{"path":"542502.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a scene in a vineyard during what appears to be early twilight, creating a stark contrast between the silhouetted foreground and the lighter sky. The foreground prominently features several grapevines, with clusters of grapes and large, dark green leaves that are finely detailed, indicating a close-up shot. The leaves are somewhat backlit by the sky, making the edges glow slightly.\n\nThe focal point of the composition is an old-fashioned biplane flying low over the vineyard. The plane is captured from the side, showing both its wings distinctly. Its silhouette contrasts sharply against the lighter patch of sky, making it stand out prominently. The plane appears to be either spraying the crops or flying very closely to monitor them, suggesting a scene of agricultural activity.\n\nThe background sky transitions from a deep azure blue at the top to a gradient that hints at either sunset or sunrise, suggesting a time of day conducive to cooler temperatures for these types of operations in a vineyard. The gentle gradient of the sky creates a calm atmosphere in contrast with the dynamic activity of the biplane.\n\nThroughout the scene, thereâ€™s a rustic and pastoral quality, evoked by the traditional methods of farming and the vintage-style aircraft, creating a blend of nature and human endeavor that is both picturesque and functional.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542505","553044","553873","542506","542504","542654","542500","549072","542503","548841","554015","548161","544491","548884","542501","544606"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["biplane","plane","fly","gradient","method","temperature","monitor","wing","leave","endeavor"]}
