{"path":"542681.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a serene and atmospheric mountainous landscape during twilight or the golden hour. The view is expansive and layered, showing a series of mountain ridges that recede into the distance. The tones in the image are warm and muted, predominantly in shades of orange, pink, and purple, suggesting the photo was taken around sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe mountains are silhouetted, and their outlines are soft and undulating, contributing to a sense of depth and tranquility. The sky above the mountains is gently gradated, moving from a lighter hue near the horizon to a darker, deeper color towards the top of the frame.\n\nThere is a subtle texture visible in the photograph, perhaps due to the film quality or artifacts from an older camera, adding a vintage or timeless quality to the scene. No human figures or man-made structures are discernible; the focus is entirely on the natural beauty of the layered hills and the peaceful ambiance created by the color palette and lighting. The overall composition is simple yet strikingly beautiful, evoking a feeling of calm and awe in the viewer.","title":"Sunset seen through smog","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555131","554634","544070","543023","557519","557558","554402","554398","555378","546749","542676","557000","546764","552927","545860","542923"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","artifact","layer","quality","recede","sunrise","film","ridge","purple","hour"]}
