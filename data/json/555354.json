{"path":"555354.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting where a large, flexible container, possibly a portable pool or a water storage tank, is extensively filled with water. Its blue walls are taut and bulge slightly under the pressure of the contained liquid. The surface of the water reflects some elements of the environment, and it has a murky, dark greenish hue indicative of either depth or something dissolved or suspended in it. A raised object, resembling a mechanical part or water filtration unit, is partially submerged towards the left side near the tank's boundary.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a dimly lit area, possibly in an industrial or makeshift storage space, based on the visible structural elements and the utilitarian nature of the container. Shadows and subdued lighting add a mysterious, perhaps somewhat neglected or unused quality to the scene. Debris or sediment is also visible scattered on the water's surface, suggesting that the water might have been stagnant for some time or has accumulated impurities from the surrounding environment. The backdrop remains indistinct and shrouded in shadows, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the water-filled container itself.","title":"High intensity aquaculture is being studied at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
