{"path":"552805.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph portrays an engine compartment of a car with its hood open. The focus is on the intricately assembled engine parts and components, which include various hoses, wires, and mechanical parts, all arranged meticulously within the engine bay. The engine itself appears clean and well-maintained, shining with metallic components.\n\nThe interior of the opened hood is visible from the underside, showing structural reinforcements typical of car hood designs to provide stability. The hood is raised to expose the engineering beneath it fully.\n\nA prominent feature in the image is a yellow sign resting against the inner side of the hood. It contains text, likely providing information or specifications related to the car or the engine, but the specific details are unclear.\n\nThe background is dark with minimal visible details, emphasizing the engine and the car's opened hood. Some lens flare effects and light reflections can be seen, likely due to the lighting conditions under which the photo was taken. These elements add a slight artistic flare to the otherwise technical and mechanical subject matter. The overall composition focuses squarely on the engineering and design of the car's engine, celebrating the complexity and craftsmanship of automotive design.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
