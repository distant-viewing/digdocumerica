{"path":"548319.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a dense urban skyline, dominated by numerous skyscrapers amidst a sprawling cityscape, which can be identified as New York City based on iconic structures like the Empire State Building. The visibility is slightly marred by haze, possibly due to smog or mist, which creates a bluish-gray cast over the scene, hinting at either early morning or late afternoon light conditions.\n\nThe composition of the image allows the viewer to observe a labyrinth of shorter buildings packed tightly together, leading up to taller, modern skyscrapers that define the city's famous silhouette. The Empire State Building stands out prominently near the center, its art deco spire recognizably towering over the other constructions.\n\nNo people are visible in the photo; the focus is strictly on the architectural elements and the density of the urban environment. The surrounding ambiance is rendered in muted tones, amplifying the urban expanse's grandeur and complexity. Overall, the photograph portrays a classic metropolitan scene, highlighting the verticality and congestion that typify New York City.","title":"Manhattan skyline, view south.
