{"path":"555371.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a lush collection of various plants, creating a vibrant display of greenery and prominent red flowers. The most eye-catching element in the image is a large, red poinsettia plant at the foreground. The poinsettia's bright red leaves, which are commonly mistaken for flowers, standout strikingly against the darker green tones of the surrounding foliage.\n\nAdditionally, the image includes a variety of other plants with differing textures, including some with elongated leaves and others that appear more bush-like. Directly behind the poinsettia, several other plants can be seen, including one with large green leaves supported by distinct, thin brown trunks or branches, indicating a mix of both bushy and arborescent plant types.\n\nThe background features a textured brick wall partially covered with tendrils or small branches likely belonging to a climbing or creeping plant. The wall lends a rustic charm to the scene, contributing to the lush, garden atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is rich in natural elements, with a focus on plant diversity and color contrast, encapsulating a serene and verdant botanical scene.","title":"An inflated polyethylene greenhouse serves as the entrance to the office at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
