{"path":"549321.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph shows a man sitting on a park bench during what appears to be a sunny day. The man is dressed in a light brown or beige jacket over a lighter shirt and dark trousers. He is resting casually, with both hands on the back of his head, elbows wide apart, and legs crossed at the ankles. His expression is relaxed and he appears to be resting or perhaps enjoying the weather.\n\nBeside him on the bench is a large, colorful bag with a bright pattern of red circles outlined in darker colors on a white background. A brown cap, presumably belonging to the man, sits next to this bag.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, indicating a well-maintained park environment. Behind the bench, a park pathway can be seen, partially obscured by the bench itself. This pathway is lined with wooden fences and dense trees, providing a serene, enclosed feel to the setting. The trees cast shadows on the grass, suggesting that it's either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a peaceful moment of relaxation in a verdant urban park.","title":"Relaxing in Battery Park during Memorial Day holiday","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551922","551970","552723","552722","555924","548615","547067","556292","549911","553065","557713","555991","547355","551940","550051","551397"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["bench","park","pathway","bag","ankle","rest","elbow","circle","sit","belong"]}
