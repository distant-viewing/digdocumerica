{"path":"547633.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a coastal area showing a line of beachfront properties along the edge of a sandy shore. The scene features a collection of small houses or cabins, each sporting different roof colors such as dark brown, light brown, and grey. These buildings appear to be primarily single-storied, with some featuring porches or decks facing the ocean.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a broad sandy beach that meets the shoreline of a body of water, likely an ocean given the visible waves gently lapping the shore. Towards the top of the image and running behind the houses, a narrow road passes parallel to the coastlineâ€”it's dotted intermittently with parked cars, indicating some human presence or activity.\n\nThe backdrop consists of the ocean which extends to the horizon, blending into a clear sky. The overall ambiance is peaceful with a natural coastal landscape primarily undisturbed by major development. The color palette of the surroundings is natural and earthen, with hues of blue, sand beige, and the darker tones of the houses' roofs, contributing to a serene coastal aesthetic.","title":"Housing on the dunes","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547636","547644","547641","547645","543427","557523","545110","557453","557504","555757","556953","543362","545121","547984","555756","556982"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","house","shore","beige","roof","lap","pass","cabin","property","coastline"]}
