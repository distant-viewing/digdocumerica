{"path":"545071.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a scene in a sandy desert-like terrain under a bright daylight. At the center of the photograph, there is an old-fashioned dark-colored jeep parked on a vast expanse of sand. The sandy area has multiple tire tracks around the vehicle, suggesting recent movement or other vehicles having passed through the area. To the front-left of the jeep, the sandy surface leads toward clusters of green vegetation, possibly grass or small bushes, which are somewhat scattered across the dunes.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows more dense patches of tall, thin grass clumped together, emerging through the sand. These patches of grass help to break the otherwise smooth texture of the sandy surface. Additionally, there appear to be a few weather-worn, wooden posts sticking out of the sand near the central-left part of the image, which might be remains of an old fence or barrier.\n\nThe background behind the jeep gradually rises into larger sand dunes which dominate the upper portion of the photograph. The coloring indicates an environment dominated by natural sandy hues, ranging from pale beige to deeper browns, punctuated by the green of the vegetation. The overall scene is quiet and devoid of any visible human activity except for the parked jeep, emphasizing a sense of isolation or remoteness in a vast natural landscape.","title":"Dune buggy in new national seashore park, simpson reef","placename":"Cape Arago (Or.)","location":"Cape Arago, Oregon","nn1":["545596","546104","543211","548897","553058","545604","544428","545575","553010","545102","545336","551969","553057","557468","549016","553662"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["sand","dune","grass","clump","remoteness","coloring","parked","pass","stick","emerge"]}
