{"path":"543751.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a young boy observing a crayfish being held carefully between the fingers of an adult's hand. The focus is on the contrast between the child's curious gaze and the detailed texture of the crayfish. The crayfish, positioned prominently in the foreground, has its pincers and antennas visibly extended out towards the viewer.\n\nThe boyâ€™s expression is one of fascination and slight apprehension as he intently studies the creature. His features are softly illuminated, emphasizing his youth and the softness of his fair hair, which falls just above his eyes.\n\nThe background of the photo is softly blurred, drawing attention primarily to the interaction between the boy and the crayfish. The overall composition of the image, with the boy and the crayfish centrally positioned, creates a sense of intimacy and focused exploration. The natural, muted color palette suggests an outdoor setting, possibly near a body of water where the crayfish was likely found.","title":"Child with crayfish in \"pocket\" park","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["553913","557443","543909","551022","543905","545182","552943","544217","546313","555060","543916","543744","552304","552941","543897","546308"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["boy","creature","softness","finger","intimacy","youth","antenna","gaze","exploration","adult"]}
