{"path":"554710.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene, likely from the 1960s or 1970s, in a small town surrounded by mountains, vividly painted with autumn colors. The focal point of the image is the line of vintage cars, typical of the era, moving down the street or parked along the roadside. The nearest car, prominently displayed in the foreground, is a large, black sedan with occupants visible inside.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, we see a variety of small business establishments. Notably, there's a shop named \"Mike's Submarines\" advertising milk, subs, and fudge in bold lettering. Other visible signs include promotional banners and arrows, guiding visitors and locals alike.\n\nThe street is crowded with people milling about, suggesting a communal event or a market day. The atmosphere seems lively, indicative of a thriving, closely-knit community setup. Trees showing early autumn hues line the edges, adding a seasonal charm to the scene.\n\nThe backdrop is a beautiful, wooded mountain, emphasizing the small town's valley location. The light and shadows indicate it is either morning or late afternoon, casting soft illumination that enhances the nostalgic feel of the setting. This photograph beautifully marries natural beauty with a slice of Americana from a bygone era, capturing the essence of life in a small, vibrant town.","title":"Traffic is heavy on a fall sunday afternoon at","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["557655","552601","554709","551071","558038","551106","557705","552602","545618","545614","551070","557155","554551","557805","556422","545216"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["town","autumn","street","milk","local","era","arrow","occupant","banner","knit"]}
