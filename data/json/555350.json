{"path":"555350.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a corner of a brick-built structure under a clear sky. The structure features a decorative motif with exposed red bricks and contains architectural elements such as a raised platform, square columns, and intricate brickwork with star and cross shapes designed into the walls. Covering what seems to be an open space or a porch are large, hung translucent panels draped along a metallic rod on the top, possibly for shading or privacy purposes.\n\nOn this platform, there are several terracotta pots, some of which house plants. Visible plants include cacti and other succulents, suggesting a dry, possibly Mediterranean or desert-like climate. The ambiance is serene and relatively barren, with only a few sparse shrubs visible in the background behind the structure. The brightness and clarity of the day indicate it might be midday or early afternoon. Despite the outdoor setup, there are no people visible in the scene, adding to the sense of quiet and privacy. The overall setting implies a functional space, perhaps a patio or a part of a residential building, designed to enjoy the outdoor weather comfortably and intimately.","title":"Side of a home near Tucson, Arizona has blackened panels under the plastic sheeting which heat circulating air and provide the house with heat during the winter","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555340","544911","552966","546470","548760","546458","546464","555286","555321","548656","552498","548649","545359","556182","551263","551635"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["privacy","platform","brick","patio","brickwork","motif","pot","midday","plant","drape"]}
