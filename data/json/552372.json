{"path":"552372.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view featuring a bright yellow helicopter in the upper left corner. The helicopter is in flight, with its rotors clearly spinning and its rear clearly visible. Attached to the helicopter is a large transparent parachute-like object with a conical shape. Several attachment points on the parachute extend into structured lines that connect together at a single point beneath the structure, where it seems to tether or carry a load not visible in the photo.\n\nThe background consists of a landscape that includes rural or suburban areas with patches of vegetation and scattered buildings. The terrain is relatively flat and expansive, stretching into the distance. The image has a slight haze, possibly due to dust or the time of day, suggestive of either dawn or dusk, enhancing the tones of the natural landscape.\n\nThe composition and context imply that the helicopter might be engaged in an activity such as aerial testing of the parachute, load transportation, or some form of experimental flight practice. This scene captures a moment of complex aerial maneuvering in what appears to be a relatively secluded or undeveloped area.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["545642","544771","544741","544737","545638","552365","555835","547533","544766","545637","552373","552393","544754","548815","544851","548911"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","flight","load","tether","rotor","attachment","testing","rear","practice","point"]}
