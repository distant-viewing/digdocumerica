{"path":"549201.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of cracked, dry earth, presenting a parched landscape. The ground is covered in large, irregularly shaped mud cracks, each segment bordered by deep fissures that underscore the dryness of the soil. The color palette of the earth ranges from light grayish-brown to deeper reddish-brown tones, suggesting variation in moisture content and soil composition.\n\nScattered sparsely across the cracked surface are small green plants, bringing a touch of life and contrast to the arid, barren ground. These plants, possibly drought-resistant species, emerge from the cracks, showing resilience in a harsh environment. The presence of these plants indicates that despite the extreme dryness, the area can still support some forms of life.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the texture of the cracked soil, emphasizing the severity of the dry conditions. No horizon line or sky is visible, concentrating all attention on the ground itself. This direct focus suggests themes related to environmental conditions such as drought and soil degradation.","title":"Close-up of stream bed illustrates the dry climate of the proposed strip-mining area of sarpy basin.
