{"path":"547694.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a somewhat dramatic maritime scene featuring a small, dark-colored tugboat on a grayish-blue, choppy sea. The boat is labeled \"AMERICAN SHIP NO.1\" in white letters across its stern. The boat appears sturdy and functional, facing towards the right-hand side of the image, with ocean spray and waves churning around it. \n\nOn the deck of this boat stands a man, positioned towards the left-side of the image. He's dressed in typical maritime or industrial attire, including a dark jacket and pants, and he is wearing a light-colored, possibly yellow, safety helmet. His stance and the direction he is facing suggest he might be looking out towards the sea or possibly another ship, possibly supervising or navigating the boat.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat moody and intense, emphasized by the overcast sky and the vigorously moving water that surrounds the boat. The setting and the elements depicted hint at a working environment, likely under challenging weather conditions. The image captures a moment that feels both solitary and significant, reflecting the daily reality and challenges faced in maritime labor.","title":"Tugboat and crewmen in East Chicago's harbor, the biggest in Indiana, move in to clear railroad bridge.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547156","544234","547559","551046","550872","547194","546845","546850","550913","545073","555802","550892","546832","549601","547461","549618"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["boat","sea","reality","tugboat","stance","maritime","spray","challenge","helmet","letter"]}
