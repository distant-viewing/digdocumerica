{"path":"546937.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling harbor scene, likely taken from an elevated viewpoint. The harbor is teeming with a variety of boats, including sailboats and motorboats, with many of them actively navigating the water. In the foreground, smaller boats are closer to the shore, while larger vessels can be seen farther out. The water is a deep blue, contrasting with the bright white and colorful sails of the sailboats.\n\nThe background showcases a city skyline with a mixture of architectural styles, including modern high-rise buildings and older, mid-rise buildings with flat or sloped roofs. The buildings vary in color, from light tan to darker shades, contributing to a vibrant urban tapestry that frames the harbor. Notably, there is no visible green space in the immediate area around the buildings, emphasizing the urban environment.\n\nOverall, the image provides a dynamic view of marine activity set against a dense urban backdrop, illustrating the lively interaction between the city and its waterfront.","title":"On a warm sunday afternoon, Baltimore's harbor is festive with many pleasure boats.
