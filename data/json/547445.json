{"path":"547445.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a densely packed urban cityscape. It features numerous mid-rise buildings distributed fairly uniformly throughout the image. The structures vary in design and height, mostly in shades of beige, grey, and brown, typical of urban architecture. At the center and to the right, one building stands slightly taller than the others, completed with a thin, vertical design that features a pronounced spire on top, distinguishing it as a possible landmark or significant building within the city.\n\nThe city is laid out in a grid pattern with streets intersecting at right angles, filled with visible traffic, which includes cars and buses, giving a sense of the active life in the city. The roads prominently organize the urban space, making them a crucial part of the city's infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate dense concentration of buildings, a more residential-looking area with smaller structures and more greenery can be seen, indicating the outskirts of the city center. The horizon stretches into a flat landscape, suggesting that the city may be located in a relatively level geographical area. Lighting conditions hint at either early morning or late afternoon, with shadows cast to the side of buildings, enhancing the textures and dimensions of the aerial view.","title":"Lincoln from the air.
