{"path":"555333.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a technological or scientific setup in a vast, desolate landscape under a clear blue sky. The main subject is a large, silvery metallic structure that appears to be part of a solar panel array or a scientific installation, shown through the partially framed view of an industrial metal lattice. This lattice has a grayish color with some sections gleaming from sunlight.\n\nThere is also a round, white apparatus at the center of the image which could possibly be housing equipment related to the installation or functioning as a part of the experimental setup. The reflected sunlight makes it difficult to discern intricate details on this equipment, but it is brightly illuminated and seems to have a glass or transparent component facing towards the camera.\n\nThe midground shows the continuation of the metal framework extending into the distance and traces of possible cables or structural supports. In the far background, the landscape is flat with scattered low vegetation, typical of a desert or semi-arid region. The horizon shows distant mountains under a clear sky, indicating that the installation is located in a remote and open area.\n\nOn the right side of the frame is a view of another section of the lattice that leads the eye back towards the apparatus. There are also glimpses of paved ground on which the structure is built, suggesting a well-maintained facility, and a parked vehicle to the right of the structure hints at human presence or activity related to the ongoing operations at this site.","title":"Looking at the test cab where the sun's rays are focused in the intense white spot of the solar furnace operated for the U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
