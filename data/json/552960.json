{"path":"552960.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Heyman, Ken","caption":"The photograph depicts a small, naked child standing on an old wooden ladder or step stool, which is elevated above a mess of discarded papers, cartons, and different types of debris. The child is facing away from the camera, looking out over the cluttered scene. The background shows wooden structures, possibly part of an old, disheveled shed with rust-colored, corrugated metal elements. The setting appears rundown and neglected, suggesting an outdoor environment that is cluttered and somewhat chaotic. The overall mood conveyed by the image is a blend of innocence, with the child's presence, contrasted starkly against a background of decay and disarray.","title":"Martin-pena area of puerto Rico.
