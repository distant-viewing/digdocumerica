{"path":"546571.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a multi-lane highway during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the dim lighting and the visible headlights and taillights of the vehicles. The highway curves gently through a densely wooded area, contrasting the natural environment with the human-made infrastructure. The road is busy with traffic, which includes a variety of vehicles such as cars, buses, and possibly trucks, all captured in motion.\n\nThere are several distinctive elements in the photograph:\n\n1. **Highway Design**: The highway includes several lanes in each direction, separated by a central median. The curving road suggests it's designed to handle significant traffic volumes, possibly circumventing or leading into a major city.\n\n2. **Lighting and Time of Day**: The visibility in the photograph is somewhat low, likely due to the time of day. The headlights and taillights are prominent, indicating it might be early morning or late evening.\n\n3. **Surrounding Vegetation**: The area surrounding the highway is heavily wooded, with dense trees flanking both sides of the road. This setting implies the highway might be located in a suburban or semi-rural area, not far from a city â€“ as hinted by what seems to be distant buildings or structures in the far background.\n\n4. **Traffic Flow**: The direction of the vehicles shows smooth traffic flow on one side, while the other side has a denser traffic pattern, which could suggest either typical daily traffic conditions or the beginning of a traffic congestion.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a typical scene of daily commuting in an environment where urban and natural landscapes meet.","title":"Looking west at the capital beltway in the bethesda area naval medical center in the background.
