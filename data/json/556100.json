{"path":"556100.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a scenic, rural railway station during what appears to be late afternoon, given the soft lighting. A long passenger train, led by a red locomotive, approaches the station, curving slightly as it enters the scene. Rolling green hills, punctuated with patches of darker green trees or bushes, form a beautiful, natural backdrop hinting at a spacious, bucolic setting.\n\nThe platform is busy with passengers, some standing and others in motion, likely in anticipation of boarding the train. The people, dressed in casual, perhaps seasonally warm attire, include a variety of ages and genders. Their attention is directed towards the arriving train, signaling a common interest and purpose in their presence at the station.\n\nThe composition captures the convergence of human activity with the expansiveness of the natural landscape, underscoring a moment of travel and transition that ties together the immediate excitement of the train's arrival with the serene expanse of the surrounding countryside. The image exudes a sense of anticipation and movement, framed by the tranquility of the rural environment.","title":"People on the loading platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, watch the arrival of the Empire Builder (train #7) from Chicago en route to Seattle, Washington. This terminal is located at the edge of Glacier National Park. Amtrak, since it assumed major responsibility for U.S. intercity rail passenger service in 1971, has reversed a decline in ridership that began after World War II.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556767","556768","556091","555967","556673","556855","556827","556782","556063","556009","556670","556041","557956","556074","557963","556772"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","anticipation","station","passenger","arrival","arrive","locomotive","gender","expansiveness","excitement"]}
