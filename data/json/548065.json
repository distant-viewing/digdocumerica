{"path":"548065.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene on a farm. The primary focus is a large, traditional red barn with a silver silo attached on the left and a smaller red silo detached on the right. Both silos feature covered tops that reflect light. Adjacent to the barn and silos, there are two smaller farm buildings with gray roofs, perhaps used for storage or additional animal shelters.\n\nIn the foreground, several cows, black and white in color, are either grazing or resting on a grassy field enclosed by a wooden fence. The grass is lush and green, contrasting with the more vivid red and silver of the farm buildings.\n\nIn the background, there's a hazy line of trees that suggest a forested area, which adds a layer of depth to the landscape. The sky is a dull, possibly overcast light blue, indicating a peaceful, though not overly bright day.\n\nOverall, the composition balances man-made structures and natural elements, evoking a sense of calm rural life centered around agriculture. The image captures the essence of farm operations and livestock care in a serene environment.","title":"Dairy farm on the banks of the Columbia River in Clark County","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557991","555577","551305","556963","557946","542801","554560","550019","547309","549194","552537","552462","544481","549237","554821","555635"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["silo","farm","silver","barn","cow","livestock","shelter","care","agriculture","essence"]}
