{"path":"554930.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts four men engaged in what appears to be metalworking or some form of industrial labor in a rustic setting. The setting is outdoors under a makeshift or semi-constructed workshop environment, possibly at a mining or construction site, as suggested by the rugged and utilitarian ambiance.\n\nFrom left to right:\n- The first man is wearing safety glasses and a buttoned shirt underneath overalls, focusing on an object in front of him that might be a part of the equipment.\n- Adjacent to him, another man in protective gear, including a helmet with a face shield, is observing or assisting in the task. His protective clothing suggests safety protocols specific to their line of work, like welding or metal grinding.\n- The third man is holding a long metal rod rested against a heavy, large metal block, which appears to be the focus of their task. His attire is less protective and more casual, consisting of a buttoned-up long sleeve shirt and trousers.\n- Lastly, the man at the far right also aids in the task by also holding the metal rod. He dons a hat and casual clothing similar to the third man, and his expression shows effort or concentration.\n\nIn the background, there is a simple timber frame structure, possibly part of the shelter or workshop, and various objects are scattered around, including what look like barrels and other tools or pieces of equipment, adding to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe image captures a moment of teamwork and physical labor, highlighting the collaboration and effort involved in their task amidst a rudimentary yet functional workspace.","title":"Workers from mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, as a supervisor stands by near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["546023","556267","556863","556335","554426","556866","556903","546824","554864","546036","556893","549722","544022","556339","553802","557945"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["task","workshop","rod","metal","man","effort","safety","labor","protocol","collaboration"]}
