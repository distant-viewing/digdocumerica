{"path":"544625.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph presents an urban landscape seen from a high vantage point overlooking a large, undeveloped area with sandy, flat terrain in the foreground. The foreground appears to be a construction site or a cleared plot, dominated by wide tracks of tread marks, possibly from construction vehicles, that have disturbed the sandy soil. This vacant site occupies nearly half of the image and appears to sit beside a body of water—a river or a bay—which curves gracefully through the landscape.\n\nBeyond this undeveloped area, the middle portion of the photograph showcases a dense urban skyline. The buildings vary in height and architectural styles, suggesting a mix of mid-century modern and perhaps earlier 20th-century designs. Construction activity is visible with at least one skyscraper under construction, indicated by the presence of cranes and the skeletal frame of a building in progress.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are vibrant, with the blues of the water and sky contrasting against the tan and browns of the sandy foreground and the whites and grays of the urban buildings. The sky, scattered lightly with clouds, spans the upper third of the image, providing a soft backdrop to the sharp lines of the city’s architecture. This juxtaposition of ongoing urban development with the raw, undeveloped land foreground gives the image a narrative of growth and transformation.","title":"Miami skyline and new landfill area","placename":"Miami (Fla.)","location":"Miami, Florida","nn1":["555813","549971","552233","547996","549480","549477","557273","548392","553672","557274","552252","547253","552394","551507","555720","548407"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["construction","transformation","site","cleared","disturb","third","whites","plot","tan","blu"]}
