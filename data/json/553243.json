{"path":"553243.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a young man standing outdoors during the daytime, wearing glasses and a white outfit, partially obscured by a large sandwich board sign he is wearing. The sign is predominantly white with red and purple hand-painted text that reads, \"GET THE WORDS OF GOD'S / P_TIME / PROPHET\". The lettering is slightly uneven and crudely done, with the word \"PROPHET\" in larger, bold letters compared to the rest of the text. The man holds a small stack of leaflets in one hand and a black folder or book in the other hand.\n\nThe background is indistinct with a hint of darkness, focusing all attention on the man and his sign. His expression is neutral, possibly showing a hint of a smile, and his hair is curly and light-colored. The setting seems to be a public area, possibly near a building entrance or a sidewalk, and his attire and the materials he holds suggest he is involved in some form of religious or spiritual advocacy or outreach.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
