{"path":"553094.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant moment between an adult and a child, set against a rugged terrain under a clear blue sky. The adult appears to be a man in his middle years, with textured, sun-tanned skin and dark hair flecked with hints of gray. His expression is serious and contemplative.\n\nHe is holding a young child, likely a toddler, securely in his arms. The child seems relaxed in the man's grasp, with attention directed slightly away from the camera. The toddler has curly dark hair and is dressed in a light-colored top with a pattern, along with white shoes and socks.\n\nThe man is wearing a yellowish-brown shirt, visibly worn and slightly disheveled, suggesting a casual or working environment. He also wears a watch on his left wrist, which adds a contrasting modern element to his otherwise rugged appearance.\n\nIn the background, a clear blue sky dominates the upper portion of the image, while dry, sparse vegetation and hills stretch across the horizon, hinting at a harsh, arid landscape. To the right, there is a glimpse of a parked car, indicating the presence of a road or parking area nearby.\n\nThis scene is likely situated in a rural or semi-rural environment, and the interaction between the adult and child showcases a moment of everyday life, possibly hinting at themes of care, family bonds, or community.","title":"Floyd flores and one of his children on his biannual visit to nixon to lay flowers at his parents' graves, Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["543866","556294","558186","556144","547135","556527","557369","557355","552655","553543","553496","556607","548805","551807","557368","543863"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["toddler","child","adult","fleck","bond","grasp","tan","wrist","sock","hair"]}
