{"path":"547332.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a man standing prominently in the foreground, dressed in religious vestments of a white alb with black and white detailing at the cuffs. His expression is serious and contemplative as he looks slightly downwards towards the viewer. Located behind him and to the left is the main subject in the midground, a classic white church with a steeple. The architecture of the church includes pointed arch windows and a main double door, indicative of traditional church designs. The structure stands against a vivid blue sky filled with fluffy white clouds.\n\nThe ground in front of the church is covered with rich green grass and scattered with yellow dandelion flowers, adding a touch of natural color to the predominantly white and blue scene. Additionally, on the right side of the composition, in the background beyond the religious figure, there are two small figures who seem to be strolling past the church, suggesting a serene, active church environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image is dramatic, with the sunlight casting stark shadows and illuminating the figure and the church facade, which adds depth and a vivid texture to the scene. This lighting further enhances the spiritual and serene aura of the setting.","title":"Rev. David T. Ernst in front of his church, the Immanuel Lutheran, in Plymouth.
