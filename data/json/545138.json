{"path":"545138.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vast landscape of an area that appears to have undergone significant logging. The foreground is densely covered with felled trees and debris, presenting a chaotic tangle of branches and timber, spread over a large, hilly terrain. A narrow dirt road winds through the scene from the middle ground towards the horizon, flanked by leftover wood and tree stumps, suggesting recent, heavy forestry activity.\n\nThe environment is devoid of standing trees in the immediate vicinity, showing a large scale of clear-cutting. This has resulted in a stark, barren landscape, contrasting sharply with any remaining green forested areas visible in the distance. The background hills roll gently and are more sparsely covered, likely indicating the extent or progression of the logging operation.\n\nThe sky overhead is partly cloudy, suggesting daylight conditions that cast subtle shadows over the ridges, enhancing the textural details of the scattered timber and rough terrain. The absence of people or active machinery in the immediate scene conveys a sense of abandonment or pause, possibly after the completion of logging activities. The overall mood presented is one of desolation and environmental impact, highlighting the effects of industrial activities on natural landscapes.","title":"A large area of slash remains after logging operations (by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs) on the Quinault Indian Reservation; nearby salmon spawning grounds were desTroyed.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555094","546060","555150","542865","555221","542820","555136","555208","545272","550354","555142","545143","555104","542827","555148","555092"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["timber","completion","cutting","extent","stump","forestry","overhead","logging","desolation","vicinity"]}
