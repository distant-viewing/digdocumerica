{"path":"549043.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene dominated by sandy terrain. In the foreground, a small white rectangular block stands upright on the sand, with the words \"BOB\" and \"NEWTON\" written on it, possibly serving as a makeshift or humorous marker or sign. Beside this block, there is a beer can lying on its side in the sand, adding a casual or discarded element to the scene.\n\nTwo dark horizontal lines, which are parts of a fence, run across the scene, dividing the foreground from the midground and creating a visual barrier. In the background, beyond the fence, the terrain continues with sparse vegetation, primarily low bushes and scattered rocks, characterizing a dry or desert-like environment.\n\nThe composition employs natural light and there is a somewhat muted color palette dominated by earth tones, reflecting an outdoor, possibly arid setting. The simplicity of the elements within the scene suggests a quiet, deserted place. The setting seems to evoke a sense of isolation or abandonment.","title":"Glamis Cemetery, a desert graveyard in the Imperial Valley, dates back to 1878 and has been declared a historical landmark.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543774","545819","545826","544137","544019","542978","544401","545811","556615","545341","542809","555397","545604","555883","545109","548672"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["block","sand","fence","employ","beer","marker","write","outdoor","continue","terrain"]}
