{"path":"553764.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo captures a vibrant and bustling beach scene. In the foreground, a sandy beach dotted with people engaging in various activities is visible. Some individuals are swimming in the ocean, while others are walking along the shore or sitting on the sand, possibly sunbathing. The beach is flanked by palm trees, adding a tropical feel to the setting.\n\nIn the middle of the image, behind the beach, there is a distinctive building with a large, thatched roof which might serve as a pavilion or gathering area. This structure is adjacent to a roadway, where vehicles, including a white SUV, are parked.\n\nThe background features more infrastructure, including a pier extending into the ocean. At the end of the pier, there is a large structure possibly used for docking or as a terminal. Various flags are visible, fluttering in the wind atop some of the structures and poles.\n\nThe ocean itself shows moderate waves and a few boats can be seen in the distant water, indicating recreational or transport activities. The overall atmosphere of the scene is lively and leisure-focused, typical of a popular beach destination.","title":"Sea Life Park, like Paradise Park, is a commercial enterprise built in a conservation zone.
