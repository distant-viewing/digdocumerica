{"path":"553394.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy construction site scene. In the foreground, several construction workers are active around a large, open excavation area where concrete forms and rebar are visibly being used to create a foundation or structure. Two cement mixing trucks, one mostly red and the other primarily white, are stationed near the center and right side of the image; they are vital for providing concrete to the site. A mechanical crane with a long, extended boom is being used to transport material from the second truck into the construction zone, demonstrating the transfer of concrete directly into the formwork.\n\nThe overall setting looks rugged and undeveloped, with a backdrop that features a hill sloping upwards, covered with sparse vegetation, typical of a construction site clearing. A variety of wooden planks and construction materials are scattered throughout the area, and several other construction workers are dispersed across the site, contributing to the overall activity. The scene is well-lit with bright sunlight, highlighting the dusty, industrial nature of the construction environment. The presence of heavy machinery and active personnel illustrates a dynamic and physically demanding work atmosphere.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction on the Whitman River.
