{"path":"544499.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image captures a lone male figure working on a field station in a vast wetland area. The man is actively engaged with some form of scientific or monitoring equipment housed within a metallic structure mounted atop a simple, elevated platform made of wood and metal supports. He is bent over what appears to be a control box or instrument, and is surrounded by tools and equipment, including what look like canisters, possibly for samples or fuel.\n\nThe background reveals an expansive wetland with various water levels, interspersed with clusters of tall grasses and a flat, open sky that dominates the upper frame of the image. The sky is slightly cloudy, suggesting a fair weather day. The horizon line runs nearly midway through the photograph, emphasizing the vast, open landscape.\n\nThe composition utilizes natural lighting that illuminates the scene clearly, and visible wear and tear on the platform suggest regular use or exposure to harsh environmental conditions. This setting is likely used for environmental monitoring or research activities, given the isolated location and specialized equipment.","title":"Jon Hergert, of the U.S. Geological Survey, at the P-37 water measurement station","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542661","547718","558108","545940","542663","546307","550962","549625","553907","542662","552110","549595","546300","549600","552289","544961"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["wetland","equipment","platform","canister","tear","sample","fuel","monitoring","monitor","instrument"]}
