{"path":"549961.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a man whose face is covered in a thick, white powder. The powder coats his skin, eyebrows, and hair uniformly, adding a textural and visually striking contrast against the natural tones of his skin visible around his eyes. He is wearing goggles which are also covered in the same white substance; the goggles have a few clear patches on the lenses, suggesting recent wear during an activity involving the powder.\n\nThe man's expression is neutral with a hint of a smile, suggesting a moment of rest or pause in an otherwise active or intense scenario. There is a clarity and focus in his eyes, piercing through the mask-like layer of white, which gives the image a strong and engaging presence.\n\nHis attire underneath the powder is obscured, but it appears that he might be wearing a dark outfit. The background is blurred and indistinct, primarily in a muted green tone that suggests an outdoor or natural setting, which complements the earthy and raw aesthetic of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that is both intriguing and mysterious, centered around an undefined but evidently messy activity, possibly related to a sport, festival, or a form of manual work involving powder or dust.","title":"Painter working on chain link fence","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["554953","549962","542784","548154","558312","556443","554846","553609","553634","557173","544382","557035","546028","542783","556428","557034"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["goggles","skin","involve","pierce","mask","festival","eye","lens","pause","portrait"]}
