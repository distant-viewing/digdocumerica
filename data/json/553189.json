{"path":"553189.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"In the photograph, three men are engaged in a sunny outdoor setting which features lush foliage and what appears to be a commercial area. One man is depicted from the back, facing the two others; he has light brown hair and wears what looks like a patterned brown blazer. Among the two facing the camera, the one to the left has sandy brown or blond hair and sports aviator sunglasses, a pale suit, and a red tie, while the one on the right has darker hair and wears a casual light shirt with vertically striped earth-toned colors. The darker-haired man is holding fast food items — a hamburger and a drink — which rest on a tray overlaid with a red and white wrapper.\n\nTheir conversation seems casual and engaged, suggesting a social or possibly semi-professional interaction amid what might be a lunch break or a casual meet-up. Behind them, other people can be seen milling about, and strikingly contrasted in the background is a dark stone or metal structure with the words \"THIRD CENT\" partially visible, hinting at the name of a building or location. This setting coupled with the people's attire gives the scene a relaxed yet lively feel, typical of a downtown area in a city during a weekday.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: lunch","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551459","553182","551460","550763","551762","555287","551818","551834","557030","557856","553153","551853","545984","553122","556847","550967"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["hair","blond","lunch","tray","blazer","third","downtown","sunglass","drink","face"]}
