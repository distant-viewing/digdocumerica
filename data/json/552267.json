{"path":"552267.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene at a busy port. In the foreground, a sizable cargo ship is moored at a dock, its white and red hull prominent against the water. The ship has several deck structures and a series of cranes onboard, suggesting it is equipped to handle substantial cargo loads.\n\nBeside the cargo ship, a smaller tugboat, painted in white and black, assists on the water. The tugboat pushes or pulls against the larger vessel, indicating a maneuvering or docking process.\n\nIn the background, the port facilities feature large red gantry cranes used for container operations. These cranes are towering and lined up along the dock, illustrating a well-equipped commercial port.\n\nThe cityscape beyond the immediate port area includes various buildings, likely a mix of residential and commercial structures. Notably, the Space Needle towers in the distance, establishing the setting as Seattle, Washington. The Space Needle is recognizable by its futuristic architecture and observation deck, standing out against the hillside and urban backdrop.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with warm tones highlighting the edges of the ships and port machinery. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the industrious atmosphere of a working port, juxtaposed with the urban environment of Seattle.","title":"Tug works freighter into dock in the west waterway of elliott bay.
