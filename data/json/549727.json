{"path":"549727.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an expansive industrial complex and its surroundings. At the forefront, there is a large industrial facility with several rectangular buildings, most likely manufacturing or processing units. These buildings are dark in color and feature multiple protruding pipes and chimneys, some of which are actively emitting smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial processes.\n\nThe buildings are connected by various other structures and there are multiple levels and layers visible, indicating a complex layout typically found in large plants or factories. Adjacent to the industrial buildings, there are vast parking areas filled with numerous cars, indicating either a shift change at the facility or a large workforce.\n\nJust beyond the immediate industrial and parking areas, the terrain transitions into what looks like well-manicured green spaces, possibly for drainage or as a buffer zone, leading further back to an expanse of more dense vegetation. This could imply that the facility is located near rural areas or less developed land. \n\nThe perspective allows for a view into the horizon where the landscape remains relatively flat with no significant rise in elevation, reinforcing the industrial facilityâ€™s likely location in a plain or valley, suited for such large-scale industrial operations. The lighting conditions suggest the photograph was taken during daytime with clear skies, contributing to the visibility and vividness of the details observed.","title":"Ford Motor Company's new casting plant at Flat Rock","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549506","553892","549726","555761","555779","547126","550339","543764","545841","555774","543872","549968","546122","544495","555778","555754"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["facility","parking","buffer","drainage","shift","building","vividness","elevation","daytime","unit"]}
