{"path":"557891.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in an automotive garage or workshop. In the foreground, there is a vintage silver car, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, identified as a Citroën by the emblem on its trunk and a model name that looks like \"SM\", a luxury coupe produced between 1970 and 1975. The car's surface reflects ambient light, and its sleek design is highlighted by the clean lines and metallic finish.\n\nTo the left of the image, a man is standing beside the car, likely a mechanic or a car enthusiast. He appears relaxed yet engaged, as he leans slightly on his tool, which could be a piece of diagnostic equipment or a pneumatic tool, typically used in automotive maintenance. He is dressed in a light white shirt and dark trousers, which suggest a semi-professional attire rather than typical workshop overalls.\n\nIn the background, another individual is seen overseeing the work or possibly waiting for service. This person's silhouette is framed against the bright light streaming in from large windows, which line the upper part of the wall, indicating this is an indoor space with ample natural light. The windows also reveal sections of metal grilles or security bars.\n\nBeneath the windows, there’s sparse detail visible except for shadows and the hint of some workstations or additional equipment, which likely relates to car maintenance or repair. The overall mood is one of quiet industry, with a focus on the maintenance or assessment of high-end vehicles, reflecting a setting dedicated to specialized automotive work.","title":"City employee of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, holds a probe attached to the tailpipe of a car. The probe is held in the car exhaust for 8 - 12 seconds while gases pass to the analyzer which reads the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city must be tested for exhaust emissions. All vehicles registered in the city must undergo annual safety checks.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557905","557848","557853","557906","557860","557858","557850","557864","553490","557885","542763","557900","557870","557897","557927","557915"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["car","maintenance","workshop","tool","workstation","assessment","streaming","luxury","coupe","window"]}
