{"path":"543955.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a riverboat at twilight, moving across a calm body of water. The scene is atmospheric and evocative, primarily illuminated by the lights on the boat itself. The image has a vintage, slightly grainy quality, giving it a nostalgic feel.\n\nThe riverboat, a multi-deck paddle steamer, is adorned with multiple rows of bright, warm lights that outline the contours of its structure. It features large paddle wheels at the rear, visible and partially illuminated by the boat's lighting, which suggest that it is indeed a traditional steam-powered vessel, likely used for leisure cruises. Dark smoke is emanating from the boat's twin funnels, rising into the dusk sky, which adds to the historic ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe boat's reflection on the water adds a shimmering, golden path that leads toward the viewer, enhancing the enchanting quality of the scene. The background is rather muted, showing a hint of a treeline and an evening sky that is dark, indicating the photo was taken during the blue hour of twilight. \n\nNo people are discernible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention more on the romantic and historical aspects of the riverboat and the serene environment in which it is situated. The overall mood is tranquil and somewhat nostalgic, capturing a moment of peaceful movement in an otherwise still environment.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboat on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543963","553815","543967","543962","543971","543959","551313","551214","547230","551222","551281","550825","551215","545736","551147","545917"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["riverboat","boat","paddle","twilight","funnel","illuminate","cruise","treeline","emanate","quality"]}
