{"path":"548290.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene focusing on a single, slender object in the foreground, possibly a small strand of seaweed, which is interacting subtly with the approaching sea foam. The object curves gently across the smooth, sandy surface, casting a delicate shadow on the sand beneath it.\n\nThe sand is predominantly white and appears very fine and uniformly textured, hinting at the cleanliness and tranquility of this beach. Approaching the strand of seaweed is a thin line of sea foam, intricately textured and sparkling slightly as it catches the light. This foam creates a soft boundary between the dry sand and the wet beach, indicating the recent retreat of a wave.\n\nThe background of the image shows more of the gently lapping sea, its surface shimmering under ambient light. There is an overall sense of calm and minimalism in the composition, with the main elements being the interplay of natural textures and the soft gradient of wet to dry sand. The lighting is soft, enhancing the peaceful and somewhat isolated mood of the scene. This photograph uses a narrow depth of field, keeping the foreground sharply in focus while the background and the sea beyond blur slightly, adding artistic depth and focus on the interaction at the shoreline.","title":"Beach at Destin, on the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548088","547612","547607","545280","547600","548757","547596","547599","543078","543287","548220","546982","546970","543493","554159","554088"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["sand","foam","sea","strand","seaweed","beach","cleanliness","retreat","object","blur"]}
