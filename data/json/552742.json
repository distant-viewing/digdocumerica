{"path":"552742.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene likely from an urban neighborhood. The composition focuses on a row of traditional red brick townhouses with contrasting white staircases leading up to front doors. Many of the residences are decorated with potted plants and hanging baskets, lending a homey and welcoming feel to the environment.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly to the side, are parked vehicles lining the street, with their roofs and top portions visible, suggesting a busy residential area.\n\nOn the sidewalk, a young girl is the main subject of the image. She is dressed in a dark coat, light-colored shorts, socks, and dark shoes, and carries what appears to be a small purse or bag. She stands halfway up the staircase of a townhouse, turning slightly to look towards the camera with a gentle smile. Her presence adds life and a personal touch to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the tree-lined street continues with similar architectural styles, indicating a well-established, possibly historical neighborhood. The focus and depth of field bring the girl and immediate surroundings into greater detail, while softly blurring the background and the foreground (including the cars), directing the viewer's attention to the human element within the urban setting.","title":"Middle-class row house in Black neighborhood of North Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552761","550117","552756","552762","551729","556170","557287","550035","555905","555900","545372","545321","555942","545397","549287","555920"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["townhouse","staircase","girl","neighborhood","street","purse","residence","welcome","sock","basket"]}
