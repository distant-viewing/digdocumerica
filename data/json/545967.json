{"path":"545967.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a serene wetland scene. In the foreground, there is a marshy area with dark, muddy water that reflects the surrounding environment slightly. The wet ground is interspersed with clumps of grass and reeds. Dominating the center of the image is a striking white egret, which is standing gracefully in the shallow water. Its reflection is clearly visible in the water, adding a symmetrical aesthetic to the composition.\n\nThe background shows a densely packed area of tall, dry reeds or stalks that extend across the scene, suggesting a natural barrier or a dense patch of wetland vegetation. The sky above is clear and appears to be a light shade of blue, indicating that the photo was taken on a day with good weather.\n\nOverall, the image has a peaceful quality, showcasing wildlife in a natural habitat with a focus on the elegant stature of the egret and the tranquility of its surroundings.","title":"Egret in canal along Highway 306","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544482","548729","544842","548732","547630","544516","545991","544620","550388","544478","548731","544616","544838","544486","547589","547488"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","reed","wetland","stalk","clump","habitat","wildlife","barrier","aesthetic","intersperse"]}
