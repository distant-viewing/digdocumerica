{"path":"554507.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor adventure and natural beauty. In the foreground, we see a rocky terrain, which is typical of a mountainous landscape, suggesting a high altitude setting. The rocks and uneven ground appear weathered, implying rugged hiking conditions.\n\nCentered in the image is a hiker, facing away from the camera, navigating the stony path. The hiker is wearing a bright orange-red backpack, which stands out vividly against the muted colors of the natural surroundings. Their attire, although not fully visible, seems appropriate for hiking, and they appear to be wearing boots suitable for rough terrain. The backpack's large size suggests they might be on an extended trek, carrying supplies for camping or a long journey.\n\nBeyond the hiker, the middle ground showcases a series of mountain peaks, rolling one after another into the distance. These mountains, under what appears to be overcast lighting, show varying shades of blue and gray, depicting a serene yet somewhat somber atmosphere. The lack of visible vegetation on these peaks further emphasizes the altitude and the harsh conditions that might prevail there.\n\nThe sky, covering the upper part of the image, is mostly overcast with hints of lighter patches, suggesting a cool or damp climate, typical of high mountain environments. The overall mood of the scene is quiet and introspective, with a focus on the solitary figure of the hiker in a vast, open landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the essence of solitary wilderness exploration, emphasizing both the beauty and the solitude of nature through its composition, color palette, and the inclusion of the lone hiker against the expansive backdrop of the mountains.","title":"Backpackers near the summit of Mount Marcy look southwest over the High Peaks region in the Adirondack Forest Preserve in New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545762","543378","554514","543385","545759","554503","542751","543376","545753","544305","554515","545571","543382","554508","554504","545785"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","backpack","mountain","hiking","altitude","peak","inclusion","camping","journey","supply"]}
