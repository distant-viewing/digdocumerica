{"path":"547066.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area featuring several elements typical of heavy industry. The dominant colors in the image are dark with shades of blue, gray, and black, accentuated by white smoke.\n\nVisible in the image are multiple large structures, including buildings and what appear to be storage facilities. These structures have various geometric shapes, with some showing signs of wear and aging such as rust and degradation. White smoke billows from tall smokestacks, contributing to an atmosphere that suggests active industrial processes. \n\nThere are also many transportation routes visible, including rail tracks that run parallel and intersect in several areas. A circular rail structure is prominently visible, possibly a turntable for trains. Several roads and what might be conveyor belts for transporting materials are also discernible.\n\nThe surface around the industrial structures is largely barren, featuring patches of dirt and some vegetated areas. The overall impression is of a bustling industrial operation, possibly involved in manufacturing or processing, with significant infrastructure dedicated to transport and production activities.","title":"'U.S. steel'","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["555771","555761","548340","555774","547126","546862","555779","555754","553891","555776","548376","549968","545445","555770","549727","545889"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["rail","smoke","conveyor","route","degradation","production","structure","belt","rust","manufacturing"]}
