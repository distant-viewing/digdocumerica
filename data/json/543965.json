{"path":"543965.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a cityscape during twilight, capturing a moment where the setting sun casts an orange and pink hue across the sky. The sun, located slightly left of center, appears as a distinct circular orb hanging low in the sky. Below, the city is spread out extensively, marked by numerous buildings of varying sizes and structures.\n\nDirectly below the horizon line, a dense clustering of small industrial or residential buildings can be seen, interspersed with patches of greenery. Several smoke plumes rise from different points, suggesting industrial activity. To the right, larger modern buildings, possibly downtown skyscrapers, are silhouetted against the water body that reflects the fading light.\n\nProminently in the foreground, there are multiple large, round storage tanks, likely for oil or chemicals, grouped together forming a pattern of white circular forms against the darker ground.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is dusky and somewhat somber, with the advancing darkness of evening enveloping the city, contrasting sharply with the soft glow of the sunset. The image captures the vastness of the urban environment alongside natural phenomena, emphasizing an interplay of human settlement and natural beauty.","title":"Smog","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["552264","544082","543969","547429","550289","545406","544086","548851","544020","550194","548383","548384","547207","542683","551956","544090"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["phenomena","orb","sun","city","downtown","settlement","darkness","form","oil","chemical"]}
