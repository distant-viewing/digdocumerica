{"path":"547820.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph features an older man walking by himself on a sunlit street. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, possibly constructed from straw, and is bundled in a long coat or jacket. He carries a cane in one hand and what appears to be a folded newspaper or a set of documents in the other. The man is crossing a street that has a visible red curb on the right side, indicating a no-parking or stopping zone.\n\nThe background of the image showcases a building with two visible windows and a classic Mediterranean architectural style, highlighted by stucco walls and tiled roofing, potentially indicating the photograph was taken in a region where such architectural styles are prevalent, such as Southern Europe or California.\n\nOne remarkable aspect of the image is the distinct, large shadow cast on the ground next to the man, mirroring his pose as he walks. This shadow adds a dramatic touch to the scene, emphasizing the brightness of the day and the angle of the sun. The bottom left of the image shows what may be a portion of another parked vehicle, suggesting this street is lined with parked cars, typical of an urban setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph delivers a quietly poignant moment, capturing the solitary figure against the backdrop of a serene urban backdrop, engulfed in sunlight that casts a large, emphatic shadow. It evokes themes of solitude and the passage of time, framed within an everyday urban context.","title":"In the old mexican market section just west of downtown San Antonio.
