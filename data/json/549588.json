{"path":"549588.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a research vessel positioned in a calm, expansive sea. In the foreground, a man is actively engaging with scientific equipment supported by cables, which are suspended over the side of the ship. He wears a red shirt and jeans, focusing intently on handling a cone-shaped, transparent scientific instrument, likely for collecting samples or data from the ocean.\n\nThe ship, painted in red and white, features a variety of maritime and scientific equipment, indicating its use for specific research purposes. Prominent on the deck are various tools and devices, possibly related to oceanography or marine biology.\n\nThe background reveals an open sea with gentle waves reflecting the sunlight and the distant outline of a coast or island, visible under a clear blue sky. This serene natural setting suggests that the vessel is situated in a relatively remote or unpopulated area, ideal for scientific research free from urban disturbances.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes both the operation being carried out and its maritime environment, highlighting a moment of scientific endeavor in the midst of nature.\n","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
