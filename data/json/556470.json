{"path":"556470.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This is a close-up portrait of a young woman with a vibrant expression. She has a notable hairstyle, featuring voluminous, teased hair that rises significantly above her forehead, indicative of styles popular in earlier decades. Her hair also has a slightly curly or wavy texture around her face.\n\nThe woman is wearing large, circular earrings that are simple yet catchy due to their size. She has a subtle makeup look, with a focus on glossy lips and defined eye makeup that accentuates her eyes.\n\nHer attire includes a garment made of a fabric with a colorful, patterned design, primarily in shades of blue, purple, and bursts of other colors resembling a knitted or woven texture.\n\nThe background is blur and indistinct, drawing the viewerâ€™s focus exclusively on her. Her expression, characterized by slightly parted lips and direct eye contact, suggests confidence and a poised demeanor. The overall aesthetic and the style of the photograph give it a dated feel, possibly placing it in the late 20th century.","title":"Clarice Brown, 19, is a secretary in the United Mine Workers field services office in Charleston, West Virginia.
