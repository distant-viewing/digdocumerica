{"path":"545147.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene around a shipyard or a marine construction area, viewed from an elevated perspective. In the foreground, a large vessel is docked, its deck filled with various pieces of heavy equipment including cranes and machinery. The vessel is elongated, revealing a weathered surface with multiple levels and mechanical components. On the deck, names like \"MURPHY PACIFIC\" and \"MARINE BOSS\" are prominently visible, likely indicating company affiliations or vessel names.\n\nIn the middle ground, aside from the vessel, there are multiple industrial elements such as a spacious dry dock area and construction equipment. Debris and materials scattered throughout suggest ongoing work or a refurbishment process.\n\nThe background is less industrial and more urban, featuring a series of high-rise buildings, possibly apartments or office structures, which stand in stark contrast to the gritty foreground. Beyond the buildings, a bridge spans across a body of water, integrating the scene into a broader cityscape. The overall atmosphere appears somber with a grey or misty sky, indicating either dawn, dusk, or overcast weather. This setting suggests a blend of marine industrial activity set against the backdrop of urban development, highlighting a juxtaposition between heavy industry and residential or commercial growth.","title":"Zidell's ship wrecking yard with freeway and skyline in background","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548346","547474","555796","550910","546934","552244","552216","555806","546016","552015","547574","551997","547061","555797","555799","544657"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["vessel","deck","name","affiliation","shipyard","construction","equipment","company","apartment","grey"]}
