{"path":"546613.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial or high vantage point view of an urban area featuring the prominent, distinctively designed Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. The image captures multiple buildings with curved, layered architectural styles that characterize the Watergate. These buildings are surrounded by roads and smaller structures that contribute to a bustling city atmosphere.\n\nA river, presumably the Potomac, flows beside the complex, reflecting some of the surrounding structures and adding a tranquil element to the otherwise dense urban scene. In the distance, the slender, iconic Washington Monument can be seen piercing the skyline, creating a clear point of reference that this is indeed Washington, D.C. The horizon stretches far into the background, showing a wide view of the city with various other buildings and hints of greenery.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a slightly gloomy tone over the cityscape, which might also account for the slightly muted colors in the photograph. The edges of the photo, particularly the left upper corner, shows some vignetting, perhaps due to the camera lens or a deliberate stylistic choice, enhancing the vintage feel of the shot.","title":"Watergate complex.
