{"path":"543291.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged coastal scene. The primary focus is on a series of rocky cliffs and outcrops bordering the ocean. The cliffs are jagged and show natural erosion, likely from the ocean waves that crash against them. The coloration of the rocks ranges from deep browns to reddish and gray hues, indicative of geological variation. These formations extend into the water, creating a dynamic and textured coastline.\n\nIn the background, atop a prominent hill closest to the coastline, a small, simple building is visible. It appears utilitarian, possibly a light house or a guard station, characterized by its minimalistic form and what seems to be a chimney or tower structure. The landscape around the building is covered with low-lying coastal vegetation, sparsely distributed and adapted to the harsh, windy conditions. The plants add splashes of green and yellow to the otherwise earthy palette.\n\nThe ocean water is represented in deep shades of blue, with white foam from the waves breaking against the rocks. The dynamic interaction between the water and the land is a central visual element, highlighting the natural power and constant change inherent to coastal environments.\n\nThe sky is clear and mostly free of clouds, suggesting a bright sunny day, which enhances the saturation of the natural colors in the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility mixed with the rawness of nature, typical of isolated coastal regions. The photograph compositionally balances the elements of land, water, and human-made structures to capture the essence of this rugged coastal landscape.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543297","553771","545122","543184","543061","543067","543309","545125","543243","543289","553775","545226","545230","545173","543080","543428"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coastline","coastal","cliff","wave","outcrops","guard","atop","crash","closest","adapt"]}
