{"path":"551602.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures an aquatic or wetland scene where various pieces of wood debris, including sticks and logs, are floating on or slightly submerged in dark water. The wood shows signs of weathering, with some pieces appearing water-soaked and others with peeling or flaking surfaces, possibly indicating prolonged exposure to the elements. The arrangement of the wood is haphazard, forming a random, somewhat cluttered collection that partially covers the view of the water. No people or distinct human-made objects can be discerned in this natural setting. The image, taken from a close-up perspective, focuses primarily on the textural details and the interplay of light on the wet surfaces, reflecting a quiet, possibly serene aquatic environment.","title":"East of the con-wed plant at cloquet: the side channel of the st.
