{"path":"548701.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a broad expanse of a calm, blue sea under a clear sky. On the water's surface, there are several boats and floating structures scattered throughout the frame. To the left side of the image, smaller boats appear to be in motion, creating slight wakes in the water. On the right side, there are larger, white domed structures floating on the sea. These structures are evenly spaced and have a uniform circular shape with white tops, possibly some type of marine equipment or buoys. In the far background, a thin strip of land or a distant island can be faintly seen on the horizon, underlining the vastness of the sea in this scene. The overall mood of the image is peaceful, with an emphasis on the serene marine environment.","title":"Lobster traps floating in the gulf of mexico","placename":"Conch Key (Fla.)","location":"Conch Key, Florida","nn1":["555718","557811","552050","548247","549380","555715","545969","557813","542903","542904","545057","557818","543059","544021","557815","548078"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sea","float","buoy","boat","wake","underline","island","emphasis","strip","vastness"]}
