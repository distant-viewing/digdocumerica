The image shows a group of people gathered around a picnic table covered with snow. On the table, various food items are spread out, suggesting a meal or snack during a break from skiing. One man, positioned on the left side of the frame, drinks from a cup while standing, wearing a striped ski suit and holding ski poles. In the center, another man is seated at the table, conversing with a child sitting opposite him. The child is dressed in a warm ski outfit. On the right, another person in winter attire stands near the table. \n\nThe background features snowy evergreen trees and a faint view of ski lifts, indicating a mountainous landscape typical of ski resort areas. The atmosphere is casual and leisurely, with the individuals appearing to be enjoying their time together amidst a snowy setting. The snowy conditions and winter gear suggest this photo was taken during the colder months, intended to capture a moment of relaxation and social interaction during a day of skiing.","title":"Lunch at 11,250 feet--the ski patrol shelter at the top of Vail mountain","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554218","554277","554269","554221","554237","550017","554235","554265","554228","554276","554257","554275","554238","554262","554242","548153"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["ski","table","skiing","winter","resort","month","snack","child","meal","intend"]}
