{"path":"556314.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of an industrial workshop, specifically what appears to be a machine shop or a similar manufacturing environment. The room is dimly lit with overhead fluorescent lighting and shows signs of heavy usage typical in industrial settings.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several large, red machines with open compartments and various mechanical parts scattered inside and around them. These machines have a rugged, utilitarian design and are possibly used for assembling or repairing mechanical components.\n\nThree men are visible in the scene, each engaged in different activities. The man closest to the viewer is leaning over one of the machines, focusing intently on his task. He is wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants, and a hat. Midway through the room, another man, wearing a darker blue shirt and a white cap, is standing and seems to be interacting or adjusting something on another machine. The third man, in the background and partially obscured, appears to be working or moving around another area of the workshop.\n\nThe overall composition suggests a busy, functional space where manual work is conducted. The ambient lighting and scattered tools and parts across the machines contribute to a sense of ongoing labor and industrial activity. The background shows additional elements of the workspace, including more machinery, tools, and possibly control panels or storage units against the walls, further emphasizing the industrial setting.","title":"Repair shop for the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company near Richlands, Virginia, in the southwestern tip of the state.
