{"path":"546466.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures an imposing view of a modern-styled church spire reaching dramatically into a dynamic sky. The spire is slender and sharply pointed, with a simple cross perched delicately at its apex, subtly commanding the viewer's attention. It rises out of a uniquely designed roof, which has a broad, sweeping structure that shows off clean, angular lines converging at the base of the spire.\n\nThe surface of the church roof appears textured and is possibly covered with shingles, catching glimmers of light that suggest a metallic sheen. This architectural element contrasts starkly against the backdrop of the sky.\n\nThe sky itself is a crucial component of this composition, setting an almost theatrical scene with its mix of dark and light clouds. The clouds are scattered, creating an interplay of light and shadow that gives depth and a somewhat dramatic atmosphere to the image. Sunlight filtering through various parts of the clouds suggests it may be either early morning or late afternoon, times when light is known to be more dramatic and visually compelling.\n\nThe photograph appears to use natural lighting to enhance the mystical and somewhat ethereal quality of the church, highlighting its structural and design elements through contrasts and silhouettes. The angle of the shot, looking upward towards the spire, emphasizes the churchâ€™s aspiration towards the heavens, resonating traditional themes of hope and reverence.","title":"North Christian Church, built in 1964","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546451","546459","546455","545873","550001","554700","546048","547439","550376","558019","547346","554207","558034","554035","558163","547332"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["spire","church","glimmer","cloud","reverence","cross","shingle","sheen","roof","shot"]}
