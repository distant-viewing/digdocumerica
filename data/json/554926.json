{"path":"554926.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man dressed in a worn-out dark blue work shirt and a wide-brimmed, weathered hat. He appears to be looking down or towards the ground, adopting a contemplative or introspective posture. His facial expression is thoughtful, underscored by glasses and the rough textures of his sun-exposed skin, suggesting a life of outdoor labor.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple fur tails hanging from a wooden structure, possibly a shed or barn-like setting, indicating that the man might be involved in hunting or trapping. The wooden beams and worn materials add a rustic feel to the setting. The background is partially blurred, which places the focus on the man in the foreground.","title":"Raccoon tails hang from the ceiling of a fur buyer's shop in Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["547179","544409","556563","542613","553091","554915","554857","552103","548218","552871","547679","543701","553090","554858","547338","554846"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hunting","fur","tail","brim","skin","shed","barn","underscor","man","weathere"]}
