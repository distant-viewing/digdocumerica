{"path":"557896.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph shows a view from inside a vehicle looking out through the open driver-side window at a woman who is leaning into the frame. The woman has blonde hair, wears a pale yellow top, and looks directly into the camera with an expressive, somewhat intense expression. The interior of the car frames the image: the top of the steering wheel is slightly visible, and the side mirror is in the bottom right corner of the frame. The background is softly out of focus, suggesting a nondescript outdoor setting, possibly a street or a parking area, but specific details are not discernible due to the shallow depth of field and lighting conditions. The overall ambiance is slightly moody and cinematic, characterized by subdued lighting and rich color tones.","title":"Car owner questions a city employee sitting in her vehicle as it is tested at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
