{"path":"553699.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image displays an aerial view of a suburban neighborhood characterized by its organized layout and residential infrastructure. The photograph shows numerous houses, primarily single-story, with varying shades of roofs, including shades of brown, red, and dark gray. The neighborhood configuration features curved and looping roads interspersed with intersecting straight streets.\n\nThe roads are paved and lined with sidewalks on both sides. Each house appears to have a small yard, some of which are lush with greenery, while others consist of simpler lawns. There are several vehicles parked along the streets, indicating signs of daily life and residential activity.\n\nThe top right portion of the image shows a distinctively busy area with more closely packed homes and slightly more complex road patterns. The overall color tone is a bit darker here, which might indicate variations in roofing materials or lighting conditions at the time of the photograph.\n\nThis orderly suburban area is edged by larger streets which signify the boundary of the neighborhood. These larger roads have more traffic lanes, visible as denser and darker lines compared to the interior residential streets. There are no prominent commercial buildings or high-rise buildings visible in the area, reinforcing the purely residential and suburban nature of this community. \n\nThis image captures the essence of suburban planning and development, showcasing typical residential blocks designed for functionality and accessibility in a tight-knit community setting.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani town, one solution to the island's housing shortage","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["549071","547435","547211","547769","545914","548824","553937","544510","553700","546399","556975","544550","548825","553705","553970","553934"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["neighborhood","street","road","configuration","loop","accessibility","roofing","community","house","knit"]}
