{"path":"557067.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a detailed and ornate Victorian-style house featuring a number of distinct architectural elements. The upper part of the house is visible, showing multiple sections with peaked, gabled roofs. The roofs are garnished with elaborate red finials that appear dragon-like, adding a whimsical or gothic touch to the structure.\n\nThe facade of the house is painted in a deep maroon with lighter tan and cream accents highlighting the detailed woodwork. Each section of the house has different window styles; one prominent feature is a large semi-circular window, reminiscent of a porthole, located below a bay window with a white balustrade.\n\nIn addition to the windows, there are other intricate details visible, such as ornate corbels supporting the overhangs, a textured pattern on some segments of the wall, and a panel of decorative frieze with classical motifs below one of the eaves.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests the house is located in a leafy area, as glimpses of trees and foliage are visible around the edges of the image. The sky behind is partly cloudy, adding a natural backdrop to the elaborate craftsmanship of the building.","title":"Restoration of a late 19th century example of Victorian architecture in Atchison, Kansas.
