{"path":"543513.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image depicts a lively scene centered around a bus marked \"Free Valley Shuttle.\" The bus is situated on a sunlit street bordered by tall green trees, creating a shaded, serene backdrop. Atop the bus, a number of individuals (both adults and children) are seated or standing, taking advantage of a viewing deck arrangement. These passengers are casually dressed, suggesting a relaxed, tourist-like environment.\n\nIn front of the bus, a group of people is gathered, presumably waiting to board. This crowd is diverse in terms of ages and attire, which ranges from shorts and t-shirts to lighter summer dresses and hats, indicating warm weather. The assembly appears engaged in social interaction or waiting expectantly, contributing to a friendly, communal atmosphere.\n\nAdjacent to the bus, a sign on its right reads \"Shuttle Buses Only,\" indicating a designated area for buses, probably within a park or protected area. The overall setting, with its lush greenery and organized transportation, suggests that this photograph might have been taken in a park or similar recreational area, where shuttle services are provided to ferry visitors around.","title":"California -- Mammoth Mt.","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["543508","556746","556809","553957","553796","546655","549644","553274","556797","546604","546592","549921","556050","556749","556203","555568"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","park","assembly","tourist","board","term","t","crowd","visitor","passenger"]}
