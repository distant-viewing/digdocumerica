{"path":"548089.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image presents a close view of a wet, muddy surface covered with numerous small, clear bubbles. Embedded in the mud are various brown and black plant debris including small twigs, leaves, and possibly pine needles. The mud itself has a patchy coloration, ranging from darker areas saturated with moisture to lighter, drier-looking patches. The bubbles, possibly created by gases released from decaying organic material or by raindrops impacting the mud, add texture to the scene. The overall impression is that of a natural, possibly damp environment like a forest floor after rain. No distinct man-made objects or human activity are evident in the photo; it's focused purely on the natural elements.","title":"Raw sewage bubbles up into the Spokane River from the Spokane City treatment plant about five miles west of the city.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552983","543523","545850","543520","550837","552066","554347","544992","555545","553581","552980","544762","554778","552054","555626","545029"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mud","bubble","twig","needle","coloration","moisture","gas","rain","impression","floor"]}
