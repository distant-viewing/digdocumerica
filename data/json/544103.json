{"path":"544103.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an industrial site, most likely a quarry or mining operation, with a large focus on both the machinery and a group of spectators. \n\nIn the foreground, four people are standing and observing the operations. Three men and one woman, all appearing to be middle-aged, are dressed in casual attire. From left to right: the first person is wearing a yellow shirt and dark slacks, the second person is in a light shirt and dark pants, the third person has on a boldly striped pair of trousers with a white shirt, and the fourth, a woman, is dressed in a white outfit and is carrying a white handbag. They are all turned away from the camera, looking towards the machinery.\n\nIn the background, there is a large mining truck and an excavation machine (power shovel) actively engaged in work. The machine is colored yellow and black and is positioned centrally in the image, with its shovel raised and containing dark colored earth or minerals. The environment is rocky and dusty, typical of a mining or quarry site. The color contrast between the earthy tones of the site and the vibrant clothing of the spectators creates a vivid composition in this image.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a moment of observation and perhaps learning about industrial operations, emphasizing the scale of machinery used in such environments through the juxtaposition of the human figures against the large machines.","title":"Souvenir rock-collectors at the Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["553827","556893","544099","547243","544108","552418","544104","552545","555606","554828","544138","555644","549245","545831","544107","555631"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["quarry","machine","mining","shovel","spectator","machinery","site","operation","person","learn"]}
