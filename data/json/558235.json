{"path":"558235.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Hanson, Art","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up portrait of a young woman dressed in bridal attire. The woman has long, straight blonde hair and a gentle expression, with her face partially illuminated, giving a soft and warm effect to her features.\n\nShe is wearing a white bridal veil that drapes gracefully around her head, complete with a frilly, lace-adorned headpiece that sits atop her forehead. Details of her wedding dress are partially visible; it features delicate lace and what appears to be floral embroidery, adding a traditional and elegant touch to her look.\n\nThe background of the image is purposefully dark, ensuring that the focus remains on the woman. The lighting emphasizes one side of her face, casting the other side in shadow, which adds a sense of depth and introspection to the portrait.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting of this photograph create a mood that is both celebratory and serene, highlighting the beauty and emotions typically associated with a wedding.","title":"Photograph of a bride in New Ulm, Minnesota","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558240","558237","556412","553708","553880","549709","544742","553499","558238","556495","553760","557114","554923","553737","556492","550048"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["lace","portrait","veil","woman","forehead","emotion","face","introspection","dress","look"]}
