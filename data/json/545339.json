{"path":"545339.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph portrays a somewhat aged two-story building made of red bricks, capturing its corner perspective in a suburban or small urban setting. The building exhibits classic architectural details including white cornices, a flat roof with a prominent sculpted edge, and small rectangular windows that appear to be of traditional type. On the ground level, there's a commercial space identified by a faded sign that reads \"MOSEâ€™S NOODLE SHOP\" with further faded advertisements and offers listed below the shop name, including \"CHOP-SOY\".\n\nAt the ground level, a single door and a couple of windows can be seen with their sills and frames painted white, matching the cornices, enhancing its somewhat faded facade. The surrounding environment includes a quiet street lined with utilities like telephone poles and wires, a clear sky hinting at either dawn or dusk, and another smaller, single-story building is seen in the background, painted white.\n\nAdding more character to the scene, there is an old vehicle parked in front of the small building in the background, hinting at the probable era of the photograph, which looks vintage. The overall ambience projects a quiet, almost desolate urban landscape, commonly seen in small towns. The picture's colors emphasize a warm tone, possibly due to the lighting during the time of day it was taken or the age of the photograph.","title":"Corner of 3rd and Oregon streets in El Paso's Second Ward","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["557156","550108","557643","545317","546440","552968","552965","544088","545355","550138","555902","552526","557155","552681","545333","553478"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["cornice","shop","sill","level","story","telephone","ambience","building","advertisement","window"]}
