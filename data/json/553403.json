{"path":"553403.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene scene on a river flanked by lush trees. In the foreground, there's a yellow rowing boat with three people aboard, seemingly enjoying a relaxed day on the water.\n\nThe first person, positioned at the stern, wears a striped tank top and shorts. She holds an oar and looks forward attentively, possibly steering or controlling the boat's movement. The second individual, sitting centrally, wears a red shirt and shorts, and is also handling an oar. This person's focus is on the oar's position in the water, contributing to the boat's propulsion.\n\nThe third person occupies the bow of the boat. They are dressed in a light-colored shirt and darker shorts, lying on their back with legs slightly lifted, suggesting a resting or lounging posture. Their eyes are closed, and they appear to be soaking in the tranquility of the surroundings, possibly sunbathing.\n\nThe backdrop comprises densely packed trees under bright sunlight, reflecting vibrant greens which suggest a lively natural setting, possibly during late spring or summer. The water appears calm, adding to the peacefulness of the setting, with the lightly rippled surface indicating gentle movement of the boat.\n\nOverall, the composition and activity in the image evoke a leisurely afternoon devoted to relaxation and enjoyment of nature by water.","title":"Visiting crew at Groton School on the Nashua River.
