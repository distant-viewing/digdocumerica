{"path":"542855.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a rural logging scene. It shows a large truck carrying an enormous load of freshly cut tree logs driving along a paved road. The logs, massive and rough with bark, are secured atop the truck's trailer, dominating the frame with their size. One can see the details of the cut wood and the sheer scale as they tower over the truck.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest lines either side of the road, indicating that the location is in a heavily wooded area. The trees in the background are tall and appear to be conifers, suggesting a mountainous or northern geographic region. The forest provides a vivid backdrop of varying shades of green, enhancing the natural setting of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft light that slightly shadows the forest and highlights parts of the logs and truck, creating a serene yet industrious atmosphere.\n\nThis scene likely illustrates the logging industry's operations, where trucks transport large quantities of timber from forests to processing locations. It not only shows the industrial activity but also hints at the environmental scale and impact of such operations.","title":"Within a mile of magnificent redwoods are sites of some of the worst logging and clear cutting practices.
