{"path":"549906.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, likely from the mid-20th century, based on the clothing styles and vehicles present. The image seems to be taken from an elevated point of view overlooking a large pedestrian crossing, with numerous people walking in different directions across what appears to be a wide street or intersection.\n\nThe crowd is diverse, with individuals of various ages and styles. People are dressed in what might be considered typical attire for the 1970s: women in skirts and dresses, and men in slacks and blazers or coats. Some are carrying bags and papers, suggesting they might be going to or coming from work or shopping.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a flower vendor at a makeshift stall, surrounded by buckets filled with colorful blooms that bring a splash of color to the urban environment. This vendor is interacting with customers, adding a personal and commercial element to the scene.\n\nBehind the pedestrians, the street is lined with parked cars typical of the era, with some cars stopped at a traffic light, indicating a busy and active city environment. The architecture in the background suggests mid-20th-century commercial buildings, typical of a bustling downtown area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its busy crossing filled with people and cars framed by urban architecture, captures the dynamic rhythm of city life during this period.","title":"Commuters head for home at rush hour near the docks of the Staten Island ferries in Battery Park, Lower Manhattan.
