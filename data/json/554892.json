{"path":"554892.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts several individuals involved in the process of shearing or handling sheep within what appears to be a rustic, wooden-slat barn. The activity captured shows at least four individuals engaged in different stages of dealing with the sheep and its wool.\n\nOn the far left, a person is bent over a sheep, holding it down on a wooden surface littered with clumps of white wool. This person is closely shearing the sheep, and seems focused on their task, with their head near the body of the sheep. They wear a light blue shirt and dark trousers.\n\nIn the center, another individual is working with a large quantity of sheared wool, handling it with both hands. This person, dressed in a white shirt and jeans, is also in a stooping position, organizing or perhaps sorting the wool.\n\nTowards the right, another figure stands slightly elevated on what may be a platform or a step, also dealing with a sheep. There is an old metal can visible near this person, adding to the rustic setting of the barn.\n\nIn the background, the structure of the barn is prominent with ample wooden beams and slats that make up the walls. The lighting suggests natural light filtering through openings in the barn, highlighting dust particles and the texture of the wooden surfaces strewn with wool.\n\nThe scene captures a moment of labor and concentration, typical of agricultural or pastoral settings, emphasizing a hands-on interaction with livestock and natural materials.","title":"Sheep being sheared on a ranch, near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554884","554893","554881","554894","552568","554886","544391","554883","554882","554880","552573","547396","551657","552569","554891","554888"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["sheep","wool","barn","slat","deal","person","stoop","handle","quantity","particle"]}
