{"path":"550472.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a small rodent, likely a ground squirrel, peeking out from a burrow in its natural habitat. The animal's head is visible, with its eyes, ears, and facial features clearly evident as it looks directly at the camera.\n\nThe surroundings are characteristic of a wild, grassy area with various types of vegetation. The ground in the foreground is rough and uneven, covered with loose soil and interspersed with clumps of grass and other green plants. Some plants have reddish leaves, adding a bit of color contrast to the mostly green and brown scene. The background is somewhat blurred due to the shallow depth of field, focusing the viewer's attention on the squirrel and the immediate vicinity of its burrow.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the curious and vigilant nature of the squirrel within its environment, highlighting the interaction between wildlife and its natural setting. The lighting appears natural, suggesting the photograph was taken in daylight, which casts soft shadows and enhances the textures of the fur and earth.","title":"Emerging from his hole, the parka squirrel takes a look around for predators--anything bigger than itself.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550468","543265","555668","550469","550470","545564","554597","542629","545556","554599","545560","557615","545549","550467","542630","551376"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["ear","clump","fur","plant","vicinity","habitat","wildlife","bit","animal","daylight"]}
