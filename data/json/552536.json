{"path":"552536.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features two large wooden barns with weathered, peeling paint. The barn on the left is partially visible with clear signs of aging on its wooden facade, especially noticeable in its darkened, vertical planks and peeling paint. It has an open loft area at the top, showing darkness inside which contrasts sharply with the brightness outside.\n\nThe barn on the right is shown more fully and is larger. It displays similar signs of wear with its weathered, faded paint and vertical wooden siding. This barn has a vent near the roof and a couple of small windows with one noticeably boarded and the other just a small, dark gap. There is also a larger double window higher up, directly underneath the apex of the gable roof, also appearing dark inside. The roof of this barn, though not in clear focus, seems to be in relatively better condition compared to the walls.\n\nBetween these two barns, there is lush greenery visible, suggesting the presence of bushes or small trees, adding a bit of life and color contrast to the mostly gray and faded tones of the barns. The environment suggests a rural setting, probably a farm, where these barns are used for storage or housing livestock. The sky behind the barns is bright and clear, indicating a sunny day which enhances the textures of the wooden surfaces and the overall rural aesthetic.","title":"Barns","placename":"West Jersey (Ill.)","location":"West Jersey, Illinois","nn1":["549194","543343","550693","555627","552537","547128","552448","555612","557991","554821","550019","555577","554782","555571","556586","552462"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","peel","paint","roof","apex","darkened","inside","weathered","gap","vent"]}
