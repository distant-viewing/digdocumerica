{"path":"554010.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a vibrant outdoor photograph featuring a man mounted on a white horse. The man appears to be of middle age and is smiling gently, looking downward which conveys a sense of joy or contentment. He wears a blue denim jacket over a shirt, which matches a rustic, outdoor aesthetic. His hair is dark with hints of gray, and his expression is relaxed.\n\nThe horse, a stunning white color, is equipped with a simple yet functional bridle and a rope. It seems calm and well-mannered under the control of its rider. The horse and rider are set against a natural backdrop, which suggests they are in a large open field; the distant background is a little blurred, giving emphasis to them.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights the subjects warmly, suggesting the photo might have been taken during the late afternoon, adding a soft glow to the overall scene. The mood of the image is peaceful, reflecting a serene moment shared between the rider and his horse in a natural setting.","title":"With pineapple fields as his arena, henri aki takes his horse for a late afternoon training session near Lanai city.
