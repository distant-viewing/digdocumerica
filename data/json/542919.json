{"path":"542919.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring a lone seagull perched on top of a wooden post that emerges vertically from a calm body of water. The post is weathered and partly covered with barnacles or similar marine growth, emphasizing its long-standing presence in the water. The seagull is positioned facing left, likely looking towards the horizon or scanning the area for food.\n\nThe water around the post is smooth, with subtle waves reflecting a gentle breeze, and it covers the lower two-thirds of the image. In the distance, under a hazy sky, one can barely discern a faint outline of land or a distant shoreline, adding a sense of vastness and isolation to the scene.\n\nThe background is a sky that gradually shifts in hue from a lighter blue at the horizon to a deeper blue as it extends upward, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon time. The natural light appears soft, indicating either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the tranquil mood of the image.\n\nThe overall composition uses vertical and horizontal lines effectively—the verticality of the post and the horizontal expanse of the water and distant land—creating a simple yet striking visual balance. It invokes a sense of quiet and solitude, emphasizing the smallness of the bird within the vastness of its surroundings.","title":"California--northern coast","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["549896","548728","547318","548832","552992","550388","543285","551378","543317","557508","545991","543063","545142","557495","553777","546241"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["post","seagull","vastness","verticality","blue","land","afternoon","invoke","morning","third"]}
