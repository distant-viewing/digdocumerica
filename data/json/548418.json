{"path":"548418.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid aerial view of a large, bustling cityscape dominated by a complex highway system and a series of tall residential buildings. Significantly, the image captures the intricate metal framework of part of a large suspension bridge in the foreground, possibly viewed from the bridge itself or another lofty perspective. This bridge framework includes an array of beams and cables, adding a geometric pattern to the image.\n\nBelow and beyond this framework, the viewer can see a highway, curved and layered, stretching across the photograph. This highway is busy with numerous vehicles, indicative of a heavily trafficked urban area. Parallel and adjacent to the highway, there are patches of lush greenery, providing a contrasting natural element amidst the urban environment.\n\nThe background is filled with a series of residential buildings, both high-rise towers and lower apartment blocks, aligned in close proximity to each other. These structures have a uniform, somewhat utilitarian architecture, typical of urban housing.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its combination of architectural and natural elements, as well as the dynamic movement of vehicles, paints a detailed portrait of urban life and infrastructure. This scene likely captures a moment from either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the soft lighting and shadows, adding depth to the urban landscape portrayed.","title":"Approaches to the george Washington bridge in upper Manhattan, aerial view","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548414","546707","553846","548344","546569","546678","553838","549478","555733","555743","547755","555745","546581","555781","548392","546704"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["highway","framework","bridge","series","suspension","portrait","apartment","housing","cable","combination"]}
