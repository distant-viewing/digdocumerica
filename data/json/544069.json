{"path":"544069.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph features a man in the foreground, speaking or possibly listening intently. He has dark hair and is wearing a light-colored plaid shirt. His expression is earnest and focused. Positioned in the background, slightly blurred and out of focus, is a white projector screen or banner with visible words and phrases such as \"UNION,\" \"JUSTLY,\" and \"JUSTICE.\" These words suggest the setting might be related to a labor union meeting or an event advocating for workers' rights. The background is dimly lit, directing the viewer's attention predominantly towards the man in the foreground. The lighting on his face and the serious ambiance indicate a moment of importance, likely involving discussion or presentation about labor issues.","title":"Cesar Chavez, migrant workers union leader","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557703","554322","554342","554339","549073","549114","554338","547367","558393","547320","546550","557856","543924","551853","558293","555234"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["word","labor","screen","phrase","presentation","meeting","banner","importance","discussion","issue"]}
