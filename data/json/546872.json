{"path":"546872.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image displays a close-up view of a horizontally-oriented wooden surface, possibly a panel or part of a crate, characterized by its natural tan and brown wood tone and textures featuring visible wood grain and some vertical seams. The focus of the photograph is the graffiti text that reads \"BALTIMORE,\" written in black spray paint. The text is informal and slightly uneven, with the letters varying slightly in size and alignment. Surrounding the word \"BALTIMORE\" is a circular branding or stencil design, painted in red, seemingly resembling a stamp. The circular design encapsulates the text and appears somewhat smeared or faded, adding a rustic or weathered quality to the image. The background behind the wooden panel is not clearly visible, maintaining the focus on the textured surface and the spray-painted and stenciled markings. The overall impression is gritty and urban, highlighting an element of street art or industrial marking.","title":"Lumber is unloaded from a ship docked at the dundalk marine terminal, a Maryland port authority facility","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552511","555939","545822","548271","547005","555750","557583","556232","543348","543330","552512","542915","557347","555059","556690","542715"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["text","marking","spray","panel","paint","smear","tan","wood","branding","alignment"]}
