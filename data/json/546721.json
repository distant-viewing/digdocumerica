{"path":"546721.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy highway system surrounded by lush greenery. The image captures multiple lanes of traffic snaking through a forested area, illustrating a mix of motion and congestion.\n\nIn the foreground, three sections of highway run parallel to each other, with the nearest section showing relatively smooth traffic flow, while the middle section has a dense build-up of vehicles indicating heavy traffic or a possible traffic jam. Various types of vehicles are visible, including cars, trucks, and potentially a few motorcycles or similar smaller vehicles. The outermost lanes in this section show a mix of moving and stationary vehicles.\n\nIn the upper part of the image, there is an interchange with a curved bridge allowing traffic to cross over from one part of the highway to another. On the bridge itself and the connecting roads, traffic is heavily congested, showcasing a bottleneck effect typical in urban road networks during peak hours.\n\nThe surrounding area is heavily wooded, with mature trees providing a stark contrast to the man-made asphalt and vehicles. The uppermost part of the photograph shows more of the continuing highway system and dense forest, hinting that this is a significant transportation artery likely near or in an urban area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights the interaction between urban infrastructure and natural landscapes, and it captures a common scenario in many metropolitan areas around the world where traffic congestion is a frequent issue.","title":"The beltway narrows in Virginia, causing rush hour jam on Maryland side.
