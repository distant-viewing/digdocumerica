{"path":"553027.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody industrial scene featuring a large crane against a backdrop of rugged mountainous terrain under a dimly lit sky. The crane is silhouetted and positioned centrally, emphasizing its importance in the composition. It is equipped with lights, which are visible and add a glowing effect to the scene. The crane seems to be in operation, possibly engaged in heavy lifting, as suggested by the visible cable and a suspended load.\n\nThe environment appears to be a construction or mining site, given the rocky and uneven terrain in the foreground, typical of such areas. The sky contributes significantly to the mood of the image, displaying dark hues with hints of blue and pink, possibly indicating early morning or late evening hours. This low lighting creates an atmosphere of isolation and industrial grit.\n\nOverall, the photograph combines elements of nature and human-driven industrial activity, creating a stark contrast between the natural ruggedness of the mountains and the mechanical complexity of the crane. The lighting and color tones enhance the sense of a harsh, somewhat unwelcoming environment.","title":"Strip mining rig.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
