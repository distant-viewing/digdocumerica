{"path":"551702.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a lush garden scene filled with vibrant life and color. The main focus is a woman tending to a large rose bush that is blooming with red and pink roses. She is dressed in a casual, floral dress that blends with the garden's aesthetic, and her blonde hair contrasts with the rich greenery.\n\nThe garden is enclosed by a wooden fence that appears weathered, adding to the rustic charm of the setting. There's a significant presence of various green plants and foliage, which create a dense and inviting backdrop. Above, the garden is canopied by the dappled light filtering through the leaves of overarching trees, illuminating patches of the garden and adding a tranquil, ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a view of a row of houses with visible architectural details such as windows and balconies, suggesting that this garden is part of an urban environment, possibly a community or shared space near residential buildings. The houses have a classic design, with windows framed by dark shutters, contributing to a quaint, historical feel.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene moment of everyday life where nature and urban living intertwine harmoniously. The image emits a sense of peace and the simple joys of gardening within a small, beautifully maintained space.","title":"Meg Wehlberg, editor with a nearby publishing house and an ardent gardener, has created this flowering oasis back of her East 30th Street house.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551701","556168","551728","551703","551746","551743","551705","551104","551784","548311","548442","551785","546505","552401","551744","551620"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","rose","gardening","house","shutter","filtering","peace","joy","balcony","space"]}
