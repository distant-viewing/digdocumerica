{"path":"545586.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural rock formation seen in silhouette against a twilight sky. The silhouette outlines a large, arched rock formation reminiscent of a keyhole or doorway, characterized by its smooth, weathered curves contrasting sharply with the dark blue of the sky. The contours of the rock formation suggest an organic, slightly asymmetrical shape with jagged texture, adding a ruggedness to the image.\n\nIn the background, there is a clear night sky transitioning in color from a deep indigo at the top to a lighter blue gradient near the horizon. A small, bright moon is visible through the arch, perfectly positioned to appear as if suspended within the rock formation's window. This placement of the moon adds a serene, almost magical quality to the scene.\n\nThe photograph captures the essence of stillness and natural beauty, evoking a sense of solitude and the majestic scale of geological time. The entire composition focuses on the play of natural shapes and light, creating a peaceful, contemplative image that highlights the enduring beauty of natural rock formations.","title":"Delicate Arch, a night time view","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543127","550428","544359","555047","544392","555206","552891","543126","545775","544376","544363","545550","549197","545801","543140","545554"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","moon","rock","silhouette","shape","endure","ruggedness","placement","suspend","doorway"]}
