{"path":"547942.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a young boy standing on a concrete walkway leading up to a suburban house. The boy is dressed casually, wearing a baseball cap, a striped t-shirt, a shiny jacket, jeans, and what appear to be slip-on shoes.\n\nThe house in the background is a two-story structure, featuring a mix of design elements. The main body of the house appears to be built with white siding, while portions of the front facade are accentuated with stone cladding. The house has a prominent front porch with a peaked roof. Above the porch, a large bay window projects outward, composed of smaller windows set in a diamond or crosshatch pattern, lending a decorative, somewhat ornate look to the architecture. There is a garage visible on the right side of the house, with a door that mimics the design elements of the house, incorporating rectangular and square patterns.\n\nThe landscaping around the house includes a neatly trimmed lawn and a concrete driveway leading to the garage. There are also flower bushes and standard shrubs enhancing the suburban aesthetic of the home front. The sky is clear with very few clouds, suggesting a pleasant, sunny day. The overall setting conveys a quiet, residential atmosphere, typical of mid-20th century American suburbs.","title":"Recently built home on border of great kills park in Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547938","552830","550121","558157","556603","546441","546035","550124","547433","558131","547946","557361","557326","557638","557094","556601"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","garage","porch","boy","slip","mimic","suburb","diamond","incorporate","driveway"]}
