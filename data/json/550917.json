{"path":"550917.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph displays an industrial scene, predominantly featuring a large oil refinery or chemical plant. In the foreground, there are several large storage tanks painted in a striking red color, which contrasts sharply with other neutral-colored equipment. Some of these tanks have visible staircases and piping, suggesting their function for storage and possibly the transit of chemicals or petroleum products.\n\nBeyond the vibrant red tanks, the middle ground is cluttered with an array of metallic industrial structures, including more tanks, towers, and a complex network of pipes and conduits. These structures are dense and interwoven, showing the complexity of the facility's operations.\n\nIn the background, the plant extends into the distance with additional infrastructure that becomes less distinct as it recedes. Two tall smokestacks rise prominently against the sky, with visible emissions of steam or smoke, indicating active production. The sky appears clear, enhancing the visibility across the plant.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of vast industrial activity and is indicative of the scale and operational complexity typical of large-scale refineries or chemical plants. The image may serve to highlight issues of industrialization, energy production, and environmental impact.","title":"Storage yard of the National Molasses Company on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549960","549959","545837","549713","555777","555775","550911","550958","546107","555778","557304","546108","552003","546221","546143","546064"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["chemical","tank","refinery","plant","production","complexity","storage","conduit","industrialization","piping"]}
