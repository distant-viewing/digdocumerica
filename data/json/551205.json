{"path":"551205.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a complex infrastructure setup consisting of a network of highways, overpasses, and interchanges. The layout includes a prominent cloverleaf interchange surrounded by a couple of loop ramps and multiple connecting roads that intertwine and lead in various directions.\n\nIn the foreground, a major freeway threads horizontally across the image, with vehicles visible on the roads suggesting active traffic. Adjacent to the freeway, several large commercial or industrial buildings are clustered together along with what appears to be a parking lot filled with vehicles.\n\nThe midground features a waterway that meanders vertically through the scene, paralleled by a road that runs close to its banks. This section also hosts more compact infrastructure, including smaller buildings possibly indicating residential areas, commercial zones, or light industry.\n\nIn the background, two mountains or large hills flank each side of the landscape, framing the developed areas between them. These natural features are densely covered in trees, indicating they are likely undeveloped forested areas. Between the mountains, the developed valley stretches back, showing signs of more human activity like additional buildings, roads, and possibly small patches of agriculture or open land.\n\nThe entire scene conveys a blend of natural and human-made environments, illustrating how infrastructure like roads and highways can integrate with varied geographical features.","title":"Kanawha City interchange of the West Virginia Turnpike","placename":"Charleston (W.
