{"path":"549454.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and rugged landscape scene from a high vantage point. The foreground prominently features a wooden signpost with the label \"SUICIDE POINT,\" attached with a metallic bracket, indicating a potentially notorious or infamous location. The signpost is somewhat weathered and battered, suggesting it has endured exposure to the elements over time.\n\nIn the background, a sinuous river curves through a deep valley surrounded by steep, rolling hills. The terrain is characterized by undulating patterns and variations in colorâ€”shades of green, brown, and grey, likely depicting a semi-arid environment. The riverbank is visible in several places, showing sandy and rocky shores. This type of terrain suggests a largely uninhabited, natural landscape potentially used for outdoor activities such as hiking or nature observation.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is structured to lead the viewer's eye from the sign in the foreground along the river, guiding through the valley into the distance, creating depth and encouraging contemplation of the vastness and secluded nature of the surroundings. The overall mood of the image is somewhat somber and introspective, enhanced by the overcast sky and muted color palette.","title":"The Snake River winds through Hells Canyon, wildest and deepest gorge in the North American continent.","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["554777","545639","550518","549448","548248","550593","544116","550586","552905","545647","552548","545783","556943","545787","545656","549514"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["signpost","valley","bracket","hiking","point","label","observation","river","variation","terrain"]}
