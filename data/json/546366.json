{"path":"546366.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures the hands-on and intricate work involved in dissecting or preparing a fish. The scene is set on a table covered with newspaper, which suggests a casual or makeshift workspace.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a large, pale-colored fish that is opened up and laid flat on the surface. Two hands are visible, one holding the fish open while the other uses a small knife to carefully make incisions or remove parts from inside the fish. The fishâ€™s inner cavity is exposed, showing some of its internal structure and flesh.\n\nNext to the fish is a small open glass jar containing pieces of what appears to be chopped fish or possibly bait, indicating that the work might involve using parts of this fish for further use, either for cooking or possibly for fishing bait.\n\nThe background and other elements in the photograph are blurred and indistinct, keeping the viewer's attention focused on the hands and the fish. The overall image provides a detailed glimpse into the process of fish preparation or dissection, highlighting the skill and care involved in handling seafood or conducting a biological examination.","title":"A biologist is removing organs from a fish for chemical analysis.
