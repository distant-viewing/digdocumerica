{"path":"545322.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a desolate and sunlit cemetery landscape. The terrain is arid and dusty, with sparse vegetation evident mostly as small shrubs. The scene is predominantly in shades of browns and grays, contrasted by vibrant patches of color.\n\nIn the foreground and middle of the image, irregularly shaped rocks, colored in shades of blue and gray, are piled into mounds. These rock arrangements mark gravesites. Some graves are further decorated with personal items and symbols, including crosses made of wood and metal. These crosses vary in size, style, and decoration; some are adorned with flowers and fabric, adding poignant splashes of color (reds, yellows, and whites) to the somber setting.\n\nIn the background, the landscape extends into a flat horizon with mild undulations. Few man-made structures, possibly power lines or fences, appear subtly in the distance, contributing to the isolated, almost forsaken feel of the environment. The sky above is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of poignancy and solitude, reflecting a place of remembrance in a stark, resilient environment.","title":"Smelter cemetery, where employees of asarco smelter works can be buried","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552683","544267","545811","557184","554824","545314","554790","549041","544427","545826","555566","557185","550364","557942","547420","554792"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["remembrance","grave","undulation","cemetery","rock","symbol","fabric","decoration","decorate","shade"]}
