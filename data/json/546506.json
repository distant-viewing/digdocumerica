{"path":"546506.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a modern architectural scene, featuring a large building with a striking geometric design. The building is composed mainly of an extensive glass facade, consisting of numerous square windows that cover the entire front. This frontal section is framed by two side walls, one visible on the right-hand side of the image, which is covered in a dark vertical tiling, adding a textural contrast to the smooth glass surface.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a broad series of concrete steps leading up to a set of large, wooden double doors that appear to be the main entrance. The doors are slightly recessed, adding depth to the structure's facade.\n\nA solitary figure is walking in front of the building, across the wide plaza that extends in front of the steps. The figure is moving from left to right, captured in midstride, and dressed in dark clothing, which provides a visual contrast to the bright and open space. The size and solitary nature of the figure amidst the vast architectural surroundings give a sense of scale and emphasize the large dimensions of the building and its open plaza.\n\nThe sky above is clear, suggesting a bright sunny day, and the lighting conditions contribute to the buildingâ€™s appearance, highlighting the textures and materials used in its construction. The photograph communicates a sense of stillness and the modern architectural style of the building, portraying a moment frozen in time within a distinctly urban environment.","title":"First Christian Church, built in 1942.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546531","546539","546518","555318","546493","546481","546464","546473","546415","546515","549317","557267","546470","548648","546456","546469"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["front","building","figure","step","recess","facade","freeze","door","dimension","glass"]}
