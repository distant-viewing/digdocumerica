{"path":"548794.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene by a body of water at dusk, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The image features a woman standing at the shore, holding a small child. The woman appears to be wearing a loose, patterned dress and has her hair tied up. She and the child are looking out over the water, which stretches expansively across the background and reflects the soft colors of a waning sky.\n\nIn the foreground, part of a camping or outdoor recreational setup is visible. To the left, there is a lantern positioned on a wooden surface, near which some stuffed toys and a roll of paper towels are placed. Also prominently in the foreground is a faded, half-folded playpen or a portable crib, indicative of a family outing or vacation setting.\n\nThe ground is sandy, suggesting that this location might be near a beach or riverbank. The setting is calm and serene, with natural lighting that suggests the time is either early morning or late evening, giving the overall scene a tranquil, introspective mood.","title":"Swiss mother and child on the beach at Long Key State Park.
