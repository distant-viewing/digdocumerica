{"path":"547643.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a tranquil scene in a densely wooded area during what appears to be the spring, indicated by small leaves emerging on the trees. The picture is taken in the middle of a forest, surrounded by numerous trees with thin trunks standing relatively close to each other. The foliage is lush and green, suggesting early growth phases of the season.\n\nSunlight filters through the canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the forest floor, which is covered with last season's fallen leaves, primarily brown and tan in color, mixed with some darker areas possibly indicating moist or shaded spots.\n\nThe trees are mainly straight and vertical, with no significant branches visible until the higher sections of the trunks, which are outside of the frame's top edge. The leaves are fresh and green, reflecting the light and adding a vibrant quality to the scene. There are no visible flowers or flowering plants, which focuses all attention on the varying shades of green foliage and the textured forest floor.\n\nThere are no people, animals, or man-made structures visible in the image, enhancing the feeling of natural solitude and the serenity of an untouched forest environment. The composition of the photo, with its focus on vertical lines of the tree trunks and the textured ground covered in fallen leaves, gives a sense of depth and tranquility. The overall mood is peaceful, with the play of light and shadow creating a dynamic yet harmonious woodland landscape.","title":"Forest of beeches and maples","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554425","554718","543581","550791","555118","558012","554393","549234","554394","558082","555116","554728","546947","554984","554990","545488"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["leave","trunk","forest","season","floor","phase","foliage","serenity","tree","play"]}
