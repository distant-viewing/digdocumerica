{"path":"546158.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image shows a close-up view of a dead bird lying on a cracked asphalt surface. The bird appears to be a small game bird, likely a quail, with its brown and tan feathers mingling with points of dark red and white. Its head with a closed eye is tipped forward onto the ground, and stiff legs can be seen bent awkwardly beneath it. Numerous loose feathers, some still fluffy and undamaged, are scattered around the bird on the asphalt.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a textured dark gray asphalt, cracked and rough, which contrasts with the warm colors of the bird's plumage. The overall setting gives a grim and somber tone to the image, emphasizing the lifelessness of the bird in a stark, man-made environment.","title":"Dead fowl on highway","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["547947","557576","546241","552992","555854","549115","552699","552056","547039","551250","552696","557015","555855","543266","543786","544547"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","asphalt","feather","plumage","game","leg","head","eye","point","tone"]}
