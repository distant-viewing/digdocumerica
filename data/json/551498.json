{"path":"551498.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic outdoor scene in an urban area. The central focus is a person swinging on a rope swing over a body of water, seemingly a river. The individual is silhouetted and appears in mid-swing, with one leg extended forward and the other bent, suggesting movement towards the water.\n\nIn the background, there are prominent urban features including a tall, narrow skyscraper and an electricity pylon with visible power lines stretching across the frame. These elements underscore a contrast between the playful, natural setting at the foreground and the industrial, urban environment in the distance.\n\nThe river banks are lined with lush, green trees and bushes, and the water sparkles under what seems to be bright, sunny weather. On the left side of the image, several other silhouettes of people can be seen on the riverbank, some are standing and one appears to be climbing on an elevated surface, possibly a rock or a small cliff, just beside the swing.\n\nThis image evokes a sense of summer leisure activities amidst an urban setting, capturing both the enjoyment of nature and the presence of the city life in the surroundings.","title":"Minneapolis Tarzan swings into Mississippi River from rope attached to railroad trestle.
