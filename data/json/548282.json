{"path":"548282.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of a woman engaging with a shell on a sandy beach. Shot from an aerial perspective, the focus is primarily on the woman's actions and the immediate surroundings.\n\nThe woman appears deeply concentrated, as she is bending down, her hair blown by the wind and falling forward over her face, partially obscuring it. She wears a black long-sleeve top, and her hands, which are visible, suggest she is handling the shell delicately. What stands out is her apron, which seems to be covered with patches of sand, adding a tactile dimension to her attire indicative of physical engagement with her environment.\n\nShe is holding a large, fan-shaped shell in one hand while apparently using the other to either clean it or examine it more closely. The sandy beach environment around her is sparse, with little other than the fine, light-colored sand visible in the immediate vicinity. There's a soft shadow cast beside her, possibly by the combination of the bright sunlight and her own body, emphasizing the brightness of the day.\n\nThe composition and the details paint an image of intimate interaction with nature, possibly collecting or studying shells, which lends a serene and absorbed quality to the moment captured.","title":"On the beach at Destin, on the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548280","552941","543225","548291","552286","545095","547167","552304","548698","543293","545195","543493","545204","543457","554121","547877"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["shell","sand","beach","woman","blow","fan","apron","dimension","clean","shoot"]}
