{"path":"549671.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene, presumably from a European city given the architectural style and signage. In the foreground, a significant element is the street sign indicating a pedestrian zone (Fußgängerzone) with hours from 10:30 to 19:00, clearly displayed in German.\n\nTo the left of the sign, a woman stands prominently in the frame. She is dressed in a colorful, patterned outfit that includes a headscarf, sunglasses, a short-sleeve shirt, and a knee-length skirt. She carries a dark shoulder bag and appears to be looking towards the street activity or storefronts.\n\nBehind the woman, there are historic buildings with ornate facades and signage indicating various businesses, including one that potentially reads \"Schlumsky.\" These buildings have a classical European architectural style, with visible details like wood paneling and large display windows.\n\nIn the street and along the sidewalks, several other pedestrians are visible. They are mostly dressed in light, summer attire, suggesting the season might be warm. The ambiance suggests a busy, urban environment with a casual and relaxed mood.\n\nAdditionally, in the immediate foreground, there's a box with plants and a parked scooter, adding to the urban feel of the street. These elements collectively offer a glimpse into daily life in this particular locale, focusing on pedestrian movement and street-level activity.","title":"Pedestrian-only zones have been established on three of the main streets of the inner city.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551849","551790","549660","549647","551788","557656","551835","551911","551816","557663","557803","549645","551829","551871","549681","551851"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","pedestrian","signage","paneling","headscarf","storefront","locale","knee","skirt","woman"]}
