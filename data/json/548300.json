{"path":"548300.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a small single-story house surrounded by floodwater. The house is mainly white with a dark roof, featuring a front porch that is partially enclosed by screens. There is a mid-aged woman standing in the doorway wearing a long, light-colored coat and a headscarf. The house and the area surrounding it appear to be severely affected by flooding, as water is visible encroaching upon the structure and the yard.\n\nIn front of the house, there's a wooden fence painted white, and it is partially submerged in floodwater. The yard has lush greenery including shrubs and a garden that is also submerged. Several tall trees with dense foliage can be seen in the background, which suggests a rural or semi-rural setting. Additionally, some blooming red flowers can be spotted near the front fence, adding a touch of color to the otherwise damp and overcast scene.\n\nThere is an antenna mounted on the roof of the house, indicating some modern amenities despite the rural setting. The overcast sky suggests a cloudy, possibly rainy day, which might have contributed to the flooding situation. No other houses are visible in the immediate vicinity in the photograph, which could imply a degree of isolation for this property.","title":"Home at Pass Manchac has yard and porch under water as a result of heavy rains and \"back-up\" water from the recently reopened Bonnet Carre Spillway.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552436","547036","547077","552857","552824","552825","552852","552843","552850","552818","552826","547079","547212","552854","552848","551091"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["house","floodwater","yard","fence","screen","headscarf","amenity","degree","antenna","flooding"]}
