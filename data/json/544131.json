{"path":"544131.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic landscape under a moody, overcast sky. The upper part of the image is occupied by a heavy, dark cloud cover that suggests impending rain or storm. Below, the landscape consists of a wide open terrain, which appears sparse and raw.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, there is a large crane, silhouetted against the sky, positioned atop what looks like a ridge or earthwork. The crane, with its long arm extended, dominates this part of the scene and adds an industrial element to the otherwise natural environment. To the right of the crane, there are several small, indistinct structures or trees that add some detail to the horizon line.\n\nThe left and middle portions of the image show gently rolling hills or mounds that are devoid of any significant vegetation or other distinguishing features. These hills are shaded and have a slightly bluish tint, contrasting with the darker tones of the sky and the silhouette of the crane.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo conveys a sense of isolation and perhaps the encroachment of industry into a natural landscape, highlighted by the dim, ethereal light filtering through the cloud cover. The photo has a gritty quality, further emphasized by visible grain or noise, typical of film photography, which adds to the atmospheric effect.","title":"Strip mining on the Moenhopi Wash.
