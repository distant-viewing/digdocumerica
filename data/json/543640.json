{"path":"543640.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a breathtaking mountainous landscape, likely captured during winter, given the extensive snow covering. Dominating the background are several tall, imposing mountains covered with a dense layer of snow, showcasing steep slopes and rocky faces that hint at their rugged terrain. The sunlight enhances certain parts of the mountains, making portions of the snow glisten while leaving other sections in stark shadow.\n\nNestling in the valley between these towering mountains is a small, quaint village. The buildings appear small from this distance, clustered closely together, suggesting a tight-knit community. The architecture visible includes traditional alpine roofs, likely designed to withstand heavy snowfall.\n\nIn the foreground, dark coniferous trees frame the lower edges of the image, contrasting sharply against the white snow and adding a layer of depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the natural environment dominating the view and hinting at the remote and possibly secluded location of the village. The photograph possesses a slightly faded quality, suggesting it might have been taken some years ago or intended to evoke a sense of nostalgia.","title":"Spring snowstorm in San Juan Mountains","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["553811","543738","550413","550503","552607","550406","543720","543750","543763","554281","550502","550415","550416","550501","542519","552173"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["village","snow","mountain","snowfall","covering","layer","nostalgia","year","winter","valley"]}
