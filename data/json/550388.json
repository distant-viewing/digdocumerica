{"path":"550388.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a serene and somewhat abstract natural scene, likely captured during twilight or under subdued lighting conditions. The main element in the image is a solitary bird, which appears to be a wading bird, standing in shallow water. The bird is centered in the image and is reflected clearly in the still water beneath it, creating a peaceful and symmetrical composition.\n\nThe background and surroundings are marked by a complex network of thin reeds or aquatic plants, which are reflected in the water and form intricate patterns and loops. These reeds dominate the upper part of the frame and are silhouetted against the lighter background, suggesting the photo was taken against the light, possibly during sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe foreground is less detailed, giving the impression of a border of dense, possibly grassy vegetation, which is slightly out of focus. This helps to frame the bird and draw attention to it as the focal point of the image.\n\nThe water surface is calm, with only minor ripples around the bird, enhancing the overall tranquil and contemplative mood of the photograph. The color palette is quite homogenous, dominated by dark tones with gradations of gray and subtle hints of warm hues, possibly from the dim light of the sun. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet solitude, emphasizing the beauty and simplicity of nature.","title":"Wading shore bird searches out insects in pond","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548832","543063","557495","553777","557448","544539","545991","551378","543918","547744","547726","544543","544838","550387","543922","547318"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","reed","loop","gradation","border","sunrise","water","twilight","simplicity","network"]}
