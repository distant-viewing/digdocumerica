{"path":"555288.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a striking composition, mainly highlighting a part of a solar panel array in the foreground with a natural and domestic background. The photo appears to be taken during the day under a bright sky filled with puffy clouds.\n\nIn the foreground is a series of inclined solar panels with a bluish hue, arranged in a linear fashion and reflecting some light. These panels take up a significant part of the image on the right side and demonstrate a focus on renewable energy technology.\n\nBeyond the solar panels, the scene includes a rural or suburban landscape. Visible are leaf-bare trees suggesting it might be either late autumn or winter. There's a fence and what seems to be a modest residential building peeping through the sparse branches of the trees, hinting at a domestic setting.\n\nThe sky occupies the upper half of the photograph and is filled with blotchy, white clouds against a pale blue backdrop, indicating a sunny day. The sun, although not directly visible, affects the lighting of the entire scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere created is one of quiet and everyday life juxtaposed with the technology of solar power, hinting at themes of sustainability and interaction between human living spaces and technological advancements in energy.","title":"Detail of the glass-covered roof panel of an adobe home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, converted to solar heating. Blackened corrugated metal sheeting lies beneath the glass. Air forced along the surface of the metal is heated, then transmitted below to a large bin of rocks for later use.","placename":"New Mexico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555309","557320","555294","555327","544405","555609","555333","557312","557333","555331","555343","544695","557330","555293","544519","555349"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["panel","technology","energy","advancement","sustainability","leaf","half","cloud","living","fashion"]}
