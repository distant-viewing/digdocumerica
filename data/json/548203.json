{"path":"548203.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene on a body of water, possibly during a casual sailboat race or a leisurely sailing outing. There are two sailboats prominently featured, both heeling slightly which suggests a moderate breeze.\n\nThe sailboat on the left has a colorful mainsail, predominantly displaying blue, green, and purple stripes, complemented by a smaller white jib (front sail). On this boat, there are four visible crew members actively engaged in sailing tasks; one person is handling the mainsail, another seems to be working with the jib, while the others are attending to other duties or navigating.\n\nThe sailboat on the right has a red and white striped spinnaker, which billows beautifully in the wind, alongside a white mainsail hoisted behind it. This boat appears to be slightly larger and hosts approximately five crew members. They are scattered around the deck, each performing different activities to manage the sails and steer the boat.\n\nBoth sailboats are sleek and well-kept, typical of cruising or racing yachts. The water appears calm except for the ripples caused by the wind and the movement of the boats themselves. The overall background is simple, featuring the deep blue water that fills the frame, highlighting the isolation and tranquility of the sailing experience.\n\nThis photograph not only captures a beautiful outdoor maritime scene but also conveys a sense of teamwork, skill, and enjoyment associated with the sport of sailing.","title":"Sailboats on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548526","549421","548513","548510","549425","549423","548498","549406","549424","549386","549403","544669","544667","548506","549394","543941"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sailboat","boat","crew","member","sail","wind","racing","yacht","cruise"]}
