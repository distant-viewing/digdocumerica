{"path":"544929.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river landscape set against a dramatic rocky desert backdrop. The perspective is framed by a large, shadowed rock surface on the right which curves towards the top of the image, partially enclosing the scene. The river, reflecting shimmering tones of blue and brown under the influence of sunlight and shadows, occupies the lower part of the frame and leads the viewer's eye towards the background.\n\nOn the left side and in the distance, layered red sandstone cliffs soar under a clear blue sky. These cliffs are stratified, showcasing various geological formations typical of a canyon environment. The textures of the rocks appear rough and are marked by erosion over time. A small sandy riverbank can be seen on the left, lined sparsely with green vegetation which provides a slight contrast to the predominantly earthen tones.\n\nThe overall composition balances the cool, dark areas within the rock shelter on the right with the warm, sunlit cliffs and blue sky, creating a natural and peaceful setting. The image captures the essence of a secluded, tranquil river flowing through a rugged desert landscape, emphasizing the contrast between shadow and light, and the interplay of natural elements.","title":"Escalante river and canyon","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["545301","543793","544863","545632","543977","543789","545633","544749","545629","545640","545787","548933","543647","545798","544393","545794"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["cliff","rock","desert","river","soar","sandstone","shadow","canyon","shelter","influence"]}
