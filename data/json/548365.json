{"path":"548365.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic view of a cityscape shrouded in atmospheric haze. The city is likely a large metropolitan area, viewed from an elevated or aerial perspective. The atmosphere overlays the city in shades of gray and muted colors, suggesting either an early morning or inclement weather scenario where fog or pollution limits visibility.\n\nIn the foreground is a river, bending around the city and crossed by a bridge, indicating the geography is dominated by water. Several buildings are discernible along the bend of the river, and the density of development increases towards the center of the image.\n\nOn the left side of the river, a cluster of high-rise buildings stands out, with one particularly prominent building rising above the rest, possibly indicating a financial or downtown district. The central and right parts of the image display a somewhat less dense collection of buildings, yet still show numerous high-rises that fade into the haze, creating layers of urban development that recede into the background.\n\nThe overall composition and exposure of the photograph create a moody and somewhat somber impression of the city. The image captures the urban expanse and its interaction with natural elements and weather conditions, emphasizing the vastness and dense construction of the urban environment.","title":"East river and Manhattan skyline in heavy smog","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548416","548384","548339","548334","548380","548317","551141","549970","548385","548407","550186","552394","549620","548378","557273","548390"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","rise","bend","haze","inclement","river","geography","development","increase","overlay"]}
