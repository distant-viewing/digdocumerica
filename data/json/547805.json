{"path":"547805.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage, somewhat cluttered store setting with various items visible that suggest it might be a general store or a market. The view is taken from outside looking in through the store's window, providing a glimpse into its interior as well as reflecting some exterior elements.\n\nIn the foreground on the left, there is a yellow crate labeled \"Dr Pepper\" filled with empty soda bottles. Stacked beneath it are more soda crates from different brands like \"Big Red\" and \"7UP,\" suggesting a variety of beverage options offered at the store. Just behind this stack, part of a wooden counter or shelving unit can be seen.\n\nCentered in the photograph inside the store is an elderly woman sitting with her back to the window, focused on what seems to be a magazine or a small book. She wears a striped outfit with a white headscarf, indicating a casual, possibly warm setting. Her seating area is quite congested with various products and items around her, giving a feeling of a cramped space densely packed with goods.\n\nTo the right of the woman, there is another makeshift display area consisting of a wooden stand holding what appear to be cardboard boxes and miscellaneous items. On the very right, a part of a large appliance or machinery with a large cylindrical component is visible, adding to the eclectic assortment of items in the store.\n\nThe interior walls of the store are simple and utilitarian, finished in plain wood paneling, and the window through which the image is taken shows reflections of the street outside, hinting at a quiet, rural or small-town setting. There is also a partially visible yellow curtain or banner inside with reversed writing, suggesting it might say \"CAFE\" from the outside.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a scene from a bygone era, possibly in a rural American town, showing a snapshot of daily life in a local general store. The ambiance feels nostalgic with a touch of disarray, illustrating a store that served multiple purposes for its community.","title":"Grocery store proprietor dozes on a quiet afternoon","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["558281","555377","554037","557763","556369","554866","552518","557679","556368","557686","554036","546216","556207","556214","555640","550132"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["store","soda","crate","item","town","shelving","appliance","window","outside","magazine"]}
