{"path":"546705.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a sprawling industrial landscape alongside a river. Prominent in the scene are multiple facilities emitting smoke and steam, suggesting heavy industrial activity. In the foreground is a large factory complex with several tall smokestacks, an adjacent parking lot, and open green spaces around the buildings. The river bends through the center of the image, with bridges connecting different parts of the city.\n\nThe opposite bank of the river showcases a densely built-up area with residential and commercial structures and some green patches interspersed amongst them. In the background, the landscape continues with similar urban development, stretching into a misty horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a blend of industrial and urban environments coexisting by the river, dominated by the industrial foreground and framed by natural and built elements in the background. The haze and muted colors give a slight sense of pollution or overcast weather, contributing to a somber tone in the photograph.","title":"Anacostia River looking south","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["557295","551192","551156","547696","551567","551174","551173","550860","557376","550855","548340","551191","552187","552246","557225","549968"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","steam","lot","smokestack","haze","complex","factory","parking","bank","pollution"]}
