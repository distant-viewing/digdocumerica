{"path":"555725.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and picturesque view of a city skyline through the silhouette of a large bridge. The bridge, which dominates the foreground, features intricate details including numerous rivets and the sweep of its arch. The silhouette of the bridge frames the cityscape in the background, contributing to a contrasted and compelling composition.\n\nThe city skyline displayed through the bridge is composed of various skyscrapers, including distinctive tall rectangular buildings and other varied architectural designs, showing a mix of possibly modern and older styles. The buildings are backlit by the soft hues of either dawn or dusk, providing a serene ambience and emphasizing their outlines against the light sky.\n\nThe water in the foreground reflects some light, suggesting the time of day to be either early morning or late evening, where the light is dim but clear. This lighting casts gentle reflections on the water and subtly illuminates parts of the buildings.\n\nOverall, the composition artfully uses the natural framing of the bridge to present the cityscape, creating a sense of depth and scale, while drawing attention to the interplay of light, shadow, and urban architectural forms.","title":"Photograph of the Brooklyn bridge across the east river","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555937","548339","555751","546865","548317","549490","557274","548384","544722","548383","544671","542804","552715","546203","549547","548416"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","cityscape","skyline","rivet","sweep","silhouette","backlit","designs","city","ambience"]}
