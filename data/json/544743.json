{"path":"544743.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of six people engaged in an activity outdoors, gathered around a tree stump on a sunny day. The group is diverse, consisting of men and women, likely in a forest or a park given the tree background. Most of them are focused intently on something atop the stump, which isn't visible in the photo. Their expressions and posture suggest curiosity or concentration on the activity at hand.\n\nTwo women in the foreground wear bandanas, one red and one black, with their hair falling over their shoulders. Another woman has long brown hair and glasses, dressed in what appears to be a blue jacket, and she is leaning over the stump. The clothing style indicates a casual outdoor setting, with everyone dressed comfortably. They wear jackets and layered clothing, implying that the weather might be cool.\n\nThe people are close to one another, fostering a sense of teamwork or collaborative effort. The background is softly blurred but shows tall trees and a clear blue sky, indicating a lush, natural environment that adds to the tranquility and seclusion from urban settings. The scene conveys a feeling of exploration or educational activity, perhaps involving nature or wildlife studies, evidenced by their engagement and location.","title":"Girls from the balarat center for environmental studies on a trail hike","placename":"Boulder (Colo.)","location":"Boulder, Colorado","nn1":["545308","557005","554665","544003","552944","554670","557007","545311","554666","554667","543441","554510","553359","543234","543440","554899"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["stump","woman","foster","bandana","clothing","jacket","hair","teamwork","black","seclusion"]}
