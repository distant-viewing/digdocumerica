{"path":"553070.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a serene river scene shimmering under bright sunlight. In the foreground, leafy branches faintly outline the upper edges, suggesting dense vegetation along the riverbank. The river itself is covered with reflective sparkles, likely due to the sunlight hitting the water's surface. The central and standout feature of the image is a solitary figure positioned in the middle distance on a rock in the river. The figure appears to be focused on a task, possibly fishing, as they are seated and slightly leaning forward towards the water, holding what could be a fishing rod.\n\nThe backdrop shows the opposite shore of the river, predominantly shaded and dimmer compared to the bright, shimmering water. The whole composition exudes a calm, tranquil atmosphere, emphasizing solitude and the interplay of light on water. The contrasting dark silhouette of the figure against the sparkling light reflections enhances the visual interest of the scene.","title":"Silhouette of fisherman on Kings River.
