{"path":"542598.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged landscape following a significant forest fire. The scene predominantly shows a hill with a steep rocky incline, topped with a sparse growth of pine trees against an overcast or hazy sky.\n\nIn the foreground, the aftermath of the fire is evident with charred tree remains scattered across the ground. The slope of the hill is covered in scorched earth and blackened tree trunks, many of which have fallen and lie horizontally, pointing towards the base of the hill.\n\nIn stark contrast, the lower foreground of the image displays a patch of dense greenery, untouched by the fire. This area provides a sharp visual division between the devastated land and the natural resilience of the undamaged forest below.\n\nThe composition of the photograph and the elevation from which it was taken give a comprehensive view of the fire's impact on this area, highlighting both the destruction and the remaining signs of life. This image serves as a poignant reminder of the natural and recurring phenomena of forest fires and their effect on landscapes.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["542600","542819","553626","555202","555113","555088","553561","555159","553571","553565","555089","553583","553572","548591","555157","553560"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["fire","forest","hill","phenomenon","incline","reminder","division","destruction","aftermath","elevation"]}
