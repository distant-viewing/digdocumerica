{"path":"542513.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a large industrial site likely involved in mining or resource extraction. The landscape is dominated by earthy tones, mostly shades of brown and orange, indicative of soil disruption and barren terrain typical of such industrial operations.\n\nKey features in the photograph include:\n- Several large rectangular and irregular-shaped open pits are visible, some filled with water, creating stark black voids in the otherwise dusty and arid landscape.\n- A network of winding dirt roads crisscrosses the area, connecting different parts of the site. These appear heavily trafficked as indicated by their pronounced paths cutting through the terrain.\n- Buildings and mobile structures, possibly offices, housing, and machinery storage facilities are clustered in different parts of the site. These structures are relatively small and vary in shape.\n- Storage tanks and possibly processing facilities can also be seen. A group of what appears to be circular tanks suggests storage or mixing of liquid materials, potentially chemicals used in the extraction process.\n- The site is extensive, with no visible vegetation, highlighting its industrial nature and the environmental impact of the activities.\n\nOverall, this image provides a detailed view of an expansive, operatively complex industrial mining facility, characterized by excavation pits, infrastructure for processing and storage, and a network of access roads, situated in a harsh, landscaped environment devoid of natural vegetation.","title":"Oil industrial site","placename":"Bakersfield (Calif.)","location":"Bakersfield, California","nn1":["543669","543758","550572","544781","551611","549174","550568","554765","543674","552004","543861","549168","544100","549148","554764","554163"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["storage","site","pit","extraction","network","facility","mining","tank","disruption","housing"]}
