{"path":"556445.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat somber scene of an outdoor environment, primarily illustrating the aftermath of what appears to be a landslide or similar natural disaster. A single muddy road curves gently from the foreground towards the middle of the image, bordered by debris and fallen trees. Evidence of recent disruption of the landscape is visible throughout the area with uprooted and broken trees scattered on either side of the path.\n\nIn the foreground, a man stands on the road, holding an object that looks like a clipboard or a book, suggesting he might be surveying, conducting research, or overseeing cleanup operations. He is dressed in a casual brown jacket and dark pants, focused on the document in his hands. He seems to be middle-aged and wears a serious expression that matches the gravity of the scene.\n\nThe background features rolling hills densely packed with trees, though the immediate surroundings along the road are muddled with a mixture of soil, rocks, and timber. Some patches of greenery on the hill hint at early spring or late fall, as the foliage is not very dense. Additionally, there are a few distant figures and mechanical equipment, possibly involved in clearing the debris or further assessment of the area.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by the image is a mix of calm and distress, underscored by the natural beauty of the region juxtaposed with the chaos resulting from the environmental disturbance. The image captures the resilience and immediate response to natural calamities, as well as the impact these events have on the landscape and local communities.","title":"Doren Bishop, superintendent for Robin Mines owned by the Alma Coal Corporation near Clothier and Madison, West Virginia, stands on the road which was made for the new mine that is being opened. It is an example of how mining changes the landscape. Sometimes changes such as this result in erosion and force families to move their homes.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555199","554548","555872","545264","554437","555089","545254","544466","555209","557993","549119","555136","547527","553639","555207","542863"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["assessment","gravity","fall","uproot","landslide","survey","distress","road","clipboard","response"]}
