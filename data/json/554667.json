{"path":"554667.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a group of people at an outdoor gathering, likely in a forest setting based on the surrounding dense trees and foliage displaying autumn colors. The focal point is a rustic log cabin with a low, sloping roof in the left background. Several backpacks are propped against the cabin, indicating that the group is possibly engaged in hiking or a camping trip.\n\nThere are around nine individuals in the image, comprising both adults and young children, all casually dressed suitable for outdoor activities. The adults appear to be engaging in casual conversation and activities. For instance, one man in the front is gesturing with his hands perhaps explaining or narrating something to another who is attentively listening. A woman and a few others are grouped near the doorway of the cabin, possibly organizing or fetching something. The overall mood is relaxed and social, with people variously occupied in light interactions or tasks.\n\nThe background is richly wooded, underlining a deep forest environment. Small details like a hanging metal lantern on the cabin and the naturalistic colors enhance the rustic, outdoor theme of the photograph.","title":"Hikers from the adirondack mountain club rest at a leanto on their way up yard mountain","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["543234","554670","557029","554510","554671","557005","542732","557777","554666","558066","554662","557985","557206","557028","554665","557943"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["cabin","group","adult","instance","lantern","prop","hiking","forest","explain","slop"]}
