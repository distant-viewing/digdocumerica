{"path":"549953.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a landfill or dumpsite, vividly illustrating the intense activity and environmental impact typical of such locations. The foreground is dominated by a broad, dirt-covered area with tracks from heavy machinery. In the scene, multiple vehicles are visible, including a heavy dumping truck in motion, spewing a cloud of dust as it deposits waste. Several other construction and waste management vehicles, such as bulldozers and trucks, are parked or operating throughout the area, contributing to the site management and organization of the debris.\n\nA significant number of birds, likely seagulls, are scattered throughout the air, drawn to the site by the waste. These birds are in various states of flight, creating a dynamic and somewhat chaotic element within the photograph. They add a sense of movement and life amidst the otherwise inanimate and mechanical environment.\n\nThe background is less distinct but appears to be a line of trees that may mark the boundary of the landfill area. The overall atmosphere is dusty and hazy, likely due to the dirt and debris being moved and unsettled by the vehicles. The color tones are muted, dominated by earthy browns and grays, punctuated by the white and gray of the birds. This setting underscores themes of environmental impact, waste management, and the interaction between wildlife and human-modified landscapes.","title":"Dump trucks, earthmovers and seagulls at the croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549754","549737","549745","549741","549753","549946","543828","549936","549748","549943","548210","546235","546231","546246","546238","547975"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","bird","management","truck","dumpsite","modify","vehicle","gray","dumping","dirt"]}
