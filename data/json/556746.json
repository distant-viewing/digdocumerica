{"path":"556746.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy bus station scene under clear skies. On the left, the front of a bus is visible with its door open, though the bus's body is mostly cropped out of the frame. Just beside it, in the center of the image, there's another bus marked with the words \"Dial-A-Ride\" and a phone number beneath on its front display. This bus, along with others extending into the background, are aligned along the bus station platform. Each bus features a red and white color scheme.\n\nIn the foreground and along the platform, a group of people, primarily men dressed in formal work attire like white shirts and dark pants, are conversing or busying themselves, likely waiting for their respective buses. The setting includes a concrete sidewalk and a metallic railing running along the bus docking area. In the backdrop, distant light poles and a clear blue sky are visible. The scene exudes the typical hustle of a public transport hub in what appears to be a midday setting.","title":"Bus drivers waiting by their Dial-A-Ride radio dispatched door-to-door vehicles to be dispatched for passengers in Haddonfield, New Jersey. It began in February, 1972, as a demonstration project between federal and state transportation departments. Funding ended in March, 1975. Spokesmen report it worked well in rush hour along fixed routes. But the 30-cent fare wasn't enough to cover one to three persons picked up at home in off hours.","placename":"Haddonfield (N.J.)","location":"Haddonfield, New Jersey","nn1":["556050","553796","546655","556809","556203","546592","556786","546735","546650","556806","556749","543513","549891","556762","549644","546605"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","platform","station","phone","docking","hustle","scheme","hub","midday","converse"]}
