The image shows four sailboats, each manned by one or two people. The boats feature colorful sails, with designs primarily in blue, white, and red, and one sail includes a circular emblem.\n\nThe individuals appear focused on maneuvering or stabilizing their crafts, suggesting a leisurely yet attentive boating activity. The water is calm, reflecting a gentle outdoor recreational setting.\n\nIn the background, there are modern, low-rise buildings that look like residential or possibly resort accommodations. There is minimal greenery visible, but a well-maintained grassy area and a promenade or dock can be seen adjacent to the water. The overall scenery suggests a suburban or lakeside holiday community setting.\n\nThe sky is overcast, indicating either an early morning or a cloudy day, which provides soft natural lighting to the scene, enhancing the tranquility and leisurely pace of the activities captured in the photograph.","title":"Sailing on one of the lakes in the Century Village Retirement Community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["543936","547757","552355","544021","547754","547781","543994","544669","549411","552345","548510","552316","546856","552297","543305","552353"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","accommodation","holiday","pace","emblem","craft","boat","boating","sailboat","scenery"]}
