{"path":"553629.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo depicts a winding mountain road carved through a rugged landscape. A truck, which appears to be a logging truck carrying a load of logs, is traveling along the road. The scene is deeply shaded in parts by tall trees growing on the steep, rocky terrain that flanks the road.\n\nThe road curves gracefully through the scene, marked by the natural erosion of the rocky mountainside. The shadows cast by the trees create dramatic contrasts of light and dark across the scene, emphasizing the isolation and challenging nature of the environment. The photograph captures a moment of interaction between human activities, represented by the truck and the road, and the natural world of the densely wooded and craggy mountains.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. Truck with salvaged timber leaves burn site for trip to Standard. Crews are in race against fall snows, which bring a virtual halt to logging in the area.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553630","553627","555154","542858","542780","556429","555653","545930","548099","548100","542606","550600","556579","542836","542855","553785"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["road","truck","mountainside","load","mountain","world","erosion","curve","log","isolation"]}
