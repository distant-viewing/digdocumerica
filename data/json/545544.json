{"path":"545544.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph displays a large industrial crane with a massive grabber claw holding a bundle of crushed, distorted scrap metal. The scene is set against a clear blue sky.\n\nThe crane, primarily visible in the upper part of the frame, features heavy-duty mechanical components, including chains, bolts, and sturdy beams supporting the equipment. The grabber claw, which occupies the majority of the image, has an articulated, multi-segmented structure that allows it to grip large volumes of material. The metal pieces within the claw's grasp appear heavily rusted and vary in shape, suggesting they might be remains of automobiles or other large metal structures.\n\nThe components of the claw exhibit signs of wear and tear, such as scratches, rust, and dents, indicative of frequent use in harsh conditions. The overall composition emphasizes industrial strength and the role of heavy machinery in handling and recycling materials within an industrial or construction setting.","title":"Crane about to drop skeleton of car into autoMobile graveyard in industrial section of city.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["548324","546253","548110","547615","546260","547610","553012","549800","550874","554318","544157","546267","545655","547621","555593","547223"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["claw","component","crane","metal","distort","dent","grasp","bundle","bolt","strength"]}
