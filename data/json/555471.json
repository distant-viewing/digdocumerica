{"path":"555471.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a classic oil lamp positioned against a sunset backdrop. The lamp, with a vibrant red base and a clear glass chimney, is silhouetted prominently against the setting sun, which provides a luminescent glow visible through the transparent glass. The intensity of the sunlight glimpsing through the lamp's chimney creates a visual fusion of light at its flame area, artistically blurring the line between the artificial light of the lamp and the natural twilight.\n\nThe lamp is positioned on what appears to be a sandy surface, suggesting a beach setting. The sand around the base of the lamp glistens with specks of mica or similar reflective particles, catching the fading light. The background is minimally detailed but reveals a calm ocean and a clear sky, transitioning in hues from gentle orange near the horizon to a darker blue above, indicative of a sunset scene.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the lamp centrally placed, utilizes back-lighting from the sun, which enhances the contours and color of the lamp while also highlighting the concept of natural versus man-made light. The overall mood is serene and contemplative, with an emphasis on simplicity and the beauty of the natural environment intertwined with a human element.","title":"The setting sun and glass lantern, symbols of solar energy and manmade lighting, along the Oregon coast near Lincoln City during the energy crisis of 1973-74","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555429","555441","555440","555428","544707","543144","549106","548123","547479","542796","549847","550288","557447","548851","545418","543146"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lamp","chimney","base","sunset","concept","sun","flame","glass","particle","speck"]}
