{"path":"553414.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river scene. It depicts a river flowing powerfully through a natural landscape, with turbulent, foamy water covering the majority of the image. The river is surrounded by lush greenery on both sides, suggesting a secluded or forested location.\n\nOn the bottom left side of the image, three individuals are standing on rocky terrain at the edge of the river. The first person, nearest to the camera, appears to be wearing a light-colored top and dark pants. The second person, standing slightly behind, is dressed in a red jacket and dark pants, while the third person also has dark attire. The people seem to be engaged in observing the river, possibly indicating a moment of leisure or a nature exploration scenario.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of adventure and natural beauty, while the fast-moving water adds a dynamic element to the scene. The overcast or subdued lighting suggests that the photograph may have been taken on a cloudy day, enhancing the moodiness and intensity of the river's flow.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River. The Nashua Conservation Commission envisions it as a nature preserve, with facilities for hiking, picnicking, bicycling and eventually swimming once the heavily polluted river is cleaned up.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["553413","542743","550658","549550","550742","550698","553416","545684","549442","553855","553653","549447","550367","552061","544856","549532"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","person","pant","majority","intensity","scenario","adventure","exploration","flow","bottom"]}
