{"path":"548241.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph features a scenic, tranquil seascape under a dramatically cloudy sky at dusk or dawn. In the foreground, the glistening surface of the water reflects the muted light from the sky, creating a shimmery effect on the waves. The coastline in the background is adorned with sparse vegetation and a few scattered buildings that appear small and rustic. Notable are a house and what may be a shed or similar small structure, all subdued in silhouette against the dim sky. There is a prominent bird in mid-flight, captured at the center of the image, which adds a dynamic element to the serene setting. The overall mood of the photograph is quiet and reflective, emphasized by the soft, dusky hues and the calm expanse of water.","title":"Tip of rockport harbor and storm clouds gathering","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["547057","557508","545000","547483","543025","542808","547044","545030","553989","547147","547638","555713","543060","542993","545019","543091"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["glistening","seascape","scenic","shed","dim","coastline","scattered","bird","dawn","subdue"]}
