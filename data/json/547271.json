{"path":"547271.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts a lively square dance scene. The photograph captures several couples, each consisting of men and women, engaging in traditional square dancing in what appears to be a large indoor space with a dark, possibly wooden floor. The dancers, probably from a mid-20th century setting given the style of clothing, are in various dynamic poses typical of square dancing.\n\nThe women wear vibrant, flared dresses with puffed sleeves and wide skirts that float elegantly as they move. These dresses are adorned with various patterns including checks and florals, predominantly in shades of red, blue, pink, and white. The men are dressed more uniformly in light-colored short-sleeved shirts and dark pants, lending a casual but neat appearance to the ensemble.\n\nThe atmosphere looks joyous and active, with some dancers captured in mid-spin or holding hands in dance figures, contributing to an overall sense of movement and festivity. The lighting in the room casts a warm tone over the scene, enhancing the inviting and animated environment of the dance floor. The background, though dim and less detailed, focuses attention on the brightly dressed dancers, creating a lively and engaging composition.","title":"Couples take their places in the 33rd annual square dance festival, held in the Pershing Auditorium.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547383","547403","547334","558286","547317","558284","547386","547387","558285","547371","557790","547274","553232","553241","556288","551710"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Groups Of People"],"terms":["dancer","dance","dancing","dress","floor","ensemble","festivity","check","skirt","woman"]}
