{"path":"545102.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a scene involving a group of people engaged in a recreational activity in a rugged, outdoor setting. The primary focus is on a large open-topped, four-wheeled drive vehicle that is maneuvering on a steep sandy dune. The vehicle, possibly a safari or tour type, holds several individuals. There are four visible people seated in the vehicle, showing casual postures suggestive of a leisurely outing, perhaps part of a desert exploration or adventure tour.\n\nThe dune itself appears expansive, with soft curves and a textured surface marked by tracks from previous passes of the vehicle, indicating that this area is used for similar activities. The background is a clear blue sky without clouds, highlighting the isolation and open environment of the setting. There's a general sense of movement and excitement due to the angle of the vehicle ascending the dune, which communicates the adventurous nature of the activity.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a sense of adventure and exploration within a vast, sandy landscape under a clear sky, combining elements of human activity with the natural environment. The framing and perspective focus on the journey of the vehicle up the dune, suggesting a moment captured during a dynamic outdoor experience.","title":"Dune buggy in national recreation park","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["551969","545094","545098","545596","553058","543211","553056","544038","545199","543370","548986","543207","549037","544869","543208","545594"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["dune","vehicle","tour","adventure","exploration","drive","excitement","journey","outing","experience"]}
