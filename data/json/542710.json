{"path":"542710.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of an agricultural area featuring neatly arranged rows of crops in what appears to be an arid landscape. The aerial perspective gives a clear view of the cultivated patterns, which are arranged in parallel lines. These rows of crops form textures and patterns reminiscent of barcodes from this height.\n\nIn the composition, there is a prominent curving line, possibly a dirt road, that snakes through the fields, providing access to different sections of the farm. The surrounding topography is mostly flat, and the fields are segmented by boundaries which could be either paths, small dirt roads, or irrigation channels.\n\nOn the left side of the image, alongside the fields, runs a paved road, indicated by its darker and smoother texture compared to the roads within the agricultural field itself. The overall color palette is a mix of the dark browns of the soil and the muted green of the crops, suggesting this photo was taken in a region with limited vegetative diversity and possibly limited water supply.\n\nThe systematic layout and the scale of the farming suggest that this is a commercial agricultural operation possibly focused on the cultivation of a single type of crop. The landscape does not feature any buildings or visible farm machinery, emphasizing the vastness and the sole focus on crop production.","title":"Two irrigation canals serving citrus ranches","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["548907","553047","548908","554053","554029","549098","558414","548905","549253","553977","548901","542714","548817","553696","542708","549094"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["crop","field","road","farm","row","irrigation","dirt","snake","cultivation","supply"]}
