{"path":"545328.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a striking outdoor scene involving a classic car and a flashy children's bicycle. On the left side of the image, a unique, brightly colored bicycle is prominently displayed. It features a gleaming, metallic frame with colors of chrome, orange, and red, accessorized with an unusual banana seat wrapped in a leather-looking material and embellished with a pair of long, green tassels hanging from the handlebars.\n\nParked adjacent to the bike is a vintage white car, identified by its emblem as a \"Fairlane 500.\" The car's design is reflective of mid-20th-century American automotive style, featuring distinct body lines, chrome detailing, and large rear tail lights. There is a person seated in the driver’s seat, partially visible through the open driver’s side window, and engaging with someone or something just outside the frame on the left, likely the bicycle's rider or owner.\n\nThe setting appears to be a street or a paved lot, as indicated by the concrete with visible lines denoting parking spaces. The lighting suggests it could be either late afternoon or early evening, casting shadows and highlighting the reflective surfaces of the bicycle and car, enhancing their visual appeal and creating a nostalgic atmosphere. The focus and composition of the photograph draw attention to the interplay between the timeless elegance of the car and the playful, ornate design of the children's bicycle, juxtaposing two different modes and eras of transportation.","title":"El Paso's second ward, a Chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["555922","545321","551464","553488","557874","551119","552412","557692","557878","543947","546230","552995","544432","547797","557052","542640"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["bicycle","car","chrome","seat","driver","mode","owner","handlebar","child","elegance"]}
