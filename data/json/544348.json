{"path":"544348.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape featuring a majestic waterfall. The waterfall cascades down from a considerable height into a serene, circular pool below. This azure pool contrasts beautifully with the surrounding rugged terrain.\n\nThe scene is bordered by towering, layered cliffs with varying shades of red and brown, typical of sedimentary rock formations. The textures of these cliffs are rough and jagged, indicative of natural erosion processes. Above the cliffs, there is a clear blue sky with a few scattered clouds, adding a sense of depth and expansiveness to the composition.\n\nVegetation, like shrubs and trees, is visible around the edges of the pool and along the cliff sides, introducing green hues into the predominantly earth-toned palette. This vegetation suggests a relatively moist microclimate around the water area, likely supporting diverse wildlife.\n\nThis idyllic and serene natural setting seems remote and untouched, offering a snapshot of nature's beauty and tranquility. The photograph's composition, with its viewpoint looking down onto the waterfall and pool from a rocky ledge, gives the observer a sense of observing a hidden gem within a vast wilderness.","title":"Havasu falls","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544344","544350","544346","544456","542698","544335","542699","548021","542594","553068","557820","555073","554409","558087","550979","550697"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["pool","cliff","waterfall","expansiveness","observer","cascade","ton","ledge","introduce","shrubs"]}
