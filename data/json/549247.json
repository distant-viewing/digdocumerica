{"path":"549247.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic rural area, likely on a sunny day, capturing three individuals walking along a dirt road. The road, framed by rustic wooden fences on either side, stretches forward into the distance, gently curving to the left. The landscape is predominantly covered in grass, punctuated by the fences and a few sparse trees, leading to rolling hills in the background under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe people in the image, appearing relaxed and casual, are walking away from the viewpoint. They seem to be in casual attire suitable for a walk in the countryside, contributing to the tranquil and leisurely atmosphere of the scene. The setting suggests an expansive, open space, possibly a ranch or a protected natural area, emphasizing a sense of openness and calmness. The composition of the image, with its perspective lines leading toward the hills and the natural framing of the road and fences, draws the viewer's eye into the depth of the landscape, enhancing the peaceful and picturesque quality of the photograph.","title":"The bud redding ranch in sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["546783","558097","557659","549235","547300","557087","549261","549236","547354","555821","549257","549182","555818","553464","543044","547316"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["fence","walk","road","ranch","countryside","lead","openness","calmness","hill","framing"]}
