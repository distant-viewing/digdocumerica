{"path":"544514.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a butterfly, likely a type of hairstreak butterfly, perched on a flower. The butterfly is primarily visible from the side and back, showcasing its complex wing patterns which include various shades of brown and white with distinctive white and dark brown bands and spots along the borders. The wings are slightly closed, revealing the underside pattern intricacies.\n\nThe butterfly's head is visible with antennae extended forward, which have white bands on a dark background, appearing slightly fuzzy. Its eyes are not distinctly visible from this angle. The proboscis can be seen delicately reaching into the flower, presumably to drink nectar.\n\nThe flower on which the butterfly is perched is partially visible, appearing somewhat wilted or past its peak bloom. It has cream petals that are slightly curled or frayed at the edges, and its central part seems aged and populated with brown structures, likely the stamens and pistils, typical of a flowering plant in the late stages of its bloom cycle.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred with varying shades of green, suggesting foliage or a natural, grassy habitat typical of butterfly environments. This blurring effect places the entire focus sharply on the butterfly and the immediate area of the flower, highlighting the intricate details of the butterfly and the textures of the plant. The lighting is natural, enhancing the color accuracy and depth of the fine details in the butterfly's wing patterns and body features.","title":"Butterfly and wild flower near TaMiami Trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544517","544553","544479","544619","543603","544603","544618","551381","544566","544614","547818","554839","548284","557585","548283","555064"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","flower","band","bloom","pattern","antennae","underside","stamen","intricacy"]}
