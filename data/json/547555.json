{"path":"547555.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene fishing scene at dusk, showcasing a softly illuminated body of water that reflects the hues of the twilight sky. The image features three primary elements: the water, the boats, and the fishermen.\n\nIn the foreground, a small rowboat is occupied by two figures managing their fishing nets. One person is standing, possibly pulling in a net, while the other is sitting and watching, suggesting a collaborative effort in their fishing activities. The boat appears filled with equipment essential for their task.\n\nTo the left, a larger boat, which seems to be a fishing trawler, is moored nearby. It is silhouetted against the water, enhancing the sense of early morning or late evening work being typical in the fishing industry. The trawler has a cabin and a visible hull, indicating it might be used for more extensive fishing operations or as a storage and transport vessel for the catch.\n\nIn the background, the water extends to the horizon under a fading sky, with hints of distant shoreline barely visible. The calmness of the water suggests minimal wind, ideal for fishing activities. The sky, transitioning from blue to gradients of pink and purple, adds a peaceful and almost melancholic atmosphere to the scene.\n\nLines of buoys float on the water surface, possibly marking the locations of nets or other equipment, leading from the trawler into the distance, which helps in emphasizing the expanse of the fishing area being worked upon.\n\nThe scene is captured with a focus on the interaction between the fishermen and their environment, symbolizing a moment of daily life and the relationship between humans and nature in the context of sustenance and livelihood.","title":"Fishing dories close in on trap nets they have set at the mouth of the Sakonnet River.","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["552313","552308","547549","545055","552309","554147","551572","552124","546980","547553","552123","547556","543753","545054","549933","546939"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","net","fisherman","boat","water","rowboat","buoy","relationship","symbolize","equipment"]}
