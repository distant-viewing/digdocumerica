{"path":"546432.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph shows an exterior view of the Irwin Union Bank building. In the foreground, there is a body of water, possibly a decorative pond or canal, reflecting parts of the scenery. A low wall with the inscription \"IRWIN UNION BANK\" in capital red letters is clearly visible across the water from the viewer's perspective, emphasizing the bank's name.\n\nBehind the inscribed wall, a row of parked cars is visible. Among these, two particularly distinguishable cars are a light-colored sedan and a darker-colored coupe, both reflecting the automotive design styles likely from the 1960s or 1970s. The cars are parked on a street that runs along the bank.\n\nThe architectural style of the bank building features modernist influences with a linear design and large, evenly spaced windows. The windows show reflections and feature vertical blinds. The facade appears to be made of a light-colored brick or stone, giving the building a sturdy and formal appearance.\n\nThe environment around the bank includes well-manicured green grass, contributing to a polished and professional setting for the bank. The overall composition and elements of the scene encapsulate a typical mid-20th-century American business district atmosphere.","title":"Cars line up outside drive-in teller windows.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["558124","545376","547997","546448","546447","558125","556046","556766","546502","546440","557156","548866","546702","555908","550024","550105"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["bank","inscribe","blind","coupe","car","inscription","capital","wall","canal","manicure"]}
