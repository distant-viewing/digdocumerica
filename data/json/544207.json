{"path":"544207.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a young child standing on a wooden ladder attached to an old, rustic waterfront shack. The shack is predominantly blue, showing signs of weathering and age, with some wood panels missing or damaged. A set of faded clothes is strung on a line nearby, probably drying in the sun.\n\nThe child, appearing cheerful and playful, is captured in mid-action, possibly climbing down or playfully halting on the ladder. This child has curly blond hair and wears a dark sleeveless top paired with striped shorts. The child's bare feet hint at a laid-back, possibly summer setting.\n\nThe water beneath the structure provides a reflection of the bright, sunlit day, suggesting a peaceful yet isolated environment. The overall scene evokes a sense of simplicity and bygone rural life, possibly near a lake or river. The photograph, with its vivid colors and textures, creates a strong sense of place and moment, emphasizing a snapshot of everyday life in a unique setting.","title":"Fisherman's son at Goose Point","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544203","552960","547727","543791","548837","548965","543688","549105","545539","544200","552940","550241","556166","544380","543496","543468"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["shack","child","ladder","string","climb","miss","foot","weathering","dry","lay"]}
