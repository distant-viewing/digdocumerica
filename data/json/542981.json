{"path":"542981.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and unique image using a reflective surface, likely water, to create a visual illusion. The reflection exhibits a fluid, almost painterly texture that resembles swirling clouds in a stormy sky. The predominant colors in the reflection are shades of blue and purple with specks of white that could be interpreted as stars or specks of debris on the water's surface.\n\nThe reflection also includes the silhouette of a human figure standing behind a fence, possibly observed from a bridge or similar structure looking down into the water. The figure appears centered in the composition and is blurred, adding a sense of mystery and anonymity.\n\nThe lighting and color tones in the image suggest it could be taken during the twilight hours, giving the photograph a serene yet slightly eerie atmosphere. This photograph combines natural and human elements to create a compelling, dreamlike scene that invites interpretation and emphasizes the beauty and complexity of reflections.","title":"Sewage treatment","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552237","554919","548972","550652","544725","550237","555804","557572","544693","543611","549445","550389","549446","545213","549007","548978"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["reflection","speck","anonymity","interpretation","fluid","interpret","figure","star","mystery","swirl"]}
