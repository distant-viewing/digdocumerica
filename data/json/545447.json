{"path":"545447.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial setting, tinted with a dark, somewhat eerie atmosphere. The image shows large factory structures filled with complex networks of pipes, chimneys, and bulky machinery, some of which are obscured by a large plume of dense, dark smoke rising into the sky. The smoke is thick enough to partially cloud the view of the structures behind it.\n\nThe prominence of the sprawling industrial buildings suggests they could be part of a steel mill, power plant, or similar heavy industrial operation, typically associated with significant emissions and environmental impact. Various chimneys and stacks are actively releasing smoke, adding to the atmospheric pollutants visible in the image.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is dark and somber, with a slightly bluish and purple tint that may suggest either the use of a filter or the effects of the pollution itself on the coloration of the environment. The sky is overcast, contributing to the grim aesthetic of the scene. In the foreground, there is a suggestion of a fence or barrier, hinting that the photo was taken at some distance from the industrial site, perhaps from a public viewpoint or an adjacent road.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a strong industrial feel and could be referring to themes such as environmental degradation, pollution, and the stark reality of industrial landscapes.","title":"Smoke from industrial plants is a 24 hour fact of life in Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["546884","550181","550172","550982","550328","557218","551054","545239","550176","550981","550195","546908","550983","542999","557214","557225"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["tint","smoke","chimney","suggestion","pollution","refer","pollutant","prominence","reality","release"]}
