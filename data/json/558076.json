{"path":"558076.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an intriguing close-up view of a natural outdoor scene, likely within a forest or wooded area. The primary focus is on a cluster of white and pale bluish-gray fungi, which appear to be a variety of coral fungi, growing amongst dark soil and green plant material. The fungi have a characteristic branching or coral-like structure, lending texture and interest to the image.\n\nAdditionally, beads of water droplets are visible scattered across the surface of the fungi, reflecting a recent rainfall or morning dew, adding a sense of freshness and vitality to the scene. A fallen, brownish leaf, possibly from a deciduous tree, is seen in the upper left part of the frame, suggesting the autumn season or a natural forest floor environment.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph seems soft yet directional, highlighting the finesse of the water droplets and casting subtle shadows, which enhance the dimensionality and textural details of the fungi and the surrounding foliage. The background is mostly out of focus, with dark brown and green tones that suggest a densely vegetated area, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the intricate details and colors of the fungi in the foreground. There's an overall organic, damp quality to the image, likely captured in natural light under a canopy of trees.","title":"Fungus on a fallen timber in Deep Lock Quarry, part of the Akron, Ohio, Metropolitan Park System. The park is within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which was signed into law in December, 1974. The recreation area contains 30,000 acres in a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. Expenditures of $34.5 million have been authorized by law for land acquisition, but Congress has to appropriate the money.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557595","558081","557624","555179","555006","555017","554593","555181","551373","555015","555014","557620","555180","555018","557006","557612"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["droplet","vitality","freshness","dew","forest","leaf","rainfall","detail","autumn","interest"]}
