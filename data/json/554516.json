{"path":"554516.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a serene natural scene centered around a small group of people on a wooden dock by a lake. The foreground shows a bushy area with lush, green foliage bordering the edge of a calm, reflective body of water. In the middle ground, a few individuals, including both adults and a child, are visible on a rickety, narrow dock extending into the water. They appear to be engaged in leisurely activities, potentially fishing, as one person seems to be holding a fishing rod.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large, steep mountain densely covered with trees. This mountain slopes dramatically into the lake, showcasing a lush landscape likely characteristic of a temperate forested area. The sky above is a clear, deep blue, indicating a bright, sunny day without visible clouds. The overall composition and natural lighting of the photograph suggest a peaceful day spent in nature, enjoying the tranquility of the water and the grandeur of the surrounding landscape.","title":"Family fishing from dock at cascade pond near Lake Placid New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554517","543579","554552","554477","544266","543443","543816","552029","552978","543892","543547","550827","545229","543527","552982","548963"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["fishing","dock","lake","spend","mountain","rod","grandeur","water","adult","slope"]}
