{"path":"543710.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image captures a dramatic silhouette scene featuring two individuals and a Coca-Cola bottle. The photograph's lighting creates a stark contrast, emphasizing the dark outlines of the figures and the bottle against a richly colored backdrop. The background transitions from warm orange at the bottom to a darker hue at the top, which may suggest a setting sun or dim indoor lighting. To the right of the image, one silhouette appears to be holding the neck of the Coca-Cola bottle, positioned near the center of the composition. The focus on the Coca-Cola bottle, emphasized by its clearer and more lightened silhouette, seems to be a central point of interaction or activity among the figures. The overall mood is intimate and subdued, with an element of mystery introduced by the dark silhouettes and minimal visible details.","title":"Recycled beer bottles receive final inspection.
