The revealed inner wood is a rich reddish-brown color, contrasting starkly with the darker, rougher texture of the surrounding bark which is almost black and wet, suggesting recent exposure or moisture presence. The overall composition focuses on textures and the natural patterns of the tree's surface with the details sharply captured, emphasizing the organic, rugged beauty of the tree. There are no signs of human activity or manipulation visible except for the stripping of the bark, and the background is uniformly dark, highlighting the central image of the stripped bark.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora forestry experts say 90 per cent of wood of burned trees can be saved if harvested before insects can attack weakened trees burned bark of this white fir tree has been removed to show sound wood beneath","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553587","544662","554974","550703","551355","545288","554592","557616","554604","542749","545292","555141","553640","542774","557621","543488"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","reveal","wood","remove","moisture","peel","strip","texture","exposure","tree"]}
