{"path":"549869.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, likely from a past era given the style of the vehicles and the overall aesthetic. The focus is on a yellow taxi cab, centrally positioned in the frame. The cab's side door shows the fare rates and the name \"Keil Trans Corp.\" A middle-aged man, wearing glasses and a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt, sits behind the wheel of the taxi. He is arm outstretched and his hand placed relaxed on the window frame, while he gazes across to his left, providing a sense of casual observation or waiting.\n\nBeyond the primary cab, the scene includes multiple other yellow cabs, suggesting a taxi stand or heavy traffic typical of urban centers. The background features a variety of vehicles, including another taxi directly behind the central one, and a large red and white truck marked with a \"P. M.\" logo. This truck partially obstructs a man who appears to be stepping into or standing by the truck, contributing to the dynamic and diverse snapshot of urban life.\n\nThe various automotive designs indicate the photograph might be from the mid-20th century, reflected by the classic car features such as prominent tail fins and distinctive chrome detailing. The setting is cramped and busy, signaling a densely populated city environment, where the mix of commercial vehicles and cabs maneuver and coexist in close quarters. All of these elements together portray a moment capturing the rhythm and pace of city life, with a focus on the everyday work of taxi drivers and the flow of urban transport.","title":"Herald Square traffic jam","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549848","549876","554331","554330","549873","554315","549859","554310","554316","554294","548331","549862","545325","554293","549868","554329"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["taxi","cab","truck","rate","waiting","quarter","vehicle","rhythm","fin","pace"]}
