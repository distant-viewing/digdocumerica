{"path":"546547.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful indoor scene framed by a large open window or doorway. Two individuals, one with long hair and the other with shorter hair, sit at what appears to be a wooden table outside the enclosed space. They are engaged in what looks like a focused activity, possibly reading or writing, as both are leaning forward slightly towards the table. The setting suggests an academic or contemplative environment, further suggested by the presence of extra chairs around them which are standard, functional types typically found in cafeterias or informal meeting areas.\n\nOutside the window, a tranquil garden scene is visible, characterized by lush green shrubs and trees which create a quiet, serene backdrop. The flora is well-maintained and forms a natural barrier, possibly indicating this is a campus or institutional setting. The lighting is soft and natural, indicating this might be a scene from either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe composition of the photograph uses the window as a natural frame, leading the viewer's eye to the interaction of the two individuals which forms the focal point. The indoor-outdoor contrast adds a layer of depth to the image, juxtaposing the quiet indoor activity against the vibrant outdoor greenery. The simplicity and calmness of the moment are its defining characteristics, inviting contemplation on perhaps academic pursuits or a quietly shared companionship.","title":"Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548232","552114","551942","546566","543314","543041","546526","551827","558025","551337","546565","550051","552723","549471","553950","547045"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["table","campus","window","pursuit","writing","companionship","meeting","hair","characteristic","calmness"]}
