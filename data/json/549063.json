{"path":"549063.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a middle-aged man engaged in operating a large, circular valve mechanism. He is outside, under a clear blue sky, possibly working on a water irrigation system or similar infrastructure.\n\nThe man is dressed in work attire, consisting of a light blue denim shirt, dark blue jeans, and sturdy work boots. He is also wearing a green hard hat. He appears focused on his task, looking down as he manipulates the valve, which is connected to a vertical metal rod.\n\nThe setting includes a concrete structure partially filled with water, which could be a component of a canal or storage basin. This suggests the location is utilitarian, possibly related to agricultural or industrial water management. In the background, the landscape is flat and open, hinting at a rural or undeveloped location. The overall composition of the image emphasizes the man's engagement with his physical task, set against the broader context of the infrastructure he is interacting with.","title":"Vincent Humeumptewa, Hopi Indian and employee of the irrigation district, opens canal gates near Parker.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549056","543795","549053","549078","543792","552112","556315","543804","544835","543781","556865","542497","553603","555239","556903","556187"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["valve","task","irrigation","basin","infrastructure","canal","mechanism","location","work","rod"]}
