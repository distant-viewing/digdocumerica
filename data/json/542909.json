{"path":"542909.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph shows a sweeping aerial view of a lush, forested landscape with a river meandering through a deep valley. The river banks are bright, possibly sandy or covered in small rocks, creating a sharp contrast with the dark green of the dense forest. The river reflects light, appearing almost silvery or white in some areas. The topography of the area is rugged, with the forest extending over rolling hills and mountainous terrain. The overall palette of the image is dominated by natural greens and earth tones, with the winding river as the central element drawing the eye along its course. The lighting suggests that the photo was possibly taken in the morning or late afternoon, as the angle of the light enhances the textures and contours of the landscape.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550576","550622","550621","550625","542701","553452","542695","550559","550562","550542","550527","550616","542700","550581","550577","550571"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","forest","green","course","topography","meander","contour","valley","bank","wind"]}
