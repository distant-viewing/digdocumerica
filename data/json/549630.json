{"path":"549630.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a rugged, icy landscape, possibly in a polar or glacier-rich region. The image predominantly features dark, jagged rock formations that are interspersed with vivid blue waterways, suggesting these could be fjords or glacial meltwater channels. The top portion of the image shows a vast expansiveness of white, which could be a field of ice or snow, bordered by these rock formations. The contrast between the icy white expanses and the striking blue of the water creates a stark and visually compelling scene. No human activities or people are discernible in this wild and natural environment, emphasizing the remote and untouched aspect of the landscape. The overall composition beautifully captures the harsh yet majestic qualities of a possibly Arctic or sub-Arctic wilderness.","title":"Colorado River seen from the air.
