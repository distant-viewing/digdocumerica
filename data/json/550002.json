{"path":"550002.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful scene at a public water playground. There are several children of various ages engaged in different activities, primarily playing in and around water. About ten children are visible; they are clad in swimwear, enjoying the sunny day.\n\nThe setting includes a large, flat pool area with multiple levels of shallow water separated by curved, raised platforms that are painted light blue. These platforms appear to serve as steps or seating areas for the children. One child near the foreground is lifting a red rectangular floatation device, seemingly about to move it or throw it into the water. Others are standing or walking on the platforms, while one child is joyfully splashing into the water.\n\nIn the background, more children and some adults are seen. These adults are supervising the children, standing or sitting around the perimeter of the water area. Beyond the immediate activity area, there are grassy areas, trees, and standard playground equipment, suggesting this space is part of a larger park.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is vibrant and cheerful, marked by the bright sunlight, reflective water, and active children, giving a sense of movement and sound, like splashes and children's laughter. The colorful and casual scene is typical of a summer day at a community outdoor area, inviting and bustling with energy.","title":"Public playground on the Charles River, near Soldiers Field Road","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552540","551160","551638","551667","552703","552539","552706","552737","555931","552702","550227","556295","552012","553446","555891","557259"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","playground","platform","splash","water","sound","adult","laughter","swimwear","supervise"]}
