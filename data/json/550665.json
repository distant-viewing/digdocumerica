{"path":"550665.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene focused on recreational fishing in a lush, natural environment. The primary subject is a person standing on the bank of a river, engaged in fly fishing. The individual, appearing to be middle-aged and wearing casual outdoor attire, is casting a fishing line into the river. The clothing includes a dark jacket and lighter pants.\n\nThe river itself is wide and tranquil, reflecting the sunlight and flanked by thick, dense forests that suggest a remote or wilderness area. The water displays subtle ripples and flows gently, indicating a calm day. The towering trees in the background are predominantly coniferous, pointing to a boreal or temperate forest setting.\n\nAbove, the sky is mostly clear with only a few fluffy, white clouds adding contrast to the vivid blue sky, which suggests it might be a warm, pleasant day ideal for outdoor activities.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the angler positioned towards the right, allows the viewer's eye to follow the curve of the fishing line across the scene, leading to the lush greenery and vibrant sky, emphasizing a sense of calm and solitude in nature. The lighting and the saturation of colors are vibrant, highlighting the natural beauty of the setting and the peacefulness of the activity.","title":"Fishing in the Androscoggin River in the \"13-Mile Wood\" area near Errol.
