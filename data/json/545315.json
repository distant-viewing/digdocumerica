{"path":"545315.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene that features three people in an alley-like setting. The central figure is leaning against the wall of a building on the left side of the frame. He appears to be a young man with somewhat long curly hair and is dressed in a sleeveless basketball jersey and dark pants. His expression is contemplative as he gazes towards the viewer, and he is idly holding a cigarette in his right hand.\n\nBehind him, further down the alley, two other individuals can be seen. They are slightly out of focus, which increases the depth of the photo and places the emphasis on the man in the foreground. The background figure on the right wears dark clothing and stands in a relaxed pose, partially obscured by shadow, whereas the individual on the left, also in darker attire, walks away from the camera, deeper into the alley.\n\nThe alley itself is narrow with exposed brick on one side and a rough, textured wall on the other. There are scattered elements of litter and debris on the ground, suggestive of urban decay or neglect. The lighting is dramatic, with high contrast between the illuminated open space at the alleyâ€™s end and the darker, shadowed area where the subjects stand, reinforcing an atmospheric, somewhat moody aesthetic.","title":"Chicano teenager in El Paso's Second Ward, a classic \"barrio\" which is slowly giving way to urban renewal.","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552971","555909","545343","545348","545358","552969","552970","548372","545361","545331","552753","546525","552973","547821","551926","547748"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["alley","basketball","figure","cigarette","wall","litter","pose","emphasis","end","neglect"]}
