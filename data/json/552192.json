{"path":"552192.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a coastal landscape during what appears to be dusk or early morning, given the subdued lighting and deep blue tones dominating the scene. The image captures a complex interplay of natural and human-made features.\n\nIn the foreground, intricate patterns of water currents and possibly some form of slicks or pollutants are visible, creating swirling designs on the water's surface that are accentuated by the low light. These patterns suggest movement and bring a dynamic element to the lower part of the composition.\n\nMoving upwards, the image shows a large body of still water that reflects the surrounding land and sky, giving it a calm, mirror-like appearance. This body of water is interrupted by numerous jetties or docks that protrude into it, hinting at human activity such as fishing or boating.\n\nAdjacent to the water, a populated area is visible with several small buildings closely clustered together. This settlement is connected by what seem to be roads or paths, weaving through the houses and extending towards the coast. The presence of human settlement suggests this might be a small coastal town or community.\n\nThe background of the photograph features rolling hills and mountains that fade into the distance, shrouded in a light mist or fog that contributes to the image's overall moody and serene quality. \n\nThe composition of the photo, with natural phenomena in the foreground leading to human activity and then the natural landscape, creates a layered perspective that highlights the interaction between nature and human habitation. The color palette consists of deep blues, muted grays, and subtle earth tones which underscore the quiet and somewhat mysterious atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Foamy pulping waste","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554091","552922","542870","545030","554022","556923","546109","542804","543051","554102","557429","543085","545000","551610","553778","551573"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["settlement","slick","phenomenon","interrupt","pollutant","water","jetty","boating","coast","current"]}
