{"path":"552900.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and expansive natural landscape. In the foreground, a field of rounded, dark boulders occupies the lower part of the image. These stones, lichen-covered and weathered, are scattered densely across a rugged terrain that appears dry and grassy. Some green vegetation sprouts sporadically among the rocks, hinting at a hardy ecosystem adapted to sparse conditions.\n\nBeyond the rocky terrain, the scene opens onto a vast flat area that leads to a large body of water. The lake lies calm, reflecting the light of either early morning or late afternoon sun, revealing shades of blue and gray. The shore curves gently, contouring along the frame up to the middle distance where it meets a more distant landmass.\n\nThe background is dominated by a range of mountains. These mountains, under a wide sky, show various shades of brown and blue, with their rugged silhouettes adding a dramatic contrast to the relatively smooth surface of the lake in front of them. The sky above is mostly clear with a few light clouds, suggesting a serene, undisturbed environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph fosters a sense of quietude and isolation, emphasizing the raw beauty of an untouched natural landscape. The earthy tones of the rocks and mountains, combined with the cool hues of the lake and sky, create a harmonious natural palette.","title":"Looking north from the east shore of Pyramid Lake lichen-covered Boulders were once part of the beach.
