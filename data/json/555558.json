In the foreground, the main object is a tattered and dirty sack labeled \"50 LBS. NET FERROUS SULPHATE\" with additional text indicating the substance is of a lower grade than USP grade, specifying \"Ferrous Sulphate - Corroded.\" Besides the sack, several trash items are scattered around, including numerous deteriorating metal cans and smaller debris, all showing significant corrosion and damage, indicating long-term exposure to the elements.\n\nThe surrounding area is gritty and stained, with a mix of dirt, rust, and colorful chemical residues, contributing to a sense of neglect and pollution. To the side and back of the sack, there is a metal fence, suggesting that this area might be part of an industrial site or a dumping ground adjacent to facilities. The faded and worn colors enhance the atmosphere of deterioration and environmental neglect showcased in this scene. The overall mood is somber and serves as a stark reminder of the environmental impact of improper waste disposal and industrial practices.","title":"Some 270 different chemicals were housed in a pennwalt corporation storage building, when it was desTroyed june 20, 1974 authorities believe the fire was started by lightning.
