{"path":"552641.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a funeral scene in a cemetery. The focus is on a large, dark-colored coffin placed on a device used for lowering it into the grave, which is covered by a green ceremonial cloth. To the left of the coffin, there are two individuals engaged in the ceremony. One appears to be an older man wearing a hard hat and dark clothes, standing and overseeing the placement of the coffin. Beside him, a younger individual, also in dark clothes, is crouching down positioning flowers near the grave site.\n\nThe background shows a vast, open cemetery with numerous headstones, some simple and others more ornate, scattering across a green lawn. In the distance, a range of mountains under a clear sky stretches across the horizon, giving the scene a serene and majestic backdrop. The lighting suggests it might be either morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows across the landscape. Overall, the setting conveys a quiet, respectful atmosphere typical of a burial ground.","title":"Funeral at Rifle","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552639","552640","552642","546147","552643","558289","557942","555566","545322","552451","554790","550364","557184","552683","554792","552017"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","clothe","headstone","ceremony","grave","cloth","placement","lawn","device","individual"]}
