{"path":"543617.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a collection of wet, multicolored stones. The image primarily features a variety of pebbles and rocks, ranging greatly in size, shape, and color. The centerpiece appears to be a larger red rock with spots of a pale mineral embedded within it, located slightly off-center towards the right. The rocks around it include browns, grays, hints of green, yellow, and even some that are almost black. The surface of these stones exhibits a glossy finish, suggesting that they are wet, possibly indicating recent rainfall or that they are positioned near a water source. The overall impression is one of natural diversity and the beauty of geological forms, captured in rich, saturated hues that are enhanced by the presence of moisture. This tranquil yet striking assembly lends a textured and organic quality to the scene.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543150","543152","544790","543191","550726","550483","543151","550474","552546","543185","557251","545589","555182","554410","543172","549353"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","centerpiece","stone","finish","assembly","pebble","rainfall","moisture","mineral","diversity"]}
