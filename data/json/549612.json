{"path":"549612.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a man involved in a scientific or laboratory activity. He is focused on adjusting or examining a glass apparatus that seems to be part of a larger experimental setup. The man has medium-length hair and a moustache, and he wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. The apparatus includes a stand with clamps holding glass tubing and a flask, which is connected to other laboratory equipment. The setting appears to be an indoor laboratory environment, hinted by the white walls in the background and the structural elements typical of such spaces. Various small items, possibly parts of the laboratory equipment or tools, are visible on the table, suggesting a detailed and intricate experimental setup. The lighting is somewhat dim, placing emphasis on the area immediately around the equipment he is working with. The overall mood is one of concentration and meticulousness.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
