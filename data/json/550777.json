{"path":"550777.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and relatively dark twilight scene featuring a calm body of water, which appears to be a lake or pond. The water's smooth surface is reflecting the dim sky and the dark silhouettes of the surrounding landscape. The visible part of the water shows several small aquatic plants scattered near the shoreline and across the surface.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dense forest with distinct outlines of trees against the sky, suggesting these are coniferous trees typical of a forested area. The tree line is irregular, with varying heights and shapes, adding a natural ruggedness to the scene.\n\nThe overall lighting is minimal, suggesting either early dawn or late dusk, with subtle gradations in the sky's color from a grayish hue near the horizon to a darker tone above. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched natural environment. The composition of the image, with the water in the foreground and the forest in the background, conveys a peaceful and untouched wilderness area, likely far from urban settings.","title":"Moen lake--one of the many connected lakes of the 11,815 square mile Wisconsin river drainage basin","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["554397","552142","554405","543611","554608","554404","543590","543604","550745","543577","551280","550389","552319","557570","556910","557021"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["gradation","ruggedness","forest","water","pond","twilight","dawn","height","wilderness","surface"]}
