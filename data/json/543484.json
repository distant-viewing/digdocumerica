{"path":"543484.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man engaging in fishing from what appears to be a boat. The man is wearing a light-colored straw hat and a plaid shirt, predominantly in shades of gray and blue. His expression is focused, hinting at an avid concentration on his task. While his face is partly in shadow, you can still notice details like his deeply wrinkled skin and the bright light reflecting in his eyes, suggesting sunshine.\n\nHe is holding a fishing rod, which extends out towards the right side of the frame. Near the right edge of the image, another part of the fishing rod is visible, including a tightened fishing line. A net can also be glimpsed in the background towards the right, further establishing the context of fishing.\n\nThe background is a muted blue, typical of a clear sky mirrored by a calm sea, creating a peaceful and serene environment. The focus and lighting emphasize the man's engagement and the gentle nature of the day, perfect for fishing. The overall composition effectively portrays a quiet moment of leisure and concentration.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["554522","543232","552122","550666","554520","544256","552320","554519","554523","548138","548738","552298","552026","544714","545306","550297"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","concentration","sunshine","straw","net","skin","man","plaid","gray"]}
