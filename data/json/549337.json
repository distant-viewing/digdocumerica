{"path":"549337.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene inside a multi-level library. The library space is densely packed with bookshelves that reach from the floor to the high ceiling. The shelves are filled with an abundant collection of books that add texture and color to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a wooden railing and a staircase lead down to the lower level where people are engaged in activities. A woman stands at the railing on the upper level, wearing a white outfit; she appears to be browsing books on a shelf adjacent to her. Her posture suggests she is carefully selecting or placing a book.\n\nOn the libraryâ€™s lower level, which can be seen through the balustrades of the railing, there is a large table where four individuals are seated, appearing deeply engrossed in their studies or discussions. They are surrounded by more bookshelves, some books laying on the table, suggesting an environment of academic or research activity. The table and the surroundings are well-lit, possibly indicating ceiling lights or natural light from windows not visible in the frame.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its vertical and horizontal lines created by the bookshelves, railing, and staircase adds a geometric aesthetic to the scene, while the human elements introduce a dynamic of intellectual engagement and tranquility. The image evokes a sense of scholarly atmosphere and focused study.","title":"The library at the Ruder Boskovic Institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549361","546560","546549","546553","553763","552592","555316","546511","546526","548219","551127","554380","546515","546500","553535","553187"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["library","bookshelf","book","railing","table","staircase","shelf","level","study","ceiling"]}
