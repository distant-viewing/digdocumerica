{"path":"544472.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a severely crushed and damaged vehicle, apparently wrecked due to a destructive event. The vehicle, which seems to be a van or large car, is wedged against a large tree, tilted to one side in an unnatural position. Its body is shockingly mangled, with parts of the frame bent and twisted. Panels of the vehicle are ripped open, exposing the internal components, which are strewn and tangled amongst the debris.\n\nBroken glasses and debris are scattered all around the accident site. The vehicle's color, a metallic dark blue or green, stands out amidst the natural greenery around it. The car's rear is visible with a license plate that reads \"HPY-168\".\n\nSurrounding the wreckage, the environment is lush and verdant, indicating a riverside or a wetland area with a calm body of water visible in the background reflecting trees. Bright sunlight filters through the leaves, illuminating parts of the scene and casting natural light on the chaotic aftermath captured in this image.\n\nThis scene likely resulted from a severe weather event or a violent accident. The serene natural environment juxtaposed with the violent destruction of the vehicle creates a poignant contrast, underscoring the force and suddenness of the event which led to this devastation.","title":"Detail of havoc caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["552083","550020","544584","554302","553863","554295","557993","547484","554303","554321","549107","547888","547597","555870","547835","544583"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["accident","vehicle","event","mangle","wreckage","tangle","devastation","crush","license","destruction"]}
