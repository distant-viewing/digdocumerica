{"path":"545396.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph presents an urban scene enveloped in a dense, murky haze, likely indicative of heavy pollution or smoke from a nearby source. A man can be observed in the immediate foreground, captured in profile as he walks from right to left. He appears dressed in a casual manner, wearing a checked shirt and dark pants, and carries a bag in his right hand.\n\nThe background features architectural structuresâ€”buildings that have a no-nonsense, functional design typical of industrial or simplified modern styles. These buildings are primarily obscured by the thick fog, which gives the scene a ghostly and somewhat eerie atmosphere. There are a couple of young trees visible, standing somewhat forlornly in the obscured environment, which adds a touch of natural contrast to the otherwise man-made surroundings.\n\nThe haze significantly impacts visibility in the scene, lending a blanket of monotone grey that covers most details and colors. This effect not only highlights the figure of the walking man by contrast but also imparts a sense of isolation or detachment to the environment, which might suggest themes of pollution, environmental concern, or urban solitude.","title":"Industrial smog blacks out homes adjacent to North Birmingham pipe plant, this is the most heavily polluted area of the city.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["547695","545415","549970","549277","553021","545442","545265","547542","553537","550175","550181","545268","548385","548373","550185","545239"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["haze","no","pollution","impart","walk","obscure","check","manner","blanket","concern"]}
