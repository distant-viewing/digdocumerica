{"path":"551411.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene with a group of people engaged in activities near a body of water, with a rugged terrain in the background. The scene is set on a muddy ground scattered with numerous small, shiny fish which appear to be dead. There's a mix of stones and debris strewn around as well.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a small group of people, who are dressed in outdoor, cold-weather clothing. One man, center-right and close to the camera, is wearing a scuba diving wetsuit with an aquatic net in his hand, suggesting that he might be involved in some sort of collection activity. Near him, a man and a woman appear to be interacting with another man holding a fishing rod.\n\nIn the background, to the left, there are two more people standing by the inclining bank that leads toward a higher plain. On the far top of this incline, two other figures can be seen standing and observing the scene below.\n\nThe scene presents an overcast, possibly chilly day, as indicated by the attire of the individuals and the overall outdoor setup which lacks vibrant colors, dominated instead by gray and brown tones. The activities suggest a mix of environmental investigation or cleanup, possibly related to the fish and the condition of the waterfront.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
