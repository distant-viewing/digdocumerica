{"path":"557917.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a man as he leans into a classic car, focusing on something inside. He is dressed in a smart outfit, featuring a dark suit and a white shirt, complemented by a thin dark tie. His attention is directed downwards towards the interior of the car, which is not visible in the image. \n\nHis demeanor suggests concentration or engagement with an object or task inside the vehicle. A small badge or emblem is visible on his left lapel, indicating some form of affiliation or identity. Uniquely, he wears sunglasses, which rest on his forehead, hinting at a transition from outdoors to indoors, or vice versa.\n\nThe car, visible only around the door area through which he is leaning, has a shiny, metallic edge with a reflective window. The door frame has noticeable curvature and design indicative of vintage automotive styling. Stickers on the car window include what appear to be a parking or access permit and an inspection sticker, which add a realistic touch to the setting, suggesting the car is in regular use and possibly belongs to a particular institution or locale.\n\nThe image is intensely color-saturated and has a dramatic feel, likely due to the lighting and film used during the photography. This imbues the scene with a moody and cinematic quality. The frame focuses only on the man and part of the car, using a shallow depth of field to blur the background and enhance the viewerâ€™s focus on the subject and his interaction with the car. The overall composition and elements suggest the photograph could be from a period documenting everyday life or from a stylized cinematic shoot.","title":"City employee affixes a 1976 inspection seal to the windshield of a car that has successfully passed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
