{"path":"543284.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph presents a serene waterscape featuring two avocets wading in relatively still water. The birds are predominantly white with distinctive black markings on their wings and necks, and they possess long, thin black beaks. One avocet is captured in a relaxed standing position, while the other is slightly bent forward, suggesting movement or interaction with the water. The setting appears to be during twilight or early evening, given the soft, dim lighting and a subtle gradient in the sky's hue hinting at sunset colors, lending a peaceful and somewhat pensive mood to the scene. The water's surface is textured with gentle ripples and reflects the soft light, enhancing the atmospheric quality of the image. There is no visible land or other objects; the focus remains entirely on these two graceful birds and their environment.","title":"California--zmudowski state beach","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["547726","554067","554068","550388","557495","557448","548832","544846","544838","545991","553777","543063","547744","544620","544539","544683"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","waterscape","beak","possess","wade","standing","wing","neck","marking","gradient"]}
