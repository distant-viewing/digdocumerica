{"path":"544435.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This image features a striking natural landscape focusing on large, rough-textured boulders surrounded by verdant vegetation. The rocks appear substantial and are possibly granite, based on their grainy texture and pinkish-gray color. These massive boulders are prominently positioned in the frame, illuminated by bright sunlight that casts deep shadows, enhancing their rugged contours.\n\nIn the foreground, clusters of bright yellow flowers on thin green stems add a vibrant contrast to the scene. These flowers are likely wildflowers, scattered across the lower part of the image, growing sparsely among smaller stones and grass. Their presence brings a touch of delicacy to an otherwise harsh and stony environment.\n\nThe background is darker, suggesting a shaded area that fades into shadows, likely due to the dense tree coverage typical of a woodland area. There is no sky visible in the image, emphasizing the closed, intimate feel of the scene. The composition cleverly balances the enduring solidity of the boulders with the transient beauty of the wildflowers, creating a serene and timeless natural tableau.","title":"Central Texas--near Lake Travis","placename":"Travis, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Travis, Lake, Texas","nn1":["549228","554596","544440","543549","558083","552546","547635","545589","545703","554572","552445","558086","550483","552900","545724","555592"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boulder","wildflower","flower","tableau","coverage","stem","contour","shadow","cluster","stone"]}
