{"path":"544815.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a geologic or mineral sample, which is likely a section of a rock or a geological formation that has been sliced or broken open. The sectioned piece has a rusty, reddish-brown exterior that is rough and irregularly textured, indicative of weathering or oxidation processes. The interior of the sample reveals a layered structure with different textures and colors.\n\nThe core of the object consists of an intriguing formation: a concentric or layered pattern resembling sedimentary depositions or a crystalline structure. The innermost layer is a darker gray or black color, possibly composed of dense minerals or a concentration of organic material. This layer has a smooth, slightly reflective surface, differentiating it from the outer rusty portion.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus and dark, putting the emphasis solely on the rock sample. The lighting highlights the textures and color variations of the rock, enhancing the details of its composition and its rough, natural beauty. The overall composition is such that it draws the viewer’s attention directly to the intricacies of the rock’s structure and the geological story it might tell.","title":"Beer can in the South Platte River","placename":"Kassler (Colo.)","location":"Kassler, Colorado","nn1":["550474","550606","545558","546165","552543","543151","546119","543149","555182","544907","553582","545487","554410","553770","550476","544682"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sample","rock","mineral","deposition","core","formation","intricacy","layer","weathering","variation"]}
