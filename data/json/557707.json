{"path":"557707.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features a man holding an American flag, partially visible in the frame, emphasizing its symbolic presence. The man appears to be middle-aged, wearing a black cap denoted with insignias, one of which reads \"GEORGIA,\" indicating a possible location or affiliation. His cap also showcases multiple badges and a label that likely connects him to a veteran's association, suggested by the American Legion emblem and a USA flag patch.\n\nHe wears black-framed glasses and a plain white short-sleeved shirt. His expression is serious, possibly reflecting the solemnity or importance of the occasion. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a woman wearing glasses and a similar white shirt, suggesting she may be part of the same event or group.\n\nThe setting indicates an outdoor location with a hint of greenery visible behind the subjects. The focus and framing on the manâ€™s profile with the American flag suggest a patriotic event or ceremony relating to the American Legion, emphasizing themes of national pride and remembrance.","title":"Closeup of a White County legionnaire awaiting the start of the Fourth of July parade down the main street of Helen, Georgia near Robertstown. Helen was a typical small mountain community of less than 300 until 1969 when town officials, businessmen and residents endorsed business district Renovation with an alpine theme. The project was a success and resulted in new businesses and a surge of tourism. The busiest time is between May and October particularly on weekends.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557706","557048","549571","556285","554448","547362","557715","548577","558271","553280","552589","553175","554361","542581","549730","556275"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["flag","cap","remembrance","insignia","affiliation","ceremony","solemnity","pride","event","glass"]}
