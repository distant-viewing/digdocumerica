{"path":"548839.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, rustic scene along a river. The landscape features a mix of natural and inhabited elements. At the forefront, the river calmly flows, its surface gently reflecting some of the surroundings. A man on horseback can be seen crossing the shallow part of the river, possibly guiding another horse without a rider.\n\nOn the riverbanks, several people are engaged in various activities. One individual appears to be washing or interacting with the river directly, while others are nearby, perhaps enjoying the water or working. The banks are lined with lush green vegetation, which adds a vibrant contrast to the somewhat dry surrounding fields.\n\nBehind the river, there are several simple, makeshift structures which seem to be residential or possibly used for animal shelter. These structures are constructed with basic materials and are sparsely distributed across the area.\n\nThe background further features open fields and sparse vegetation, exhibiting a mostly arid climate. Few trees and bushes dot the landscape, and the scene is set against a background of clear skies. In the distance, a more developed area with better-constructed buildings can be seen, suggesting the proximity of a rural town or village.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its natural scenery, human and animal presence, and a blend of undeveloped and slightly more urban elements, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence and rural life.","title":"Colorado River on the Mexican side of the border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549029","549089","548868","555575","542653","549457","548096","544607","551067","542555","543793","542558","552108","551332","549027","557239"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","animal","horseback","village","rider","shelter","field","coexistence","horse","proximity"]}
