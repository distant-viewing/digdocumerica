{"path":"555107.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape affected by logging activities. The scene is a mountain slope densely covered with tree stumps and fallen timber, showcasing a stark, cleared area. Many of the trees have been cut down, leaving a plethora of tall stumps scattered across the hillside. The background shows a dense forest on an adjoining hill which contrasts starkly with the barrenness of the foreground.\n\nThe environment suggests recent logging activity, as indicated by the fresh appearance of the cut wood and the lack of vegetation on the logged slope. The soil is visibly eroded, possibly due to the deforestation, exposing a darker soil layer. A few young trees have begun to grow among the stumps, suggesting early stages of natural regeneration.\n\nThe photograph is taken during the daytime under clear, bright conditions, casting sharp shadows that emphasize the rugged texture of the terrain. The overall mood conveyed by the image is a blend of natural beauty and environmental disturbance, highlighting the impact of human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"Douglas firs and alder trees 15 to 20 years old in the foreground, natural seeding of mixed deciduous trees and conifers in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555097","555150","542820","555208","555221","555094","555098","545138","555136","542827","555198","542865","542832","555146","553468","555143"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["stump","slope","soil","deforestation","timber","logging","disturbance","daytime","hillside","lack"]}
