{"path":"547684.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a rural area, predominantly illustrating a patchwork of farmlands. The farms are divided into various geometric fields, each appearing with different colors and textures indicating diverse types of crops or soil treatment. These fields are bordered by narrow strips of green, likely shrubs or small trees, forming natural barriers between different plots.\n\nIn the center of the image, a cluster of buildings, possibly farmhouses and barns, can be seen surrounded by lush greenery, including a few prominent trees providing shade. There is also a small winding road or driveway leading up to these buildings, enhancing the rustic charm of the setting.\n\nThe image captures the true essence of agricultural landscapes, with the vastness and orderly arrangement of the fields suggesting efficient land use possibly for crop rotation or varied cultivation. The photo also portrays a sense of serene isolation and a deep connection to the natural environment, typical of rural countryside areas.","title":"Farmlands near Middletown","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["558414","547426","547350","547321","552858","553817","547447","556968","557517","542517","549253","547357","558044","547428","545842","557748"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["crop","field","farmhouse","driveway","patchwork","countryside","farmland","cultivation","plot","treatment"]}
