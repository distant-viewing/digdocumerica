{"path":"553982.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a coastal area, showcasing a serene beach environment. The picture captures two prominent sandy beaches, outlined by foamy sea waves gently crashing against the shore. The beaches are hemmed in by rocky outcrops and patches of lush greenery, which include a variety of tropical palm trees. \n\nThe terrain behind the beaches is relatively flat and looks to be developing into either small scale residential or vacation facilities, characterized by clusters of small buildings spread around the area. These buildings appear to be interspersed amongst more verdant patches, possibly gardens or small cultivated areas, contributing to a relaxed, recreational atmosphere.\n\nBeyond these immediate coastal developments, the landscape transitions into what seems to be agricultural fields, marked by larger, more uniformed patches of land that have distinct colors possibly indicating different crops or land usage. The farther backdrop features gently rolling hills, which fade into a hazy mountain range under a soft blue sky, speckled with light clouds. \n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a tranquil, picturesque scene of natural beauty interspersed with signs of human habitation and use, suggesting a balance between enjoyment of natural scenery and residential living.","title":"The Poipu beach area has the most desirable ocean frontage on the island, and hotels are rapidly taking over the remaining beach land. Because dry climate disqualifies it for prime agriculture, the land use commission zoned the area for urban use however, it is for the county to decide how far urbanization will be carried. The \"Poipu Community Association\", a private group, is acting to curb indiscriminate development.","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["553983","554156","553766","554171","557453","557466","554157","543425","554023","543427","547637","553765","554057","553671","547629","548785"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","intersperse","patch","vacation","land","speckle","crash","outcrop","palm","usage"]}
