{"path":"548293.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, you see a group of people on a small boat docked beside a wooden pier. The boat, which has a covered area and is named \"Miss Rachel\" as seen on its side, holds multiple occupants mostly seated under the canopy. The people appear engaged in a conversation or gathering, focusing towards the center where someone appears to be interacting or speaking. The individuals are dressed in casual attire typical of a warm climate, including shirts and trousers.\n\nThe foreground shows a part of the pier with a rugged wooden surface, with some ropes, a chain, and a shovel lying around, indicating usual dockside activity and utility. On the left side, the perspective is partially obstructed by a dark upright element, likely a post or part of another boat. \n\nThe water surrounding the boat is calm and there are several other boats in the background, suggesting this could be a small marina or a fishing dock. The environment suggests a functional, everyday setting rather than one prepared for leisure or tourism. The overall atmosphere appears laid-back with people engaged in everyday social or work-related interactions.","title":"Oyster boat captains at Pointe a la Hache map out new navigational charts of the area with an official from the U.S. Department of the Interior.
