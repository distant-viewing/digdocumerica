{"path":"548498.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph shows a scenic view of a sailing event on the open sea, primarily featuring two sailboats. The closest sailboat, which dominates the frame, is captured from a side profile, with its sails fully unfurled. Its large white sail curves gracefully, catching the wind, and it is complemented by a smaller jib sail (a triangular sail in the front). The boat's hull appears sturdy and dark, possibly made of wood, and it is filled with passengers. Most of the visible passengers are standing and seem to be actively involved in sailing the vessel.\n\nIn the background, another sailboat following a similar course can be seen. This boat has its sails up as well, though it's further away and appears smaller in perspective. The vastness of the open water around the boats suggests they are in a large body of water, likely an ocean or large lake, under a clear sky with soft lighting conditions, likely in the early morning or late afternoon given the gentle quality of the light.\n\nThe water itself is relatively calm with light ripples indicating a gentle breeze conducive to sailing. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, conveying a sense of leisure and adventure associated with sailing activities. The horizon is visible in the distance, emphasizing the expansive environment in which the activity is taking place.","title":"Sailing on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549403","544667","548526","548506","548203","549394","549406","549421","552345","548513","552355","544021","552343","544669","549405","547781"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","sailing","passenger","boat","course","breeze","hull","profile","adventure"]}
