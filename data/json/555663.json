{"path":"555663.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a sweeping aerial view of a rugged landscape dominated by dramatic natural features. The scene is characterized by a series of lush, rolling valleys interspersed with winding streams and rivers. A prominent glacier is visible in the mid-right section of the image, descending from a range of sharply peaked mountains that serve as the backdrop.\n\nThis glacier is large and expansive, with its thick ice cascading down between the peaks and feeding into the valley below, where it likely contributes to the river systems visible throughout the area. The meandering rivers and streams cut deeply into the landscape, creating a network of water channels that reflect the light and add dynamism to the view.\n\nThe terrain is mostly barren rock and sparse vegetation, but there are areas of greener patches that suggest some foliage growth. The landscapeâ€™s colors are a blend of earthy browns, dark greens, and the stark white of the glacier, contrasting sharply with the blue of the small pond seen in the lower right corner. The overall impression is one of awe-inspiring natural beauty, mostly untouched by human presence. The sky overhead is partly cloudy, subtly shading the mountains and valleys below, enhancing the sense of depth and distance in this pristine wilderness setting.","title":"View west toward Worthington Glacier and Thompson Pass (elevation 2,771 feet).
