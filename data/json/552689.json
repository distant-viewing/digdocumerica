{"path":"552689.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial plant or factory setting, under a clear blue sky. The facility is a complex structure with multiple levels, featuring an intricate arrangement of pipes, scaffolding, and steel frameworks that create a dense network of industrial components. On the left, there is a tall vertical pipeline, possibly a smokestack, which is white with a blue bands around it. This stack extends into a curving pipeline that loops over part of the structure. Several stairs and platforms are visible, allowing access to different parts of the structure. \n\nThe foreground shows a small portion of a building with a flat roof on the left side and a ground surface covered with gravel. In the background, mountainous terrain can be observed, suggesting that the plant is possibly located in a valley or a region with significant natural relief. The setting is illuminated by bright sunlight, emphasizing the metallic surfaces and the complexity of the plant's construction. There are no people visible in the shot, focusing the viewer's attention on the industrial machinery and architecture.","title":"Anvil points research center, a government facility, has been leased to development engineering, inc.
