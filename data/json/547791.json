The bronze plaque is inscribed with the name \"Thomas W. Ferguson,\" along with the designations \"PFC US Marine Corps Vietnam\" and the dates \"Nov 1 1946 - March 1 1968.\" Adjacent to the plaque is a small arrangement of flowers primarily in shades of red, white, and blue, placed in a black vase. This colorful floral arrangement includes various types of flowers like carnations and daisies. Next to the flower vase, an American flag on a short pole is planted into the ground, signaling the deceased's military service. The background is simple and consists solely of the lush green lawn, which extends uniformly in all directions, providing a serene and respectful setting.","title":"Vietnam soldier's grave in van zandt haven of memories cemetery in Longview","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547800","552531","550364","544427","544423","545364","555566","545357","547801","554210","546147","546098","552461","545314","547417","549041"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["plaque","vase","flower","lawn","arrangement","inscribe","bronze","daisy","embed","manicure"]}
