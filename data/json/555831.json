{"path":"555831.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This color photograph shows a marine scene with several individuals performing various activities around a large boat or ship. The setting appears to be on open water under a clear, sunny sky. The ship features a white hull with visible details like windows, railings, and deck equipment. There is also a yellow crane arm attached to the ship, hinting at the vessel's capability for handling cargo or equipment.\n\nOn the ship's deck, there are three men visible in total, all dressed in casual or work attire, including hats and short-sleeved shirts. Two of these individuals are standing at the stern, engaged in an activity that involves handling ropes or equipment. One man is positioned slightly lower on the deck, leaning over the side, observing or maybe communicating with a diver in the water.\n\nIn the water next to the ship, a diver wearing full scuba gear—including a wetsuit, flippers, diving mask, and back-mounted air tanks—is visible. The diver seems to be just about to enter or has just exited the water, attached by a line to the ship for safety or navigation purposes.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a coordinated operation or activity involving the use of the diver for underwater inspections, research, or possibly some form of recovery mission. The calm water and clear weather conditions contribute to the serene yet active environment captured in this image.","title":"Divers from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ship \"Ferrel\" getting ready to check current meter stations in the bight. Water circulation there is not yet fully understood. Current research will give a more accurate reading of how well sludge and waste is dispersed by natural circulation. They also hope to learn how much man's activities have disturbed the natural pattern.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555829","555833","549265","555830","555834","555832","555828","549590","555827","549356","549369","549616","549597","549594","549598","552861"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["diver","ship","deck","equipment","wetsuit","total","capability","diving","recovery","mask"]}
