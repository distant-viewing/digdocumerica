{"path":"545695.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a flower cluster, predominantly white in color, with multiple small blossoms grouped tightly together at the top of a stem. Each flower has a star-shaped appearance with five delicate petals and a visible central structure, likely the stamen, enhancing its intricate details. The stem appears to be slender and green, supported by sparse foliage including a single green leaf visible in the foreground, which is out of focus emphasizing the depth of field used in this shot.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, with warm, earthy tones that suggest this picture was taken during golden hour, providing a natural, subdued lighting condition. The colors in the background blend in hues of brown and muted orange, highlighting the whiteness and delicate texture of the flower's petals. The mood conveyed by this image is one of serenity and natural beauty, focusing entirely on the floral subject and subtly suggesting its environment without distraction from sharper background details.","title":"Flowers bloom in water canyon, named for a spring which furnishes a good supply of pure water, a rarity in this dry area","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["553368","554576","545726","544875","554574","555034","549230","554587","543623","557618","547642","554586","545706","550462","553366","545720"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","flower","stem","distraction","blossom","star","serenity","leaf","detail","hour"]}
