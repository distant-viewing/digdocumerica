{"path":"543624.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph presents a close-up view of a young tree or shrub in the early stages of leaf development. The branches are thin and delicately spread out, with small, fresh green leaves budding at their tips. Notably, one of the branches is adorned with a red, satin ribbon tied in a simple knot that gently flows downward. This inclusion of the ribbon suggests a human element, possibly marking the tree for observation or as part of a ceremonial function.\n\nThe background features a softer, darker setting that includes the blurred outlines of other trees; these trees appear much larger and possibly older, creating a contrast in maturity and size against the lightly colored, youthful subject in the foreground. The backdrop enhances the visibility and focus on the tree with the ribbon, making it the prime subject of this photograph. The overall composition and the play of light suggest that it might be taken either late in the afternoon or under a filtered light condition.\n","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543488","550461","557593","555003","547634","554740","555099","546497","555007","551365","555004","555100","553361","555188","543551","544731"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["ribbon","maturity","subject","branch","tree","inclusion","tip","leaf","observation","function"]}
