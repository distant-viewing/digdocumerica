{"path":"550072.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a large public fountain area on a sunny day. The fountain consists of multiple jets of water shooting vertically high into the air, creating a dynamic and lively water display. The fountain is part of a larger pool, with water cascading over a raised circular structure in the center into the surrounding pool.\n\nIn the foreground, a walkway runs parallel to the fountain, bisected by straight, white crosswalk lines painted on the ground. There are three individuals in the scene. On the right side, two elderly individuals walk hand in hand, with the person on the right wearing a long black coat, a black head scarf, and carrying a black bag, and the other individual wearing a light grey suit with a white hat. On the left side of the walkway, a young girl, wearing a light-colored dress and white shoes, stands by the fountain's edge, looking towards the water.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky and a row of trees in full foliage behind the fountain, suggesting a well-maintained urban park or public space. The overall composition of the photograph is peaceful, with a sense of casual daily life and enjoyment of public spaces.","title":"Hanna fountains on the mall, Cleveland's civic center","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557268","550747","553224","551449","552737","550752","553289","551772","553149","557282","550080","549982","551647","551792","551453","552703"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","pool","walkway","jet","scarf","individual","hand","space","water","shoe"]}
