{"path":"545885.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features an upwards perspective of a modern skyscraper with a distinctive glass facade. The building's surface is composed of numerous square glass panels framed by thin, metallic frames, reflecting blue sky and clouds. The angle of the view creates a visual effect where the building seems to narrow and stretch into the sky, converging at a point out of the image frame. The right angle view accentuates the buildingâ€™s geometric design and symmetry, emphasizing the scale and the smooth, reflective quality of its exterior. The sky in the backdrop shows a light scattering of clouds, contributing to the overall dynamic and somewhat abstract aesthetic of the composition. The color saturation and slight graininess suggest that the image might have been taken on film.","title":"United Gas building is also called the \"Minor building.\"","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["555278","557280","555329","546491","551455","557333","550007","548648","549301","556174","546415","550116","549971","555326","552395","552363"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["graininess","angle","scattering","symmetry","glass","saturation","cloud","film","skyscraper","panel"]}
