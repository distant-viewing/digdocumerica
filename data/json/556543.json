{"path":"556543.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment among four men gathered around a vintage red car, possibly engaged in a game of cards. The setting appears to be in a rural area with green, wooded hills in the background, under overcast skies. The scene might be near small town residential or industrial buildings based on the structures visible in the distance.\n\nEach man is dressed in casual attire typical of mid-20th-century American fashion. The man on the left wears a cap, a dark blue work shirt, and pants, and is seated on the hood of the car. The other three men stand closely around the front of the car, focusing on the activity at hand. They wear light-colored summer clothes; two of them have short-sleeved shirts and the third wears a t-shirt. The man in a white short-sleeved shirt appears to be reaching for a card or making a move in their game.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, the vintage red car, and the attire and leisure activity suggest a relaxed, communal interaction typical of a bygone era in a small American community.\n","title":"Picket line at the brookside mine company in harlan county Kentucky, near Middlesboro in the southeastern part of the state the strikers are playing cards on the hood of a car.
