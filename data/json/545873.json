{"path":"545873.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing urban architectural scene. In the image, two large buildings frame the composition on the left and right sides, converging towards the top center of the photo. The building on the left appears solid and dark-toned with a smooth surface. On the right, the building has a facade comprised of reflective blue glass, divided into rectangular sections that reflect the clouds and sky, creating a mirror effect.\n\nBetween these buildings, against a clear sky, is the focal point of the image: a church steeple rising from the central building at the bottom. The steeple is sharp, pointed, and features a cross at its peak, suggesting a modern design yet retaining traditional religious symbolism. The contrast between the modern, secular office buildings and the traditional religious symbol of the cross provides a thought-provoking visual juxtaposition.\n\nThe sky above is a vivid blue, occupying about the top two-thirds of the photo, giving a sense of openness and height that accentuates the verticality of the buildings and the steeple. This composition suggests themes of spirituality juxtaposed with commercialism, tradition alongside modernity, and provides a commentary on the landscape of contemporary urban environments.","title":"Church steeple rises above modern building.
