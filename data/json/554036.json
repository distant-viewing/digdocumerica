{"path":"554036.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a small, rustic neighborhood store, seemingly located in a tropical setting, given the presence of palm trees visible in the background. The structure of the store is simple, with a thatched roof and an open front counter where items for sale are displayed.\n\nA person, presumably the shopkeeper, is standing behind the counter. They are wearing a casual, floral-patterned shirt and smiling towards the camera, which adds a friendly, welcoming atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe storefront has a handmade sign reading \"THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORE\" in colorful, block letters hung just above the main counter. Below it, a simpler, weathered sign states \"STORE\" in faded blue paint. The store offers a variety of goods, including what appears to be fresh produce displayed on the counter among other items such as a container with what might be cookies or candies, and a red Coke box which suggests they also sell beverages.\n\nThe sky is overcast, suggesting an imminent rain, or just an overcast day, and contributes to the serene and somewhat remote ambience of the photograph. The composition of the photo captures a slice of daily life in this tropical, community-centric setting.","title":"Store in Pukoo area","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["557763","547805","555377","554037","555640","552518","556368","544257","557688","554125","552517","552513","544373","558281","557679","546216"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["counter","store","centric","item","welcome","sell","beverage","storefront","produce","ambience"]}
