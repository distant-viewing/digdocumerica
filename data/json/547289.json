{"path":"547289.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene at dusk. The image features a landscape that includes several farm buildings and structures against a softly fading sky.\n\nOn the left, there is a two-story house with white siding and a dark roof; one of the windows on the second floor appears illuminated, lending a warm glow. Adjacent to this house, there are other smaller outbuildings that also have white siding.\n\nToward the center and right of the image, prominently stands a classic windmill, thin and tall, typical of those used historically for pumping water on farms. This adds a nostalgic or rustic feel to the scene.\n\nFurther right, there is a large barn with a gambrel roof painted in a dark color, possibly red. Next to the barn, other farm-related buildings are visible, including what looks like a shed or storage structure with a similarly dark roof.\n\nIn the foreground, the remains of a harvested field are visible, possibly corn, as indicated by the short, stubby residue dotting the landscapeâ€”this suggests the photo might have been taken in late fall or early winter.\n\nThe sky, occupying the upper half of the composition, displays a gradient of colors from deep blue at the top transitioning to milder hues near the horizon, suggestive of either sunrise or sunset conditions.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a quiet and tranquil rural setting, emphasizing agricultural life and the simplicity of farm architecture.","title":"A farm","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547293","547309","557119","556963","552462","547347","542801","547428","554767","547288","557023","555577","557183","547128","554819","547393"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","barn","siding","roof","windmill","corn","residue","remain","outbuilding","house"]}
