{"path":"543534.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a group of people engaged in leisure activities on a sandy beach. The beach setting is surrounded by large sand dunes and some sparse vegetation, predominantly bushes, which add a rugged natural backdrop contrasting with the relaxed atmosphere in the foreground.\n\nIn the center, a young woman stands prominently; she is dressed in a light-colored, patterned bikini and appears to be eating or biting something small, possibly a snack. Her body language seems relaxed and casual as she gazes towards another group member.\n\nSurrounding her, in a semi-circle formation on the sand, are six other individuals evidently engrossed in a social gathering. Most of them appear to be in swimwear, suggesting an enjoyment of the beach environment and possibly swimming prior to this moment. To the left three individuals are seated close together. One is leaning forward slightly while another is visibly engaged in conversation or reacting to the group. Another woman to the far left seems to be mostly absorbed in her own thoughts or the scenery.\n\nFurther to the right, another group of three consists of two seated individuals who face a third, who is leaning forward in a lively exchange. A young child stands upright with a bright expression, adding a youthful energy to the scene. The child's presence, along with diverse postures and orientations of the adults, imparts a sense of dynamism and familial or friendly interaction.\n\nThis peaceful yet engaging scene is bathed in natural light, with shadows cast across the sand suggesting late afternoon or early evening sunlight. The warm lighting enhances the tranquil yet cheerful mood of the vignette.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["550936","548541","547009","546874","543216","556297","547507","547873","547503","546768","547688","547491","544206","546794","555923","550243"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","beach","group","vignette","exchange","dynamism","swimwear","snack","child","orientation"]}
