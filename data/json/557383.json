{"path":"557383.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene nestled in a valley surrounded by lush green mountains. In the foreground, there is a sizable parking lot filled with cars from what appears to be the 1970s or earlier, indicating the photo might be several decades old. The cars exhibit a variety of colors and are arranged randomly throughout the lot.\n\nCentral to the image are a few industrial buildings with red and dark elements; one of the buildings has multiple large windows and possibly metal siding. Prominently, there are two large water towers constructed of metal, featuring a cylindrical shape supported by an intricate lattice of metal beams. Both towers have \"USA\" labeled on them, making them striking landmarks in this industrial tableau.\n\nTo the left side of the factory, white smoke billows from a chimney against the backdrop of the mountains, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of natural beauty and industrial functionality. There is a sense of quiet activity, as the smoking chimneys imply work being done, but there are no people visible in the photograph. The contrast between the serene, wooded mountains and the busy industrial setup foregrounds a common theme of nature intersecting with human enterprise.","title":"A little smoke comes from the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant area to the south and white smoke from furnace #36. Metallurgical plant emissions dropped 97.7 percent, from 113,252 to 2,649 tons annually, between 1967 and 1975. A compliance schedule was reached between the company and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission.
