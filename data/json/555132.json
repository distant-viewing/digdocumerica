{"path":"555132.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a tranquil and misty mountain landscape at either dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by a dense blanket of fog that flows through a mountainous forest, partially obscuring the tree-covered valleys and peaks that lie beneath it. The foreground features younger conifer trees, their needles sharp against the softness of the fog. In the background, the silhouettes of distant mountains rise above the rolling mist, suggesting a vast and rugged terrain. The horizon is subtly illuminated, indicating the early or late hours of the day, with light hues blending into the bluish-grey overcast sky. Overall, the photograph conveys a serene and somewhat ethereal mood, capturing the quiet beauty of a foggy mountain landscape.","title":"Distant view of Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542848","552695","555536","555110","555126","555131","545012","555130","542923","554647","557575","543312","554962","557000","553825","554634"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["fog","softness","conifer","mountain","needle","blanket","hour","dawn","mist","peak"]}
