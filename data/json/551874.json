{"path":"551874.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban scene, possibly in Munich, Germany, judging by the sign on the crates which reads \"Spaten MÃ¼nchen,\" referring to a local brewery. It appears to be a rainy day, as the cobblestone street and sidewalks are wet, and pedestrians in the background are using umbrellas.\n\nThe main focus of the image is a man in traditional Bavarian attire, which includes a checkered shirt, dark pants, knee-length Lederhosen, a leather apron, and sturdy shoes. He is wearing work gloves and is engaged in the strenuous activity of lifting a large metal beer keg. His posture suggests effort as he leans forward to hoist the keg, likely to transport it to a nearby establishment.\n\nTo the left of the man are stacks of beer crates branded with the Spaten logo, indicating a delivery or distribution activity typical for a beer hall or restaurant. The crates are arranged neatly beside a narrow alleyway leading into what looks to be a commercial building.\n\nThe background shows a vibrant street scene lined with buildings featuring traditional European architecture, decorative elements like statues on the facades, and a banner strung across the street with more German text, enhancing the cultural setting. Pedestrians, partially blurred, walk along the street, adding a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is slightly moody due to the overcast weather, yet the scene is lively, captured with a rich color palette that emphasizes the reds and yellows against the grey day. The photograph effectively conveys a moment of daily life intertwined with cultural and commercial activities.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.  It is totally traffic free.  Not even bicycle riding is permitted.  On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned.  This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551847","551871","551789","557802","558265","551873","558264","558266","551840","558287","551862","551790","557663","551806","551816","551788"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["beer","crate","street","pedestrian","alleyway","refer","delivery","apron","leather","restaurant"]}
