{"path":"545386.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a man standing in a small, narrow water body, likely a stream, surrounded by an environment rich in greenery. He is engaged in the activity of managing or fishing with a long, slender pole, which he holds with both hands. The pole extends into the water, suggesting he might be using it to navigate or stabilize himself, or possibly for traditional fishing or aquaculture. The man is dressed in a light-colored long sleeve shirt, darker pants, and a hat, which indicates working attire typically worn in rural or outdoor settings.\n\nThe surrounding area is lush with tall green grass and dense vegetation, indicating a natural, possibly rural setting. The stream's water is clear, reflecting the green of the plants above, and some small items, possibly bits of debris or equipment, are visible in the water near the man.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, with sunshine illuminating the scene, casting shadows, and highlighting the textures of the plants and the manâ€™s clothing. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a moment of everyday life, focusing on traditional or manual tasks in a natural setting.","title":"Workman scoops trash from creek","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553650","548831","549012","546298","543829","550047","543781","553953","555602","542561","548956","550666","553339","550313","551406","553332"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["stream","fishing","aquaculture","sunshine","pole","man","plant","water","bit","sleeve"]}
