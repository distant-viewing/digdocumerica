{"path":"554355.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a pile of heavily crushed and mangled car parts. Dominant in the frame is a compacted piece of what appears to be the front face of a vehicle. Features such as a surreal, mask-like pair of round headlamps, a distorted, silver-colored grille, and a crumpled bumper can be identified, creating an illusion of a face in the wreckage. The colors range from metal grays and whites to rusty browns and blacks, indicative of metal fatigue and exposure to elements. The background is blurred but filled with similarly destroyed car parts interspersed with chunks of gravel and debris typically found in a scrapyard. The overall mood conveyed is one of decay and destruction.","title":"Junked car in scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554305","554295","554303","554302","547476","554311","554321","554317","552738","549107","554319","553005","555492","551517","553863","542656"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["headlamp","face","chunk","scrapyard","wreckage","mask","grille","bumper","black","destruction"]}
