{"path":"546470.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene that focuses on a modern architectural setting. The image features a large brick building characterized by its minimalist design, comprising vertical and horizontal lines that create a striking geometric pattern. Key architectural elements include deep recesses and overhangs which play with shadow and light, adding depth to the structure.\n\nIn the foreground, a person is seated on a ledge, seemingly engrossed in reading a book. They are placed under the canopy of a large overhang that direct transitions into a small alcove, providing a natural, shaded space for study or relaxation.\n\nAdjacent to where the person sits are four sets of lamp posts. Each post holds three spherical light fixtures, and they add a modern, almost futuristic element to the scene. The posts are anchored into what appears to be a lower, wide pedestrian platform that might serve as a walkway around the building.\n\nThe surrounding environment, partially visible through a frame of lush green foliage on the left side of the image, suggests that the building is situated in a serene, landscaped area. The foliage provides a natural contrast to the rigid structure of the building and softens the overall composition of the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph hints at either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, diffuse sunlight enhancing the quiet, studious atmosphere.","title":"Cleo Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546464","546531","546492","546515","553744","546481","546473","546460","546506","546511","546500","546519","546539","546546","546532","546456"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["post","overhang","ledge","foliage","fixture","building","person","study","book","walkway"]}
