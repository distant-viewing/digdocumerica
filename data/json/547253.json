{"path":"547253.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a cityscape. The perspective looks down over numerous high-rise buildings, roads, intersections, and some patches of green spaces distributed among the urban environment. Additionally, two significant water bodies can be noticed. The water on the left portion of the photograph is wide and seems to be a large river, curving slightly out of the frame. On the right, there appears to be a smaller body of water or possibly a continuation of the river, feeding into a broader expanse outside the right frame of the image.\n\nThe left section of the image also features a distinctively arranged green area that includes what appears to be a monument, characterized by a tall, thin spire-like structure visible from this distance. The roads within the city are visibly busy with tiny specks that suggest vehicles, and there are various shadows cast by the tall buildings, indicating a daytime setting with ample sunlight.\n\nThe color palette of the urban area predominantly includes shades of gray, brown, and green, indicating buildings of various types and ages, along with the greenery of the trees and lawns. The sky above is clear and blue.\n\nOverall, the view is both expansive and detailed, offering a look at the architectural layout and the geographical features surrounding this urban environment.","title":"Aerial view of downtown Washington.
