{"path":"552203.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a pile of freshly cut logs. The foreground features a close view of the cut ends of several large tree logs, showing the wood's rings and textures. Some logs have markings possibly made with paint, which appear as pink dots. The logs are arranged haphazardly, creating an organic and slightly chaotic appearance.\n\nIn the upper part of the image, framed by the dark silhouettes of logs, the background reveals a clear blue sky dotted with wispy white clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The framing logs create an almost cave-like opening towards the sky, adding a dramatic and natural frame to the composition. This arrangement not only focuses attention on the sky but also highlights the texture and natural colors of the wood against the bright backdrop of the sky.","title":"Cold deck log storage at Olympia.
