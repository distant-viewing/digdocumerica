{"path":"554648.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene autumn scene featuring a calm, expansive lake reflecting the clear blue sky. Surrounding the lake, dense forests in full autumn color dominate the landscape. The trees are rich in shades of red, orange, and yellow, suggesting that this photo was taken in the peak of fall foliage season. The background is framed by rolling hills and low mountains, adding a sense of depth and seclusion to the scene.\n\nThe lake itself is large and appears untouched, with smooth surface reflecting the vivid colors of the surrounding forest and sky. The far edges of the lake bend out of view, suggesting it might be part of a larger lake system. No human activity, like boats or buildings, is visible, suggesting this area is quite remote or preserved. The overall composition is peaceful and picturesque, typical of North American landscapes in regions known for their fall scenery, such as New England or the Appalachian regions.","title":"Hardwood trees show their fall color at seventh lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554758","554649","554757","554761","554750","554714","554751","554749","554635","554713","554712","554711","554737","554651","554719","558093"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","autumn","fall","region","seclusion","preserve","forest","know","scenery","system"]}
