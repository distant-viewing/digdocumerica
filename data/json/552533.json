{"path":"552533.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph presents a close-up view of the upper section of a building facade where a sign spelling \"KEWANEE\" is prominently displayed. The sign features white letters on a dark background and is mounted just below the peak of a gabled architectural feature, which contributes to a somewhat dramatic angle in the composition.\n\nThe materials used in the construction are mainly wood, as indicated by the horizontal wooden siding that forms much of the visible structural surface. The construction appears aged and weathered, with a tangible sense of wear and history evident in the faded paint and the somewhat rough texture of the wood.\n\nAbove the sign, part of the roof structure is visible, characterized by dark-stained wooden beams and rafters that add an element of depth and detail to the scene. The mood is somewhat moody and dim, possibly due to the weather or the time of day, imbuing the photograph with a sense of somberness or nostalgia.\n\nAn electrical wire runs diagonally across the frame, partially intersecting with the peak of the gable and adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise rustic and aged aesthetic.\n\nThe background is blurred and difficult to discern specifically, contributing to a focus that remains strongly on the sign and the architectural details of the building. Overall, the image captures a slice of architectural heritage, emphasizing textures, materials, and the impact of time on man-made structures.","title":"Kewanee railroad station","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552534","553479","557643","547790","545355","552681","547808","557634","552511","558029","547894","550108","552964","557156","544088","551586"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["sign","peak","modernity","spell","wooden","heritage","wood","materials","construction","imbue"]}
