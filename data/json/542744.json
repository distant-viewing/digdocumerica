{"path":"542744.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque natural setting. In the foreground, there is a person engaged in fly fishing, standing in a clear, gently flowing river. The individual is dressed in casual outdoor attire, featuring blue jeans and a yellow long-sleeve shirt, and is holding a fishing rod with focus and concentration on the activity.\n\nThe background presents a majestic mountain landscape. The mountain, lush and imposing, rises steeply from the surrounding terrain, its rugged surface dotted with rocks and greenery predominantly consisting of dense coniferous trees. The sky above is clear and brightly lit, suggesting it might be a sunny day, enhancing the overall vibrancy and clarity of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the natural elements and the human activity, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature and portrays a typical outdoor recreational scene in a mountainous region. The clarity of the water in the river and the robust flora on the mountain add to the vivid and fresh atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542529","550665","554519","554520","543453","550317","542509","550313","552976","550217","542740","550666","543516","555576","542646","542522"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["clarity","mountain","fishing","vibrancy","coexistence","rod","flora","concentration","picturesque","lit"]}
