{"path":"555801.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large ship navigating through deep blue ocean waters. The ship is a commercial vessel, possibly a cargo or tanker ship, painted in a deep red with white and varying shades of gray. The vessel has a prominent white and red superstructure located towards the stern, with numerous decks visible.\n\nThe hull of the ship is long and narrow, equipped with what appear to be several cargo holds or tanks situated along its central axis, covered by what seem to be large hatches. These structures suggest the ship may be used for transporting bulk materials or fluids. The ship leaves a wake of white foamy water as it moves, indicating its active progress through the sea. The surrounding ocean is vast and mostly calm, with small waves brushing the surface, suggesting moderate weather conditions.\n\nIn the background, there's nothing but the open sea, stretching to the horizon, underlining the isolation and the specific focus on the ship in this maritime environment. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of motion and purpose within the vastness of the ocean.","title":"One of four New York City owned vessels dumping sludge into waters of the Bight. In 1973 there were 5.8 million cubic yards of sewage sludge dumped in the Bight. The volume is expected to triple in the next few years. Dredge spoils are dumped six miles from shore, sludge 12 miles, waste acid 15 miles, and chemical wastes 106 miles. Construction debris and derelict vessels also are disposed offshore.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555811","557819","557816","557817","550891","548201","545845","551990","544234","549613","555810","555789","545830","557818","550918","555721"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","ocean","cargo","vessel","hatch","tanker","sea","superstructure","fluid","progress"]}
