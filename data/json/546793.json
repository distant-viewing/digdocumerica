{"path":"546793.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene involving water pollution. There is a large concrete structure on the right side of the image from which a rusty, circular metal pipe protrudes. Water is flowing out of the pipe into a body of water, possibly a river or a lake, forming ripples and disturbances on the surface. The surrounding area consists of rocky, uneven terrain littered with broken stones and bricks, suggesting neglect or disrepair. The color of the stones varies from reddish-brown to gray, adding a rugged texture to the scene. \n\nThe overall impact of the image is somewhat industrial and dilapidated, highlighting human impact on the natural environment, specifically concerning water pollution and possibly waste disposal. The composition focuses squarely on the point where the effluent enters the water, emphasizing the interaction between the man-made structures and the natural environment.","title":"Outfall from the olin chemical plant on curtis creek in Baltimore harbor.
