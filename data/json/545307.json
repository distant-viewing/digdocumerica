{"path":"545307.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a young boy lying on his stomach amidst a bed of vibrant pink flowers. His gaze is directed towards the viewer, with a slight smile gracing his lips, conveying a sense of playful innocence. The boy is wearing a brown shirt that blends subtly with his dark hair, both complementing the vivid pink of the flowers.\n\nThe boy's hands are gently placed on the flowers, indicating a moment of interaction with nature. One hand is fully extended, touching the flowers delicately, while the other supports his upper body as he looks up.\n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring glimpses of grassy areas and a hint of what might be small buildings or structures, suggesting that this scene might be taking place in a park-like setting or near residential houses. The overall ambience of the image is serene and joyful, emphasizing a connection with nature and the simple joys of childhood.","title":"Environmental awareness is a scheduled subject for this 3rd grader at the Bryant Webster School.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["552942","551763","552035","543688","549254","553494","543870","543791","543871","544222","553170","555915","551765","549105","551684","543677"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","boy","innocence","lip","childhood","ambience","pink","joy","gaze","hand"]}
