{"path":"545727.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of yellow cactus flowers in the foreground, with a dry, rugged landscape stretching into the background. The flowers are bright yellow with delicate, layered petals and are blooming from a green cactus dotted with long, sharp spines. The cactus plants are scattered across the composition and appear to be thriving in the harsh environment.\n\nIn the background, we see a mountainous terrain with earthy tones ranging from dark to light browns. The texture is rocky and uneven, indicative of a desert or semi-arid region. The sky above is mostly cloudy, suggesting possibly overcast weather conditions which provide a muted, soft natural light that enhances the vivid yellow of the cactus flowers.\n\nThe overall scene is a vivid display of life in a typically inhospitable environment, highlighting the beauty and resilience of desert flora against a stark, formidable landscape. The composition effectively contrasts the delicate beauty of the flowers with the ruggedness of their surroundings.","title":"Prickly pear cactus blossoms","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544582","545709","554844","544894","545718","544885","544877","545722","545723","549018","544451","545296","544890","544891","544938","544879"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","desert","delicate","spine","thrive","ruggedness","petal","yellow","bloom","flora"]}
