{"path":"549480.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large urban area, extending toward a vast body of water visible at the top of the image. The urban landscape is densely packed with a mix of residential and commercial buildings. Several high-rise buildings are seen dominating the central portion of the image, set against the backdrop of the waterfront.\n\nThe city is laid out with streets that intersect at various angles, creating a grid-like pattern in some areas and more irregular patterns in others. There is a notable green space, a long rectangular park, which runs parallel to what appears to be a main thoroughfare.\n\nIn the foreground and midground, one can see mostly low-rise structures, which are possibly residential houses or small commercial establishments, with dense tree cover interspersed throughout. The skyline reveals that the city is a blend of modern and older architectural styles.\n\nThe body of water adjacent to the city adds a calm contrast to the busy urban environment. This, along with the clear sky with slight cloud cover, casts natural light that illuminates the cityscape, enhancing the variety of colors from lush greens to varied building hues. A distant horizon shows more water beyond a thin strip of land, possibly an island or peninsula, contributing to a scenic view that completes this urban coastal setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the dynamic nature of a bustling city transitioning into a serene waterfront, showcasing the density and diversity of urban life juxtaposed with natural elements.","title":"Buffalo--looking west toward downtown secton and lake erie","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["553790","556952","553672","552233","548453","549477","553677","556947","552223","552231","549505","553559","555720","552252","551509","552133"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","waterfront","thoroughfare","peninsula","complete","rise","establishment","island","diversity","intersect"]}
