{"path":"553135.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape. The foreground is dominated by jagged, moss-covered rocks interspersed with clusters of grass and small shrubs, presenting a rugged terrain typical of a volcanic or high-desert environment. One of the rocks prominently displays a small red and white object, which stands out against the natural colors of the environment, adding a hint of human presence or activity.\n\nBeyond the rocky terrain, the scene opens up into a vast, flat expanse that stretches towards a large body of water, which could be a lake or a distant sea, glistening under the sunlight. The water body is bordered by a mountain range that stretches across the horizon, contributing to a sense of expansiveness and tranquility. The sky is clear with soft lighting, indicating either early morning or late afternoon. This scene likely captures a moment of natural beauty and stillness, with no visible human activity except for the small, possibly man-made object on the rock. The overall composition encourages a view into an untouched natural landscape, evoking a sense of solitude and peace.","title":"Man-painted rock, found on a rise at the south end of Pyramid Lake, blends into the natural landscape.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552900","552891","542583","551553","553994","552894","551520","552904","550441","552905","549151","552906","555592","549448","552889","544155"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["rock","expansiveness","peace","object","moss","stillness","terrain","desert","range","body"]}
