{"path":"557606.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a large, dark-colored frog peering directly into the camera. The frog's skin has a shiny, textured appearance, possibly damp, and radiates an iridescent blue-black color. Its eyes are striking and prominent with horizontal, almond-shaped pupils surrounded by a delicate green hue. The frog is partly submerged in water, as indicated by shimmering water textures around its face and body. \n\nIn the foreground, there are a few green leaves dappling over the water surface, suggesting the frog might be in a natural, leafy water body, perhaps a pond. The lighting is soft, highlighting the glistening details of the frog's skin and creating a slight reflection in the eyes. The overall mood is calm and focused, capturing the quiet ambiance of the frog's natural habitat.","title":"Close-up of a bullfrog (Rana catesbiana Shaw) sitting on the edge of Tin Mine Lake, Washington.
