{"path":"546019.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a broad river. The waters, appearing slightly turbulent and rippled, cover the foreground of the image and show a mix of dark and muddy swirls. On the river, a large ship with a dark hull and a superstructure marked with rust or discoloration floats slightly off the center to the left, headed downstream. A small red boat is visible in the distance near the larger ship. On the right side of the river, there is a lightly wooded area, partially obscured by the river's expanse, indicating that the riverbanks are quite wide apart. A line of utility poles runs through the tree line, suggesting the presence of a road or path parallel to the river. The sky is clear, adding a calm upper boundary to the scene filled with natural and man-made elements in motion. The overall scene conveys a mix of industrial activity within a natural riverside environment.","title":"Oil spews from a damaged Liberian tanker after the tanker collided with a barge on the Mississippi River.
