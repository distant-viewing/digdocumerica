{"path":"557462.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area with a variety of structures and natural landscapes. In the foreground, there is a marina filled with numerous boats docked in orderly rows beside the water. Adjacent to the marina, there are several buildings that appear to be waterfront properties or businesses, possibly hotels or residential complexes. There is also a large, prominent white building, likely a hotel or office tower, standing taller than any other structures in the area, with a distinct modern architecture that stands out due to its height and design.\n\nThe mid-ground of the photo shows a developed urban area with neatly arranged rows of houses having uniformly shaped roofs, likely a residential suburb. The layout includes winding roads and open spaces. Beyond the residential area, the photograph captures a network of highways and roads that traverse the landscape, enhancing the connectivity of this urban setting.\n\nThe background is dominated by hills or low mountains, providing a natural boundary to the urban development. The topography varies, showing some areas with sparse vegetation and others more densely covered, possibly indicating different land uses or natural conservation areas.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph cleverly juxtaposes human development with the natural environment, emphasizing a blend of urbanization, recreational maritime activities, and natural terrain. The image effectively conveys the scale and scope of human infrastructure in relation to the natural landscape.","title":"Aerial of a marina development at Oceanside. Some 84 percent of the residents in the state live within 30 miles of the coast, which has resulted in mounting land use pressure, particularly along the shoreline. Regulatory commissions were set up in November, 1972, to supervise development within 1,000 yards of the coast. They must submit recommendations to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending a plan which will affect future development.","placename":"San Diego (Calif.)","location":"San Diego, California","nn1":["548638","548783","557422","545128","553790","554058","548784","556966","557451","556953","549528","549505","548779","549501","550363","557452"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["hotel","marina","urbanization","relation","suburb","scope","development","row","traverse","connectivity"]}
