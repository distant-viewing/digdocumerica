{"path":"550253.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rundown urban scene, possibly the aftermath of a demolition or severe neglect. The setting is an outdoor area surrounded by two traditional brick buildings, which give a sense of an enclosed, private space, perhaps an alley or back lot.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a large amount of debris scattered across the ground. This includes broken furniture (parts of wooden frames, a collapsed armchair, and a gutted sofa), numerous loose papers and pieces of cardboard, various forms of refuse and smaller litter items like cans and food packaging. Particularly notable is a large disassembled structure that might have once been part of a building or large furniture.\n\nIn the midst of this destruction, a solitary man is walking. He is dressed casually in a light-colored short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, with a belt and dark shoes. His presence contributes to a somber atmosphere, as he navigates through the mess with a demeanor that feels both purposeful and resigned. His path and the direction he is facing suggest he might be inspecting the area or just passing through.\n\nThe buildings flanking the scene appear aged, with features typical of mid-20th century construction seen in many urban areas. The visible windows are all intact and closed. One of the buildings has a small tree growing adjacent to it, adding a touch of greenery to the otherwise bleak environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph vividly conveys a sense of urban decay and neglect, highlighting themes of deterioration and the resilience or indifference of those who inhabit or move through such spaces.","title":"Behind unoccupied 1311 east boulevard, a casual dumping ground","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550246","549786","549785","557351","552757","557345","552750","550257","553555","553506","553476","550129","550264","552751","557350","547130"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["furniture","sofa","armchair","neglect","rundown","alley","demolition","inhabit","deterioration","navigate"]}
