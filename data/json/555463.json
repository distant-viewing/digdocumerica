{"path":"555463.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up of a weathered, silver-colored gasoline pump nozzle. The nozzle is mounted on a pump featuring a metallic and textured surface that appears silver and white. Prominently, a large padlock hangs from a section of the nozzle near its handle, suggesting measures for security or prevention of unauthorized use.\n\nThe nozzle itself shows signs of wear and age, with some visible rust and tarnish, which adds to the industrial and used feel of the equipment. The surrounding background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the pump and nozzle in the foreground. In the blurred background, dark and undefined shapes hint at the interior of a gas station or a similar utilitarian space.","title":"The driving public became so desperate for gasoline that many stations such as this one in Portland had to resort to locking their pumps in daytime during the fuel crisis of 1973-74.","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555510","547874","554784","555495","548169","548049","548173","548171","555512","555511","548175","555508","546153","555466","548053","548047"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["nozzle","pump","silver","gasoline","security","measure","gas","close","up","rust"]}
