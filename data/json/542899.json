{"path":"542899.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a California Western railroad motorcar, model M100, designated with the number X100 on its side. The motorcar, primarily painted in bright yellow with a white roof and silver accents, is partially emerging from a large, wooden train shed with dark, weathered timbers. The structure appears to be a classic railway depot or engine house, characterized by its large, open bay doors and rustic appearance.\n\nThe motorcar itself is detailed with various fixtures such as headlights, horns, and side mirrors, and it has both front and side windows covered by wire mesh protectors, suggesting it may be used in a rough terrain or under conditions where flying debris is common. The vehicle is equipped with a streamlined design and features a sturdy metal grille at the front. The words \"CALIFORNIA WESTERN\" are prominently displayed along the side of the car, emphasizing its affiliation.\n\nThe surroundings of the shed are not fully visible, but the ambient lighting and shadows suggest the photo was taken during the daytime. The contrast between the vividness of the motorcar and the dark, somewhat dilapidated texture of the wooden shed adds a dynamic element to the scene, bringing attention to the functionality and maintenance of railway equipment versus the age and historical value of the infrastructure.","title":"California Western Railroad","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542898","552604","556784","557944","556053","556022","556857","556058","555986","556782","542897","545960","552995","551007","546627","545931"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["shed","railway","depot","horn","affiliation","value","grille","mesh","headlight","fixture"]}
