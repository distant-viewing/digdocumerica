{"path":"542738.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows four distinct piles of natural substances, each with a unique color, arranged on a light brown paper surface. From the left to the right, the first pile is dark green, possibly sunflower seeds or some type of grain. Next to it, in the center, is a pile of light beige-colored grains, which could be rice or oats. The third pile consists of a bright aqua-colored granular substance, possibly colored decorative sands or crushed stone. The fourth pile, closest to the front, is navy blue, resembling the third in its granular form and possibly another variant of colored sand or crushed mineral.\n\nThe arrangement is on a flat surface that appears to be indoors due to the even lighting, which casts soft shadows behind some of the piles. The composition focuses on the contrast of textures and colors among the materials. The photograph captures the natural textural details of these piles and the way the light interacts with the particles, adding depth and dimensionality to the image.","title":"Natural grain in center, blue oats poisioned with pival for rat and mouse bait, green with strychnine for killing gophers, and grey with zinc for ground squirrels","placename":"Fresno County (Calif.)","location":"Fresno County, California","nn1":["542736","553582","552547","557582","550606","545521","543617","555194","555200","546156","543150","545597","555155","543695","550483","543149"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["pile","crush","grain","substance","sand","sunflower","seed","indoor","particle","mineral"]}
