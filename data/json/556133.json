{"path":"556133.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of an elderly African American man. He is wearing a textured, striped hat with a well-worn look and a decorative band around it. Beneath the hat, his eyes can be seen behind large, round glasses with thick frames. His facial expression is contemplative, looking slightly off to the side.\n\nHis beard is mostly gray with hints of black and is neatly trimmed, yet natural in style. He seems to be outdoors, as suggested by the blurred background that hints at bright colors, possibly from people or objects at a public gathering or market. The focus on his face, framed by the hat and the glasses, draws attention to his thoughtful expression, adding character and depth to the image. The lighting enhances the texture of his skin and facial features, emphasizing maturity and a sense of calm wisdom.","title":"Price Allen, the \"Peanut Man\", a sidewalk vendor on Chicago's South Side. He is one of the nearly 1.2 million Black people who make up over one third of the population of Chicago. It is one of many Black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. They are portraits of people living life as they find it, as individuals who are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556149","554857","556137","554858","547179","548226","556147","556478","542613","556084","544409","553091","547360","552103","548236","556452"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["hat","maturity","glass","portrait","beard","band","expression","market","skin","character"]}
