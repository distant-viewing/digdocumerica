{"path":"551956.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a dramatic sunset scene over a body of water, presumably a lake or sea. The dominant visual elements are the intense red and orange hues dominating the sky, which create a stark contrast against the dark silhouettes in the foreground and middle ground. \n\nIn the foreground, several indistinct silhouettes of people can be made out; they appear to be seated or standing near the water's edge, possibly on a dock or embankment. The water itself shimmers with reflections of the fiery sky, its surface textured by small ripples indicating a gentle movement.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo features a prominent industrial skyline. The silhouettes of several large structures, potentially factories or power plants, are visible. Notably, one large smokestack releases a plume of smoke or steam that billows into the sky, blending with the sunset. This industrial scene forms a sharp contrast to the natural beauty of the sunset, perhaps invoking themes of environment and industry.\n\nOverall, the photograph is both visually striking and possibly contemplative, merging natural and human-made landscapes under a dramatic evening sky.","title":"Fishermen on spit of land on Lake Michigan in Michigan City, Indiana","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["544707","550289","545430","545438","548123","550304","545418","548851","547102","545022","544708","546114","552156","545421","545030","552263"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["sunset","silhouette","embankment","plume","steam","ripple","smokestack","factory","dock","industry"]}
