{"path":"557387.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph displays an industrial scene, likely a part of a factory or processing plant. The composition is dominated by large, metallic structures which are predominant in gray and silver tones. There are several large ducts or pipes, one notably large in size making a curved shape in the center of the image. This pipe appears to connect different parts of the plant, with supports and bolts visible at its joints.\n\nSeveral tall, cylindrical towers or chimneys rise in the background and to the right side of the frame. They are equipped with external ladders and platforms, possibly for maintenance access. The sky is barely visible at the top of the image, suggesting the structures are quite large in scale.\n\nIn the lower part of the scene, there is a complex array of smaller machinery, possibly related to processing or ventilation systems. This subsystem includes various control boxes, smaller pipes, and metallic frameworks that support the more massive structures above.\n\nThe ground is not clearly visible, but glimpses suggest a concrete base, scattered with some debris, reflecting the industrial nature of the setting. The lighting conditions appear to be either during the day with an overcast sky or in shaded conditions because the light is diffuse without strong shadows or highlights.\n\nOverall, the image gives a feeling of an active, functional industrial site, emphasizing utilitarian design and robust engineering. No human figures are visible, reinforcing a focus purely on the mechanical and architectural aspects of the industrial environment.","title":"Mist eliminator tanks, duct work and the stack for furnace","placename":"Charleston (W.
