{"path":"548632.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a busy waterfront area in a tropical or subtropical environment. The scene includes different elements organized around a roadway extending vertically across the image:\n\n1. **Waterfront Development:** On each side of the road, there appear to be two different segments of a large, organized development. On the left, we see a vast field of what seems like parked cars or RVs arranged neatly in rows, suggesting a parking lot or an RV park on a flat gravel surface. On the right, the area is more built-out, showing buildings with red roofs, and more organized parking, which might indicate a commercial area or a residential zone.\n\n2. **Road and Bridge:** A thin, straight road runs vertically through the photograph, transitioning into a bridge that spans a clear blue body of water, connecting islands or peninsulas. The bridge over the water also has supports visible beneath it.\n\n3. **Natural Environment:** The surrounding waters are shallow, as indicated by the visible sandbanks and variations in water color—shades of blue and turquoise—which suggest coral reefs or sandy bottoms. This adds a vibrant contrast to the more industrial and man-made structures. The land masses show some sparse vegetation, indicating a relatively arid climate or environment where development might prevent lush growth.\n\n4. **Oceanic Features:** Patches of darker and lighter blues in the water suggest different depths, possibly areas of marine flora, signs of ecological variation that could include aquatic plant life, or merely shallow areas.\n\nThe photograph puts on display the interaction between human infrastructure and the natural marine environment, highlighting development in a possibly ecologically sensitive area. The clear, organized layout of the land contrasts sharply with the natural organic forms of the surrounding waters.","title":"Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key one of the lower Florida Keys, where Rachel Carson camped while gathering data for her book, The Edge of the Sea (1955).
