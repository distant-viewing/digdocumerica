{"path":"555924.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving a man reclining on a public bench. The bench is made of metal and has vertical slats painted in a dark color, perhaps black or dark blue, both for the seat and the backrest. The man is wearing a wide-brimmed hat, which covers his face, and is dressed in casual, light-colored clothesâ€”a gray t-shirt and blue jeans. His body is oriented in a relaxed pose with one arm draped over his face and the other resting by his side. You can also see a wristwatch on his left wrist. His legs are extended along the length of the bench, and he appears to be either resting or sleeping.\n\nPositioned on the ground beside the bench is a portable stereo cassette player, indicating a possible intent to listen to music while relaxing or that he was listening before falling asleep. The tape deck lid is open, suggesting that a cassette may have been recently used or is about to be played.\n\nThe surroundings are somewhat urban and stark, with a mostly empty background featuring a concrete ground that displays some cracks and minimal debris. The scene suggests a quiet time in an urban park or similar public space, where one can find solace or a momentary escape amidst a city setting. The lighting is natural, hinting that it might be either dawn or dusk, times known for their softer light quality and serene ambiance.","title":"Man lounging on a park bench with his radio on the reis park boardwalk in New York city.
