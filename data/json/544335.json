{"path":"544335.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and picturesque natural setting dominated by a large waterfall. The waterfall flows vigorously down a reddish-brown rocky cliff into a vibrant turquoise pool of water. The waterfall is framed by lush green foliage, reflecting a bright sunny day with clear skies that contribute to the vibrancy of the colors in the photograph.\n\nIn the foreground, the water pool formed by the waterfall is quite clear and calm, reflecting some light and providing a strong contrast to the force of the waterfall. The edge of the pool is bordered by natural elements like rocks, tree roots, and small plants, adding to the wild and natural aesthetics of the scene.\n\nThere are several people enjoying the refreshing environment; some are swimming in the pool while another person is seen sitting by the side, running their hands through the water. The presence of people interacting leisurely with the water adds a dynamic human element to the otherwise tranquil natural scenery.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes the tranquility of the natural world, juxtaposed with human enjoyment and interaction with nature, offering a snapshot that is both visually captivating and emotionally invigorating.","title":"Havasu Falls on the HavaSupai Reservation","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544350","549629","544101","544342","553068","544346","550979","544340","544343","544348","553397","549552","558087","548021","545874","557820"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","pool","root","vibrancy","force","world","water","enjoyment","scenery","cliff"]}
