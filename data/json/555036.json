{"path":"555036.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of three purple flowers in varying stages of bloom. The flowers exhibit a rich purple hue with dark, near-black patches and a bright yellow center. They have delicate, slightly ruffled petals. Two of the flowers are fully open while the third is still partially closed. The blooms are attached to thin green stems that are barely visible within the frame.\n\nThe background is artistically blurred, showcasing shades of soft violet, pink, and hints of green, which effectively isolates and highlights the subjects, giving the image a dreamy quality. The lighting is soft and appears natural, enhancing the vibrant colors and delicate textures of the flowers. The overall composition of the image focuses on the beauty and intricate details of the blooms, evoking a sense of tranquility and the essence of nature.","title":"Flowers growing on an ocean strip in the Pacific Coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547613","558075","545707","550462","553366","555024","551368","557618","550464","555035","543597","554574","542970","554576","557167","555034"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["bloom","flower","green","petal","stage","essence","subject","tranquility","hint","quality"]}
