{"path":"543303.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene under a clear, blue sky. In the foreground, distinctive, windswept trees with sparse foliage bend dramatically over a sandy beach dotted with people engaged in leisure activities such as walking and sitting. The trees are probably cypress or pine, known for their ability to thrive in coastal environments.\n\nThe sandy beach occupies the middle ground of the image, stretching laterally across the frame. Small groups of people can be seen enjoying the beach; some are walking along the shore, while others are sitting or laying on the sand, perhaps sunbathing or relaxing.\n\nIn the background, gentle waves wash onto the shore, hinting at a calm ocean. Further back, the coastline extends into a hilly landscape partially covered with low-lying clouds or fog, which is typical for coastal areas. This rolling terrain is dotted with greenery, likely shrubs and trees adapted to seaside environments.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its natural curvature of the shoreline, the rugged and windswept trees in the foreground, and the expansive view of the peaceful beach leading into the hills, provides a picturesque and tranquil coastal scene, offering a sense of relaxation and natural beauty.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["545280","543296","547697","547596","546970","543089","547612","546953","548220","543287","548757","543193","544989","547592","547607","545162"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","dot","shore","sunbathe","curvature","sit","walk","adapt","wash","thrive"]}
