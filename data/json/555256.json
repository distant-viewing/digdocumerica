He is dressed in a long white lab coat and is focused on writing or taking notes in a small notepad he holds in his left hand, which rests on a piece of laboratory equipment. The equipment emits a light blue glow, suggesting that it may be involved in some type of analysis or experiment. The lighting in the room is dim, drawing attention to the glowing apparatus and the figure examining it.\n\nThe background is mostly dark with just a few details visible, emphasizing the working environment typical in research labs. The left side slightly shows other lab equipment or storage units that are typical in a scientific research setting. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting and setting seems serious and focused, typical of a professional research environment.","title":"An environmental protection agency technician develops pesticide samples which have been spotted on a thin layer plate within a hood and under ultraViolet light.
