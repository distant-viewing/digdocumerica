{"path":"554775.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverscape, likely during late fall or early spring judging by the sparsity of leaves. The setting is a calm, slightly meandering river reflecting its surroundings with remarkable clarity. The water acts as a mirror, reflecting the intricate patterns of bare tree branches above. The trees on either bank are dormant, with thin, twisted branches that stretch both towards the sky and into the reflection below.\n\nThe riverbanks are lined with a variety of shrubs and undergrowth, mostly in muted earth tones that suggest a season of dormancy or the end of one. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffuse light, enhancing the reflective quality of the water and giving the entire scene a tranquil, almost melancholic atmosphere. The photograph has a natural, untouched feel, inviting contemplation of the quiet and slow-paced natural world.","title":"Runoff sediment from nearby stripping has clouded this stream.
