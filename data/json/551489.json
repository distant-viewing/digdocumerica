{"path":"551489.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph portrays an interesting and somewhat abstract scene from an urban setting. It's taken from an elevated perspective, looking down onto a paved pedestrian street. The composition focuses heavily on a set of large, translucent half-spheres, likely made from glass or plastic. Inside these half-spheres are clusters of large, prominently displayed light bulbs, which are anchored to a central structure, possibly part of a public art installation or a unique street lamp design.\n\nAt the center of the image, below these half-spheres, there is a man engaging with a potted plant adorned with bright flowers. He appears to be tending to or observing the plant. His attire is casual, featuring a short-sleeved shirt and pants. The surrounding area includes more potted plants placed around his vicinity, suggesting an interest in beautification or green spaces within this urban environment.\n\nThe street itself is relatively quiet with no visible traffic or pedestrians aside from the lone individual. The buildings lining the street are modest and functional, characterized by blocky facades and minimal decoration. The overall feel of the image is serene, punctuated by the interaction of urban life and artistic elements, as well as the blend of technology with natural details such as flowers.","title":"The city of Minneapolis Dept. of Public Works has a maintenance crew who work exclusively on Nicollet Mall.
