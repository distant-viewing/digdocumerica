{"path":"545342.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and candid moment inside a vintage car, showing two people in a relaxed and informal setting. The setting appears to be within a taxi, given the details noticeable inside the vehicle.\n\nOn the left, most of the view is obscured by the open door of the car, painted in a vibrant yellow. The interior door panel is shown with a mechanically rolled window and retro, curved metal door handles and cranks. There is a young woman seated on the passenger seat. Her back is towards the camera, and she is wearing a checkered shirt. Her attention seems directed outside the front window.\n\nTo the right, a young man is seated, more toward the rear seat of the car. He is dressed in a light gray tank top and beige shorts. The young man is holding a drink can in his right hand, and his attention is directed towards the front side of the car, possibly looking at something or someone outside of view in the photograph. His expression conveys a relaxed and observant mood.\n\nThe front dashboard of the car is visible with a few items including what appears to be a meter or gauge (likely for the taxi), adding to the contextual clues that this is a taxi. The interior of the car is finished in a pale, possibly leather, with a simple and utilitarian design.\n\nThe scene outside the vehicle shows a daylit setting, with indications of a road or parking area lined with trees offering a glimpse of an urban environment. The lighting suggests it might be late afternoon, given the soft and warm quality of light that fills the car.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment likely from a few decades ago, judging by the style of clothing and car interior, conveying a sense of everyday life and casual interaction perhaps between friends or acquaintances in an urban setting.","title":"Teenagers in El Paso's second ward, a classic \"barrio\" on the border of Mexico","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["557866","547758","546093","557863","557874","545316","557841","549876","557871","552780","543856","548306","549869","555475","546849","549673"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["taxi","car","door","seat","interior","dashboard","gauge","meter","retro","leather"]}
