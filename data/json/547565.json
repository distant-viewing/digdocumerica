{"path":"547565.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a serene early morning or a foggy evening at a busy fishing harbor. Several fishing boats are moored at a wooden dock, with one prominently labeled \"TAMMIE.\" The vessels are sturdy and functional, equipped with tall masts presumably for nets or lines. The calm water around the boats reflects their details and the slightly muted sky above subtly hinting the presence of fog.\n\nOn the dock, a number of individuals appear engaged in various activities possibly related to fishing. These activities could include preparing boats for departure, unloading catch, or maintenance tasks. These people are clad in typical casual or work attire, suggesting a routine day of labor at the port.\n\nThe environment is characterized by a mix of functional harbor equipment, including crates, barrels, and tools, which are strewn around the area, contributing to the working nature of the scene. In the background, modest harbor structures or warehouses are visible. These buildings exhibit characteristics typical of maritime industrial facilities, likely used for storing gear and processing catches.\n\nAbove, the sky is ovary, contributing to a tranquil yet slightly somber ambiance that envelops the scene. Birds are seen flying or perched atop the masts, adding life to the still scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph vividly depicts the daily life and atmosphere of a fishing harbor, highlighting the blend of calmness and industrious energy typical of such environments.","title":"The sakonnet point fishing fleet","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["548235","546998","542905","542872","542911","546939","548228","543035","547549","550306","543358","545026","548229","543246","548546","547553"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["harbor","fishing","mast","boat","catch","dock","departure","crate","unload","characteristic"]}
