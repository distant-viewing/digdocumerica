{"path":"543281.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, rugged coastal scene. In the foreground, two seagulls are standing side by side on a rocky surface dotted with small patches of colorful vegetation, possibly succulents and lichens which lend specks of green, yellow, and orange to the scene. The rocks are irregular and weathered, suggesting exposure to harsh elements.\n\nIn the blurred background, the dark blue and turbulent ocean stretches across the frame, with waves visibly striking against jagged rocks, spraying water upward. This creates a textured contrast between the calm stance of the seagulls and the dynamic, rough seas behind them. The atmosphere appears misty or foggy, adding a sense of moisture and coolness to the scene. The overall mood is one of serene isolation, showcasing a snapshot of wildlife in a rugged coastal environment.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554600","547008","545122","543204","542919","553347","543282","543329","545130","557508","552146","543285","545173","543295","543307","543139"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["seagull","lichen","speck","stance","rock","moisture","wildlife","exposure","snapshot","orange"]}
