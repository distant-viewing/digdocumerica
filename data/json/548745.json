{"path":"548745.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal scene with sea oats in the foreground. The image focuses on clusters of slender, bending stems topped with plume-like, golden-brown seed heads characteristic of sea oats, often found in coastal sand dune environments. The grasses are captured against a background that softly blurs into a stretch of sand leading to a water body, possibly a lake or calm sea.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape includes more sand dunes and a line of shrubbery or low vegetation. Beyond this natural foreground and middle ground, a bridge is visible spanning the width of the water body. The bridge appears subtly, almost blending into the slightly overcast sky adorned with soft, fluffy clouds. The composition of the photograph, with the vivid detail of the sea oats contrasted against the more muted tones of the sky and distant landscape, creates a calm and contemplative mood, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the coastal environment.","title":"Sea wheat at Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key.
