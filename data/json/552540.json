{"path":"552540.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful moment of children playing in a park with a water feature. The image shows four children enjoying themselves around what appears to be a fountain or a sprinkler system that sprays water from the ground. In the center, a child with outstretched arms is standing directly under the central jet of water, seemingly in mid-jump or dance, giving a sense of movement and excitement. This child is wearing swim trunks and holds up a frisbee with one hand, adding a playful element to the scene.\n\nTo the right of this central figure, two other children can be seen closer to the camera. One, a boy, is standing and looking directly towards the camera with a smile, while the other is partially submerged in the water, visible from the shoulders up, also smiling and possibly holding a small inflatable ball.\n\nThe left side of the image is less focused, with another child who is partly visible and appears to be entering or playing in the water. The water itself is captured beautifully, with droplets illuminated by the light, suggesting this photo was taken on a sunny day.\n\nThe background includes blurred greenery and part of a traditional-style building, which sets a tranquil and possibly historic park environment. The overall atmosphere of the image is vibrant, carefree, and reminiscent of simple summer pleasures.","title":"Fountain at Glen Oak Park","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552539","551638","551667","550002","552737","551857","552702","551160","551446","553149","551639","556136","553229","557410","552703","544187"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","water","dance","swim","pleasure","ball","jet","excitement","droplet","fountain"]}
