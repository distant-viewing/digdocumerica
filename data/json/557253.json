{"path":"557253.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake setting. The foreground features a smooth, reflective surface of the water, mirroring the sky and clouds above. Midground is occupied by a dense cluster of trees on a small land formation, their green foliage contrasting with the blue skies. On the left side of the image, a small white boat is captured mid-motion, creating a spray of water as it speeds across the lake. In the background, a bridge spans the width of the lake, nestled between tree-covered hills. The overall mood of the image is peaceful, with elements of human activity indicated by the boat and bridge, suggesting a blend of natural and human-influenced landscapes.","title":"View of an outfall containing styrene emptying into Raccoon Creek which empties into the Ohio River.
