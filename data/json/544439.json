{"path":"544439.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant and picturesque natural landscape, primarily composed of a lush meadow filled with bright yellow wildflowers. The field is scattered with various green trees and patches of bushes, contributing to the verdant, diversified texture of the scenery. The background is partially obscured by the density of the trees, suggesting the meadow might be part of a larger forested area.\n\nSunlight dapples through the foliage, enhancing the vividness of the yellow flowers and creating a pattern of light and shadow across the scene, lending depth and a dynamic quality to the image. There appears to be no visible human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched, serene quality of the natural environment. The overall composition and the natural lighting conditions give the photograph a peaceful, almost idyllic feel, inviting the viewer to appreciate the beauty of the wild, natural setting.","title":"Texas--near Lake Austin","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["544443","556990","551370","557099","550781","557098","549158","552503","544574","542704","557191","542615","545847","549229","545723","544938"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["meadow","quality","vividness","wildflower","density","scenery","bush","flower","foliage","field"]}
