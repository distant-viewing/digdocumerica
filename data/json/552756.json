{"path":"552756.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from an urban street that appears moderately worn and historical in setting. It features a narrow street flanked by rows of red-bricked, two- or three-story townhouses with stoops and several windows, some of which have window guards. The road is lined with multiple vintage cars, suggesting the photo may be set in the mid-20th century. The cars are parked along one side of the street, and their models and the styling look typical of the 1960s.\n\nIn the foreground, a young child can be seen walking alone down the middle of the street towards the camera. The child is wearing a green jacket and appears small in comparison to the surrounding cars and buildings, emphasizing a sense of vulnerability or solitude. Further down the street, several adult figures are engaged in various activities; one person seems to be entering or exiting a building, while another stands by a car.\n\nThe setting has a gritty feel, complemented by an overcast sky and a street surface that shows signs of wear and scattered debris. There's no greenery in sight, adding to the urban environment's stark and hardened aesthetic. The overall mood is somewhat solemn, capturing a moment of everyday life in a working-class neighborhood. The color palette is primarily muted with the red of the brick buildings providing a subtle contrast.","title":"Street scene","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552965","555942","552743","549287","553493","555895","556170","557278","545351","555900","553552","552742","555940","552761","553550","556454"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["street","car","guard","vulnerability","styling","townhouse","comparison","solemn","child","class"]}
