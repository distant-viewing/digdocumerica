{"path":"555649.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a heartwarming moment in a swimming pool featuring a woman and a young girl, likely sharing a joyful, educational swimming experience. The woman, positioned with her back to the camera, has her hair pulled up in a casual bun and is wearing a dark blue swimsuit. She gently holds the young girl in front of her, supporting her in the water.\n\nThe young girl, facing the woman, appears to be laughing or talking, exhibiting a look of happiness and relaxation. Her expressions and glee are vivid, suggesting a strong connection and enjoyment in the moment shared with the woman, possibly her mother or teacher.\n\nThe water in the pool is a clear, turquoise color, shimmering with light and reflecting gentle waves created by their movement. The background is largely indistinct due to the focus on the subjects and the reflective quality of the water, emphasizing the intimacy and secluded feeling of their interaction. \n\nOverall, the composition and the soft natural lighting enhance the serene and affectionate atmosphere of the scene, portraying a simple yet profound moment of connection and learning between the two individuals.","title":"Mother and daughter in a public swimming pool in Washington, district of Columbia","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556293","548584","543863","551473","549103","552702","546851","553449","548583","554904","548113","551409","551548","548550","553071","556299"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["girl","swimming","pool","woman","share","connection","teacher","bun","mother","happiness"]}
