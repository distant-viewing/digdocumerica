{"path":"554490.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic, aerial view from a chairlift with lush, extensive landscapes in the background. A person is sitting on a single chair of the lift, which is suspended from a cable. The chairlift offers a sweeping view of a mountainous terrain and a lake dotted with islands. The person, dressed in a red shirt, black pants, and black shoes, is gazing out towards the horizon, seemingly absorbed in the natural beauty. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright but overcast day, which casts soft light on the undulating hills and water below. The composition of the image, with its focus on the suspended chair against the vast backdrop, emphasizes both the height and the serene, expansive environment. The image encapsulates a moment of quiet solitude and the grandeur of the natural landscape.","title":"Mccauley mountain, New York, chair lift gives tourists a panoramic view in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554248","554247","554254","543535","550641","554455","545753","554653","554514","550423","543761","555690","553825","552144","550629","550413"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["suspend","chair","absorb","person","island","undulate","lift","cable","shoe","grandeur"]}
