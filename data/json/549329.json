{"path":"549329.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a rocky waterfront area with various people engaged in different activities. In the foreground, numerous individuals are spread out across a rocky shore. The people, comprising both men and women, are mostly in light summer clothing such as shorts and tank tops, and some are in swimwear. They appear to be involved in various leisurely activities such as sunbathing, walking, standing, and sitting on the rocks. A few appear to be fishing, with fishing poles extended out over the water.\n\nIn the background, there is a prominent building with a classical architectural style characterized by multiple stories, balconies with railings, and a faded pink fa√ßade. The building is flanked by lush green trees and another similarly styled building. A row of cars, typical of a mid- to late-20th-century European model, lines the street directly in front of the building, suggesting the photograph may have been taken in that era. On the street, a few more people are visible, either walking or standing, contributing to the busy, communal atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its blend of natural rocky textures and urban elements, alongside a relaxed, summertime vibe, suggests a coastal town likely popular with visitors and locals for its waterfront charm and recreational opportunities.","title":"The Adriatic Sea coast attracts tourist fishermen.
