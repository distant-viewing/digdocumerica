{"path":"544927.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a striking view of ancient cliff dwellings nestled within a large, shadowed cave-like recess in a sandstone cliff. These structures, characterized by their sandy color and architectural form, blend seamlessly into the rocky backdrop. The dwellings show a series of multi-story buildings made of stone and adobe, with visible rectangular doorways and round tower-like structures, which suggest a highly organized community and advanced building practices.\n\nIn the foreground, a curved path lined with a low stone wall leads toward the dwellings, implying accessibility for visitors or researchers. The environment around the cliff is arid, with sparse vegetation including bushes and small trees, primarily conifers, which cling to the rugged terrain. The clear, blue sky suggests a sunny, dry climate, typical of a desert or semi-arid region.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the harmony between the ancient human structures and the natural environment, highlighting the ingenuity and adaptability of the builders who once inhabited this secluded area. The cliff above and surrounding rock formations provide a natural protective shield, giving the site a secluded, almost hidden feel, which might have been strategic for defense or climate control.","title":"Cliff palace, first major ruin discovered in the mesa verde","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["544953","544952","544922","544941","544951","544948","545554","544421","544919","545567","544949","545550","545565","545817","545584","555286"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dwelling","cliff","climate","recess","stone","cave","inhabit","cling","harmony","shield"]}
