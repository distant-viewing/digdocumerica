{"path":"557467.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows a scene with a group of people in an outdoor setting that appears to be a large sandy area, possibly a construction site or a sandy dune environment. On the left, a prominent sign is fixed on a pole, reading \"KEEP OUT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY ENTERPRISE,\" suggesting the area is restricted. A male figure stands near this sign, pointing upwards, as if emphasizing the message of the sign.\n\nTo the right, a group of five people are captured walking towards or standing on top of a sand mound. The group includes four women and one man. Their attire suggests a casual setting, possible a group outing or a visit. The women wear casual summer clothing, like shorts and tank tops, while the man wears trousers and a lighter-colored shirt. The background is quite plain, mainly showing the blue sky and some further mounds of sand, emphasizing the barren, undeveloped nature of the landscape. \n\nThe scene captures a juxtaposition of leisure (the group of people casually dressed and exploring) against a backdrop of prohibition (the warning sign), suggesting a narrative of exploration or accidental trespass in a usually off-limits area. The bright daylight and clear skies add a vividness to the setting, highlighting the isolation and the open, undeveloped nature of the surroundings.","title":"Employee near the construction site for the expansion of the San Nofre Nuclear Generating Plant warns swimmers to detour to the beach. Located south of Los Angeles, the work area has a sea wall which forces swimmers to detour and swim about 100 yards to reach the other beach area. Between 1900 and the early 1970's the amount of coastal wetlands decreased from 381,000 to about 125,000 acres. State regulatory commissions currently are monitoring shoreline development.","placename":"San Clemente (Calif.)","location":"San Clemente, California","nn1":["544093","544085","553112","545596","544740","545102","545702","544108","545199","543534","552286","545776","549037","544821","555397","542601"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["group","mound","sign","sand","enterprise","limit","dune","warning","people","vividness"]}
