{"path":"554060.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a weathered informational sign. The text on the sign is fairly comprehensive and states: \"Kapalua Beach is owned and maintained by Maui Land & Pineapple Company & Inc. Its use by the public is revocable at will. Please keep the beach clean for yours and otherâ€™s pleasure. The beach is closed after 10:00 P.M. No camping in this area. Please observe posted areas.\" The text is in all capital letters, increasing its visibility and emphasis.\n\nThe background of the image shows dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, suggesting the sign is located in a shaded, possibly wooded area near the beach. The lighting conditions indicate that the photo was taken during the day. Additionally, the shadows cast on the sign reflect the shapes of the surrounding tree branches, integrating the natural environment subtly into the composition of the image. Overall, the photograph conveys a regulatory message about the use of a private beach area, emphasizing cleanliness and restricted access.","title":"Access to beaches is not yet a critical problem on Maui, but signs like this may be a foretaste of the future.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554168","554119","554001","545248","543168","554038","543420","548846","553956","547973","544263","554103","547836","557441","545109","548670"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["beach","sign","public","text","cleanliness","capital","pleasure","use","camping","message"]}
