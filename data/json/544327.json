{"path":"544327.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene involving a large wooden crate or truck bed that is modified to carry people. The structure appears robust, with wooden planks and reinforced corners. The top of the crate is covered with a tarp, partially protecting the interior from external elements. Through an open section, you can see several people inside.\n\nThree individuals are visible in the image. One person, visible on the left, wears a cap and seems to be looking directly at the camera, exuding a sense of alertness or curiosity. This person's face shows mild exposure, with a focused expression. In the middle, only a small portion of another person's head is visible, peeking over the edge. To the right, another individual leans on the crateâ€™s edge; visible are their arm and part of their torso, suggesting a relaxed or tired posture. This person wears a white, sleeveless top.\n\nIn terms of clothing, all visible attire appears casual, appropriate for travel or a potentially rugged journey. The background behind the crate is relatively nondescript, mainly a light, blurry blue that could suggest a sky or a plain backdrop, providing no additional context about the location or environment.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of transit or movement, possibly suggesting migration, dislocation, or travel. The expressions and positioning of the individuals convey a blend of readiness and weariness. The mood is somewhat pensive, reflecting on the conditions or the journey ahead.","title":"Taking shelter during a dust storm","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553819","552360","554543","553117","556533","545094","544402","544329","544802","543478","554199","557110","556705","553736","549373","554685"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["crate","journey","person","travel","alertness","torso","tarp","readiness","individual","positioning"]}
