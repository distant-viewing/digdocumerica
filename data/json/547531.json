{"path":"547531.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene with significant environmental pollution. In the background, there are two prominent factory buildings, each with a tall chimney. Thick smoke is billowing from these chimneys and contributing to a large, dense cloud of pollution that dominates the scene. The smoke is a dark gray color, merging into a brown haze that diffuses across the photograph, possibly indicating the presence of pollutants.\n\nThe landscape around the factories is barren and flat, with small patches of snow or reflective puddles scattered across the foreground, suggesting a cold or wintry environment. The vegetation is sparse, with only a few small, bare branches visible in the lower part of the photo, which could indicate that the area is not very conducive to plant life, possibly due to industrial activity.\n\nThe overall tone and color of the photograph are somewhat faded and have a reddish-pink tint, which might be an effect of the photographic process or the time of day when the photo was taken, indicating either dawn or dusk with the sun low on the horizon. This lighting gives the scene a somewhat eerie or surreal atmosphere, highlighting the environmental impact of industrial activity.","title":"Open burning at city dump","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["550176","551054","557218","545447","550981","550875","546884","550983","550181","551052","550172","550992","545507","551053","551026","545392"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","factory","pollution","smoke","pollutant","puddle","tint","reddish","low","merge"]}
