{"path":"550692.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavy-duty construction vehicle—a crane, set in a wooded area, likely part of a construction or logging site given the environment. The crane is predominantly orange, with the name \"Northeast Erectors Bow, N.H.\" emblazoned in white text on the side of its cabin. Its tracks and the crane arm are visible, emphasizing its robust, industrial nature.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured by foliage, there is a sign that reads “BEYOND THIS POINT RADIOLOGICAL CONTROL AREA,” which suggests the presence of a controlled or hazardous area, possibly related to energy production or scientific research given the reference to radiological control. The surrounding area is green and lush, indicating a relatively undeveloped site, and the ground appears muddy and disturbed, typical of sites under construction or heavy use.","title":"Widening a road in the \"Shelburne Birches\" area near Shelburne, on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["548773","544157","557729","545655","545653","547181","548559","548772","545887","545648","548775","555593","554830","544156","547171","554545"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["crane","site","construction","reference","duty","production","cabin","research","energy","control"]}
