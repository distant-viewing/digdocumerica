{"path":"544979.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, a young Caucasian man with mid-length brown hair and a mustache is standing outdoors on a sunny day, smiling as he prepares food. He is wearing a t-shirt that says \"STADIUM TIGERS\" with a graphic of a tiger's face and paws, along with a pale apron over jeans. The man wears white gloves and is handling large slabs of raw salmon, threading them onto a wooden skewer.\n\nBehind him, the setting includes a pile of chopped firewood and a rustic outdoor grill setup consisting of a metal frame holding a grilling grate. There are other skewers of salmon laid out on the grill, with each skewer being quite long, extending across the length of the grill. The background suggests a casual outdoor environment, likely a backyard or campsite, with trees visible under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of outdoor culinary activity, possibly at a social gathering or community event focusing on cooking and eating together.","title":"Salmon bake, fund-raising affair for community of browns point","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544974","544983","557801","544986","545017","549451","557934","546127","552808","554511","552315","551275","543987","551276","557700","552329"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["grill","salmon","length","thread","chop","cook","slab","graphic","campsite","apron"]}
