{"path":"550044.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling outdoor flower market in an urban setting. The market is filled with a vibrant array of flowers in various colors and types: yellows, pinks, reds, and whites prominently display among neatly organized flower beds, which are distinguished by their bountiful blooms and lush foliage.\n\nIn the center of the image, visitors are interspersed among the flowers, adding a dynamic human element to the scene. There is a couple walking together through the market; the man is dressed in a suit and tie, and he holds some papers, while the woman next to him is wearing a light, spring-colored outfit. Near the left side of the photograph, another woman in a long coat and lighter pants stands somewhat apart from others, maybe in contemplation or selection of flowers.\n\nOverlooking the market from behind is a red brick building with an arched design and multiple windows, suggesting a historical or significant architectural structure in the city. In the backdrop, parts of other modern and older buildings can be glimpsed, indicating that the flower market is situated in a developed urban area with a mix of old and new architecture.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its blend of natureâ€™s colors through the flowers against the urban backdrop, along with people enjoying the environment, offers a lively and picturesque city scene. The image suggests a warm, sunny day based on the bright lighting and the shadows cast by structures and people.","title":"Faneuil Square outdoor market","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550027","551697","553242","551698","551699","549924","549994","551685","551838","551779","551743","551794","551700","557257","551746","551644"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["market","flower","selection","city","pink","bloom","bed","woman","tie","yellow"]}
