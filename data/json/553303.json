{"path":"553303.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph is an aerial or high-angle view of a large parking lot filled with numerous cars. The cars are tightly packed and are arranged in multiple rows that run vertically in the image. Each row contains several cars, and the colors of the cars vary widely, with shades like red, blue, green, black, white, yellow, and gray readily identifiable.\n\nThe arrangement of the cars is orderly, and the parking lot surface beneath them is visible, showing dirt-covered ground with few visible demarcations for parking spaces, suggesting an informal setup rather than a formally painted lot. There are no visible buildings or people in the photograph, focusing solely on the density and pattern of the parked cars.\n\nThe image gives a sense of busy activity without showing any motion or individuals, implying a location likely frequented by many, possibly near a public or commercial facility. The diverse colors and models of the cars might indicate the photograph was taken in an era when car design varied greatly, possibly in the 1970s or 1980s, evident from their vintage styles.","title":"Downtown parking lot","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["546879","556721","548432","547826","546813","546685","554349","547480","556722","550100","546900","542635","547686","556773","556197","549875"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","lot","parking","demarcation","row","density","arrangement","model","setup","1970"]}
