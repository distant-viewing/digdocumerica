{"path":"545889.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph displays an expansive aerial view of a large industrial area along a river. The industrial complex is extensive, consisting of multiple large rectangular buildings with sloped roofs, likely warehouses or plants specific to heavy industry. The foreground features the largest buildings, characterized by their significant size and metallic exteriors.\n\nTo the side of these main structures, there are several towering smokestacks emitting fumes, indicating ongoing industrial processes. Numerous storage tanks of various sizes can also be seen distributed across the plant, suggesting the storage of chemicals or gases.\n\nThe complex is well-connected by a network of roads and railway tracks; a large section of these tracks is prominently filled with rows of railcars, indicating the facility's reliance on rail transport. Near the river, several cargo ships are docked, pointing to the import and export activities tied to this industrial operation.\n\nThe surrounding area is relatively flat, and beyond the industrial buildings the river continues its course, supporting the notion of this area being crucial for transportation and logistics. The green area across the river provides a stark contrast to the densely built and active industrial scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the scale and functionality of a heavy industrial operation, highlighting its infrastructure and modes of transportation.","title":"Armco steel plant.
