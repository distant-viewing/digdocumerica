{"path":"548199.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of a rural valley nestled among mountains. The landscape is rich with diverse types of vegetation, demonstrating areas of dense forestry as well as open fields. In the heart of the valley, there is a small town with residential and industrial structures. The buildings are scattered and are surrounded by patches of open green space, which indicates a sparse population density.\n\nTwo significant features are noticeable: smoke plumes arise from two points within the town, suggesting either industrial activity or controlled burning, which is a common practice in rural areas for clearing land or managing agricultural residues. The smoke adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene landscape.\n\nThe valley itself is flanked by high mountains, which rise steeply from the valley floor, showing little to no development, indicating their probable status as either protected areas or difficult terrains unsuitable for construction.\n\nThe lower areas of the image show denser tree cover, indicating less human intrusion and possibly regions of native forest or woodland. The topography includes gentle slopes as well as more rugged mountain ridges, offering a variety of landscapes.\n\nA clear body of water, possibly a river, snakes through the forest on the left side of the image, reflecting the light and adding a natural aesthetic contrast to the green and earthy tones prevalent through the rest of the scene. Roads can be spotted winding through the town and along the forest line which helps in discerning the scale and spread of human settlement in relation to the natural environment.\n\nThe image is taken in clear atmospheric conditions during what appears to be morning or late afternoon, given the angle and the softness of the light, which casts gentle shadows and gives the landscape a warm, inviting glow. This time of day accentuates the contours and textures of the terrain and contributes to the overall pastoral and tranquil vibe of the scene.","title":"Columbia River Gorge in the early morning light","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548172","552593","549116","543746","542998","552595","550525","550528","543750","557379","545042","556968","551049","556341","556915","546424"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","town","forest","mountain","relation","burning","population","status","residue","smoke"]}
