{"path":"557945.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a rustic, cluttered workshop or sawmill. It's an expansive yet busy space filled with woodworking equipment, lumber, and tools strewn about.\n\nThe focus is on two men, presumably workers, dressed in casual attire suitable for manual labor. The man in the foreground faces away from the camera and is interacting with the other man, who is seen in profile. They appear to be engaged in a task or a discussion related to the wood pieces or machinery surrounding them.\n\nThe structure they are in is large, with an open framework suggesting an agricultural or industrial setting. The roof of the building is supported by thick, wooden beams, and the walls are only partially enclosed, allowing natural light to flood the space. This setup points to an operation that likely requires ventilation, such as a sawmill.\n\nThere are piles of wood and logs, some cut into planks, others awaiting processing. The foreground is particularly cluttered with pieces of wood, sawdust, and fragments, suggesting recent activity. The presence of various long-handled tools and aged machinery parts, including what looks like a bandsaw blade, contributes to the industrial ambiance of the setting.\n\nIn the background, through the gaps in the structure, one can glimpse a tranquil outdoor setting, possibly indicating that this sawmill is located in a rural area. The contrast between the natural peace outside and the industrious, somewhat chaotic environment inside is stark, underscoring the hardworking nature of the individuals in the scene.","title":"Sawmill at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio. Operated on farm property, it is used for demonstrating how timber was used, and for reconstruction of 19th century buildings moved to the village. The saw is powered by a 1912 boiler and an 1889 engine. Steam power is generated by using wood not suitable for conversion into planking. The historic site is located within the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["554432","554431","554430","554428","556314","553614","557337","555533","546036","554429","554853","555472","542857","544022","553642","553648"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["wood","tool","sawdust","await","ventilation","machinery","piece","lumber","blade","gap"]}
