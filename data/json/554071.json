{"path":"554071.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and expansive rural scene, most likely depicting a grazing area for cattle. The image features a large herd of cows scattered across a verdant, sunlit pasture. The pasture itself is situated in a valley surrounded by gentle hills and slopes that recede into the distance under a cloudy sky.\n\nThe terrain is marked by varying shades of green grass, and there are several distinctive features that add to the pastoral charm of the scene. Firstly, a few isolated palm trees, which stand taller than the surrounding foliage, are visible throughout the area, emphasizing the tropical or subtropical setting of the landscape. Additionally, the fields are sectioned off by what appears to be terracing on the hillsides, suggestive of agricultural activity, perhaps to control erosion or manage water runoff.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dominated by a mountainous region, partially shrouded in clouds, adding a sense of depth and grandeur to the landscape. The lighting in the photo, likely either early morning or late afternoon, casts gentle shadows and enriches the color palette with warm tones, enhancing the tranquil and timeless rural atmosphere captured in the image.","title":"The hana area of Maui is mostly prime agricultural land and is not immediately threatened by development.
