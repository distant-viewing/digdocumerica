{"path":"556415.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image features a close-up portrait of a Black man looking directly at the camera. He is wearing black-rimmed glasses and is dressed in professional attire, consisting of a light grey vertical striped shirt and a dark tie. There's also a tie clip and what appears to be a pocket protector containing pens inside his shirt pocket, suggesting a scholarly or professional occupation. His stance and the close framing give the photograph an intimate and formal quality.\n\nIn the background, the setting is minimalistic and nondescript, with neutral-colored walls that appear to be of an office or a tacit home space. There is a slight hint of furniture seen behind him, possibly a chair, which supports the idea of an office or a home-study environment. The lighting in the photo is subtle, casting gentle shadows on his face and enhancing the thoughtful expression he maintains. The overall composition emphasizes his presence and personality, making it a powerful and engaging portrait.","title":"Levi Danials is director of field services for the United Mine Workers of America at their district headquarters in Charleston, West Virginia.
