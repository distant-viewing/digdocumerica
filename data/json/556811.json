{"path":"556811.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a gritty, urban scene focused on a subway train covered with graffiti. The setting appears to be a subway platform, a suggestion supported by the typical metallic exterior and design of the subway car, as well as the tracks visible at the bottom edge of the image.\n\nThe subway car is partially open, showing a man standing in the doorway, engrossed in reading a newspaper. He is dressed in casual, somewhat dated attire including a striped, long-sleeve shirt and slacks. His attention is clearly on the newspaper, indicating a moment captured during daily commuting routines, oblivious to the observer.\n\nThe exterior of the subway car is heavily vandalized with graffiti, featuring large, bold tags painted in black and white. The graffiti spans the doors and the body of the train, some parts dripping, indicating fresh application or the type of paint used. The styles of the tags vary, displaying different hand styles and flair typical of graffiti culture.\n\nInside the train, other passengers are visible, seated and standing, although details about them are limited due to the contrast and focus of the image primarily on the man reading and the graffiti. The windows reflect some light, as well as the shadows of the figures inside, playing with the perception of interior and exterior spaces.\n\nThe photograph has a historical feel, reminiscent of the late 20th century, possibly capturing a slice of life in New York City or another large metropolis during a time when subway graffiti was more prevalent and less regulated than today. The mood is one of urban decay and artistic expression, highlighting the contrast between everyday commuters and the vibrant, rebellious street art that marked that era.","title":"Graffiti on a subway car on the Lexington avenue line in New York city.
