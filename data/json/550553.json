{"path":"550553.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view over a diverse landscape that integrates urban areas with natural terrain. The image captures a river flowing through the scene, around which the urban development is concentrated. This development includes clusters of buildings that form a small town or city, roads, and an industrial area. Surrounding this urban sprawl are various patches of farmland, with fields in different states of cultivation, appearing in various shades of brown and green.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a hill partially covered in dense greenery, perhaps a wooded area, which sharply contrasts with the developed regions. In the distant background, beyond the immediate urban and rural areas, one can see a broader river and what appears to be more extensive industrial facilities, with visible smoke or steam rising, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the interface between human habitation and nature, illustrating how urban areas expand into and exist alongside the natural environment. The scattering of clouds casting shadows on the ground adds depth and texture to the aerial view.","title":"Alyeska Pipeline Service Company's pipeyard appears at left in this view south toward Fairbanks.
