{"path":"552395.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a dense urban skyline dominated by several large skyscrapers. It is taken from a high vantage point, looking down upon a cityscape that includes a variety of architectural styles.\n\nProminently featured in the center is a particularly tall building that stands out due to its height and the distinctive white vertical stripes along its sides. To the left of this building are shorter, mostly modern buildings with flat roofs, and a few older, more ornate structures interspersed among them. To the right, there are two very large, dark-colored rectangular towers, almost twins in appearance, which are among the tallest in the view. Further to the right, there is another tall building that appears to be slightly shorter and has a somewhat broader structure. \n\nThe environment shows development typical of a large city â€“ clusters of both high-rise and mid-rise buildings, possibly commercial or office spaces. At the lower edge of the photo and between the skyscrapers, there are what appear to be street roads with moving tiny specks that may suggest vehicles.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat hazy, which might suggest air pollution, fog, or simply a photographic effect. This haze slightly obscures the buildings in the distance and gives the image a muted color palette predominantly in hues of blues, grays, and whites.","title":"Sunlight and smog","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552394","549971","550202","549979","548386","549477","553674","548424","553328","551509","549476","548392","548385","548387","551510","548319"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["skyscraper","building","speck","fog","white","stripe","vantage","office","height","gray"]}
