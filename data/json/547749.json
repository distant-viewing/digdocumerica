{"path":"547749.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a leisurely scene by a lake. In the foreground of the image, a woman dressed in a red outfit is seated on the grass. She is holding and bending over to kiss a baby, who is wrapped in a light-colored blanket. Next to the woman, on the grass, there are a few items scattered around such as a soft pink towel or blanket and a Coca-Cola can.\n\nBehind the woman, at the lake's edge, there are four individuals who are engaged in fishing. Two individuals, whose figures are not fully distinguishable due to distance and silhouette, appear to be standing closer together, while two others are spaced slightly farther apart. They are holding fishing rods extended over the water.\n\nThe background shows more of the lake and some greenery on the opposite bank. There are also a few more indistinct figures around the lake, possibly engaged in similar leisure activities. The setting suggests a calm, sunny day perfect for outdoor activities. The natural light casts gentle shadows and enhances the peaceful ambiance of the scene.","title":"A Sunday afternoon at White Rock Lake, one of the city's most popular weekend resorts.","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552975","543164","552029","543609","554517","548737","553081","544230","546941","543892","544223","553082","550851","544033","543515","549935"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lake","blanket","fishing","woman","baby","figure","towel","wrap","grass","can"]}
