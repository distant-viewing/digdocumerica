{"path":"552599.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape scene, predominantly featuring nature's elements in a tranquil setting. In the foreground, there is a calm river reflecting the subtle hues of the sky and surroundings. Along the riverbanks, a dense collection of deciduous trees showcasing vibrant autumn colors in golden and amber tones are visible. These trees stand out brightly against the darker tones of the surrounding landscape.\n\nIn the middle ground, dark wooded hills rise gently, adding depth and contrast to the scene. The distant background features layers of mountains that gradually recede into the horizon. These mountains, with their subdued hues and soft shadows, suggest a beautiful, undisturbed natural environment.\n\nThe overall composition is bathed in the soft, warm light of either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the golden tones of the autumn leaves and creating a peaceful, almost idyllic atmosphere. There are no visible human elements or activities in the scene; it is a pure representation of natural beauty and tranquility.","title":"Rifle, the major town of the Piceance Basin, is located on the Colorado River.
