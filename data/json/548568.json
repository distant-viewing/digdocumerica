{"path":"548568.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a social gathering outdoors during what appears to be the evening, as indicated by the low light and sunset visible in the background. A group of adults is seated around a small table, engaged in conversation and enjoying a meal together. The table is set with what looks to be plates and possibly cups, suggesting they are sharing a meal.\n\nThe setting is a grassy area near a body of water, likely a pond or small lake, adding a calm and scenic backdrop to the scene. The water reflects the light and clouds above, enhancing the tranquil and pleasant atmosphere of the gathering.\n\nIn the background, modern buildings can be seen, suggesting that the location might be near a residential or corporate area. The architecture is simple with visible balconies or terraces, which could indicate the buildings are used for either offices or apartments.\n\nThe image has an overall warm tone, likely due to the natural evening light mixed with the artificial light beginning to dominate because of the setting sun. The presence of trees and flowering plants around the edges further suggests a well-maintained outdoor area possibly within a community or institutional setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of leisure and community, highlighting social interaction in an inviting outdoor environment.","title":"Neighbors at the Century Village retirement community meet behind their apartments for an outdoor supper.
