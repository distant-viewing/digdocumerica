{"path":"544027.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of a rugged desert landscape. The foreground consists of a slope covered with small rocks and sparse shrubbery, typical of arid regions. The slope appears dry with shadow patterns indicating the time might be either in the late afternoon or early morning due to the angle of the sunlight.\n\nThe middle ground features a diversity of geologic formations. There are several layers of hills, each varying in color, from dark brown to reddish hues. These hills present a textured appearance with exposed stratifications, suggesting erosion over significant geological timeframes. The vividness of their colors is highlighted under clear, bright skies.\n\nIn the distance, several more mountains appear. These are somewhat bluer and hazier, indicating their further distance from the viewpoint. These mountains provide a dramatic backdrop to the scene and showcase some eroded flat surfaces on their tops, indicative of ancient geological processes.\n\nThe overall composition suggests a desolate and sparsely inhabited or completely uninhabited area. There's a clear sky with no visible clouds, emphasizing the aridity and wide-open spaces typical of desert environments. The scene is devoid of any human activity or artificial structures, focusing entirely on the natural, raw beauty of the landscape.","title":"Tailings piles at Castle Dome Mine","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544401","544016","545789","552923","545895","545800","545771","544745","545804","545575","545843","545748","543665","555885","545790","545754"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","slope","stratification","timeframe","mountain","shrubbery","hill","vividness","diversity","viewpoint"]}
