{"path":"543787.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a cowboy riding a pale-colored horse in a rustic setting, likely in a ranch or farm area. The man is dressed traditionally, wearing a dark hat, which appears to be a cowboy hat, a long-sleeved shirt, possibly made of denim or a similar sturdy fabric, light-colored gloves, and dark trousers. He is sitting in a western-style saddle showing a relaxed posture, looking slightly to his left as he offers something (possibly holding a glove) towards something or someone not visible in the image.\n\nThe horse has a light, possibly white or gray, coat and is equipped with a bridle and reins. The mane of the horse is well-groomed and falls elegantly to the side. Both the cowboy and the horse exhibit calm demeanors.\n\nIn the background, there are wooden structures that suggest a rural or ranch setting. These could be fences, pens, or parts of a barn, underscoring the equestrian or agricultural environment.\n\nThe sky above is bright and mostly clear, indicating a sunny day. The foreground is slightly out of focus with a blurred, earth-toned object (possibly a rock or part of the ground), giving depth to the scene and focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the rider and the horse at the center of the composition. The overall atmosphere is that of a peaceful, everyday moment captured in the life of a cowboy and his horse, with natural, outdoor lighting contributing to the vividness of the colors and textures in the image.","title":"Cattle drive","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553118","544420","543776","554010","557041","544362","554011","553114","552564","552562","553814","557051","549198","554689","553116","557043"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["horse","cowboy","ranch","glove","rein","bridle","mane","saddle","exhibit","hat"]}
