{"path":"544497.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a cormorant perched atop a bare, weathered tree branch. The bird is facing left with its beak slightly open, displaying its long neck and dark, textured plumage, which contrasts against a clear, vivid blue sky. The tree branch on which the cormorant sits is vertical and appears brittle, highlighting its rough texture and pale color, which stands out against the blue sky. There is another similar, broken branch just visible at the bottom of the frame. The image is well-lit, likely taken during daytime under direct sunlight, emphasizing the definition and colors of the bird and its perch.","title":"Baby cormorant in Chokoloskee rookery","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544547","544489","544563","544477","555010","544559","548885","551378","557628","548490","543595","542919","557204","544539","557604","544505"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["perch","branch","bird","beak","plumage","neck","daytime","bottom","sit","leave"]}
