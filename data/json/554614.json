{"path":"554614.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures two scuba divers in the process of gearing up or checking their equipment by the edge of a large lake. The diver on the left is standing in the water, turned towards the other diver, and appears fully suited with a black wetsuit, fins, and a high-capacity dual-tank setup on his back. He is equipped with standard scuba essentials including a buoyancy control device (BCD), a diving mask on his forehead, and a snorkel visible on the side of his mask. His head is slightly turned, as if he is looking at the other diver or his own equipment.\n\nThe diver on the right is kneeling in the shallow part of the lake while working on the equipment that appears to be partially mounted on an inflated black rubber ring, possibly a support float or a personal decompression floatation device, which is common in diving for safety and gear management. This diver's setup is similar, featuring a blue BCD, a diving mask, and a red and white diver down flag attached to the ring, indicating active diving in the area to nearby boats or passersby.\n\nThe background shows a calm, expansive lake with faint hills or low mountains in the distance under a cloudy sky. To the far left, there's a glimpse of another sea vessel, possibly a sailboat with a white sail, cruising in the middle distance, which along with the buoy markers scattered around suggests this area is a designated water activity zone.\n\nOverall, the image represents an active moment of preparation in the sport of scuba diving, set against a serene natural backdrop, highlighting both the excitement of the underwater exploration and the calm, scenic environment in which it takes place.","title":"Two scuba divers from a New York City club ready their safety tube with flag which floats above their diving area to warn boaters.
