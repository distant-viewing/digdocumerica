{"path":"552507.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a strikingly painted red schoolhouse with white trim. The building features a distinct architectural style, with elements typical of traditional rural schoolhouses such as a prominent cupola with a weathervane on top. The cupola adds a charming historical detail while also serving a functional role as part of the building's ventilation system.\n\nThe schoolhouse has a steeply pitched gable roof covered with dark shingles that appear well-maintained. Below the gable, a circular emblem, possibly the original school seal or coat of arms, adds an element of authenticity and heritage to the facade. The front of the building includes an inviting porch, sheltered by a small roof supported by posts, which leads up to the central door flanked by windows on either side. This setup is typical for a schoolhouse, where such a porch would serve as a transitional space for students.\n\nThe entrance features a series of steps and has a neatly laid stone pathway leading up to it, reflecting care in maintaining the approach to the school. The surrounding yard is lush and green, hinting at a rural or suburban setting. There are well-tended areas with grass and scattered foliage around the building, which enhance the rural charm of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a clear blue sky suggests a beautiful, sunny day, adding brightness to the scene and contrasting sharply with the vibrant red of the schoolhouse. This setup invites the viewer to appreciate the harmony between the well-preserved historic building and its natural surroundings. The overall composition of the photograph is balanced, with the focal point being the historical architecture enriched by nature's backdrop.","title":"House in Marble Town","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["557171","553818","558162","552456","549626","557076","558146","550019","548295","557952","557750","546429","558035","558099","558156","558031"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["gable","school","porch","setup","authenticity","building","student","ventilation","heritage","harmony"]}
