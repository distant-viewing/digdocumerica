{"path":"550365.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This is a photograph set in a cemetery. The image captures a solemn and somewhat eerie atmosphere typical of such locations. Multiple gravestones are distributed across a well-maintained lawn, with lush green grass and colorful flowers placed at several graves, suggesting recent visits from loved ones. \n\nIn the foreground, to the left, there is an obscured gravestone, with \"PORTER\" visible. Other gravestones are clearly shown, one of which prominently displays the name \"ATWOOD\" at the top, and another with \"RICHARDSON.\"\n\nA peculiar element of this photograph is a statue of the Virgin Mary positioned centrally in the background. The statue is cloaked in a white garment, and it stands among the graves, which creates a serene yet haunting focal point.\n\nTo the right, a figure of an elderly woman, dressed in a dark coat and pants, is walking through the cemetery. She appears contemplative, looking downwards, possibly reading the inscriptions on the graves or in a moment of remembrance.\n\nThe whole scene conveys a peaceful yet somber mood, characteristic of cemeteries, where memories and the essence of those passed are revered and pondered upon. The natural lighting suggests that it might be either late afternoon or an overcast day, which adds to the solemnity of the setting.","title":"Eastport cemetery, Memorial Day, 1973","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["544267","558040","557942","552017","557184","552451","554792","550364","554824","547417","554790","550731","548239","554206","546147","557089"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["gravestone","grave","cemetery","statue","remembrance","memory","solemnity","inscription","garment","set"]}
