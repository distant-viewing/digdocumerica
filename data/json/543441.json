{"path":"543441.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of young people engaged in outdoor activities in a wooded environment. The setting appears to be a lush forest, indicated by the presence of large trees, including a particularly thick one with a dark, charred trunk in the background, suggesting it may have experienced fire damage. The ground is scattered with leaves and patches of sunlight that filter through the canopy above, creating a dappled effect on the surface and the subjects.\n\nThere are several individuals in the image, all appearing to be adolescents. They are involved in what looks like a manual labor activity, possibly a forestry or ecological conservation project. Specifically, the focus is on a girl in the foreground, wearing a white and black striped shirt, black pants, and wielding an axe poised to strike a small log on the ground. Around her, other individuals are engaged in similar tasks. To the right, a boy in a blue shirt and another in a darker outfit are also handling tools—shovels or axes—working on the ground or adjusting their grip on their tools. Another boy and a girl, mostly hidden from view and facing the others, are nearby, suggesting a collaborative group effort.\n\nThe attire of the young people is casual, suitable for physical outdoor work, including jeans and sweaters. Their engagement with the environment and tools conveys a sense of purposeful activity and learning, possibly related to an educational field trip or a volunteer conservation effort.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on active youth in a natural setting, emphasizes themes of cooperative work, environmental stewardship, and outdoor education. The inclusion of trees and natural light enhances the outdoorsy and earnest ambiance of the scene.","title":"Young conservationists doing trail work","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California","nn1":["543440","544003","545308","543439","557005","545311","557007","553601","554665","543927","544739","552944","543176","542732","542603","551427"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["tool","conservation","girl","effort","boy","wield","work","education","learning","poise"]}
