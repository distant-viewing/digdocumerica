{"path":"548352.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image presents an aerial view of the Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. The photograph captures the statue standing prominently on the star-shaped base that includes Fort Wood. The surrounding waters have a choppy texture, reflecting a cloudy or overcast sky which softly diffuses the light. Sunlight subtly highlights the eastern side of the statue and the ripples in the water, creating a serene mood.\n\nThe entirety of Liberty Island is visible, showing well-maintained paths, patches of green grass, and a few small buildings clustered near the base of the statue. A dock extends off the island, oriented toward the bottom-left of the image. There are no visible boats or people, suggesting a moment of quiet or the capture of the photograph during a less busy time.\n\nThe horizon at the top of the frame is filled with distant land, possibly parts of New Jersey or other areas surrounding the harbor. There are no significant landmarks in the immediate background, helping to focus viewer attention solely on the Statue of Liberty and its immediate surroundings. Overall, the composition offers a peaceful view of this iconic American symbol, isolated yet connected to its urban surroundings through the expanse of water.","title":"Statue of liberty, on liberty island, upper day, New York harbor","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553862","548351","555723","548349","555740","554351","549803","549760","549761","554350","549781","549763","548327","549790","547932","558115"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["statue","entirety","distant","base","landmarks","surroundings","star","symbol","harbor","island"]}
