{"path":"548962.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a dairy farm milking parlor. In the image, several cows, predominantly black and white, are positioned in individual stalls with harnesses and metal barriers securing them in place. The focus of the photograph is on one particular cow, marked with the number \"133\" on its side, and a worker who is attending to the cow.\n\nThe worker, a male, is dressed in a blue uniform and a white cap, crouched down next to the cow, appearing to be either attaching or adjusting a milking apparatus to the cow's udder. The machinery involved in the milking process includes metallic and rubber components that are connected to collection containers, typically used to gather milk efficiently.\n\nThe setting has a functional, clean appearance with a tiled floor that shows some patches of water or milk spills. The light in the space is artificial, possibly fluorescent, providing ample illumination for the task at hand. A clock on the wall suggests an organized schedule being followed, hinting at the regular milking routine that these farms adhere to. The overall composition of the photograph highlights the interaction between human and animal in agricultural settings, emphasizing the routine nature of dairy farm operations.","title":"Milking time on experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548961","548959","548952","554950","552669","554949","548960","552569","548957","548966","554917","558353","548967","548993","553271","548984"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cow","milk","farm","worker","schedule","rubber","harness","spill","stall","crouch"]}
