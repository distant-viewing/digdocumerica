{"path":"547744.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a serene and somewhat ethereal scene at a body of water, likely at dawn or dusk given the soft, purple-pink hues that permeate the image. The water reflects these gentle colors, contributing to a tranquil and slightly mysterious atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, several birds are observed engaging in various activities: one is in flight, its reflection mirrored in the water below, while others stand calmly in the shallow waters. Scattered throughout the scene are faint silhouettes of dead or dormant trees partially submerged, adding an element of desolation and stillness to the landscape.\n\nThe background fades into a lighter hue of purple, illustrating a sense of vastness and openness in the environment. The entire composition evokes a feeling of quiet solitude and natural beauty, highlighted by the minimal use of color and the stillness of the reflections on the water.","title":"Marshland and migratory birds at lake havasu national wild-life refuge, which is about equally divided between California and Arizona.
