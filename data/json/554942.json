{"path":"554942.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where a person is engaged in the physical activity of splitting wood. The person, wearing a light-colored helmet and a striped long-sleeve shirt, is actively using an axe to split a large piece of wood. The person's motion indicates a forceful downward swing of the axe.\n\nThe background of the image features a blue pick-up truck with a metal cage-like structure on its bed, parked next to a metal storage shed. The truck and shed add an industrial or utilitarian feel to the scene. Nearby, there are a few other miscellaneous items, like a large tire and a pile of logs, suggesting the area is used for work related to wood processing or similar outdoor activities.\n\nThe ground is cluttered with wood chips, small branches, and chunks of wood, evidencing recent and ongoing wood cutting tasks. The setting appears to be a cleared area, possibly a work site, where tree clearing or wood preparation is being conducted. The natural light illuminates the scene well, creating a vivid and dynamic composition.","title":"Worker from Mexico splits a cedar log with the aid of a steel wedge in a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553613","552109","558315","554411","542787","554414","555472","553643","553602","543588","554412","553614","554415","553604","553608","542773"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["wood","split","shed","person","cage","truck","chunk","swing","pick","chip"]}
