{"path":"556191.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features a bustling marina filled with numerous sailboats moored in calm, blue waters. The boats vary in size and design, most equipped with tall masts and arranged densely across the image. The background reveals additional rows of boats extending off into the distance, hinting at a large, popular sailing hub, possibly in a coastal area. There are no signs of people actively managing or using the boats, which gives a serene, static feel to the scene. The lighting suggests a bright day, possibly late afternoon due to the warm, softened quality of the light and the way it casts gentle shadows on the water. The image captures the essence of a tranquil maritime setting, focused primarily on the floating vessels and their orderly anchorage in the harbor.","title":"Marina in lake Michigan adjacent to downtown Chicago.
