{"path":"556987.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene on an asphalt road. The focus is on two geese that are standing directly on the road. These geese are visible upfront and centered in the composition. The road they stand on has a yellow dividing line that fades in the distance. On the road surface, there's a puddle reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding environment, adding a textural contrast to the dry surrounding asphalt.\n\nAt a distance on the road, there are three people walking away from the cameraâ€™s viewpoint. Their figures are not detailed, but it looks like a group consisting of adults and possibly a child, seemingly engaged in a casual stroll or conversation as they walk.\n\nThe setting is quiet and isolated, surrounded by an expanse of a flat, possibly rural landscape. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, creating long shadows and a slightly dramatic effect on the scene. The overall ambiance of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat idyllic, emphasizing a moment of tranquility and interaction between nature and human presence.","title":"Typical schold road \"traffic\" in mid-afternoon on a spring day.
