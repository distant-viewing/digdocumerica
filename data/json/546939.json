{"path":"546939.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil maritime scene featuring two moored fishing boats on calm waters. The boat in the foreground is white with visible rust and peeling paint, showing signs of weathering and age. It has high masts with rigging but no sails, likely equipped for modern fishing operations. A small cabin is situated in the mid-part of the boat.\n\nThe second boat in the middle ground is larger and similarly equipped with tall masts and fishing gear, possibly for trawling. This boat also shows signs of wear, with a rusting hull and a cabin at the stern. There are several people on this boat; one appears to be handling the equipment or the catch, actively engaging in a task associated with fishing.\n\nThe backdrop features a serene, expansive water body that reflects the partly cloudy sky above, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. In the distance, a flat, tree-lined shore stretches across the horizon, giving a sense of a sheltered and calm fishing area, likely a bay or river estuary.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a workday in the life of fishermen, highlighting the rustic and hardy nature of their vessels against a peaceful natural landscape. The image conveys a sense of quietude and the simple beauty of maritime life.","title":"These shrimp boats belong to a cooperative, one of the few Black-owned enterprises on the Sea Islands.","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547549","547553","552313","542903","548247","547565","548235","547556","548546","543035","542911","547557","542872","546998","547555","555719"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","mast","cabin","workday","fisherman","catch","rigging","quietude","weathering"]}
