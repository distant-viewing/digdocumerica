{"path":"545931.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an innovative, streamlined vehicle on a railway track positioned in a vast, arid desert landscape. The vehicle resembles a futuristic train car with a sleek, aerodynamic design, predominantly white in color with a red horizontal stripe running along its sides. Its front forms an elongated, rounded nose akin to a bullet, featuring circular windows and marked with streamlined contours to reduce aerodynamic drag.\n\nThe environment is quite barren; the ground is dry and mostly devoid of vegetation, suggesting a harsh, sun-drenched climate. The sky is a clear, deep blue, indicating a bright, sunny day.\n\nTo the left of the vehicle, a metallic structure, possibly a station or maintenance platform, is visible. This platform includes stairs leading up to the height of the vehicle door, suggesting it is used for entering or exiting the vehicle.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a testing or operation of a high-speed train prototype in a remote or isolated area, designed for minimal environmental resistance and high-speed travel. The imagery evokes a sense of avant-garde transportation technology being tested or demonstrated in a challenging, sparse environment.","title":"The limtv (linear induction motor test vehicle) is tested at the department of transportation high speed ground test center the vehicle is designed to operate at speeds up to 250 miles per hour it uses electro-magnetic forces for noiseless propulsion","placename":"Pueblo (Colo.)","location":"Pueblo, Colorado","nn1":["545960","545948","545946","545942","545939","545956","556111","556058","556784","555992","549131","555887","556003","555986","545964","548906"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["vehicle","speed","train","platform","test","imagery","reduce","nose","testing","exit"]}
