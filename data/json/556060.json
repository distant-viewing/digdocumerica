{"path":"556060.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an older man operating a train from the cab, giving a first-person perspective of the locomotive's interior. The man, wearing a denim jacket and a matching railroad cap, is seated on the left side of the image. He is focused on his responsibilities, working with various controls and levers typical of a train dashboard.\n\nThe interior of the train cab is detailed with numerous gauges, buttons, and levers, primarily colored in black and metallic tones. On the left side of the image, the dashboard prominently features dials and operational meters. Moving to the right, there are more specialized controls and a brightly colored emergency brake handle.\n\nThrough the cab's windows, blurred by motion and possibly dirt, one can glimpse the outside scene. The view includes railway tracks extending into the distance and a partial view of another train parallel to the one being operated. The environment suggests a cold, possibly wintry day, evident from the overcast sky and lack of visible foliage.\n\nThese elements combine to provide a dynamic and authentic representation of a train operator's workspace, illustrating the complexity and focus required to manage such a large vehicle.\n","title":"Engineer at the controls of the Amtrak Turboliner passenger train at St. Louis, Missouri.
