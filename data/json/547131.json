{"path":"547131.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a tumultuous sea scene underscored by a dramatic lighthouse and connecting pier construction. The environment is visibly agitated with frothy, chaotic waves dominating the foreground, indicative of strong winds and possibly storm conditions. The lighthouse itself is placed to the right side of the frame, and features classic architectural elements including a prominent tower capped with a lantern room, and an adjoining keeper's house that features a peaked roof and is painted mostly white with red accents for visibility.\n\nThe connecting pier, which extends from the lighthouse towards the left edge of the frame, is constructed with numerous arches and columns supporting a flat walkway above, all appearing quite elegant against the wild surge of the sea below. This rigid, geometric structure starkly contrasts with the organic, dynamic pattern and movement of the water.\n\nIn the background, the sky is a clear, deep blue, free of clouds, which could suggest that the churning ocean might not be due to a current storm overhead, but perhaps from distant weather systems or from notable tidal forces.\n\nOverall, the composition is balanced with a focus on the lighthouse as a steadfast sentinel amid nature's turbulence, evoking themes of resilience and calm within chaos. The absence of people or any other human element reinforces the natural and somewhat isolated setting of the scene.","title":"Breakwater and lighthouse on a windy day on Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547154","543086","545118","550361","544996","543141","547118","550362","551600","546151","547068","547916","542796","550314","543403","547091"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","storm","pier","connect","lantern","turbulence","sea","churn","chaos","force"]}
