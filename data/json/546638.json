{"path":"546638.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a broad urban street. The main focus is a heavy-duty tow truck, marked with the words \"POLICE\" and appears service-ready or industrial with machinery and cables mounted on it. It is painted white and occupies the foreground of the image. At the forefront, there is a partially visible person standing at the door of this truck, likely the driver, as the door is open and he appears to be facing outside.\n\nIn the background, moving away from the foreground, the street is filled with numerous other vehicles, including cars and possibly other service vehicles. The street itself is flanked by well-manicured trees and large buildings, hinting at a possibly governmental or urban commercial area.\n\nDominating the far background of the scene, under a hazy sky, is a clear view of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Its distinctive dome and neoclassical architecture make it recognizable even at a distance. The Capitol seems to be framed by the street perspective and appears far from the primary activities in the foreground. Streetlights along the road are also visible, some of which are illuminated, suggesting either early morning or evening lighting conditions that create a slightly dark, moody atmosphere. \n\nThe image effectively juxtaposes routine urban activity in the foreground against the iconic and symbolic government building in the distance, setting a unique spatial and emotional tone.","title":"Tow truck with female officer answers calls to open traffic lanes where necessary","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546641","554309","546649","546746","546645","546717","546743","552077","546741","546692","547226","546570","546679","546653","546693","546737"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","service","truck","door","tow","government","manicure","heavy","dome","flanke"]}
