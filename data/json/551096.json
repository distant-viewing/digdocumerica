{"path":"551096.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat unusual scene where industrial and recreational activities intriguingly coexist. The main focus is a large industrial facility, located in a valley surrounded by densely wooded hills. The facility includes a tall, narrow chimney and several large buildings that appear to house machinery, possibly for generating power or processing materials. Adjacent to these structures are several large, cylindrical storage tanks.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a baseball game in progress on a large, dirt field. Players can be seen in mid-game, scattered across the field with some running and others positioned for play. Spectators are gathered along the sides of the field, watching the game. The juxtaposition of heavy industry and leisure activity in this setting provides a striking commentary on the integration of community life with industrial environments.\n\nThe backdrop features lush, green hills that hint at a rural or semi-rural setting. towering transmission towers are faintly visible in the background, perched atop the hills, which reinforces the industrial theme of the area. This creates a contrasting and layered scene combining elements of nature, industry, sport, and community.","title":"Glasgow little league field.
