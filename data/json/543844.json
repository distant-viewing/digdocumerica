{"path":"543844.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic, rural scene dominated by a significant industrial structure and a group of animals. In the foreground, three dark-colored horses are seen in a grassy field. The horse closest to the viewer appears to be in motion, possibly trotting, while the other two are grazing or walking forward, heading away from the camera.\n\nIn the background, a large, aged wooden mining headframe towers over the scene. This structure, typically used in mining operations to lower and raise conveyances within the mine shaft, is built on a hill of debris or tailings, identifiable by their reddish-brown color, indicating possible iron content or rust. The structure appears weathered and slightly rickety, indicative of disuse.\n\nThe sky above this scene is overcast, lending a somber tone to the image and suggesting it might be taken either in early morning or late afternoon. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet abandonment, where nature slowly reclaims a post-industrial landscape.","title":"Mules run wild in mining district","placename":"Cripple Creek (Colo.)","location":"Cripple Creek, Colorado","nn1":["543848","543836","546130","542621","544726","544955","552091","555588","556958","555609","543668","549214","549191","552562","552501","556586"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["horse","mining","lower","shaft","reclaim","disuse","mine","iron","graze","content"]}
