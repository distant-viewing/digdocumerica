{"path":"557056.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up portrait of an elderly man with a cheerful expression. He is wearing black-rimmed glasses and has short, combed, gray hair. His attire includes a dark blue suit, a light-colored shirt, and a patterned tie. The lighting highlights the textures of his skin and the glint of his glasses.\n\nThe background, although blurred, hints at an urban environment with portions of signage visible, including letters that suggest commercial settings. The combination of focused foreground and diffuse background accentuates the subjectâ€™s facial features and expression, adding depth to the portrait. The overall composition and the man's affable expression convey a sense of warmth and approachability.","title":"Congressman Joe Skubitz, ranking minority member of the U.S. House Interior Committee, rides in the annual parade in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia. It is a part of the festivities of the Flint Hills Rodeo, a major cultural event of the area.
