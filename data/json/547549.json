{"path":"547549.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, judging by the soft lighting and the position of the sun. It features two boats on calm waters, likely engaged in fishing activities. \n\nThe first boat is closer to the viewer and oriented diagonally across the frame, moving from the bottom right to the middle left. It is a small, narrow boat, mostly submerged with its gunwale just above the water line. In the boat, several spherical buoys are attached, indicating the presence of a fishing net or line. There are two individuals on this boat; one at the stern managing what looks to be a net or rope, and another standing closer to the bow looking towards the water, possibly checking the catch or the condition of the equipment. \n\nThe second boat in the background is positioned more horizontally across the frame and carries several individuals who appear to be engaging in similar activities with nets or ropes. This boat also shows a portion submerged, suggesting it might be loaded or it is simply the design of the boat to ride low in the water.\n\nThe water is relatively still with gentle ripples reflecting the subdued sunlight, which adds a shimmering texture to the surface. The background is hazy, which obscures distant details, but there seems to be a faint outline of a shoreline with possible industrial or urban structures. \n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of calm and quietude, typical of fishing routines which often start at dawn, with the soft, filtered light suggesting the presence of mist or light fog, emphasizing the peacefulness of the scene. The color palette is dominated by muted blues, purples, and hints of orange from the sky, reflecting beautifully on the water surface.","title":"Fishing dories close in on trap nets they have set at the mouth of the Sakonnet River.
