{"path":"547911.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking and somewhat surreal scene at a body of water, possibly a lake or coastal area. The focus of the image is a submerged car that has been abandoned in the water. Most of the vehicle's body is underwater, with only parts of the rusted underside, wheels, and a portion of the body protruding above the water surface. The steering wheel of the car, still intact, is prominently visible above the water, creating a stark contrast against the calm surface.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a tranquil and expansive body of water extending towards the horizon, where land and industrial structures are faintly visible. The sky above seems overcast, casting a soft light that enhances the eerie, desolate feeling of the scene.\n\nThe water itself appears fairly calm but contains splotches that may be algae or debris, subtly reflecting the environmental impact of such human neglect. There are no people visible in the scene, emphasizing the solitude and abandonment of the car.\n\nThis image could evoke themes of environmental pollution, the passage of time, and the human footprint on natural landscapes. The vehicle, a man-made object once of value and utility, now sits as an artifact of disregard, slowly deteriorating and merging into the aquatic environment.","title":"Auto chassis submerged in Jamaica bay waters near breezy point","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547835","547605","546318","547839","546315","547481","555850","547132","547484","555849","547601","546173","548752","547597","549107","547024"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["wheel","disregard","body","water","underside","car","value","artifact","intact","footprint"]}
