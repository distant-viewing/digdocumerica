{"path":"543942.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and sunny water scene. In the foreground, a young person with short blonde hair is seated in a colorful inflatable boat. They are wearing a white tank top, and they appear focused on navigating the small boat using a double-bladed red paddle. The water around them sparkles with the reflection of the sunlight, creating a picturesque and luminous effect on the surface.\n\nIn the background, there are two larger boats moored in the water. One is a sizable white yacht with a dark cabin and windows, which appears polished and well-maintained. The other is a smaller, simpler white and blue boat that seems functional and less luxurious compared to the yacht.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph suggests leisure and relaxation, likely captured during a peaceful moment on a sunny day. This setting invokes a sense of quiet enjoyment and the pleasure of being on the water. The composition of the photo, with the calm water and larger boats in the backdrop, frames the central activity of the young person paddling and brings a focus to this simple, serene pursuit.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["549417","552316","549411","543881","553403","546976","547273","553411","546317","544115","552345","548080","552050","548736","552982","552292"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","yacht","paddle","pursuit","pleasure","water","sparkle","invoke","bring","person"]}
