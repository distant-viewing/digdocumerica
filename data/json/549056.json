{"path":"549056.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a man working outdoors in an agricultural environment. He is engaged with a large wheel or valve near a water canal, which suggests that he might be controlling the flow of water. The canal, filled with water, extends into the distance alongside a dirt pathway.\n\nThe man is dressed in work attire, consisting of a long-sleeve light blue shirt, denim jeans, and durable shoes. His attire indicates manual labor, especially with the inclusion of a hard hat, suggesting safety precautions are necessary for his task.\n\nThe background of the photograph reveals a rural or agricultural landscape. There are wide-open fields that seem to be under cultivation, and mountains can be seen faintly in the far horizon under a slightly hazy sky. This suggests the photo was taken in a valley or a similarly vast flat area dedicated to agriculture.\n\nThe composition of the image places the man on the right side, slightly bent over the control mechanism, focusing intently on his task. His position and activity draw the viewer's attention directly to the interaction between the man and the equipment, highlighting the importance of water management in agricultural settings. The overall scene conveys a sense of solitude and dedication to maintaining the crucial supply of water for farming.","title":"Vincent humeumptewa, hopi indian and employee of the irrigation district, opens canal gates near parker","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549063","543792","549078","543781","549053","555876","543795","549064","548869","544371","543804","549036","544250","549259","554203","545371"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["canal","control","precaution","supply","task","dedication","man","water","inclusion","cultivation"]}
