{"path":"552920.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a massive chunk of what appears to be salt or minerals floating in a deep blue body of water. The object is irregularly shaped with a rugged surface that looks crusty and porous, resembling a natural mineral formation. Its bright white color starkly contrasts with the dark blue of the water surrounding it.\n\nThe composition of the photo positions the mineral formation off-center, leaving ample space around it that emphasizes its isolation and uniqueness in the vast water. The water itself has a gradient of color that intensifies to a darker shade as it extends away from the object, suggesting greater depths.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or other objects; the focus is entirely on the interaction between the natural formation and its aquatic environment. The photo captures the serenity and the natural beauty of this geological phenomenon, providing a sense of scale and the vastness of the surrounding water.","title":"One of the rock formations known as the Pinnacles thrusts up from Pyramid Lake.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["550740","552887","545623","544774","555626","555860","544721","553348","550606","543126","555225","546110","552904","553867","552421","552889"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mineral","formation","object","phenomenon","intensify","chunk","water","salt","serenity","gradient"]}
