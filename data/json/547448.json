{"path":"547448.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene of maritime activity featuring a red sailing yacht robustly navigating through windy sea conditions. The yacht is shown at an angle, leaning to its port side due to the strong wind, with waves splashing against its hull. The vessel's sails are fully unfurled and taut, capturing the wind efficiently, propelling the yacht forward at a considerable speed. \n\nThe yacht itself is sleek, with a glossy red hull that stands out against the grayish tones of the sea and the overcast sky. Fittings and riggings are clearly visible, emphasizing the vessel's well-maintained condition and readiness for challenging sailing conditions.\n\nAboard the yacht, three individuals are actively managing the boat. They are dressed in casual, likely waterproof attire suitable for maritime activities. The crew appears focused and experienced, each attending to different tasks likely related to navigation and sail management to ensure optimal performance and safety.\n\nIn the background, the sea merges with a hazy, cloudy sky at the horizon, suggesting an expansive and somewhat isolated marine environment. The overall composition of the photograph captures the synergy between human skill and the natural elements of wind and water, portraying a moment of adventure and mastery in sailing.","title":"On chesapeake bay, the class 1 sloop wandelaar makes for the atlantic in the","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547460","547457","547449","548494","547456","549398","547454","547458","549391","549435","549387","549429","549403","549421","549428","549404"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["yacht","sailing","wind","sea","sail","hull","vessel","condition","rigging","readiness"]}
