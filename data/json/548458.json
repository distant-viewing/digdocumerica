{"path":"548458.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man engaged in a seemingly gentle activity within a traditional-style room. The man, who appears to be in his seventies or eighties, is shown reaching up towards the top of an arched doorway with one arm extended and his hand gently touching the wall. His posture and facial expression suggest a moment of contemplation or reminiscence.\n\nHe wears a light-colored, polka-dot printed shirt, and has a cigarette hanging from his lips, adding to the relaxed, yet nostalgic atmosphere of the scene. His other hand is relaxed by his side.\n\nThe setting is rustic and quaint with an old-fashioned charm, evidenced by the detailed floral wallpaper covering the walls, casting a pattern that contributes to the slightly dated, yet warm ambiance of the scene. The visible portion of the room includes a shadowed arch indicating a passage or threshold he stands by, and a curtain just visible through the archway, suggesting a window on the other side.\n\nThe overall lighting, soft and natural, filters into the room, illuminating the man and the wall, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the wallpaper and the worn, genteel nature of the room. The photograph, taken from a slightly low angle, focuses on capturing this poignant, solitary moment in a serene setting.","title":"Bernard picarello claims aircraft vibration caused this crack in the wall and other damage to his home at 112 moore street his home is directly under a Logan airport flight path","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["544232","548454","555532","547427","545974","558330","552104","553517","545986","555529","547313","553054","546105","556488","555430","553516"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["room","wall","lip","archway","cigarette","print","relax","curtain","doorway","hand"]}
