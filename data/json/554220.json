{"path":"554220.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a moment focusing on a woman dressed in a bright red jacket, seated and holding a can of Coca-Cola. She is featured prominently in the foreground, appearing relaxed and casual. The woman wears dark sunglasses and has her hair down, flowing over her shoulders. She is drinking directly from the can.\n\nThe setting appears informal with a bluish-black dim background which suggests an interior space, possibly a bar or a casual gathering place, as evidenced by the reflections and glimmers that resemble lights or glassware in parts of the image. The light source seems to be coming from her side or behind her, which creates a silhouette effect and highlights parts of her face, the can, and her jacket.\n\nThere is a subtle hint of activity or other people in the blurred background, suggested by patches of red that might be other individuals wearing similar red attire, or possibly more of the womanâ€™s environment reflecting her own style or the event she is attending. The overall mood of the image is one of relaxed leisure, with a hint of anonymity and style due to her sunglasses and the shadows enveloping her.","title":"Skier quenches thirst at Timber Line outdoor restaurant","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["543710","553541","557723","553275","554344","550940","553211","556613","545330","551458","545373","553217","543039","553191","554378","556414"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["can","sunglass","anonymity","glimmer","woman","glassware","jacket","attend","bar","drink"]}
