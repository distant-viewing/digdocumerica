{"path":"558227.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Rees, David","caption":"This photograph depicts two elderly women engaged in playing cards, possibly in a home setting. The woman on the left, partially visible from the side, is wearing glasses and a bright red top. She has short, white hair, and appears to be looking at her hand of cards which is spread out, though not visible directly to the viewer.\n\nThe second woman, slightly more in focus and situated on the right, is dressed in a green cardigan over a white blouse. She is meticulously examining her own set of cards. Her hair is also white and she has a calm, concentrated demeanor. Both women are seated, though only their upper bodies and heads are visible.\n\nThe room in which they are situated appears cozy and softly lit, with a lamp visible in the background casting a warm glow. The atmosphere suggests an intimate, relaxed setting typical of a private residence, possibly a living room, decorated with modest, traditional furnishings including a fabric upholstered chair and a decorative, dark-toned table lamp. The overall mood of the image is one of quiet camaraderie and leisurely enjoyment.","title":"A librarian, left, and a teacher, both employees of senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
