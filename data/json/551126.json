{"path":"551126.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a diverse group of young people gathered on what appears to be the steps of a large stone building with classical architectural elements like columns. On the left, two African American young women stand and converse with a seated African American young man who wears a striped tank top, denim jeans, and a printed cap, and is gesturing with his hand possibly in conversation. Another young woman, wearing a red top, is sitting next to the young man but is facing away from the camera, contributing to the social interaction.\n\nOn the right, three teenagers—two Caucasian and one African American—are sitting on a higher ledge of the building steps. They seem relaxed and are casual observers or participants in the ongoing interaction. The setting suggests a public building or a university campus environment. The overall mood is casual and depicts a candid moment among friends or acquaintances in an urban setting. The style of clothing suggests the time frame might be in the 1970s or 1980s, characterized by the fashion and hairstyles shown.","title":"Steps of the public library on capitol street in downtown Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
