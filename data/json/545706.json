{"path":"545706.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a single delicate wildflower in focus against a blurred rocky background. The flower has pale, slightly translucent petals, radiating out from a brighter yellow center comprised of visible stamens. Each petal is long and narrow, forming a star-like shape. The stem of the flower is slender and appears to be leaning slightly to one side. Just below the flower, attached to the same stem, is a small, pendant-like bud, suggesting that it is either a developing or unopened flower.\n\nThe background, though out of focus, shows a variety of grey and brown tones, suggesting a rocky or stony environment. The lighting in the photograph highlights the flower, making its colors stand out against the darker, more muted background. This setup conveys a sense of isolation and delicate beauty of the flower in its rough, natural habitat.","title":"Columbine in Water Canyon","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["555034","545695","551368","544875","554574","555033","549230","545699","555189","553361","543623","554586","555035","553368","542969","547642"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","stem","stamen","bud","radiate","star","wildflower","comprise","habitat"]}
