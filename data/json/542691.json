{"path":"542691.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an older man engaging in scientific or botanical work inside a greenhouse. The man is focused on examining small plant samples, perhaps for research or inspection purposes. He wears a light-colored shirt and has a concentrated expression.\n\nIn the foreground, to the right side of the image, there are scientific instruments, including an ozone meter and perhaps some form of recorder or analyzer with dials and a printing or paper feed feature, suggesting the recording of environmental data or plant conditions.\n\nThe background is blurred, but the structure appears to be a typical greenhouse with transparent panels that allow ample light, necessary for plant growth. The interior is equipped with various trays and containers, likely holding more plant specimens for study or cultivation. The overall setting emphasizes a scientific and methodical approach to plant care or study, with an emphasis on environmental conditions as indicated by the presence of the monitoring equipment.","title":"Gene cardiff, head of plant research at the statewide air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["555300","555360","554622","557322","542663","555280","557321","542666","555249","546286","546278","551594","543801","546284","542661","549612"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["greenhouse","plant","study","examining","recording","specimen","tray","panels","meter","data"]}
