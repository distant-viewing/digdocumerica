{"path":"556886.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a bustling railway construction or maintenance scene. In the foreground, several workers wearing hard hats are either standing or moving around a series of rail-mounted construction vehicles. These vehicles appear specialized for tasks likely related to track maintenance or construction, featuring cranes and other equipment. There are multiple railway tracks paralleling each other, with one clearly undergoing some form of work, as evidenced by the construction equipment and visible debris.\n\nThe background shows an urban setting with low-rise buildings, trees, and perhaps slightly scattered industrial structures, suggesting this might be a semi-urban or outskirts area. Visible in the distance are some high-rise buildings and more densely clustered trees, indicating proximity to a more urbanized region.\n\nThe setting is during the day under clear skies, affording bright lighting that casts distinct shadows from the workers and equipment onto the gravel and tracks, enhancing the industrial vibe of the scene. The photograph provides a snapshot of mid-century rail infrastructure work, reflecting both the technology and labor practices of the time.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, laying new quarter mile long sections of rail to replace the old shorter track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel track, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556878","556872","556899","556895","556869","556894","556871","556881","556885","556883","556859","556900","556897","556879","556901","556012"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["construction","track","rail","railway","equipment","worker","maintenance","parallel","undergo","rise"]}
