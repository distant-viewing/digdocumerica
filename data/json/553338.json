{"path":"553338.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts an individual engaged in fly fishing in a serene, wooded environment. The fisher, wearing a red jacket and a dark hat, is standing in the middle of a stream. They are focused on casting their fishing line, which extends out into the water, forming a slight arc. The stream appears calm but with enough flow to create gentle ripples around the person's legs and where the line touches the water.\n\nThe environment around the stream is lush and densely wooded, with a variety of trees that suggest a mature, temperate forest. The light filtering through the canopy creates a mosaic of bright patches and shadowy areas on the surface of the water, enhancing the natural, tranquil setting.\n\nA fallen tree trunk lies partially submerged in the foreground, running diagonally from the lower left to the upper right-hand corner of the frame, adding a rugged, natural element to the setting. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the solitary activity of fishing amid the quiet beauty of the forest, evokes a sense of peaceful solitude and connection with nature.","title":"Water diversions of all kinds are enjoyed in the fresh, clean waters of the squannacook river.
