{"path":"554119.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil coastal scene, possibly at a park or natural reserve. The image is focused on two signs, mounted one above the other on a single post, positioned in the foreground of a blurred background. \n\nThe upper sign is a yellow square with bold, black text stating \"REMOVAL OF SAND PROHIBITED ORD. 368 C. OF H.\" This indicates a local ordinance protecting the natural resources, specifically prohibiting the removal of sand from the area. \n\nThe lower sign is white and slightly larger, featuring black text that reads \"REST ROOM H K BROWN PARK.\" This sign serves as a directional indicator for restrooms in the area, suggesting the photograph is set in or near H. K. Brown Park.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, we see a picturesque view of a beach edged by dark volcanic rocks. Waves crash gently on the sandy shoreline. Beyond the beach, a dense copse of tall, thin palm trees is visible, evoking a peaceful tropical atmosphere. The lighting conditions suggest it may be late afternoon, with subdued sunlight enhancing the serene setting.","title":"Famous black sand beach at Kaimu, created by lava runoff, is a favorite tourist stop. Area around beach is due to be developed. In order to preserve beach, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to add a new foundation of sand under the existing layer. Critics argue this would change color of beach, causing it to lose its appeal.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543168","554168","545248","543420","547973","545109","554038","547836","548670","553861","554060","542984","543108","548158","547850","547840"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["removal","sign","sand","prohibit","text","beach","indicator","reserve","crash","square"]}
