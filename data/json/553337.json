{"path":"553337.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features an adult male engaged in fly fishing in a river. The man is standing mid-stream with water surrounding him; the river is moderately wide with a visible current marked by bubbles and ripples on the water's surface. He is dressed in outdoor gear suitable for fishing, including a green vest, darker pants, and a cap, also wearing glasses. He holds a fishing rod, poised with concentration on his activity.\n\nThe surrounding environment is forested, suggesting a rural, possibly secluded location. The riverbanks are densely lined with bare trees and shrubbery, which indicates it might be during a cooler season, as the trees appear leafless. The lighting suggests it is daytime with ample sunlight, enhancing the vividness of the natural setting and the sparkle of light on the water's surface.\n\nAdditionally, he carries a small side bag which likely contains fishing supplies or personal items. This tranquil scene is captured with a sense of serenity and focus, typical of a nature outing.","title":"Water diversions of all kinds are enjoyed in the fresh, clean waters of the squannacook river.
