{"path":"554570.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of a young female hiker, examining a trail sign in a wooded area. She is dressed in a sleeveless shirt and jeans, with a large red backpack fitted with external frames and tied-on gear such as a yellow item with a spiral design—possibly a sleeping mat or tent. Her blond hair is pulled back, and she leans forward to read closely the details on the wooden trail sign.\n\nThe sign, mounted on a single thick wooden post, is elaborate and well-crafted, featuring multiple destinations. It shows directions to several trails with distances indicated in miles—for example, \"Trail to Avalanche Lake,\" \"Lake Colden,\" \"Indian Falls,\" \"Mt. Marcy,\" among others, with arrows pointing towards the respective paths.\n\nThe backdrop reveals a verdant forest setting with ample sunlight filtering through the trees, casting patterns of light and shadows on the forest floor which is covered with green vegetation and some yellow wildflowers. The scene conveys a sense of a clear, bright day, favorable for hiking and exploring the natural surroundings. The overall composition of the photograph suggests adventure and preparation, emphasizing a moment of decision making and orientation in the journey.","title":"New York State Department of Environmental Conservation sign shows trail markers and distances to various points in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543379","545785","554557","545768","554539","554508","554558","554503","545493","543378","544906","554505","554513","554504","545515","543388"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["trail","decision","making","example","mat","hiker","arrow","orientation","sign","tent"]}
