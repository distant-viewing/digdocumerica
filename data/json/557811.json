{"path":"557811.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph shows an expansive view of a tranquil deep blue ocean taken from an aerial perspective. The picture captures the vastness of the ocean, with a calm surface and subtle variations in the blue hue of the water, suggesting depth and serenity. Notably, two boats are visible on the water, adding a sense of scale to the image. One boat is located closer to the bottom left corner of the photo, while the other is slightly up towards the top right corner, which creates a diagonal line across the composition.\n\nBoth boats appear to be medium-sized, possibly tour or leisure vessels, indicated by their clean, sleek appearance. None are making significant waves or wake, suggesting they are either moving slowly or stationary. The simplicity of the scene is underscored by the sheer lack of any other distinct featuresâ€”no land, other boats, or objects are visible, emphasizing the isolation or open environment these boats are navigating.\n\nThe color palette of the photograph is minimal, dominated by the various shades of blue of the ocean, which helps to create a peaceful and isolated atmosphere. The framing and the angle of the shot suggest that it may have been taken from a high altitude, likely from an aircraft, which gives the viewer a sense of floating above this serene maritime scene.","title":"Charter fishing boats in a dumping area for acid wastes in the New York Bight near New York City. The area is not considered good for fishing. Some boats spend time in the waters to clean off the bottoms of their vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for monitoring all ocean dumping. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration is conducting a marine ecosystems analysis program in the Bight. The multi-year project is being observed by EPA and the Coast Guard.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557813","548701","557814","555715","552921","555785","545900","552292","557815","555718","549380","555803","555706","552050","543059","548247"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["boat","ocean","corner","serenity","aircraft","framing","variation","altitude","lack","simplicity"]}
