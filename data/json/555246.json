{"path":"555246.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a warehouse where work is being conducted by four men. The men are wearing safety helmets, two sporting yellow helmets and two in white. The scene is an active one, involving the men handling large boxes, which are part of extensive stacks of pesticide product boxes prominently labeled \"SENCOR Herbicide\".\n\nTwo of the men are standing on the ground; one is overseeing the works, and the other is assisting by stabilizing the boxes or receiving something from the man on the stack. The focal point of the activity seems to be the man on top of the stacked boxes who is in the process of moving a box from one stack to another or organizing the boxes. He is receiving or giving instructions and passing papers down to another worker on the ground beside him.\n\nThe stacked boxes create high walls across the image, displaying a variety of packaging labels indicating the content and brand. The warehouse itself has a lofty ceiling and visible support beams, suggesting a spacious but enclosed industrial building typical of storage facilities. The floor of the warehouse is concrete, with visible markings and some debris, which adds to the industrial feel of the environment. Overall, the composition captures a busy and organized warehouse setting focused on inventory management and manual handling of goods.","title":"Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspectors pull samples as a company official watches (right).
