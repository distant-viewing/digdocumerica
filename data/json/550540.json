{"path":"550540.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a rugged, natural landscape that appears to be a wilderness area. The image depicts a broad expanse of terrain covered primarily with greenery, which includes areas of dense trees and more open, grassy fields.\n\nIn the center of the photograph, there is a distinct, winding dark line which may be a road or a man-made path cutting through the grassland and intersecting with patches of forest. Several small, interconnected bodies of water, possibly rivers or streams, meander through the forest and can be seen threading around dense clusters of trees.\n\nOn the right side of the image, near where the road meets a bend in the river, there is a small human settlement. This consists of a few buildings which are small in scale compared to the expansive natural environment around them. The structures look to be basic and functional, possibly serving as lodging or operational bases for activities in the area such as forestry, mining or exploration.\n\nThe overall scenery is remote and undisturbed, with the presence of the buildings suggesting minimal human impact on a largely wild and natural environment. The landscape's terrain and vegetation suggest it might be in a mountainous or northern region, potentially in a place with rigorous climates given the hardy nature of the flora visible. The overall lighting in the photograph is somewhat dim, implying that it might be either overcast or that the picture was taken during either early morning or late evening.","title":"Abandoned trailers and a wrecked plane on the eroded remains of a winter ice strip (near mile 295). The view is south southwest across the Kanuti River. These remains date back to the 1970-71 ice road when a rough trail was cut north from the Yukon River to Sagwon. The new pipeline route passes west of this point.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550533","550615","542821","550642","543767","550541","550544","553564","555677","550629","550596","556931","550534","550600","550644","556906"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["basis","bend","grassland","forest","forestry","settlement","river","flora","road","terrain"]}
