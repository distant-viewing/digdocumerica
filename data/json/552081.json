{"path":"552081.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental destruction, where two old, damaged television sets are abandoned amidst fallen trees and debris. The setting appears to be a natural landscape that has undergone significant devastation, possibly from a storm or logging activity.\n\nIn the foreground, one television set is lying on its back with its screen facing up and exposed internal components. Its frame is damaged and parts of the glass screen are shattered. Closer to the mid-ground, another television lies on its side, also showing visible damage and disarray in its components. The surrounding vegetation includes scattered grass and small plants, indicating that the area might otherwise be a green space.\n\nThe background reveals a broader area of devastation with numerous fallen trees, their trunks and limbs jumbled chaotically. This scene extends towards a body of water visible in the distance under a bright blue sky. This combination of technology, nature, and destruction communicates a poignant message about environmental impact and the remnants of human artifacts in natural settings.","title":"The south bank of the Kansas River on the east side of Lawrence has become a much used dumping ground.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552089","543589","550799","547897","547527","546120","552102","543165","553869","547661","545254","544468","550352","551247","547024","544060"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["television","screen","devastation","destruction","set","component","limb","artifact","disarray","storm"]}
