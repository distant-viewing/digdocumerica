{"path":"553119.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures the vibrant and colorful façade of the Prima Donna Casino, featuring a flamboyant display of neon signs and giant statues. The center of the image shows a large, colorful marquee sign that reads \"PRIMA DONNA CASINO\" in bold, red letters, surrounded by bright yellow rounded arches. Each arch is adorned with a large disco ball-like sphere and embellished with statues of showgirls in extravagant costumes, including showgirl attire and feathered headpieces.\n\nBelow the main casino sign, there are various smaller signs that entice potential customers with offerings such as a casino, restaurant, slots, and entertainment, including live music and performances as indicated by \"Two Shows Nightly.\" The signs promote food deals, like \"Sausage, Bacon or Ham & Eggs 98¢\" and \"1/2 Fried Chicken Dinner $1.25\" reflecting the casino's aim to attract visitors not only with gambling and shows but also with affordable dining options.\n\nThe building itself appears to be typical of mid-20th-century architecture, with a flat front and no visible windows, emphasizing the grandiose signage and decoration over the structure itself. The atmosphere conveyed by the photograph suggests a vibrant, bustling venue, aiming to draw in guests with its promises of fun, food, and entertainment. The sky is clear and deep blue, indicating that the photo was taken during the day, which highlights the intensity of the casino's colorful display even in daylight.","title":"Entertainment round-the-clock is a Reno attraction","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["549025","549015","549026","549009","553139","549022","549017","553123","549014","553121","551495","549008","548402","553017","545448","552414"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["entertainment","statue","sign","aim","arch","food","guest","sphere","embellish","fun"]}
