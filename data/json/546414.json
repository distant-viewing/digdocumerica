{"path":"546414.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of industrial construction, focusing on the assembly of a large, modern building. Two primary structures dominate the scene: a finished white building with a sleek, curved design and a neighboring structure still under construction, wrapped partially in brown protective material and featuring exposed horizontal supports.\n\nIn the foreground, a construction worker in a red hard hat is actively engaged with metal materials, possibly aluminum panels or siding, which are laid out on a supporting framework made of wooden beams. The worker seems to be selecting or preparing these materials for installation.\n\nThe surrounding area is a construction site with visible debris and materials scattered aroundâ€”a typical sign of ongoing large-scale construction. The ground is uneven and covered with small stones. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting variable weather, which might impact construction activities.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of construction progress, highlighted by architectural forms and the labor involved in building modern structures.","title":"Construction of Fodrea Community School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["555373","546411","546426","547858","548552","556642","544167","549640","557730","550273","553924","546422","547989","547829","543592","548551"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","material","worker","neighboring","select","aluminum","support","assembly","finish","wrap"]}
