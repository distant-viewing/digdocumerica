{"path":"548231.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man meticulously working on metal objects in what appears to be a workshop setting. The man is wearing glasses and a striped, short-sleeved shirt, indicating an informal workspace environment. He seems focused on polishing or inspecting a metal part, holding it firmly in his hands as he examines it closely.\n\nThe workspace around him is cluttered with various items suggesting a craft or mechanical workshop. Metal parts with shiny, reflective surfaces are spread out on a table in front of him, which are possibly components of a larger assembly or individual metalworks. The lighting is dim with spot illumination, mostly concentrating on the workspace and the man, highlighting his task and the metallic objects, whereas the background remains darker and less defined, filled with shadows and indistinct shapes that suggest tools, materials, and equipment scattered throughout the area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of craftsmanship and attention to detail, emphasizing the man's engagement and skill in his work. The setting and activities suggest that this could be a craftsman specializing in metalworking or a similar trade, deeply absorbed in his practice.","title":"Shorty Lesch, pewtersmith and Rockport's harbormaster Bearskin Neck at Rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548252","558356","555533","553656","542664","548455","553330","557678","558379","555239","554864","556314","557680","551590","558303","553329"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["workspace","workshop","metalwork","metal","trade","man","skill","craftsmanship","assembly","craft"]}
