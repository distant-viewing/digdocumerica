{"path":"546299.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five people engaged in a meeting around a rectangular table in what appears to be a library or a room with ample shelving filled with books and journals. The setting has an academic or professional ambiance, underscored by the orderly bookshelves that fill the background. There is a large wall clock displaying 12:22, indicating it might be around lunchtime.\n\nThe individuals in the image are focused on the documents laid out on the table; most of them look like they could be discussion notes or papers. The people are predominantly middle-aged or older, dressed in professional attire typical of earlier decades: men in shirts and ties, and a woman in a modest blouse.\n\nThe man at the head of the table, likely leading the meeting, holds a paper and seems to be explaining something or reading aloud. The others are listening attentively, with two people taking notes. The context suggests a serious, work-related discussion, possibly involving research, academics, or administrative matters.\n\nThe overall composition and color saturation give a vintage feel to the photograph, with a focus on a professional engagement in a studious environment.","title":"EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory, Dauphin Island.
