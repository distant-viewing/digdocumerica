{"path":"545723.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vividly rich natural scene, predominantly featuring a cluster of bright yellow wildflowers in the forefront. These flowers are perched atop a mound of earthy, red-brown soil and seem to be thriving amidst scant green vegetation. They are slightly swayed, suggesting a gentle breeze and add a splash of color contrasting markedly with their surroundings.\n\nIn the background, a sprawling landscape unfolds. The middle distance displays open, rough terrains with scattered patches of shrubs and reddish rock formations that are typical of a desert-like environment. This rugged terrain extends and gradually melds with a flatter, broader valley-like area that lies under a vast expanse of sky.\n\nDominating the horizon are majestic mountains capped with snow, suggesting a contrast in the weather from the presumably warmer, arid foreground. These mountains rise sharply and are highlighted against a clear sky with minimal cloud cover, providing a stunning backdrop to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the vibrant flowers against a vast, serene landscape, evokes a sense of tranquility and the enduring beauty of natural environments. The image might be intended to highlight ecological beauty or the stark contrasts within a single natural scene.","title":"Utah--near Moab","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544938","544881","544443","545296","555666","545703","552442","549018","549225","557098","544574","555186","544887","545719","545718","549228"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["flower","mountain","breeze","wildflower","splash","mound","terrain","cover","beauty","display"]}
