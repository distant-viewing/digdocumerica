{"path":"555658.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant natural landscape that presents a harmonious blend of different terrains and vegetation. The main visual elements include a mountainous backdrop, a foreground of thick greenery, and a meandering river. \n\nForeground: The lower part of the image is dominated by dense shrubs or small trees covered in white flowers, suggesting spring or summer blooming. These plants are lush and seem to blanket the ground densely, creating a textured green and white foreground that contrasts with the other elements.\n\nMidground: Beyond the immediate foreground, there is a wide river, appears silt-laden, potentially due to glacier runoff. Its color, a muted grey or light brown, spans horizontally across the midsection of the frame, providing a natural division between the flora in the foreground and the mountain slopes.\n\nBackground: The backdrop is comprised of impressive mountains that rise steeply from the river’s edge. These mountains are extensively covered in greenery, suggesting a rich, dense vegetation cover, likely deciduous or mixed forest. Two distinct, narrow, white-water streams originating from the higher elevations descend through the thick green cover of the mountains, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The mountains peaks, while not snow-capped, appear rugged and barren, indicating erosion or a lack of soil depth suitable for vegetation at higher altitudes.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph showcases a serene yet wild landscape, indicating a remote or uninhabited region. The contrasting textures and colors—ranging from the gentle white blossoms, the rough river, to the lush green mountain slopes—create a scene rich in natural beauty, invoking a sense of tranquility and untouched wilderness.","title":"Pipeline crossing of the tsina river and richardson highway looking south across the roadway.  The river is out of sight behind the road.  A right-of-way centerline has been cleared.  It is visible in the right side of the picture as a diagonal cut descending the hillside toward the camera location.  The cut angles sharply right where the dark swath seems to end on the side.  From that point the line will cross the small stream visible in the upper right.
