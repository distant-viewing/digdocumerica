{"path":"554399.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic landscape dominated by a vast lake foregrounding a series of dark, shadowy mountains under a dramatic sky. The lake, occupying the lower third of the image, appears relatively calm and reflects a faint hint of the sky above. The mountains, extending across the middle part of the image, feature prominent ridges and valleys, adding depth to the scene. The summits are not sharply defined, lending a mysterious feel due to their silhouette against the sky.\n\nAbove, the sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds that vary in shade from bright white to dark gray, suggesting that it might be either late afternoon or possibly a weather change approaching. These clouds occupy nearly the upper two-thirds of the frame, giving the photograph a somewhat brooding atmosphere.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or any discernible buildings or structures, emphasizing the natural and untouched wilderness of the area. The edges of the lake are lined with dark foliage, which blends into the mountainous terrain. This serene yet moody scene conveys a sense of solitude and the grandeur of nature.","title":"High peaks region seen from marcy dam and lake","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["543643","543816","550641","550493","554405","555692","550579","555130","543761","553825","543608","552894","552900","545213","550612","543023"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["third","lake","occupy","summit","mountain","approach","cloud","ridge","grandeur","define"]}
