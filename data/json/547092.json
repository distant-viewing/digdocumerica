{"path":"547092.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat dilapidated wooden fence in the foreground with a handwritten warning sign attached to one of the vertical posts. The sign reads \"Loose Sand, Dangerous, Keep Out, Enter at Your Own Risk,\" suggesting potential hazards beyond this barrier. The fence is visibly worn and partially collapsed, indicating neglect or damage over time.\n\nBeyond the fence, a modern architectural structure is visible, characterized by large glass windows and a prominent use of angular, geometric lines. This building seems to be a residential or possibly commercial property with a balcony and a flat roof. The overall setting may be in an urban or suburban area, judging by the developed nature of the building and the surfaces around it.\n\nThe ground shows patches of snow and puddles of water, an indication that the photograph may have been taken in winter or early spring. There are no people visible in the image, adding a sense of abandonment or quiet to the scene. The ambiance is somewhat gloomy, enhanced by the overcast sky and muted colors, which may reflect the time of day or weather conditions when the photo was taken.","title":"Storm damage at beverly shores","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["545159","554707","554103","547046","557212","543122","557474","544727","557412","544245","547910","552455","548845","558000","547985","544263"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["fence","hazard","collapse","indication","warning","puddle","dilapidate","time","keep","balcony"]}
