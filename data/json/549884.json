{"path":"549884.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image presents a scene captured in a tunnel or underpass on a multi-lane road. The photograph is slightly blurred, suggesting motion. It features several cars typical of mid-20th century designs, driving through the tunnel. The lighting in the tunnel is dim but punctuated by regular overhead light fixtures that emit a soft glow. The ceiling of the tunnel is dark and stained by exhaust fumes or other environmental factors.\n\nThe road appears wet, indicated by the reflective surfaces and the patterns of light on the asphalt, which enhance the sense of recent or ongoing rainfall. The right side of the image shows the tunnel opening, revealing a brighter, overcast sky and hinting at the outdoor environment adjacent to the tunnel.\n\nThe composition of the photograph exploits the perspective of the tunnel, with the lines of the road, lights, and the contours of the walls converging towards a vanishing point in the distance, creating a strong sense of depth. This view smoothly guides the viewer's eye through the image, from the darkness of the tunnel interior to the relatively brighter and indistinct exterior. The mixture of light and shadow along with the stream of cars traveling adds a dynamic element to the scene.","title":"55th Street underpass, Franklin D.
