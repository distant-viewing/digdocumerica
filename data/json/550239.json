{"path":"550239.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a crowded beach on a sunny day. On the left side of the image, an adult male is leaning forward on a green metal railing, observing the beach. He is wearing a tank top and shorts, and has long hair tied back. The beach is filled with numerous people engaged in various activities including swimming, sunbathing, and walking along the shore. The crowd is diverse, consisting of individuals and groups, some of whom are in swimwear while others wear more casual summer clothes.\n\nThe beach itself appears sandy with patches of dirt and grass near the front where the railing is located. There are scattered pieces of wood and a couple of trash bins alongside the railing, suggesting this might be near a pathway or entry point to the beach. The sea is visible in the background, calm and stretching to the horizon under a mostly clear sky with a few clouds. The atmosphere is vibrant and appears to be a popular destination for beachgoers, possibly during a weekend or holiday due to the large number of people.","title":"Huntington beach on lake erie.
