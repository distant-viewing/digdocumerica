{"path":"555930.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene under what appears to be an elevated train track or highway overpass. The image is rich in a deep, moody atmosphere created mainly by the shadows from the overpass above and the sporadic light filtering through it.\n\nForeground: Two figures are standing on a street that is dappled with light and shadow. The figures are facing each other and are captured in mid-motion. The one on the left, wearing light-colored pants and a dark top, is gesturing with their hands slightly raised, suggesting a moment of interaction or conversation. The individual on the right is dressed in dark pants and a brightly colored red top, contributing a vivid splash of color to the scene.\n\nMidground: Behind the figures, two red traffic lights punctuate the dim hues with their focused glow. There are cars parked on either side of the street, which runs straight under the structural overpass.\n\nBackground: The distant view opens slightly beyond the confines of the overpass, revealing buildings with commercial signage, including a bright red \"FOOD\" sign, hinting at an urban neighborhood setting. Trees line the edge of the streets and add a touch of nature to the concrete surroundings. \n\nThe entire composition is framed by the dark underbelly of the overpass, with crisscrossing metal beams and irregular cuts of light breaking through, adding a rough texture and an intricate pattern to the top section of the image. The scene captures a fleeting moment of everyday life, marked by a distinctive contrast between the shadowy environment and the vibrant life occurring within it.","title":"The underside of an elevated train platform is part of the environment on Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, New York City.

Some of the best American architecture survives in her \"worst\" neighborhoods, only because it hasn't been demolished.","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["555890","550022","550012","549281","552481","555925","546540","555927","556983","555747","553277","551098","553845","557278","548445","548474"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["overpass","figure","street","dapple","light","confine","pant","filtering","occur","crisscross"]}
