{"path":"555146.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a landscape dominated by forest and clear-cut areas in a mountainous region. In the foreground, there is a large area of clear-cut forest with scattered remnants of tree trunks and branches strewn across the ground, giving it a barren and disheveled appearance. This area contrasts starkly with the lush, dense forest surrounding it.\n\nBehind the clear-cut area, the middle and background of the photo show densely wooded mountains. The trees are predominantly coniferous, with dark green hues. Several mountain ridges are visible, and on some of these ridges, more clear-cut patches are evident. These patches appear as lighter, more barren spots amidst the dark green forest, forming geometric shapes that are noticeable from a distance.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during the daytime with clear skies, as the forest and cleared areas are well-lit, and details are easy to discern. The overall scene captures a mix of natural beauty and the impact of logging activities, highlighting the contrast between untouched and deforested land.","title":"View of recent clear-cuts on the Canyon River drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545289","555150","542865","545143","555107","542834","557001","542820","542832","542833","555147","555221","555145","555198","545138","557574"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","ridge","show","mountain","daytime","remnant","patch","spot","area","trunk"]}
