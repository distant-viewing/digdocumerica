{"path":"548720.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts what appears to be a close-up view of a collection of bioluminescent organisms or a similar phosphorescent phenomenon under a microscopic or extreme close-up setting. The image is dotted with myriad small, bright, white speckles resembling tiny lights or glowing particles, scattered across various shapes and structures that look somewhat organic in nature.\n\nThe backdrop is uniformly dark, enhancing the luminosity and contrast of the bright speckles against the darkness. The overall composition conveys a sense of mystery and the intricate beauty of natural phenomena, perhaps aquatic or microbial, that emit light. The structures in the image seem to be clustered in several blobs, woven together by delicate connections, accentuating an otherworldly or alien aesthetic. The color palette is limited mostly to the bioluminescent white and various shades of deep blue and black, emphasizing a deep-sea or nighttime feel.","title":"More than 40 species of living coral can be found in the 75 miles of protected ocean waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555838","555842","555839","557609","555843","555069","555837","555840","555023","555060","557619","555841","557611","555176","557610","550606"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["speckle","phenomena","luminosity","organism","phenomenon","nighttime","particle","mystery","darkness","connection"]}
