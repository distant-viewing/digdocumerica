{"path":"553434.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor setting focusing on a small, muddy creek surrounded by thick vegetation. The creek, reflecting hints of sky and foliage above, has a murky, rust-colored water surface, indicative of sediments or possibly pollution. Around the creek, there are various plants, predominantly lush green leaves, which suggest a possible temperate or tropical setting. Some of these plants come very close to the waterâ€™s edge, and there are rocks visible at the banks anchoring the plants.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there is a partial view of what appears to be a wooden object, possibly a decaying log or a piece of old wooden structure, angled into the ground and partially submerged, contributing to a somewhat unkempt or wild characteristic of the scene. The overall lighting in the image is natural, filtered through the canopy above, casting soft shadows and highlights throughout the frame, enhancing the feeling of a secluded, possibly untouched natural environment. There is no visible sky except for what is mirrored in the water, and the creekside is tightly framed by the flora, focusing all attention on the natural elements and the intimate details of this aquatic ecosystem.","title":"Water in drainage ditch, clogged with wastes, flows from the Leominster dump area into the already severely polluted Nashua River.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["545473","546126","551351","546896","547487","555211","552023","557245","550351","550341","558009","554603","553427","549641","544765","552430"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["creek","plant","characteristic","highlight","sediment","flora","outdoor","rust","ecosystem","log"]}
