{"path":"547895.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a brightly colored warning sign attached to a wooden utility pole. The sign is rectangular with a white background and red border, featuring black and red text that is set in different sizes and weights to emphasize the message. The text reads:\n\n\"WARNING!\nAny person illegally dumping within this area without proper permit will be subject to ARREST\nThis violation of the Penal Law is punishable\n1YEAR IMPRISONMENT OR #1,000.00 FINE\"\n\nBelow the sign, the grain and texture of the old, weathered wooden pole are visible, illustrating a natural aged look possibly enhanced by exposure to the elements. In the background, slightly blurred, are electrical lines extending across the top of the photo and a street lamp that appears somewhat rusted, hinting at an urban setting. Additionally, there are multiple smokestacks in the distant background, further suggesting an industrial or less residential area. The sky is slightly overcast, diffusing the light and adding to the somber, utilitarian feel of the image.","title":"Warning posted at the municipal incineration plant in the Gravesend Bay area of Brooklyn is often ignored.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552084","553729","545517","557551","547992","544813","546009","548836","557474","554567","546805","554103","546386","545298","550272","544227"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","permit","text","pole","weight","sign","grain","dump","message","lamp"]}
