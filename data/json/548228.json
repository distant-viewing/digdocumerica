{"path":"548228.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, bustling fishing harbor, rich with the details of maritime life. The foreground features aged wooden lobster traps stacked neatly alongside weathered wooden docks. Two brightly colored buoys, one red and yellow and one with peeling paint, rest atop them, suggesting recent or ongoing fishing activities.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo showcases several fishing boats, moored closely together, floating calmly in the harbor. The boats range from a small skiff to larger, cabin-equipped fishing vessels, indicative of a working harbor that supports a range of fishing activities.\n\nIn the background, there are tall stacks of lobster traps that line the docks, reflecting the harbor's primary industry. A large red wooden building, possibly a warehouse or a processing facility for the catch, dominates one side of the frame. Beyond the immediate harbor area, residential houses are visible, painted in traditional New England styles and colors, blending seamlessly into the coastal landscape.\n\nThe water is calm, suggesting a peaceful day with good weather, ideal for marine-based work. The clear blue sky adds a vibrant backdrop to the serene aquatic environment. The composition and elements of the photograph together capture the essence of a working New England fishing harbor, characterized by its functional maritime infrastructure and tight-knit community.","title":"Rockport Harbor lobster pots and buoys","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548229","548547","547565","546998","542911","542905","548217","550306","548764","543358","548789","542876","546939","542907","542872","542878"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["harbor","fishing","trap","dock","marine","working","catch","buoy","boat","cabin"]}
