{"path":"557677.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a family of four posing in front of a house with distinctive architectural features. The setting is a daylit scene with some greenery and a clear sky.\n\n1. **People**: The family consists of four individuals – two adults and two children. \n   - The first adult appears to be a man standing in the back row; he smiles slightly and wears a long-sleeved shirt and slacks.\n   - Beside him, there is a woman who is likely an adult; she wears a long-sleeved blouse and a long skirt with a polka dot apron over it, adding a traditional, homely touch.\n   - Two children stand in the front – one who appears to be a teenage girl wearing a blue top belted at the waist, with black flared pants, and one younger boy in the very front wearing a white T-shirt that features a logo reading \"Peninsula YMCA Day Camp\" and red shorts.\n   \n2. **House**: The house in the background exhibits a charming, cottage-style architecture with a white and black color scheme that provides a stark, visually appealing contrast. It features:\n   - A pointed roof with decorative trim.\n   - An adorned balcony on the upper floor, characterized by a geometric railing pattern that adds an intricate detail to the home's facade.\n   - At least one visible window on the upper level beside visible decorative elements that may be part of the balcony or the window design.\n\n3. **Surrounding Area**: There is minimal visible greenery, including a couple of small shrubs and a grassy area, suggesting that the house is in a maintained yard or garden setting. The ground immediately around the family is a dark soil or mulch which contrasts with the light facade of the house.\n\n4. **Overall Composition and Atmosphere**: The photograph has a formal yet warm composition, with the family aligned centrally and symmetrically in front of their house, suggesting a sense of pride and belonging to the place. The attire of the family members reflects a personal and relaxed atmosphere, appropriate for a casual family portrait at home. The elements of the house and the way the people present themselves contribute to a genteel, serene suburban or rural living scene.","title":"The Chet Nichols family stand outside the Applehaus Restaurant, which they built and operate in Helen, Georgia near Robertstown.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548312","556496","544310","557361","547398","557641","556356","551130","552959","556173","547938","546439","553498","556531","557094","545397"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Family Activities"],"terms":["family","house","adult","balcony","front","home","facade","polka","apron","pride"]}
