{"path":"543903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and industrial scene at sunset. The image predominantly features two tall electricity transmission towers, constructed of metal and towering over the landscape. Numerous interconnected electrical wires silhouette against the warm hues of the sunset in the sky, which is soaked in deep oranges and ambers, conveying a peaceful yet melancholic ambiance.\n\nIn between these two giant structures, another utility pole with attached wires is visible, albeit much smaller in size compared to the massive transmission towers. Adding a natural element to this industrial backdrop are two birds in flight; one is closer and appears just in the center-left part of the image, below the nearest transmission tower, while the other bird is near the top right corner, seemingly at a further distance. The presence of these birds adds a touch of wildlife and freedom contrasting sharply with the rigid, man-made structures.\n\nThe foreground, obscured by the dim lighting and shadow, hints at some vegetation or trees. This blend of nature with the human-engineered electrical infrastructure offers a poignant reminder of the interactions and tensions between natural environments and technological developments. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on vertical structures and the inclusion of wildlife, creates a thoughtful reflection on progress and its impact on the natural world.","title":"Sunset behind power lines in Galveston Bay industrial area","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549011","553830","553028","549110","544355","546389","544011","544020","544613","543728","557977","543926","547732","544300","549020","550183"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["transmission","bird","tower","wildlife","wire","sunset","reminder","tension","electricity","inclusion"]}
