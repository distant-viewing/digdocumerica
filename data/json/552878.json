{"path":"552878.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a mature man peering as he looks out from what appears to be a door or window frame. His face is thoughtful or intent, perhaps listening or watching something outside the frame. The man has visible signs of aging, with lines on his forehead and face, and his hair is thin and slightly disheveled. He wears a simple white T-shirt.\n\nThe frame he is looking through is painted white with signs of wear like chipped paint and dirt. To the upper left of the frame, attached to the white wall, are two rectangular, vertically placed licenses issued by the \"Wildlife and Fisheries Comm.\" These licenses are colored red and blue and indicate the years '72 and '73, possibly signifying dates of issue.\n\nThese details suggest the setting might be related to a maritime or fishing environment, and the licenses affirm a legal or professional connection to fishing or wildlife activities. The overall composition and the man's expression convey a moment of quiet reflection or attention.","title":"Captain of a lake borgne oyster boat looks out from his pilothouse","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552871","554926","556563","543701","551340","556084","543713","552104","552103","553516","556443","547427","547179","548218","557035","547338"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["license","issue","fishing","chipp","forehead","frame","intent","pee","paint","aging"]}
