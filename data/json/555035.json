{"path":"555035.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of a delicate flower. The flower has five thinly spread petals that are a soft, pale lilac with faint lines radiating out from the center toward the edges. At the heart of the flower, several prominent yellow stamens protrude, surrounded by a cluster of smaller ones, all centered around a greenish-white base which forms the core of the blossom.\n\nThe texture of the petals appears silky, with tiny droplets of water visible, suggesting dew or a spray of water, adding a fresh and vibrant aspect to the image. The attention to detail in the photograph captures the natural veining of the petals which adds depth and interest.\n\nThe background is a softly blurred mix of greenery, likely the leaves of the plant, mingled with shadows and patches of light, blending seamlessly to highlight the flower while providing a contrast that enhances its delicate features. The lighting is soft and appears natural, casting gentle shadows and contributing to the tranquil and serene mood of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition places the flower centrally and slightly tilted, which guides the viewer's focus directly to the intricate details and subtle colors of the flower while the defocused background ensures undiverted attention to the subject.","title":"Closeup of siberian miners lettuce growing in old growth forest in olympic national timberland, Washington.
