{"path":"558097.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a wide, tranquil rural landscape characterized by rolling grassy hills under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, two individuals are seen walking across a vast, undulating field. The field itself is marked by various shades of green and hints of brown, suggesting sparse vegetation or possibly the transitioning seasons.\n\nThe two people, slightly off-center in the composition, are walking toward the right of the frame with leisurely strides. One individual is carrying what appears to be a bag or a small backpack. They are dressed casually and appear to be engaging with each other, promoting a relaxed, informal atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, the terrain rises to include lush, dense forests covering the hills. This expanse of trees features shades from deep green to lighter green, indicating a variety of foliage. At the crest of one of the hills, a partial view of what may be a pathway or small road can be discerned, meandering through the landscape.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of peace and simplicity, showcasing a moment of human interaction within the vastness of nature. The clarity of the atmosphere and the absence of any urban elements emphasize the rural setting and the beauty of the natural surroundings.","title":"Kendall hills are part of the Virginia Kendall park which is a part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.
