{"path":"555238.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a detailed and focused view of a cylindrical container labeled \"ALCO Bran Beanweda Dinitro Weed Killer,\" manufactured by the Ley Chemical Company. This pesticide container, vividly presented in the foreground, is predominantly green with yellow and red text and accents. It features a warning label that is prominent, displaying words like \"DANGER,\" \"POISON,\" and \"KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN,\" alongside other safety and hazard notifications.\n\nPositioned in the background and slightly out of focus is a man wearing a yellow hard hat. This suggests he might be in an industrial or construction environment. His face is partially visible, primarily obscured by the deep depth of field focused on the weed killer container, lending a blurry portrayal of his features but a clear indication of his presence and relevance to the setting or activity being portrayed, likely related to the handling or use of the pesticide.\n\nThe arrangement and focus in the photograph emphasize the importance or implications of the product (weed killer), possibly highlighting themes related to workplace safety, chemical usage in industrial or agricultural settings, or environmental considerations.","title":"Environmental Protection Agency inspector checks a label on a pesticide container during a routine inspection at the Valley Chemical Company, Greenville, Mississippi.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553905","555244","555243","555245","555259","555263","553610","555235","546032","555246","548865","555240","555149","545634","544171","555237"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["pesticide","weed","container","safety","consideration","implication","hazard","danger","indication","warning"]}
