{"path":"550772.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene featuring two people paddling in a canoe. The river is expansive with calm waters reflecting a hazy sky. The duo in the canoe—a man and a woman—appear engaged in navigating the river. The man, at the stern, is actively paddling, while the woman, seated at the bow, also holds a paddle, looking straight ahead.\n\nIn the background, a prominent industrial bridge spans across the river. It has a unique design with large vertical towers and a conveyor-like structure above, suggesting it could be part of a dam or an industrial conveyance facility. The bridge is made of metal, with heavy beams and large cylindrical containers, possibly for storage or transport. It's supported by sturdy pillars embedded in the river, and there's a noticeable tree-covered island or riverbank behind it.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears lush and green, indicating this might be late spring or summer. The sky is somewhat overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene which softens the colors, giving the scene a tranquil, slightly moody atmosphere. The overall setting is peaceful, juxtaposing industrial elements with the natural beauty of the river and its surroundings.","title":"The three hundredth anniversary of the Marquette-Joliet 1673 exploration of the Mississippi and its tributaries inspired a retracing of the 3000 mile route by seven men costumed in 17th century garb and paddling two 17th century canoes.
