{"path":"554074.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene sunset scene by the sea. The photograph is tinged with a golden hue, emphasizing the reflective gleam of the sun on the ocean water, creating a shimmering, textured surface. In the foreground, dark rocky outlines and the gently breaking waves along the shore are visible. The coastline curves gracefully into the distance.\n\nIn the middle ground, a small peninsula or breakwater features prominently, adorned with a line of tall palm trees silhouetted against the bright, dusky sky. These trees add a tropical or exotic quality to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the horizon meets the ocean under a golden sky, contributing to the tranquil and beautiful atmosphere of the picture. The image's composition, using the rule of thirds, places the landmass horizontally across the frame and the ocean currents and waves lead the viewer's gaze across the picture, enhancing the expansive feel of the seascape. The general mood is calm and picturesque, typical of a tropical sunset by the ocean.","title":"Late afternoon surf at Maliko Bay","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554075","553989","543144","545030","543064","552335","550288","547479","552294","557447","550296","544711","545238","543145","545000","552038"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["ocean","sunset","picture","rule","wave","breakwater","peninsula","gleam","landmass","tinge"]}
