{"path":"554238.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and colorful scene at a ski resort. A group of people, presumably skiers, are gathered around a small wooden hut, seemingly a ticket booth or rental place, covered with a significant amount of snow on the roof, indicating recent heavy snowfall.\n\nThe skiers are clad in typical winter sport attire from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s given the style of their clothing and equipment. Their outfits include brightly colored ski jackets in shades of red, yellow, and blue, and some wear patterned garments. Several individuals are wearing ski boots and are either holding their skis or have them propped up nearby, suggesting that they are either preparing to start their day on the slopes or taking a break.\n\nThe scene is vibrant yet casual, with people in various stancesâ€”some standing and chatting, others handling their gear. One person in particular, in a striking orange jacket, is bent over, possibly adjusting their boots or bindings. The environment around the group is snow-covered, enhancing the winter atmosphere of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a lively glimpse into the social and preparative aspects of skiing, highlighting both the sport's communal nature and the vintage fashion and equipment of the era.","title":"Line to buy ski lift tickets.
