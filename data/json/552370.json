{"path":"552370.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph portrays an outdoor scene where a man is engaged in maintaining or inspecting a piece of machinery, specifically an aircraft. The man wears a denim jacket featuring an insignia and a baseball cap, attributes suggesting a professional role, likely a technician or mechanic. He is kneeling on the ground, working attentively on the helicopter, which is painted in bright yellow and marked with the word \"PROTECTION\" encircling a blue logo.\n\nHe appears to be handling some hoses connected to the aircraft, which could involve fueling, hydraulic systems, or other maintenance activities. The setting seems to be a paved area, likely part of an airstrip or helipad, given the nature of the work and the additional partial view of another similar aircraft in the background.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment emphasizing the technical and maintenance aspect of aviation, illustrating the critical behind-the-scenes work that supports aerial operations. The focus is on detail and professionalism, grounded in a utilitarian environment.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["545935","552393","542498","549721","552365","542576","542499","546683","555239","548911","552383","545642","542578","545685","553603","552369"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","maintenance","professionalism","insignia","aviation","technician","mechanic","helicopter","hose","protection"]}
