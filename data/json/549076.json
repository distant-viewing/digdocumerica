{"path":"549076.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a stark contrast between natural desert landscapes and man-made infrastructure. It features a long, straight canal or watercourse, filled with water, that slices through expanses of undulating sand dunes. The water reflects the sunlight, creating a vivid line of light running through the darker terrain. \n\nThe dunes around the watercourse are characterized by their smooth, flowing lines and ridges, shaped by wind erosion and deposition. The textures and patterns in the sand vary, with some areas appearing softer and more sculpted, while others are sharper and more defined.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, given the elongated shadows and the warm golden hues bathing the scene. On one side of the canal, there is a raised bank or pathway that runs parallel to the water, suggesting functionality, possibly for maintenance or monitoring purposes.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of isolation and the juxtaposition of human effort against the vast, natural environment of the desert. The background fades into the horizon with a clear sky, enhancing the emphasis on the terrain and the canal cutting through it.","title":"All-American Canal carries Colorado River water through sand-swept area of the Imperial Valley.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548895","548896","542510","549032","545329","552733","548925","548949","548928","548192","547098","545626","544752","543977","544658","545636"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canal","dune","desert","sand","deposition","monitoring","functionality","ridge","emphasis","slice"]}
