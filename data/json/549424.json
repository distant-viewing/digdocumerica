{"path":"549424.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid sailing scene, showcasing a regatta with multiple sailboats. The ocean occupies the majority of the frame, with a calm yet textured water surface hinting at a gentle breeze.\n\nTwo sailboats are prominently in view. On the left, a small boat with a large, orange spinnaker marked \"US 12514\" and another sail labeled \"Y\" is tilted slightly, indicating it is catching the wind effectively. A sailor is visible in the boat, actively managing the sails. This boat is primarily white, adding to its visibility against the blue water.\n\nTo the right, another sailboat appears, this time with a green spinnaker with “US” visible and partially showing \"882A\". This sailboat also incorporates a \"Y\" on its mainsail, suggestive of a specific class or type of sailing race these boats are participating in.\n\nIn the background, other sailboats with variously colored sails can be seen scattered across the horizon, underscoring the competitive atmosphere of the regatta. The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light that saturates the colors of the spinnakers and the water.\n\nThe composition of the image emphasizes the dynamic action of sailing and the interaction of the sailors with their environment, showcasing their skills in navigating and controlling the boats amidst competitive pressures and natural elements.","title":"Running before the wind on chesapeake bay in the Annapolis-Newport race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548522","548526","547450","549400","549389","549425","549421","549082","549426","548513","543936","548203","549404","549406","552346","549394"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","regatta","sail","boat","sailor","pressure","incorporate","saturate","race"]}
