{"path":"546257.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a landfill, focusing on the operations and machinery used to manage waste. In the center of the image is a prominent yellow construction vehicle, likely a bulldozer or wheel loader, which appears to be moving or compacting trash. The operator is visible inside the cabin of the vehicle. Behind it, the terrain is uneven and covered with a vast amount of diverse waste materials, including what looks like broken pieces of wood, plastics, and other debris.\n\nIn the background, there's another similar machine, seemingly a bulldozer, actively working on the piles of garbage. A person in dark clothing and a helmet is visible standing on a red truck, adding human scale to the scene and indicating manual handling or sorting of waste.\n\nThe setting is open-air with a clear sky overhead, hinting it might be a warm day. The environment around the activity zone glimpses vegetated areas, suggesting that the landfill might be located near or within a rural or semi-rural setting. The image effectively captures the gritty reality of waste management operations in a landfill setting.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
