{"path":"545933.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively riverside scene with numerous recreational activities taking place. The image captures a river that curves gently from the foreground to the background. The river water distinctly shows two colorsâ€”it appears murky and brown on one side, likely due to sediment or shallower depth, and darker on the other, indicating deeper water.\n\nThe riverbanks are crowded with people, suggesting a popular spot for gathering and leisure activities. On the left riverbank, in the foreground, a few individuals can be seen near the water; one person appears to be entering or exiting the water. The opposite riverbank is densely packed with more people, some standing and others sitting, enjoying the day.\n\nVarious people are engaging in water activities; the river is dotted with numerous colorful inner tubes and small boats, both occupied by individuals or groups. These objects add vibrant splashes of yellow, red, and blue to the otherwise natural tones of the scene.\n\nThe background is framed with lush green trees under a cloudy sky, which shades the entire scene with soft, natural light, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon. This setting contributes to a relaxed and cheerful ambiance, typical of a summer day spent by the water.","title":"Wash off from chattahoochee river bank, a result of inadequate land and building controls","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["545941","551499","553439","543943","546811","548006","557740","549461","553441","551525","554475","545734","551282","551538","548935","551218"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["riverbank","river","water","tube","spend","people","exit","standing","riverside","enter"]}
