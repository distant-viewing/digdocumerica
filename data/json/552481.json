{"path":"552481.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a unique view through a crisscrossed, lattice-like structure that partially obscures the scene behind it. This structure, possibly a part of an overpass or another type of raised platform, creates a diagonal pattern of shadows and lines that dominate the foreground. Through these geometric shapes, one can see a somewhat blurred, busy outdoor area, likely a road or street below.\n\nIn the distance, there are several vehicles, including red and white cars which appear to be in motion, hinting at a lively street scene typical of an urban area. Alongside the vehicles, there are green spaces, possibly small patches of grass or bushes, adding a touch of nature to the otherwise industrial and urban setting. The background includes structures that could be buildings or other architectural elements, but they are too indistinct to describe in detail.\n\nThe image has an overall dynamic feel, emphasizing movement and the contrast between the man-made elements and nature. The focus and exposure settings give a dreamy, almost ethereal quality to the photo, with the forefront pattern lending an artistic filter to the everyday life captured behind it.","title":"Migrant labor camp in Princeville","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["553681","549281","555930","557979","553721","548418","556832","542682","549846","555747","547776","550153","553845","549902","549861","553475"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["describe","lattice","overpass","street","crisscross","vehicle","pattern","exposure","raise","forefront"]}
