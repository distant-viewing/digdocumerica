{"path":"553369.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of several lady's slipper orchids, scientifically known as Cypripedium. The photograph focuses on one flower prominently displayed in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left, with others softly blurred in the backdrop. The prominent orchid has a distinctive appearance with a large, inflated pouch that is pink with a network of darker pink and purple veins. The pouch is contrasted by the green and brown hues of the plant’s twisted leaves and stem which curl around it, incorporating a pleasing mix of colors and textures.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it may be natural sunlight filtering through a canopy, illuminating parts of the flower and leaving others in shadow, which adds depth and a sense of dimension to the scene. The background is a soft, dark green which highlights the flowers due to the shallow depth of field, focusing the viewer’s attention on the intricate details and patterns of the orchid's surface texture.\n\nThese flowers are typically found in wooded areas, indicating that this photograph may have been taken in a natural habitat, capturing the orchids in their native environment. The overall composition and focus illustrate the delicate but striking beauty of these orchid species in a serene and natural setting.","title":"Lady slipper, one of the many kinds of wild flowers growing on the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of pepperell","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554582","554581","553365","554112","553366","554586","554595","553588","544875","543597","543200","547613","553368","554115","554843","554576"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","delicate","twiste","curl","incorporate","dimension","vein","other","stem","leave"]}
