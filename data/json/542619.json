{"path":"542619.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil and picturesque scene of two horses, an adult and a foal, in a vast field during what appears to be dusk or dawn. The lighting casts a warm, reddish-orange glow over the landscape, highlighting the gentle and serene atmosphere.\n\nThe field is expansive, covered with short grass or grazing land that is uneven and textured, typical of a pastoral setting. The ground seems dry with variations in color ranging from dark earth tones to lighter sandy hues, all illuminated by the soft, reddish light of the setting or rising sun.\n\nThe two horses are positioned towards the center-left of the frame. The adult horse is bending its head down, likely grazing, which creates a calming, domestic feel to the scene. The younger horse stands close by, suggesting a sense of dependency and closeness between the two animals.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused, enhancing the sense of depth and emphasizing the vast space around the horses. There is a subtle gradation of darker to lighter tones in the background, which may indicate distant foliage or perhaps a tree line fading into the horizon under the hazy sky.\n\nOverall, the composition and color palette of the photograph evoke a sense of peace and natural beauty, capturing a quiet moment in nature with these two graceful animals.","title":"California--sierra foothills","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["542972","545894","542622","556958","545890","551327","551229","557186","552501","543726","543678","542956","557988","552562","556957","544414"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","animal","grazing","adult","closeness","gradation","peace","graze","field","variation"]}
