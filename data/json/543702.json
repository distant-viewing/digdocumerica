{"path":"543702.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a low-lit scene featuring a series of glass bottles, closely arranged in a line. The perspective is slightly low, with the view perhaps positioned at the level of the bottom third of the bottles. The bottles are illuminated from behind with a warm golden light, which creates a glowing outline around their forms and casts light through their translucent bodies. The light highlights the curves of the bottles and creates a soft, diffused effect as it passes through the glass.\n\nEach bottle appears to have a black cap or closure, and the glass surfaces are speckled with numerous small glints of light, suggesting the presence of moisture or condensation. The backdrop is cloaked in darkness, focusing all visual attention on the illuminated bottles and their luminescent outlines. The resulting aesthetic is one of simplicity and visual appeal, emphasizing form, light, and color in a dark, obscured environment.","title":"Recycled beer bottles receive heat treatment prior to final packaging.
