{"path":"545047.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic sky scene dominated by a large American flag atop a flagpole in the foreground. The flag is caught in mid-wave, revealing its stars and stripes against a turbulent sky. The background includes an industrial landscape characterized by multiple sources of thick, billowing smoke. These smoke plumes appear dense and are likely emanating from factory stacks, suggesting an industrial area. The contrast between the symbol of national pride (the flag) and the environmental impact of industrial activity (the smoke) is stark and compelling. The image captures a moment that could be seen as symbolic of industrial progress and its consequences. The colors are somewhat muted with a blue-grey overtone, typical of older color photographs. There are visible signs of wear or degradation on the image, adding a vintage quality to it. The composition with the flag sharply in focus against the blurred industrial backdrop emphasizes the flag, inviting reflection on its symbolism.","title":"Weyerhauser pulp mill smokestacks and American flag","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542581","550169","557244","550184","548225","548577","554361","552190","555166","547084","547204","546968","557218","550939","550905","550328"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["flag","smoke","consequence","flagpole","pride","star","progress","symbol","degradation","source"]}
