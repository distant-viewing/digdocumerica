{"path":"550939.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene with a dominant background of a vast sky filled with clouds. The main focal point is a large industrial structure, which appears to be an emission stack, expelling a significant amount of white smoke or steam that blends into the cloudy sky. The landscape below the smoke shows lush greenery with some trees and a few indistinct structures, suggesting a rural or semi-industrial setting. The colors in the image are somewhat muted, portraying an overcast or gloomy day. The overall mood evoked by the scene may hint at environmental concerns or industrial impact, highlighted by the contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity. The structure itself is detailed, with visible railings, pipes, and platforms, typical of industrial architecture.","title":"Smokestack of the Du Pont chemical plant on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["557373","551026","550938","550672","550983","550344","545239","551054","550172","548157","550329","550981","557218","551056","543011","550871"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","emission","concern","amount","pipe","steam","railing","platform","stack","structure"]}
