{"path":"555825.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals inside a helicopter, dressed in full aviation gear. Both are wearing vibrant orange flight suits, equipped with various pockets and zippers. Their outfits include thick gloves and they have what appear to be communication devices attached around their necks and shoulders.\n\nThe first individual on the left wears a white helmet with a green cross on it, suggesting a medic or a similar emergency responder role. His helmet is equipped with a visor and a white headlamp secured around it. He is seated, looking slightly downward, with a serious expression, reflective of focus or concentration.\n\nThe person on the right, who wears a helmet with a vibrant red and white stripe on it, is in a partially crouched position possibly conversing or preparing to disembark. His visor is lifted up, and he holds onto a black device that could be an intercom or a flight control instrument.\n\nIn between them is dark, blurred equipment that seems to be part of the helicopterâ€™s interior. Beyond the open helicopter door, over the shoulder of the man on the right, you can glimpse a sunny, distant horizon that suggests they might be flying over a large body of water, adding a context of search, rescue, or monitoring over maritime areas.\n\nThe lighting in the cabin casts deep shadows, emphasizing the serious atmosphere of the scene and highlighting the intense daylight outside, contrasting the interior's dim setting. The overall composition and the elements captured suggest a scenario of urgency and readiness, typical in rescue or emergency operations.","title":"The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for monitoring all ocean dumping in the New York Bight which includes 15,000 square miles of ocean waters and the continental shelf off the coasts of New York and New Jersey.
