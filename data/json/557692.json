{"path":"557692.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential setting where two vintage cars are parked in front of a house, partially obscured by lush green trees. The scene captures a hint of irony as the cars are parked next to a tree with a \"NO PARKING\" sign attached to it. This suggests a disregard for the sign, adding a humorous element to the image.\n\nThe front car, which is only partially visible, appears to be light-colored, possibly white or silver, and has a sleek design characteristic of mid-20th century American automobiles. The second car, prominently featured in the foreground, is a darker color, potentially a deep blue or black, with distinctive late 1960s or early 1970s styling. It includes design elements such as chrome bumpers and trim, and rectangular taillights. The car displays a license plate from Alabama, adding a geographical element to the context.\n\nThe background features a traditional wood-framed house with a front porch, slightly visible behind the foliage of the trees. The setting exudes a sense of mid-century American suburban life, with an emphasis on personal vehicle ownership and the use of space in residential areas.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a nostalgic view into past American life through its depiction of vintage cars, a residential setting, and the subtle presence of cultural artifacts like the \"NO PARKING\" sign.","title":"Out of state tourists ignore a homeowner's request for \"no parking\" in front of his Main Street home in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Traffic is congested, especially on the weekends between May and October, as visitors arrive to see the small mountain community of some 270 residents. Helen has been an attraction since 1969 when the business district Renovated the store exteriors with a Bavarian alpine theme.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551021","551119","555922","545419","551090","546177","556707","556735","548238","557840","556435","550683","551109","557877","557667","557878"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","parking","disregard","ownership","styling","artifact","sign","bumper","house","license"]}
