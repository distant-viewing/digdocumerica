{"path":"545879.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph shows a desolate landscape under a condition that appears to be either foggy or dusty, obscuring much of the scenery and casting a gloomy ambiance. In the foreground and extending into the midground, a number of shrub-like plants and small trees are visible. They are sparse, leafless, and have a ragged appearance, manifesting the harsh environment they are set in. The ground is barren, with no visible grass or foliage, suggesting an arid region.\n\nThere's no human activity, buildings, or artificial structures evident in this image. The atmosphere is dense, possibly indicating a dust storm or heavy mist that further contributes to the impression of isolation and desolation in the photograph. The lighting is muted, perhaps indicative of an overcast day or the dim light filtering through a dust-laden sky. The overall effect is quite moody and stark.","title":"Heavy rain falls faster than Earth can absorb it.","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["549183","549119","545341","554780","544019","543718","548673","549133","545895","543722","552420","546121","544137","544428","545604","555885"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["dust","laden","filtering","storm","desolation","midground","scenery","mist","number","impression"]}
