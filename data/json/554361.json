{"path":"554361.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features an old, frayed American flag, prominently positioned, attached to what appears to be a car antenna. The flag, showing visible signs of wear and tear, suggests long-term exposure to the elements, rendering its fabric torn and its colors faded, particularly evident in the red stripes and white stars against the deep blue background. Atop the flagpole, just beneath the flag, there's a small, slightly wilted green plant or flower, adding a touch of natural contrast to the battered flag.\n\nIn the background, a number of vintage cars are neatly parked in what looks like an outdoor parking lot, suggesting the photo may have been taken several decades ago. The cars' designs, curved edges, and chrome details hint at mid-20th century automotive style. The parking lot appears spacious with a reasonably clear sky overhead and a calm ambiance without any people or moving objects visible. The focus and composition of the shot ensure that the flag and its immediate surroundings are the central subjects, symbolically standing out against a backdrop of everyday normalcy and historical context.","title":"Inspiring emblems on car antenna in one of the city's chronic traffic jams","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542581","548225","545047","548577","546817","550152","550148","557873","547494","552589","546177","557715","546230","544423","557707","546329"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["flag","lot","parking","tear","car","flagpole","antenna","star","chrome","fabric"]}
