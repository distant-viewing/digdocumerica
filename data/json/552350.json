{"path":"552350.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic aerial view of a river or estuary at sunset. The image is framed by a moody sky filled with ample clouds, through which sunbeams are penetrating, casting an ethereal array of light over the water below. The sun is visible, peeking through the cloud cover in the upper center of the frame, and its reflection on the water creates a path of shimmering golden light.\n\nThe broad expanse of the water body is interspersed with multiple boats leaving gentle white wake trails, which are visible as curving lines on the water's surface. The landscape surrounding the water includes landforms jutting into it, shaping narrow inlets or promontories. These land masses are dark and only subtly detailed due to the photograph's contrast with the radiant sunset.\n\nThe quality of the light, with the sun's rays filtering through the clouds and its intense reflection on the water, contributes to a serene yet dynamic scene, creating a sense of tranquility and movement simultaneously. The overall ambiance of the photograph is peaceful and visually striking, offering a captivating view of a natural landscape illuminated in a spectacular sunset scene.","title":"Puget Sound at sunset, looking toward Point Defiance (left) and Vashon Island (right)","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552230","552294","551206","551215","543144","557447","543143","545022","547731","552277","548910","544711","547352","553992","543956","552293"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","water","masse","ray","reflection","sun","inlet","landform","wake","cloud"]}
