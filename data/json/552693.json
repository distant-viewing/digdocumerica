{"path":"552693.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This is a photograph focusing on a section of a plant, likely a small tree or bush, featuring a cluster of yellow leaves. The leaves are vibrantly colored, suggesting the photograph might have been taken in autumn when leaves are changing colors. The leaf edges are slightly jagged, and the veins are somewhat visible, providing intricate textures to the foliage. The stems are thin, with a reddish-brown hue that contrasts softly against the yellow leaves.\n\nThe background is almost entirely dark, creating a stark contrast that highlights the leaves and gives the image a sense of depth. There are no distinct shapes or colors visible in the background; its uniformity ensures that the viewer's attention remains firmly on the brightly colored leaves. The lighting seems to be coming from the front or slightly above the foliage, casting gentle shadows and enhancing the details of the leaves.\n\nThe composition of the photograph cleverly uses the darkness of the background to elevate the natural beauty and autumnal tones of the leaves, focusing on capturing a moment of seasonal change in nature.","title":"Aspen leaves flutter along the east Rifle creek","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["546011","554744","554727","554735","554736","557168","544731","554739","557593","554743","554668","550603","543620","551356","554725","554741"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","change","bush","uniformity","vein","foliage","ensure","reddish","stem","leaf"]}
