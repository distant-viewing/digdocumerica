{"path":"555674.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic river landscape, predominantly featuring a wide river in a mountainous area. The river bends through the frame with murky but calm water, flowing from left to right. It is flanked by banks covered in small rocks and pebbles. On the left riverbank, there is a long line of larger rocks piled presumably to protect the bank from erosion.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is mountainous and densely forested with evergreen trees. The mountains rise steeply from close to the riverbanks and are covered with rich green foliage. In the distance, several mountain peaks, some possibly with very small snow fields, are visible under a partly cloudy sky. \n\nThe overall mood is serene and natural, suggesting a remote or sparsely populated area. The photo appears to have been taken in broad daylight with sufficient natural light illuminating the entire landscape, enhancing the vibrance of the natural greens and the texture of the water and rocks.","title":"View east up the Lowe River Valley. Thompson Pass (five miles away) appears as the gentle notch on the center left skyline. The pipeline will cross the river at this point.
