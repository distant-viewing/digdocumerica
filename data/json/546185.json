{"path":"546185.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a deceased fish lying on a sandy, muddy surface, partially entangled in seaweed or aquatic plants. The fish, which appears to be a type of bream or similar silver-scaled species, is shown with its side facing the camera, exposing detailed textures of its scales and fins. Also entangled with the seaweed are various pieces of trash including a squashed, clear plastic cup and a crumpled aluminum can, which has a label that might indicate a soda or beer brand.\n\nThe colors in the photo are a mix of the dull silver of the fish, the greens and browns of the wet vegetation, and the muted tones of the man-made objects. The environment suggests a shoreline or riverbank where the tide or water level has receded, leaving behind the remains and debris. The presence of garbage juxtaposed with the natural elements in the image emphasizes a theme of environmental pollution and its impact on marine life. The overall mood evoked might be one of sadness or a commentary on ecological negligence.","title":"Dead fish and litter on Gulf Coast beach","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["550878","546779","546898","552067","547737","546782","547687","555560","547704","545161","546930","546846","546784","550806","550812","548973"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["fish","seaweed","silver","soda","aluminum","remain","fin","beer","tide","commentary"]}
