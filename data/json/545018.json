{"path":"545018.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a serene landscape at dawn or dusk. In the foreground, there is a vast open meadow with sparse vegetation and what appears to be dew or frost coating the grass, reflecting light and adding a bright, shimmering quality to the scene. The meadow is enclosed by a rustic, possibly wire fence that stretches horizontally across the view, helping to frame the lower part of the image.\n\nThe middle ground of the photograph features a thin, low-lying mist that hangs over the meadow, adding a layer of mystery and tranquility to the setting. This mist partially obscures the base of forested hills visible in the background, blending the land and sky.\n\nThe background is dominated by rolling hills densely covered in trees. These trees appear dark against the early light, which might be due to the time of day and exposure settings of the camera. Above the hills, there are more layers of mist that fade into the bright sky above, which is clear and shows a gradient of light suggesting early morning sunlight diffusing through the moisture in the air.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or animals in the scene, enhancing its untouched, natural feel. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and quiet, capturing a moment of natural beauty and stillness.","title":"Oregon--Cape Kiwanda","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["546154","555536","556990","545209","556985","549249","549146","557182","557013","557095","556587","550667","550489","557014","554982","542916"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","mist","hill","frost","layer","dew","mystery","moisture","stillness","gradient"]}
