{"path":"550277.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents an urban landscape viewed from a high vantage point, possibly a rooftop. The foreground features a sloped roof with red tiles leading directly into a composition of various buildings. Visible in the foreground is a brick wall, featuring a rich, weathered texture of red bricks, leading to a sense of age and exposure to elements.\n\nDirectly below, the viewer can see the tops of several structures. Among these are multiple residential or small commercial buildings with different architectural characteristics: some have shingled roofs, while others are covered with flat, tar paper roofing. Notable is a weathered wooden building that adds an element of rustic decay juxtaposed against more pristine structures around it.\n\nFurther in the distance, the image captures an industrial area characterized by larger buildings and smokestacks emitting smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial activity which contrasts noticeably with the residential feel of the foreground structures. This part of the image provides a narrative about the coexistence of residential and industrial zones within the same urban area.\n\nAdditionally, the photo includes a clear blue sky with minimal cloud cover, and a contrail from an airplane, which further emphasizes the depth and expansiveness of the scene. An antenna array on a rooftop stands out, indicating the presence of modern technology amidst the older architectural environments.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a layered perspective of urban life, from residential tranquility in the immediate front to industrial activity in the back, topped with a broad sky suggesting the broader environment in which these scenes unfold.","title":"Air monitoring unit (left) on top of Firehouse #13 at 4750 Broadway records emissions such as those from Republic Steel (right rear).","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549971","550153","556180","548329","547103","553300","553557","550157","555791","548424","550203","547210","549979","553728","549958","555755"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["rooftop","brick","expansiveness","antenna","roofing","unfold","airplane","shingle","tile","lead"]}
