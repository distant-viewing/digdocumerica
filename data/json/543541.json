{"path":"543541.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a lumber yard surrounded by a forested area. The foreground prominently features neatly stacked arrays of wooden panels and beams, arranged parallel to each other on the ground. The stacks vary in length and are supported by smaller wooden blocks, suggesting a methodical system of storage and organization.\n\nBeyond the immediate stacks, the middle ground reveals more lumber piles, some covered in white protective sheets. There appear to be partially constructed wooden structures, possibly frames or supports, lending an industrial and construction-related vibe to the scene. \n\nFurther back, a collection of small buildings or shacks can be seen. They vary in construction material and appearance, with some having simple wooden exteriors and others showing more intricate designs or additional features like external braces.\n\nThe trees surrounding the area suggest a rural or semi-wilderness setting, with tall conifers dominating the landscape, hinting at the probable source of the wood. The ground is bare and looks compact, possibly due to frequent use as a working area.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a busy, functional lumber yard with a focus on wood storage and processing, set against a natural forest backdrop, indicative of the lumber industry's operations.","title":"Lake Forest Glen condominium development","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["542584","543489","552163","542943","542945","550668","552162","552214","548155","552176","552140","554416","552199","542596","542942","552198"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lumber","stack","yard","brace","shack","storage","wood","support","construction","sheet"]}
