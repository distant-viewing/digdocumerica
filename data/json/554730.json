{"path":"554730.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays a serene fall setting in a dense forest. The composition focuses on several trees filled with the vibrant colors of autumn leaves, primarily in shades of red and orange, interspersed with lingering green hues. The foliage is densely packed, and the trees have thin, dark trunks that contrast strikingly with the bright leaves. Light filters through the leaves which illuminate them against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, enhancing the vividness of the autumn colors. The angle of the view is from below, looking upwards towards the treetop canopy, giving the sense of being surrounded by the forest. The image conveys the lush, tranquil, and colorful essence of the fall season.","title":"Mountain ash in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at 4,000 feet","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["557821","554727","554738","554711","554737","554735","554636","557822","558074","554726","554736","550603","554739","554715","554728","554649"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["autumn","leave","fall","treetop","forest","upwards","vividness","essence","trunk","canopy"]}
