{"path":"552737.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant and lively outdoor setting, centered around a large, circular water fountain. Water is vigorously splashing from the fountain's center towards the edge, creating a dynamic and lively water effect. On the left side of the image, a group of children are lined up along the outer rim of the fountain, watching the water with interest. They appear to be of various heights and are dressed in colorful, casual clothing typical of a warm day outside.\n\nTo the right, there is an adult kneeling and taking a photograph of the scene, focusing on the children. This individual is using a camera held close to their face, suggesting they are capturing either the children or the fountain, or both.\n\nThe background includes a series of steps and a park-like setting with trees and scattered sunlight, indicating that this scene might be in a public park or a similar recreational area. The overall feel of the setting is peaceful yet cheerful, with the water feature providing a focal point for activity and attention.","title":"On camera in a city park","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552539","551667","551638","557268","551772","552703","550752","552540","550747","550080","551449","553229","550072","551467","553149","549982"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","child","splashe","rim","water","park","scattered","step","interest","height"]}
