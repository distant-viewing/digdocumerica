{"path":"551185.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a sharp contrast between urban and natural landscapes. The upper left corner features two red brick houses with peaked roofs standing beside a wide, multi-lane road. The road has light traffic, with a few vehicles visible, and is bordered by sidewalks and greenery. On the right side of the road, an expanse of healthy trees suggests the edge of a suburban area.\n\nDirectly adjacent to this orderly urban setting, the rest of the picture shows a strikingly different sceneâ€”an expansive area of what appears to be a polluted or contaminated body of water, possibly a pond or small lake. The water has a swirl of dark and light hues ranging from gray to black and light brown, indicating the presence of different substances and probably pollution. The edges of this water body are irregular, with patches of vegetation sporadically emerging from it. This stark environmental contrast may highlight issues such as water contamination close to residential areas and the encroachment of urban development on natural sites.","title":"Highway runs beside polluted waters of the Kanawha River in a heavily industrialized section of the Kanawha Valley","placename":"Charleston (W.
