{"path":"554984.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense forest scene filled with numerous thin, vertical trees. The trees are mostly bare but some are beginning to show small, fresh green leaves or buds, indicating that this might be an early spring setting. A notable feature in the image is a prominent tree with a curved trunk forming an arch near the foreground, which visually contrasts with the upright trees. This arching tree is covered in patches of moss, emphasizing a wet or moist environment.\n\nThe forest floor is visible, scattered with fallen branches and leaf litter, suggesting an undisturbed natural area. Light appears to be filtering through the canopy above, casting patches of brightness and shadow throughout the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a quiet, almost mystical quality typical of a forest recovering from winter, on the brink of full spring. The image primarily showcases shades of brown and green, punctuated by the light sky visible through the canopy, contributing to a serene and somewhat secluded woodland scene.","title":"Vine maple and alders in the queets corridor of the Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554961","547643","546947","553574","554425","555096","555054","543487","554980","542725","554976","555121","554958","554718","555125","554985"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","spring","canopy","seclude","tree","bud","begin","fallen","leaf","punctuate"]}
