{"path":"557399.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a steel mill during nighttime operations. The focal point of the image is the bright, fiery glow of molten metal being poured or processed. This heat source lights up its immediate surroundings, casting a warm, orange hue that contrasts sharply with the predominately dark, blue-toned environment.\n\nThe setting includes an intricate configuration of industrial structures, which comprise heavy machinery, large metal frameworks, and scaffolding. These structures are complex, featuring various levels, walkways, and supporting beams, suggesting a large-scale industrial operation.\n\nIn the foreground is a large mold or receptacle, glowing bright orange along its edges, presumably from the intense heat of the molten metal it contains. This element suggests that the facility is engaged in casting or other metal-forming processes.\n\nNo people are visible in the photograph, which emphasizes the massive scale and the mechanical nature of the environment. The background is murky and underexposed due to the low light conditions, focusing attention on the brightly lit midground where the metal processing occurs. This composition highlights the harsh and dramatic conditions typically found in such heavy industrial settings.","title":"Metal cools in the foreground while the furnace has been tapped and is ready for pouring at the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Total plant emissions for the metallurgical furnaces and the powerhouse were reduced 97.7 percent from 1967. A compliance schedule was reached between the corporation and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. EPA stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
