{"path":"544991.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, tunnel-like pathway framed by densely intertwined tree branches forming a natural arch. The trees, lush and leafy, create a vibrant canopy over the pathway, almost completely blocking out the sky. The leaves and branches are thick, making the archway seem like a living tunnel, dappled with scattered light that filters through the foliage, casting an array of light and shadows on the path below.\n\nIn the center of this verdant tunnel, there is a car driving towards the viewer. It appears to be an older model, possibly vintage, adding a sense of timeless elegance to the scene. The car is small compared to the grandeur of the natural archway, emphasizing the dominance and vastness of nature in this setting.\n\nThe color tone of the image leans towards cool hues, predominantly greens and blues, enhancing the feeling of tranquility and seclusion. The road itself is unpaved, suggesting a rural or less-traveled path, which adds to the overall peacefulness and isolation of the scene.\n\nThe composition draws the viewerâ€™s eye straight down the path, led by the natural lines of the trees and the direction of the car, creating a sense of depth and inviting wonder about what lies beyond the visible part of the pathway. The image evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation, inviting the viewer to imagine taking a quiet drive through this beautifully secluded natural corridor.","title":"These trees are trimmed back from the road","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557555","557010","547659","544860","557011","542950","550216","548100","550567","550695","556976","557116","557528","555215","557018","542862"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tunnel","archway","pathway","path","drive","invite","viewer","car","dominance","seclude"]}
