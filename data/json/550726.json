{"path":"550726.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a natural body of water with various types and sizes of rocks visible through the water's surface. The composition predominantly shows a play of textures and colors between the water and the rocks.\n\nThe water appears dark and has a slightly turbulent texture, suggestive of movement, possibly due to a flow or breeze. The rocks submerged in the water vary in color from off-white and beige to brown and reddish-brown, and they have organic, irregular shapes. Some rocks seem rounded, likely smoothed over time by water action, while others appear jagged and rough.\n\nThe color contrast between the dark water and the lighter rocks, along with the textural interplay, adds depth and visual interest to the image. The arrangement of rocks forms natural patterns and paths, leading the viewer's eye across the photograph horizontally. The lighting, possibly natural sunlight, highlights the tops of the rocks and subtly enhances their textures.\n\nOverall, the photograph documents a serene yet dynamic natural aquatic landscape, focusing on geological elements and the influence of water on shaping such environments.","title":"Details of polluted androscoggin river seen from the bridge at jay below the androscoggin mill of the international paper company","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["544790","543152","555077","557251","552061","542583","550678","544862","543185","555626","543789","544867","543172","553388","553420","544856"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rock","water","smooth","texture","shape","breeze","influence","document","interest","submerge"]}
