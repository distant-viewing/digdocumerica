{"path":"547637.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a dynamic seaside landscape marked by a striking interplay between water and land. At the forefront, a broad beach stretches horizontally across the image, showcasing a mixture of light sandy areas and darker patches likely indicating wet sand or shallow water. The beach forms a slender barrier between the open sea on one side and a serene, intricate bay or lagoon on the other.\n\nThe bay features deep blue waters, punctuated by small islands and peninsulas richly adorned with green foliage, suggesting a robust natural environment likely characterized by diverse flora. The clarity and calmness of the water are indicated by smooth textures and gentle light reflections. Some small boats or watercraft can be seen as tiny white specks, suggesting recreational or fishing activities in the area.\n\nIn the region surrounding the bay, the land rises gently into hills covered with lush green vegetation, hinting at a rural or relatively undeveloped area. The greens are of various shades, possibly indicating different types of trees or plant life. There are a few visible structures, small and sparse, suggesting limited human habitation or perhaps isolated farmhouses.\n\nThe overall composition provides a breathtaking view of a tranquil natural scene dominated by the elements of land and water, with human presence minimal and seemingly integrated into the broader environmental context. This landscape likely provides habitat for wildlife and serves as a recreational destination for those seeking solace or adventure in its natural beauty.","title":"First the barrier beach along the ocean, then the salt pond and then the mainland.","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["548604","553983","554156","548785","554018","554020","552922","553982","554022","557466","554171","543427","554019","543328","547629","557453"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bay","land","lagoon","beach","watercraft","farmhouse","seaside","peninsula","water","speck"]}
