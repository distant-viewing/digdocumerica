{"path":"542804.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph appears to be an aerial shot captured either during early morning or late evening, as indicated by the subdued light conditions and long shadows. It depicts a sweeping, panoramic view of a large body of water and a coastal area with significant geographical and man-made features.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense urban grid stretches along the coastline, indicating a populated cityscape alongside the shore. The photo includes a distinctive, large suspension bridge spanning across a narrow part of the water, connecting two landmasses. This bridge, a prominent feature in the composition, is partially bathed in sunlight which creates a stark contrast with the more shadowed sections of the landscape.\n\nBeyond the bridge, the body of water extends into the background where it appears to merge with a bay or sea. The water glistens due to the reflection of light, adding a sparkling texture to the scene. Several layers of mountainous terrain rise from the water on the far side, shrouded in layers of mist or fog that lend an ethereal quality to the landscape. The topography varies, showing both rugged outlines and smoother, hill-like features.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is serene yet dramatic, emphasized by the interplay of light, shadow, and the natural fog, which imparts a soft, mystical feel to the scene. The aerial perspective allows for a comprehensive view that highlights the interaction between the natural environment and human engineering. The photo's color palette is cool, dominated by blues and grays, punctuated by the warmth of the sunlight.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543050","548415","542798","543436","544713","552192","548335","543087","548317","542807","544761","547669","546865","553678","547703","556951"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["bridge","fog","feature","suspension","layer","water","landmass","topography","sunlight","warmth"]}
