{"path":"549292.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor urban scene featuring two men in conversation near a building. The older man on the right is dressed in a light-colored coat and a hat; he seems to be pointing towards something outside of the frame, looking in that direction. The other man, visible from behind, wears a checked jacket and appears to be listening and looking in the same direction as the older man.\n\nThe background comprises a corner of a dark-bricked building with white trim around the windows. The architecture is residential, with features like a porch and multiple stories suggesting an older, well-established neighborhood. The corner lot is bordered by a traditional white picket fence, adding a quaint, classic look to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photo is one of casual, everyday interaction, potentially a moment of sharing information or storytelling in a familiar setting. The composition focuses on these individuals in their immediate environment, using the architectural elements and fencing to frame the scene naturally.","title":"Anthony Bruno (left) with 92-year-old James Morse, residents of the neighborhood closest to Logan Airport. They are standing on Lovell Street outside the house where Mr. Morse has lived for over 60 years. Mr. Bruno is pointing to a siding which both men believe--but cannot prove--was loosened by airplane vibrations.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549291","549293","553558","557079","557143","551469","547382","551853","553153","553519","554026","557854","548482","554860","553244","557767"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["direction","corner","picket","man","fencing","establish","information","listen","check","look"]}
