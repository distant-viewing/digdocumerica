{"path":"552504.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, outdoor scene featuring an expanse of dried grass or hay bent and flattened in sweeping patterns across the ground. The foreground shows the flatter areas where the grass has been heavily pressed down, presenting textures that suggest the movement of wind or a similar natural force. Towards the background, there are sections of taller, upright grasses or reeds, some of which are catching light, giving them a brighter, more golden appearance compared to the darker shades of the bent grasses.\n\nThese upright grasses seem to form a borderline with a darker, possibly wooded area beyond them, hinting at a transition from an open field to a forested region or brushland. The lighting in the photograph suggests daylight with enough intensity to create distinct contrasts on the ground and highlight the golden hues of the dry grass while casting deeper, cooler shadows in other areas. The overall impression is one of quiet and undisturbed natural space, possibly after a windstorm or another natural event that caused the grass to lay in such a patterned manner.","title":"Trampled field along Spoon River Road","placename":"Elmore (Ill.)","location":"Elmore, Illinois","nn1":["545069","557191","551370","546154","557104","552485","557559","549233","547616","549232","553084","550489","549251","552312","549034","544884"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","hay","reed","intensity","force","manner","wind","transition","daylight","impression"]}
