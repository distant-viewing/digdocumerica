{"path":"545694.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting, possibly within a national park given the distinctive rock formations. In the foreground, a family consisting of five individuals is engaging in leisure activity within this picturesque environment. A man is seen carrying a young child on his shoulders, while walking along a trail. The child is wearing bright green outerwear. Following them closely are three other children, two of whom are walking together while the other appears slightly ahead, pointing towards the landscape.\n\nThe backdrop consists of impressive geological formations, characterized by towering sandstone cliffs and monumental rock pillars that dominate the landscape. The rocks are a vibrant red-orange color, typical of sedimentary formations found in desert landscapes like those in the American Southwest. These majestic formations stand against a slightly overcast sky. The terrain is rugged and covered with sparse desert vegetation, emphasizing the natural and undeveloped nature of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph integrates human exploration with the raw beauty of a vast, undisturbed natural environment, highlighting an interaction between humans and nature.","title":"Utah--Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545700","544903","545702","545689","545601","545782","545585","544312","545693","544931","545780","545581","545772","545605","544898","544341"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["formation","child","rock","desert","sandstone","pillar","trail","family","shoulder","cliff"]}
