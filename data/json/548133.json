{"path":"548133.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing on a concrete ledge next to a large body of water, likely a fish hatchery or similar water cultivation setup. The man, dressed in dark trousers, a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, and a dark flat Cap, is captured in mid-motion as he scatters feed or some granular substance from a metal bucket into the water. The feed disperses in a wide arc, creating a spray of particles that catch the sunlight, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe water sparkles brilliantly where it catches the sunlight, indicating the time of day might be either early morning or late afternoon when the sun is lower in the sky. Trees fill the background densely, pointing to a secluded or wooded location. Additionally, there is a glimpse of what appears to be a small white trailer positioned in the treeline, possibly indicating facilities or temporary storage used by the facility.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the act of feeding within the context of aquacultural management, set against a natural backdrop that suggests a peaceful, sunlit setting.","title":"Eagle Creek Fish Hatchery near Cascade Locks, on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["545386","542561","548831","552271","554535","550666","554520","543781","550317","548956","543829","546298","553650","553332","554523","554519"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["feed","arc","treeline","particle","cultivation","ledge","facility","act","spray","substance"]}
