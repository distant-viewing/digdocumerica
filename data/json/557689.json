{"path":"557689.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in the activity of painting the exterior of a building. He is sitting on a scaffold-like wooden platform, surrounded by painting supplies, such as a paintbrush and a can of paint. The man wears a casual blue short-sleeve button-up shirt, dark pants, and is barefoot, contributing to an informal and work-oriented atmosphere.\n\nThe man appears middle-aged with short, salt-and-pepper hair and a notable expression of satisfaction or contentment as he looks directly towards the camera. His posture is relaxed while holding a paintbrush, suggesting he is taking a break or posing for the photograph.\n\nThe building behind him features corrugated wall panels that he is in the process of painting white. There are visible streaks and patches where the old surface still shows through, indicating the work is in progress.\n\nThe overall setting seems to be outdoors during the day, suggested by the natural light and a hint of a clear sky visible in the top portion of the image. Additionally, the environment communicates a practical, DIY home improvement scenario.","title":"Lanier Chambers paints part of the new alpine exterior of his recently acquired service station at the edge of Helen, Georgia near Robertstown. He bought the station when the former owner refused to Renovate. The previous owner could not be forced to use the alpine motif because the station is located just outside the eastern edge of the city limits. Chambers is developing land for residential use in Helen and does not live there himself.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556154","548556","553471","556637","549930","556156","551503","556633","542497","548455","553921","557115","556229","553603","556458","546032"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["scaffold","contentment","salt","streak","progress","supply","work","can","button","scenario"]}
