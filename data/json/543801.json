{"path":"543801.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a man working in a scientific or laboratory setting, focusing his attention on precise work with lab equipment. He is partially visible, peering closely at an object within a protective glass enclosure designed to likely safeguard against contamination or to create a controlled atmosphere. The man wears glasses and a casual t-shirt, suggesting a relaxed yet attentive approach to his work.\n\nInside the glass enclosure, prominently displayed at the center, is a flask containing a yellowish liquid, symbolizing ongoing chemical or biological experimentation. The flask is placed on a metal stand, possibly a heating or cooling unit, considering its structured design.\n\nThe environment hints at a professional laboratory with practical furnishings and fixtures aimed at facilitating scientific experiments. Overall, the setting emphasizes concentration and careful handling of substances, integral to laboratory operations and experiments.\n","title":"Lab technician at secondary treatment sewage plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["555251","543797","542666","546284","546277","546296","549605","546278","555250","549612","549604","549333","555281","546275","549349","546287"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","flask","enclosure","experiment","glass","experimentation","heating","furnishing","contamination","approach"]}
