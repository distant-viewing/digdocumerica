{"path":"548733.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a serene coastal scene. In the foreground, there's a beach composed of uneven, rough rocks, giving it a rugged feel. The beach is littered with scattered stones and dried seaweed, leading into the clear, shallow waters.\n\nMoored near the shore is a small sailboat with a white hull and a partially visible red accent. The boat has a blue protective canvas attached around its cockpit area, providing shade. There are a couple of brown-colored ropes tethering the boat to the shore to prevent it from drifting. One individual, partially obscured, appears to be seated at the rear of the sailboat, possibly engaged in maintenance or preparation activities.\n\nIn the background, the water extends out toward the horizon, reflecting a bright sky. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting a sunny day, favorable for sailing or boating. On the distant horizon, there appears to be a faint outline of land, giving depth to the seascape.\n\nOverall, the composition gives off a peaceful, leisurely vibe, typical of a quiet coastal area, ideal for sailing and enjoying the natural surrounding. The image captures a moment of tranquil seaside life.","title":"Resting boater idles his craft in a lagoon at Marathon in the central Florida keys","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["543402","543329","542903","554101","547273","544667","552345","548521","548247","545900","547913","548118","543059","545057","542907","542877"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sailboat","tether","beach","shore","drift","cockpit","seaweed","prevent","canvas","seascape"]}
