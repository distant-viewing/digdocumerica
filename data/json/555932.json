{"path":"555932.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a decorative metal emblem attached to the side of a vehicle, possibly a fire engine given its traditional association with such decorations. The emblem is crafted in the shape of an eagle with its wings expansively spread out. The eagle grasps a shield which displays the American flag design with white stars on a blue field atop alternating red and white stripes.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the emblem is detailed, showcasing textured features on the wings and body of the eagle to provide a lifelike appearance. The eagle's eyes and beak are prominent, adding an intense and regal expression to the figure.\n\nBehind the emblem, parts of the vehicle are visible. The side of the vehicle is a glossy red, typical for fire engines, and there are chrome elements that include a handle and detailing that contours the vehicle's body. The background is dark, focusing attention on the brightly illuminated emblem with its metallic sheen catching the light. This gives the photograph a dramatic and vivid appearance, emphasizing the symbol of strength and patriotism represented by the eagle and the American flag.","title":"Eagle insignia on a New York City Fire Department truck. This project is a portrait of the inner city environment. It contains life the way it is lived there and 19th century architecture the people inhabit. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554361","542581","554369","557244","554364","548577","545047","558115","548225","546746","555893","557707","557873","557133","549572","546778"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["emblem","wing","engine","fire","vehicle","flag","patriotism","grasp","beak","alternate"]}
