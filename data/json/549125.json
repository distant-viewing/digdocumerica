{"path":"549125.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of several mechanical tools placed against a textured background of what appears to be an asphalt or coarse stone surface, possibly a wall or ground. The tools include a combination of wrenches and other mechanical devices, primarily metallic, exhibiting a variety of sizes and shapes. They are entangled, with visible rust and signs of considerable use or exposure to harsh conditions.\n\nThe tools show intricate details including bolts, adjustment levers, and wrench heads, indicating that they are used for specific mechanical tasks that require precise adjustments. The lighting in the image casts shadows on the tools, providing depth and emphasizing their rugged, worn-out textures.\n\nThere is no human activity or other objects observed except for these tools, focusing the photograph solely on these items and their industrial utility. The predominant colors in the image are shades of blue, gray, and metallic tones, conveying a cool and harsh aesthetic typical of industrial environments.","title":"Peabody coal company strip mine, south of colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["556353","546932","555954","543121","542585","554319","546888","556388","546757","543997","547777","545982","554318","545151","543109","542545"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["tool","adjustment","lever","bolt","asphalt","require","combination","device","rust","exposure"]}
