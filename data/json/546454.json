{"path":"546454.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph portrays a long, shaded passageway created by a pergola, which is a garden feature forming a shaded walkway of vertical posts or pillars that usually support cross-beams and a durable open lattice, often upon which woody vines are trained. The pergola in the image is covered with climbing plants and leaves, which create an interplay of light and shadow on the pathway beneath.\n\nThe pathway extends straight forward toward the horizon of the image, directing the viewerâ€™s gaze toward a small, yellow-painted building at the distant end. The structure of the pergola is constructed of metal or wood painted in a dark color, which contrasts with the lush greenery of the plants and the brightness of the sun-dappled pathway. \n\nOn either side of the pergola, well-kept grass areas can be seen, indicating that this location is likely in a park, garden, or a similarly maintained landscape. The ground is covered with a concrete or stone path that is evenly laid, creating a serene and orderly appearance. Off to the left side in the background, the glimpse of a parked car and other structures suggests a nearby parking area or a more urban environment adjacent to this garden or park setting. The image captures a sense of tranquility and the simple beauty of architectural and natural harmony.","title":"Mabel McDowell Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546458","546559","546450","546505","546457","546510","550275","547249","544991","557976","551265","555359","544285","551104","546534","557782"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["garden","pathway","vine","park","lattice","harmony","pillar","plant","gaze","brightness"]}
