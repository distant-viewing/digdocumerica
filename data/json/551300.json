{"path":"551300.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up side profile of a man wearing distinctive apparel that suggests a blend of rough, charismatic charm. He sports a sharp, dark cowboy hat adorned with a row of white stars across the front, projecting a style that is Americana and somewhat theatrical. His attire includes a denim jacket over what appears to be a woolen or textured sweater. This juxtaposition of fabrics adds depth to his rugged appearance.\n\nThe man's face is partially obscured by a pair of aviator sunglasses reflecting light, which adds a layer of mystery and privacy to his demeanor. His facial features suggest he is mid-adult, and his skin appears weathered, which, along with his attire, might hint at an outdoor or adventurous lifestyle.\n\nThe background of the image is soft and out of focus, mainly in muted earth tones that complement the subject's dark attire and do not distract from his figure. The choice of shallow depth of field ensures that the attention remains squarely on the subject of the photograph. This setting might be an outdoor area, indicated by the natural light and the blurred hints of a natural environment around him.\n\nThe photograph conveys a strong sense of individuality and a nonchalant coolness, characterized by the man's casual pose and fashionably rustic outfit. It effectively captures a moment that reflects a distinctive personal style fused with cultural symbols, standing out in what seems to be an everyday setting.","title":"Motorcyclist relaxing on his bike on \"The Strip,\" Memorial Day, 1973. \"The Strip\" is a popular commercial playground beginning at Bagnell Dam and winding south along the ridge tops for about a mile.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["549199","547679","553091","552561","557173","552873","549120","547028","542613","549122","549054","556443","548236","547344","554858","549051"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["apparel","distract","attire","subject","privacy","choice","lifestyle","star","ensure","symbol"]}
