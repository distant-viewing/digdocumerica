{"path":"552243.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a panoramic view of a diverse landscape comprising industrial, natural, and waterway elements. In the foreground, a curving roadway is visible, closely following the contour of a large body of water, possibly a river or an estuary. This waterbody is a prominent part of the scene, occupying the lower section of the image.\n\nTo the left and right of the water, there are two separate areas with industrial installations, noticeable by large white storage tanks and structures spread across the sites. These industrial areas are likely involved in processing or storage activities, given their proximity to the water for possible shipping or logistical reasons.\n\nBeyond these industrial zones, the landscape transitions into a more rural setting with patches of green fields and sparse buildings, indicating less dense development. This blends into the distant background, where a dramatic mountain range, capped with snow, forms a majestic backdrop. Its presence adds a striking contrast to the otherwise predominantly industrial and flat scenery.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its mix of natural and human-made elements, paints a complex tableau of interaction between industry and environment. The expanse of water and the curving road add dynamic lines to the view, while the distant mountains offer a serene and timeless quality, juxtaposed against the more transient and structured industrial foreground.","title":"Oil tank farms at anacortes, on fidalgo island in puget sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["556919","556977","556913","556907","556908","544792","545354","545042","555845","556904","555861","552196","555752","551197","555684","551174"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["curving","waterbody","reason","estuary","storage","tanks","tableau","shipping","mountain","zones"]}
