{"path":"546219.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people enjoying a day by a body of water with a heavy industrial backdrop. The scene shows four individuals, three women and one young girl, sitting and resting on a sandy shoreline. On the left side of the image, one woman with red hair is seated on a piece of driftwood close to the waterâ€™s edge, facing towards the water. Next to her, three people are seated on the sand, likely on a towel or blanket, facing away from the camera towards a large industrial structure in the distance across the water.\n\nThis industrial structure dominates the background with a silhouette distinguished by large buildings, conveyors, and cranes indicative of a facility like a shipping, mining, or some form of manufacturing plant. It creates a stark contrast with the recreational and laid-back setting of the foreground.\n\nThe water between the shore and the industrial facilities is calm, reflecting a hazy sky which suggests overcast or humid weather conditions. The atmosphere appears to be serene, yet the presence of industry implies a merging of natural landscape with human economic activities. The overall impression is one of relaxation and casual socializing in the foreground, juxtaposed with the busy, industrial setting in the background.","title":"Olin mathieson chemical plant on far side of lake","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["550937","546145","551959","546134","552180","550221","551525","549929","549220","546227","546228","550228","557484","552139","543943","550902"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["manufacture","water","driftwood","distinguish","towel","facility","shipping","seat","conveyor","face"]}
