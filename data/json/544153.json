{"path":"544153.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a scene within an industrial setting, likely part of a large factory or processing plant. The image is filled with a complex arrangement of metal structures and machinery.\n\nThis scene is dominated by large gray pipe systems, some of which are insulated with what appears to be some sort of black wrapping, running horizontally across the picture. These massive pipes are supported by a steel framework which also houses staircases and platforms, allowing access to different levels of the facility.\n\nTwo workers, dressed in helmets and safety gear, are noticeable on one of those raised walkways, placing them slightly off-center in the composition. They appear to be involved in a manual task, possibly inspecting or maintaining the facility's equipment.\n\nThe background features the exterior of a large metal-clad building, with parts of its interior visible through openings and under the structures. The building's color palette consists mainly of industrial grays and blues, which complement the metallic tones of the infrastructure surrounding it.\n\nAdditional details like safety barriers, various smaller pipes, and conduit systems, as well as utility lights, add to the detailed industrial feel of the scene. This setting communicates a sense of scale and the complexity of operations typical in industrial environments.","title":"Inside the Four Corners Generating Plant","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["557388","557387","552003","544018","544026","543158","544053","544001","546767","555815","546757","546036","544826","545992","544014","556503"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["pipe","system","safety","conduit","facility","staircase","communicate","opening","inspect","metal"]}
