{"path":"547040.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat bleak and deteriorating coastal scene under a clear blue sky. On the right side of the image, there is a large two-story building that appears weathered and slightly ramshackle. Its white paint is faded and peeling, with visible stains and some graffiti. The building has a steeply pitched roof with dark shingles, and one of the windows is boarded up while another is left bare, missing a covering or frame.\n\nTo the left of the building, the scene shifts to the shoreline, which is covered with various rocks and debris. Three bare trees stand near the water's edge, their brunches bare, implying winter or early spring. In front of these trees, there is what seems to be the remnants of a small pier or docking structure, consisting of weathered wooden posts and beams in disarray, sticking out of the water.\n\nThe shoreline is rocky and irregular, scattered with large, rough stones, and the water near the shore shows ripples, indicating a gentle movement. This environment evokes a sense of desolation and abandonment, enhanced by the building's disrepair and the scattered remnants of human construction by the water. The photograph captures a sense of quiet and decay, possibly suggesting the aftermath of a storm or prolonged neglect.","title":"Aftermath of severe storm in zion--house wrested from its foundation","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547038","543242","546871","547118","543320","547622","543359","543364","547581","551963","547105","547119","548105","543288","547041","547594"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["remnant","bare","shoreline","covering","disarray","deteriorate","docking","graffiti","shingle","miss"]}
