{"path":"543017.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, rural setting during what appears to be the evening hours. The scene includes a man engaged in the process of tilling soil in a farm or garden. He stands beside a red and metallic tiller, which is actively turning the rich, dark earth. The tiller, a significant feature in the image, suggests an ongoing effort to prepare the land for planting or cultivation.\n\nThe man, dressed in casual clothing including jeans and a plaid, long-sleeve shirt, is looking down slightly, giving the impression that he is either pausing in his task or observing the machine's work. Arrayed before him are several white ducks. These birds, close to each other and the operating tiller, add a lively and slightly whimsical element to the otherwise labor-intensive setting.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features recently tilled rows interspersed with young trees, indicating either an orchard or a structured garden layout. Behind the trees, there is a simple, white-painted building which might serve as a storage shed or a small barn, typical of a rural property. The land continues to rise gently towards densely wooded areas, perceptible under a slightly dusky sky.\n\nAesthetic aspects of the photograph include its soft, natural lighting—likely late afternoon sunlight—that enhances the tranquil atmosphere of the countryside. The composition successfully integrates elements of human activity, agriculture, and nature, presenting a snapshot of rural life and work.","title":"Tony Owen Organic Farm","placename":"Eel River (Calif.)","location":"Eel River, California","nn1":["543117","547297","546986","554015","544888","547304","555528","547436","544323","557696","543667","555618","547309","546996","552574","554204"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["garden","duck","planting","countryside","cultivation","land","work","shed","agriculture","barn"]}
