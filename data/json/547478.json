{"path":"547478.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene filled with a multitude of activities and people. The setting is a sunny beach day with clear blue skies and the ocean in the backdrop adorned by moderate waves. The beach itself is bustling with people engaged in various activities such as sunbathing, walking, or playing in the sand.\n\nIn the foreground, two vintage-style vehicles add a notable contrast to the natural beach setting. One of the vehicles prominently visible is a classic, open-top roadster painted in white and black, reminiscent of 1920s automotive design with its curved front and exposed engine compartment. Beside it, there's an orange van, which appears to be a modern make, possibly a 1970s or 80s model, equipped with roof racks, likely carrying beach gear.\n\nThe beachgoers are a diverse mix of adults and children, dressed in typical beach attire such as swimsuits and shorts. Several people are near or around the automobiles, indicating a gathering or a social event. Nearby, there are large trash bins, suggesting an organized effort to keep the area clean.\n\nThis setting reflects a leisurely day at the beach, underscored by a touch of nostalgia provided by the vintage vehicles, which may also suggest an automotive enthusiast event or a casual gathering of friends. The mood is casual, and the environment appears full of energy and enjoyment.","title":"Misquamicut State Beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["550934","545857","550922","547499","557475","550921","550925","545237","547495","550933","545252","548929","547628","553764","546794","547482"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","80","gathering","sunbathing","make","vehicle","beachgoer","bin","event","enthusiast"]}
