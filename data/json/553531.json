{"path":"553531.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a candid, domestic scene inside a rustic kitchen. On the left side of the frame, there is a wooden shelf filled with various kitchen items including pots, pans, mugs, and other cookware. Below the shelf, there's a sink cluttered with several white cooking pots and some objects that appear to be wrapped in a cloth.\n\nTo the right, a person is seen from behind, likely a woman based on the hairstyle and build. She is in a stretching or reaching pose, lifting her arms to adjust or fix something on an obscured wooden object, possibly a shelf or frame. She is dressed in a casual, long-sleeve grey shirt and darker pants. In front of her, there's a white gas stove with a kettle and a pot on top, and next to the stove, a container that resembles a coffee can.\n\nThe overall lighting suggests a natural, subdued tone, possibly hinting at an interior with limited lighting sources, which, along with the visible wear and simplicity of the furnishings, evokes a sense of lived-in warmth and modesty. The walls are sparsely decorated, with neutral colors and a touch of wear or aging visible, adding to the photograph's atmosphere of an everyday, unembellished moment.","title":"Sandy Watkins, 12, one of a family of eleven members, washes dishes in the kitchen of her house in Mulky Square.
