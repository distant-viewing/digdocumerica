{"path":"547198.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a stark industrial environment. It is taken during the day, under a bright sun which is visible in the top right corner, emitting strong rays and lens flares. The foreground is dominated by a sandy, rough terrain with visible tire tracks weaving across it, indicating recent activity, possibly from heavy vehicles.\n\nIn the background, the central focus is a large industrial plant emitting a thick, voluminous plume of dark smoke that billows upwards into the sky, forming a stark contrast against the bright blue background of the clear sky. The plant itself has several structures including tall chimneys and various buildings, all part of an industrial complex. The overall mood of the image, set by the juxtaposition of the natural sunlight and the industrial smoke, communicates a strong visual statement about environmental impact. The image effectively portrays the intrusion of industrialization into natural landscapes.","title":"Dune area behind Indiana Harbor, looking east toward Bethlehem Steel","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["552190","557302","550981","557218","545990","544173","557373","545446","549190","547539","551026","543011","550983","557248","546141","543992"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["statement","ray","flare","smoke","intrusion","industrialization","lens","plant","tire","plume"]}
