{"path":"554802.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged, open landscape likely of a mining or excavation site. In the foreground, there are large piles of dirt and rocks, suggesting recent digging or earth-moving activities. A winding unpaved road cuts through the scene, curving around the piles and stretching into the distance towards the rocky, barren hills that dominate the background. The terrain is uneven and natural, with a few sparse patches of vegetation barely visible.\n\nThe sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted, somber tone which enhances the feeling of desolation and abandonment. There are no visible structures or people, reinforcing the sense of isolation. The quality of the photograph has a vintage aspect, likely taken with an older camera, as indicated by its softer focus and color saturation. The overall composition draws attention to the curvature of the road, leading the viewer's eye through the landscape.","title":"Land stripped by the Hanna Coal Company off Route 100","placename":"Ohio","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544178","545533","545604","549179","554804","557468","554154","544418","552420","549180","543772","555882","544116","555610","554817","547979"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["pile","digging","curvature","cut","saturation","desolation","excavation","road","mining","abandonment"]}
