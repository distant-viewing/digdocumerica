{"path":"555263.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph shows a worker in an industrial setting, engaged in a task that requires protective equipment. The worker is dressed in a dark navy blue jacket with a light green shirt visible underneath, and is wearing a yellow hard hat. The worker's face is obscured by a large, black gas mask, indicating the potential presence of hazardous materials or fumes. On the worker's hands are yellow gloves which complement the safety theme.\n\nThe worker is holding a white, spherical object in one gloved hand and a small tool or device in the other, suggesting they might be performing a measurement or testing process. In the foreground, there are various items spread across what appears to be a worktable. Visible items include round containers with labels, a pack of cigarettes, and a few metallic tools which reflect light, thereby drawing attention to their presence.\n\nIn the background, the environment is somewhat cluttered and dimly lit, hinting at an indoor setting that might be a warehouse or a factory floor. There are piles of what appear to be bags stacked messily, some with visible text that suggests commercial or industrial contents.\n\nOverall, the focus of the photograph is on the worker and the immediate workspace, capturing a moment of industrial activity where safety and precise operation are crucial. The attire and equipment of the worker emphasize the importance of protection against environmental hazards in such settings.","title":"An environmental protection agency inspector checks Barrels of pesticides at the port of Newark, New Jersey.
