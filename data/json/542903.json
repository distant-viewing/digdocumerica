{"path":"542903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene maritime scene. In the foreground of the image, calm waters host three boats: one prominently featured sailing boat anchored near the center of the frame and two smaller motorboats. The sailing boat is white with a pointed bow and two bare masts standing tall. It reflects gently on the water surface, adding to the tranquility of the scene.\n\nThe background depicts a modest, rural coastline with several buildings, possibly a small village or a community. The buildings appear simple and scattered, some with visible antennas, nestled below a gentle, rolling hillside that recedes into the distance. The hill is largely bare with patches of greenery, suggesting a location that might be common in coastal regions with temperate climates. Beyond the hilltops, a faint hint of an overcast sky blends with the late afternoon or early evening light.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the boats in the calm water juxtaposed against the distant rural landscape and overcast sky, creates a peaceful and somewhat isolated feeling, typical of coastal living areas away from urban hustle. This image could evoke a sense of tranquility and the slow pace of life in such locations.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["548247","542907","544669","543545","542872","548733","554101","542877","550039","546939","542904","543246","548235","542908","547781","549380"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sailing","boats","climates","hilltop","village","pace","tranquility","boat","antenna","motorboat"]}
