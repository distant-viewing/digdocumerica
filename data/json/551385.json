{"path":"551385.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a carnival game booth, with a woman standing behind the counter. She is wearing a yellow sleeveless top and a light-colored headscarf, and appears to be looking off to the side with a somewhat thoughtful expression. \n\nThe booth itself features a game where players attempt to break balloons with darts to win a prize, as indicated by a sign that reads, \"Brake 3 Balloons win a-Prize.\" The sign has a small spelling error (\"brake\" instead of \"break\"). A red background panel is visible behind the balloons, and multicolored balloons are attached in a scattered pattern, some already burst.\n\nOn the left side of the booth, various stuffed toys and other small prizes hang as potential winnings. They include stuffed animals and a few figurines wrapped in clear plastic bags. The structure of the booth is wooden, painted in red and dark tones, with a blue countertop where a few darts are lying.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a typical moment at a fair or carnival, highlighting the leisure and entertainment aspects prominent in such venues.","title":"Operator of dart-throwing, balloon-breaking concession at Bagnell Dam amusement strip","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545444","545461","545454","551384","551689","552950","556216","551688","546975","551841","545449","557799","551290","545460","551295","551298"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["booth","balloon","carnival","game","entertainment","toy","headscarf","player","counter","venue"]}
