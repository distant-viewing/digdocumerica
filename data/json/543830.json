{"path":"543830.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic outdoor scene likely in a mining or industrial area. The central focus of the image is a forceful spray of water gushing from a partially visible large, rusted pipeline. The water jets into the air before cascading down onto a rugged terrain composed of small rocks and gravel, which shows signs of iron oxidation giving them a red-orange hue.\n\nThe background consists of a rocky environment with similar red and brown tones, suggesting an area rich in minerals or affected by mining runoff. No vegetation is visible, which could indicate the harshness of the environment or the effects of industrial activity. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day, which casts distinct shadows enhancing the texture and color contrast throughout the scene.\n\nThe composition uses a close-up perspective on the water burst, capturing the powerful movement and the fine droplets in sharp detail. The angle provides an intense, almost visceral sense of the water's force and the industrial scale of the equipment involved. This scene could be indicative not only of industrial activity but also raises potential environmental concerns such as water contamination and landscape disruption.","title":"Water from this pipe is pushed up by gas from a deep well.
