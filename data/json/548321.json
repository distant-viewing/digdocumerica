{"path":"548321.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an elevated view of an industrial area, likely taken from a high vantage point. The foreground features a large industrial complex with multiple buildings, some of which are flat-roofed and one particularly tall smokestack dominating the scene. The smokestack is releasing a plume of white smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Various other smaller chimneys and exhaust vents on the roofs of the buildings also release smoke or steam, contributing to the industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows elements of urban infrastructure, including a large bridge supporting a street filled with traffic, which spans across the photograph horizontally. Below and around the bridge are other buildings, possibly residential or smaller industrial structures, densely packed and layered back towards the horizon.\n\nIn the background, a densely populated urban landscape stretches out. Rows of buildings, possibly residential apartments or offices, can be seen extending into the distance where they become less distinguishable. The area has a somewhat gritty look, typical of urban industrial zones, with a color palette dominated by grays, browns, and the faded colors of the buildings' facades.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somewhat bleak, underlining themes of industry and urban density. The gray, overcast sky further enhances the industrial feel of the scene, giving it a somber overtone.","title":"Consolidated Edison smoke-stack in Brooklyn, looking to Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550177","548376","550172","550181","557225","550982","550344","546908","545987","550185","543001","555737","545268","546705","548326","550983"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["release","smokestack","bridge","building","exhaust","smoke","vent","become","apartment","underline"]}
