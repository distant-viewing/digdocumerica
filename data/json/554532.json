{"path":"554532.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene, natural setting, focusing on a toppled tree that forms a hollow, makeshift shelter over a small, rudimentary dirt trail. The tree, its trunk large and covered in moss and other small foliage, has fallen in such a way that its roots are partially exposed, creating a natural arch.\n\nUnderneath this natural arch, there is a young woman and a large dog. The woman, with medium-length hair, is dressed in a red and black flannel jacket, indicative of an outdoor activity setting. She seems to be in a moment of interaction or communication with the dog, which appears to be a light-colored, medium to large breed, attentive and standing close to the woman.\n\nThe background is densely forested, filled with various shades of green, suggesting this scene is set in a lush, wooded area. The daylight seems to be bright but filtered through the canopy of the forest, casting soft patches of light and shadow over the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, the dirt path is studded with scattered rocks and pebbles, enhancing the rustic and untouched feel of the environment. The overall mood of the image is one of peaceful coexistence with nature, highlighting a moment of quiet companionship and exploration in the wild.","title":"Tipped over tree shows its very shallow root structure and topsoil depth, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state strong winds cause severe blowdowns because of these factors","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554559","554537","551942","543040","547045","543446","543452","543490","542732","549716","549928","554971","553373","554668","554627","554099"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["dog","arch","flannel","woman","breed","medium","dirt","companionship","root","pebble"]}
