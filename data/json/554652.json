{"path":"554652.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a serene, natural landscape dominated by a winding lake nestled among dense forests. The lake is distinct for its irregular shape, featuring many inlets and protrusions, and it mirrors the sky, reflecting a deep blue hue. Surrounding the lake are rolling, forest-covered hills which display a spectrum of colors, indicating either a variety of tree types or a change in seasons.\n\nThe entirety of the landscape is enveloped in wilderness, with no visible signs of human activity or development. The hills progressively recede into the background where they become more muted and blend with the horizon. The sky above is clear with a gradation from light to darker blue, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon setting. A bird can be seen in the upper right-hand part of the image, adding to the sense of tranquility and untouched natural beauty of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the vastness and unspoiled beauty of the natural environment.","title":"Sargeants Pond, near Blue Mountain, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550579","550612","555695","556926","554526","552141","555388","550541","556930","555698","554527","542882","543643","556931","550644","555702"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lake","spectrum","protrusion","entirety","gradation","inlet","forest","hill","change","bird"]}
