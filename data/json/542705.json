{"path":"542705.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring various tall structures, which appear to be part of a chemical plant or refinery. The main focal points are several large towers and cylindrical containers, possibly storage tanks, fitted with external piping and access stairways. These towers and tanks are constructed of metal and have a functional, robust appearance typical of such facilities.\n\nIn the foreground, there's an out-of-focus view of tree branches, suggesting the photo was taken from behind some foliage, adding a framing device that contrasts the natural elements with the industrial setting. The industrial structures are seen beyond a chain-link fence, indicating a barrier that restricts access to the facility. This setup gives the image a voyeuristic feel, as if peering into a normally hidden aspect of industrial operations.\n\nThe sky in the background is bright and slightly overexposed, which may indicate the photo was taken on a sunny day. The image also exhibits a slightly grainy texture and blueish tint, typical of older film photography. This photograph effectively captures the stark contrast between industrial development and natural elements, possibly underscoring themes of environmental impact or industrial expansion.","title":"Mobil oil refinery seen through smog","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544179","549713","546122","545992","546108","551082","545998","546170","544691","546064","546107","557220","557304","546143","557225","542545"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["access","tower","stairway","tank","refinery","expansion","piping","link","facility","tint"]}
