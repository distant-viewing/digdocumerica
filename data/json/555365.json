{"path":"555365.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures two transparent shrimp-like creatures against a dimly lit underwater backdrop. These creatures, likely some type of shrimp, are located close together on a substrate composed of small, multicolored gravel or coarse sand. The creatures themselves are nearly transparent, with visible details including their long antennae and the dark spots of their eyes. Their bodies, segmented and slender, blend subtly into the dark, murky background. The overall mood of the image is serene and natural, with a focus on the delicate and almost ethereal appearance of the shrimp against the simple, gritty texture of the ocean floor. The lighting is subdued, emphasizing the translucency of the shrimp and the quiet depths of their underwater environment.","title":"A juvenile shrimp being raised at the University of Arizona Environmental Research Laboratory at Tucson in their high intensity aquaculture experiments.
