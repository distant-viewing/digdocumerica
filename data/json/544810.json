{"path":"544810.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph portrays a landscape deeply impacted by pollution and neglect. It captures a muddy river or stream filled with debris and pollutants. Prominently in the foreground, there is a large, overturned barrel, possibly metallic, half-submerged in the water, surrounded by branches and other debris. The water appears stagnant, likely contaminated, reflecting patches of oil or chemical residue on its surface. \n\nThe surrounding area is equally degraded; both banks of the watercourse are littered with garbage, rubble, and broken vegetation. The left bank, in particular, shows a steep, eroded slope leading up to a flat area that supports a makeshift structure built on stilts, possibly indicating frequent flooding or high water levels. There is a mix of sparse grass and garbage across both sides of the bank, adding to the scene's dilapidation.\n\nIn the background, there is a clearer view of the sky with a few white clouds suggesting a sunny day, which contrasts sharply with the polluted environment. The houses located somewhat distantly on the right bank appear rundown, with piles of rubble or debris surrounding them, echoing the general neglect seen throughout the scene.\n\nThis photograph likely illustrates a significant environmental issue in an industrial or post-industrial area, emphasizing themes of pollution, neglect, and the pressing need for environmental clean-up and sustainable management practices.","title":"The polluted South Platte River","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["547907","551531","543762","547493","556419","552127","551562","552811","550812","550259","547524","550205","550800","552046","550352","547485"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bank","neglect","rubble","garbage","debris","pollution","residue","stilt","pollutant","flooding"]}
