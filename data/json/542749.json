{"path":"542749.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a large, ancient tree trunk that has fallen over and is lying on rich, dark earth. The trunk is predominantly characterized by its rugged, gnarled bark with a plethora of textures ranging from deep furrows to smoother patches that have a somewhat glossy sheen under the lighting conditions. The colors of the bark are diverse, featuring shades of dark browns and grays with subtle hints of reddish-brown undertones.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the trunk arcs dramatically, creating a natural hollow area beneath it. This hollow part of the trunk is shadowy and deep, offering a stark visual contrast to the bright and detailed texture of the outer bark. The inside of this hollow looks charred and dark, suggesting that the tree might have been struck by lightning or affected by fire at some point in its life.\n\nThe background of the image is less distinct but reveals a forest setting with additional trees, which have straight, vertical trunks and are surrounded by a somewhat blurry mix of foliage and shadow. This suggests that the photograph is taken in a densely wooded area, possibly in a natural, undisturbed forest.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on the textured trunk in the foreground and the darker, mysterious hollow, along with the blurred woodland backdrop, gives an impression of quiet isolation and natural decay, highlighting the cycle of life within a forest ecosystem.","title":"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557616","557621","555001","554974","550792","542570","545288","543488","553587","554973","544662","545278","545292","553577","555181","554967"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["trunk","bark","forest","undertone","inside","arc","cycle","sheen","woodland","fire"]}
