{"path":"547407.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four men seated around a rectangular table in a plainly decorated room. One man is addressing the group and pointing to a document on the table. Each man is attentively looking towards the documents, suggesting a business or organizational meeting might be in progress.\n\nThe room is modestly decorated with beige walls and floral curtains framing a sunlit window to one right. On the left side wall, an American flag stands prominently beside a couple of framed certificates or awards hanging behind the men. Despite the basic furnishings and decorations, the setting gives an air of formality, likely a community hall or a local organizational office.\n\nThe men are dressed in casual and semi-business attire, wearing patterned and striped shirts typical of a bygone era, indicating this photo could be from the mid-20th century. The atmosphere is one of engagement and concentration, reinforcing the imageâ€™s capture of a moment of consideration or decision-making.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a nostalgic and historical tone, with its older color palette and the style of clothing worn by the men which provides some visual clues about the time period it was taken in.","title":"Members of the Garland Village Board hold monthly meeting in a room above the volunteer fire department.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547368","547284","547365","547362","546299","552616","552617","549073","547367","552618","548237","547320","555247","555234","557704","556028"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["document","man","room","table","decision","formality","making","consideration","furnishing","hall"]}
