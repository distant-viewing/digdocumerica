{"path":"555141.jpg","date":"June 1971","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up of a section of a cut tree trunk. The main focus is on the rich-textured, freshly split wood and its various elements. There are large splinters and shards prominently displayed in the center and right of the image, showing jagged edges and fibrous textures. These splinters project outwards, creating a dynamic and rugged appearance. \n\nThe surface of the tree trunk reveals the circular annual growth rings, providing a detailed and natural pattern that is common in sawn wood. These rings incrementally vary in thickness, indicating different growth rates which might have been influenced by environmental conditions. The wood itself has a deep, warm, reddish-brown color that highlights the natural beauty and complexity of its grain.\n\nIn portions of the photograph, particularly in the upper and right sections, finer splinters can be seen, and in the background, the rest of the stumpâ€™s surface is smoother with less pronounced features compared to the broken center. The overall image effectively captures the raw and natural textures of wood, showcasing both its robustness and fragility.","title":"Closeup of a stump in a recent clear-cut in olympic national timberland, Washington.
