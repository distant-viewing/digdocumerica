{"path":"553806.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of several people canoeing in a river. The image is framed by lush green leaves in the foreground, which partially obstruct the view, adding a sense of depth and intimacy. The focus is on a single canoe being paddled by three individuals who appear engaged in a leisurely expedition. They are moving towards the right side of the frame.\n\nThe people in the canoe are dressed in outdoor, casual attire suitable for a river expedition; two of them are wearing hats, which suggests a need for protection from the sun or elements. The canoe itself looks sturdy and traditional, possibly made of wood, and cuts through the water, creating ripples and splashes around it.\n\nThe background and surroundings are dimly lit and shrouded in shadows, presumably due to the dense foliage overhead, which suggests that this scene is set in a heavily wooded area or under a canopy of trees. This setting generates a tranquil and somewhat secluded atmosphere.\n\nThe image has a dynamic feel due to the movement of the canoe and the natural light filtering through the leaves, highlighting the physical activity and the peaceful environment in which it takes place. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of adventure and appreciation for nature.","title":"Retracing the Louis Joliet-Father Jacques Marquette expedition on the Wisconsin River.
