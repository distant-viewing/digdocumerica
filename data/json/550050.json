{"path":"550050.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph shows an individual rowing a narrow boat, likely a single scull, in a body of water. The person, seated towards the rear of the boat, is captured in the midst of a stroke, with one oar partially submerged in the water and the other raised slightly above it. They wear a dark outfit, which contrasts against the light rippling surface of the water. From the perspective of the image, it appears the rower is moving towards the left, indicated by the gentle wake and water disturbances trailing behind the boat.\n\nThe overall ambiance conveyed by the image is serene and tranquil, underscored by the calmness of the water and the clear sky reflecting off the surface. No land or other objects are visible in the immediate background, giving an expansive feel to the scene. The water glistens with light, possibly indicating a sunny day, although the direct sun is not visible in the picture. The framing and composition focus strongly on the rower and their alignment in the environment, highlighting the peaceful solitude of the activity.","title":"Sculling on the Charles River, Harvard University area Cambridge","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["557564","550975","546819","546070","548553","553402","549416","553401","553404","553403","550835","549417","553407","552310","551549","553411"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","water","rowing","oar","alignment","rear","wake","midst","calmness","disturbance"]}
