{"path":"550107.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque urban street scene, likely in a historic district, under a clear blue sky. The image prominently features a row of distinct, well-maintained buildings.\n\nOn the left, there is a large stone building with a flat facade, light brickwork, and multiple symmetrical windows framed with black shutters. This building appears to be of a substantial size with two visible levels over a ground floor, showcasing a more commercial or public use based on its size and stately appearance.\n\nAdjacent to this, stretching towards the right, is a series of attached townhouses. Each house varies slightly in color and architectural detail but generally shares a traditional, possibly 18th or 19th-century style. The first in this series is a green three-story building adorned with multiple American flags, suggesting a patriotic or festive occasion. The roof of this building has a classic steep slant with dormer windows protruding.\n\nNext along the row are buildings with similar heights and features, including more American flags and ornamental details like window shutters and wrought-iron railings.\n\nAlong the street level, there are various elements indicating both residential and commercial use: a small seating area with an umbrella offers a caf√©-like setting, a man walks by dressed casually, and there are lamp posts and planted trees enhancing the urban streetscape.\n\nThe overall composition captures an inviting, historically rich environment, cohesive in its architectural unity and vibrant with everyday activity. The scene likely dates back several decades as indicated by the style of dress of the passerby and the classic design of the lamp posts and overall streetscape.","title":"Bonne bell cosmetics restoration program transformed a decaying business district of suburban Lakewood into this attractive \"georgetown row\" of shops","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550115","555920","551722","546440","555912","550111","548470","558030","550035","550110","546428","550114","557156","551629","543360","555900"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["streetscape","shutter","flag","post","unity","protruding","wrotch","level","inviting","series"]}
