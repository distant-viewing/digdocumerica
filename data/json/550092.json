{"path":"550092.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features a prominent circular sign with the text \"UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE MAXIMUM PURCHASE 10 GALLONS\" against a vivid blue sky. The sign seems to relate to a fuel restriction, likely set during a time of shortage. The scene includes a person crouching near the rear of an older model car, which is positioned next to a fuel pump at a gas station. The person appears to be interacting with the carâ€™s fuel tank, possibly filling it up with gas.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple fuel pumps visible, indicative of a typical gas station setup. The surroundings suggest a clear, sunny day due to the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground. The overall ambiance of the image emits a somewhat tense or regulated atmosphere due to the imposition of fuel limits, contrasting with the otherwise ordinary task of filling up a car. The dots or reflections on the image could be artifacts from the photographic process or lighting, adding a slightly abstract layer to the otherwise straightforward scene.","title":"'Sign of energy crisis'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548049","548173","555465","548053","548171","555486","555485","555434","555494","555489","555467","548047","548169","555484","548170","555498"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["fuel","gas","pump","gallon","station","restriction","shortage","car","artifact","notice"]}
