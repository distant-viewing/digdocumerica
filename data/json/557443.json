{"path":"557443.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a young woman smiling and holding a living crawfish in her hand. The woman has shoulder-length brown hair and wears large, teardrop-shaped glasses with a thin frame. She appears joyful and intrigued by the crawfish, which is prominently displayed in her extended hand, close to the camera. The crawfish's large claws, tangled antennae, and wet, muddy exterior suggest it might have just been taken from its aquatic environment.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a light-colored shirt with a floral pattern, though only part of her shirt is visible due to the close-up and shallow depth of field of the photo. The background is blurred but seems to be outdoors with natural light, possibly near a body of water where the crawfish was caught.\n\nOverall, the focus and lighting highlight the interaction between the woman and the crawfish, creating a vibrant and engaging scene centered on discovery and interaction with nature.","title":"Marine life from Upper Newport Bay, near Newport Beach, the bay, an excellent example of a bird refuge, was scheduled for development as a yacht harbour.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["553913","543751","543905","543909","545182","543916","543179","550316","543912","552941","552943","551596","546308","546316","545284","545165"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["woman","antennae","claw","intrigue","discovery","hand","interaction","live","up","shoulder"]}
