{"path":"555186.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a cluster of white and yellow flowers in the foreground, prominently displayed against a natural backdrop. The flowers, which are large and trumpet-shaped with a prominent yellow central pistil surrounded by a ring of white petals, appear to be thriving amidst a bed of dark soil and dried vegetation.\n\nBehind the flowers, the landscape includes a weathered stump of a cut tree, adding a sense of past human activity in this otherwise natural scene. The stump, bleached pale and jagged, contrasts with the lush greenery of scattered conifer trees visible further in the background. These trees add depth to the scene and suggest a forested or mountainous region.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its vivid floral foreground set against mundane remnants of forestry and a natural backdrop, creates a visual narrative that contrasts life and decay, while also highlighting the resilience of nature in a disturbed environment. The muted sky above, possibly overcast, gives the environment a soft and even light, enriching the colors of the scene.","title":"Trilliums growing on a southwest facing slope clear-cut six years earlier in the Satsop River drainage system of Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
