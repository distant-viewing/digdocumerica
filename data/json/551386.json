{"path":"551386.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts two men engaged in a conversation in what appears to be a misty or foggy coastal setting. The man on the left, who wears a baseball cap and a denim shirt, is listening attentively to the other man on the right, who has a beard and is dressed in a brown shirt with suspenders. The older man seems to be explaining something, which could be related to the activity they are part of, while gesturing with his hands.\n\nIn front of them, partially cropped by the bottom edge of the photograph, is a large black tub filled with small, silvery fish, suggesting the men might be involved in fishing or gathering these fish. Beside the tub, there's a fishnet, further emphasizing the fishing context. Several more people are visible in the soft-focus background, similarly engaged in activities with nets, suggesting a community or group effort in this fishing activity.\n\nThe overall composition, coupled with the foggy background, creates a serene maritime scene that focuses on traditional fishing and the interaction between the individuals involved. The photo captures a candid moment of work and dialogue, strongly reflecting a sense of camaraderie and shared endeavor.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
