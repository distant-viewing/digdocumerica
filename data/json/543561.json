{"path":"543561.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and detailed scene of a natural pond or marshy body of water. In the foreground, there is a variety of aquatic vegetation, including water plants and tufts of grasses that emerge above the water's surface. The plant life is dense and appears to be thriving, showing a robust and healthy ecosystem.\n\nThe surface of the water partially reflects the surroundings, including tall, thin tree trunks that are distinctly mirrored, extending vertically in the image and creating a contrast with the horizontal layout of the pond's vegetation. This gives a layered textural effect to the scene.\n\nThe water appears calm, with only slight ripples, possibly due to a gentle breeze. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be late afternoon, as the light seems soft and natural, enhancing the serene and untouched feel of the environment.\n\nThe background and upper part of the image are dominated by the reflections of tall, slender trees, likely situated around the pond. These reflections blur into the darker tones of the water, contributing to a peaceful and somewhat mysterious ambiance, drawing attention to the natural beauty and tranquility of the setting.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a serene moment in a natural setting, focusing on the interaction between water, plant life, and light, while offering a reflection of the trees that adds depth and interest to the composition.","title":"Nevada -- Tahoe National Forest, California","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["551352","554623","542554","550750","544524","547509","550784","550786","544765","554603","554591","546963","545008","542582","553465","544525"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["pond","reflection","water","plant","tuft","breeze","ecosystem","layout","interest","ripple"]}
