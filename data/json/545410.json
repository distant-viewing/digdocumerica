{"path":"545410.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene at sunset. Multiple tall, narrow chimneys emit thick, dark smoke against the backdrop of a vibrant orange sun setting in the background. The sun appears partially obscured by one of the chimneys, creating a dramatic silhouette effect. The foreground shows a variety of industrial structures, including additional chimneys and utility poles, all in silhouette due to the backlighting of the sunset.\n\nPower lines are visible crisscrossing in front of the chimneys, adding to the industrial feel of the scene. The sky transitions from a deep orange near the sun to a darker hue as it moves away from the horizon, indicating the time of day as late evening. Overall, the image communicates a powerful visual contrast between the natural beauty of the sunset and the harsh, polluting presence of industrial activities.","title":"U.s.  Steel plant.
