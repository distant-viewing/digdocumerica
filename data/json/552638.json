{"path":"552638.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph shows a tender and intimate moment between a mother and her newborn baby in a hospital setting. The mother, who is wearing glasses and a light-colored hospital gown that features a diamond pattern, is looking down affectionately at her newborn baby cradled in her arms. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and appears to be smiling gently at the infant.\n\nThe newborn baby is wrapped snugly in a soft, pale-yellow blanket and is wearing a white, long-sleeved outfit. Notably, the baby has a small medical tube taped to one cheek, suggesting some form of medical attention, but they otherwise appear healthy and are sleeping peacefully.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus but features the pale colors and textured surfaces typical of a hospital environment, such as a pillow and a partial view of medical equipment or furniture near the edge. The emotional warmth of the scene provides a contrast to the institutional backdrop, highlighting the connection between the mother and child in the first moments of the babyâ€™s life outside the womb.","title":"At calggett memorial hospital--walter solon moyer iii, the first baby of the new year, and his mother","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558172","558166","558171","558169","558170","557368","553533","558175","556294","556233","556146","558409","557369","556145","556299","558405"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["baby","hospital","mother","gown","pillow","sleep","cheek","tender","tube","wrap"]}
