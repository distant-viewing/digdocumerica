{"path":"545361.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban alleyway lined with aging and dilapidated brick buildings. The walls of the buildings are marked with graffiti, some of which includes words and others appear to be simple tags or marks. These buildings show signs of neglect and wear, with some windows bricked up and others without any cover, exposing the interiors.\n\nThe alley is paved but littered with debris such as small trash and patches of dirt or broken pavement. Above, a network of utility poles and lines runs parallel to the alley, adding to the gritty, urban atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe lighting hints at either early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows are long and cast prominently across the alley, intensifying the mood of abandonment. The sky is clear and adds a contrast to the shadowed and somewhat foreboding nature of the alley environment.\n\nNo people are visible in this scene, emphasizing the desolation and possibly underscoring themes of urban decay and neglect. The focus and composition of the photograph guide the viewer's eye down the alley, leading to speculate about what might lie beyond the visible space.","title":"Alley off 3rd Avenue in the area of El Paso","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552967","544072","551131","552969","546525","545343","545542","549786","557345","549785","545315","550253","552750","546514","553506","550145"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["alley","neglect","alleyway","guide","tag","other","mark","pavement","aging","desolation"]}
