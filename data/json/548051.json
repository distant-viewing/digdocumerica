{"path":"548051.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a beach scene where a significant amount of driftwood and debris are scattered across the sand, leading toward the shoreline. In the foreground, an individual is walking on the beach, facing away from the camera. This person is dressed in dark clothing and carries a large white object, possibly a piece of foam or light driftwood, on their shoulder. The beach appears quite vast and deserted aside from this person.\n\nThe background features the ocean with moderate waves breaking near the shore. The sky is relatively clear, suggesting it might be a sunny day. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a secluded or less frequented beach, emphasized by the natural debris and the solitary figure. The mood is somewhat serene but also a little somber due to the lack of vibrant activity and the presence of washed-up wood, which often signifies natural events that can alter the landscape of such environments.","title":"Collecting driftwood near the mouth of the Columbia River, Pacific Ocean in background","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543078","543069","543048","555469","546953","548055","544989","542887","542886","555468","542889","547943","546970","547607","543293","542890"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","driftwood","debris","foam","person","amount","lack","shoulder","sand","shoreline"]}
