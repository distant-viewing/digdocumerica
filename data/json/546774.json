{"path":"546774.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a river or lake with a focus on a dilapidated wooden dock protruding into the water. On the dock, there are three men engaged in different activities. The first man, on the left, appears to be walking towards a corner of the dock with his back partly turned to the camera, near some objects including a bucket and what looks like pieces of wood or rubble. The second man is crouching near the center of the dock, possibly tending to some task on the ground. The third man is standing near the edge of the dock, holding a pole or a stick, perhaps fishing or just stirring the water.\n\nThe wooden dock is in a state of disrepair, with visible broken planks and detritus scattered around. In the water surrounding the dock, there are floating debris and dark patches, possibly oil or waste, contributing to a sense of environmental neglect. The water itself appears calm, reflecting the blue of the sky.\n\nIn the background, beyond the water, there is a grassy bank lined with trees and a neatly manicured park area. Vehicles can be seen parked in the distance, and there are visible road signs, indicating a nearby roadway or urban setting. The contrast between the foreground activities and the more manicured background suggests a boundary or edge of urban and industrial activities near a recreational or public space.","title":"Crabbing off an old dock near port covington in Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["545928","547584","551985","546079","544266","554534","544260","543231","547582","544306","544567","547594","551986","545936","547033","547626"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["dock","stirr","detritus","ten","manicured","man","water","crouch","protrud","rubble"]}
