{"path":"551894.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling subway station scene. The setting is an underground platform characterized by a distinctive curved design, with the ceiling and walls forming a continuous, rounded tunnel-like shape. The station is lit by a series of fluorescent lights running along the center of the ceiling, casting a bright white glow that contrasts with the yellowish tone of the walls.\n\nA subway train, appearing vintage in style with a dark blue and white exterior, is stationed on the right side of the platform. It has stopped to allow passengers to board or disembark. The platform is busy with activity; there are many commuters present, some seated on benches along the platform edge, while others stand or walk about. The passengers display a variety of outfits suggestive of a diverse urban population, possibly during a busy hour of the day.\n\nAlong the platform, there are horizontal blue bands and name signs indicating the station name, which is not clearly legible in the photograph. The ambiance of the scene suggests a moment of transient movement, typical of a metro system in a large city. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the architecture of the subway station and the dynamics of urban life, captures a common yet evocative public transportation environment.\n","title":"A schnell-bahn (express) station at marienplatz, three levels below the street","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551895","556651","551883","556821","556818","556650","556815","556660","556812","556823","556774","551889","551886","556652","556663","556779"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","station","subway","ceiling","passenger","name","disembark","population","commuter","tunnel"]}
