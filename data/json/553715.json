{"path":"553715.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, there is a woman dressed in a vibrant and regal attire, consisting of a floral patterned pink dress adorned with a bold, darker pink fabric that seems like a cape or shawl draped over her shoulders. Her gown flows elegantly, enhancing her poised posture atop a horse. Her head is adorned with a decorative floral wreath that complements her outfit.\n\nThe woman is sitting on a white horse, holding onto the reins delicately, indicating an aura of grace and control. This scene seems to be taken during a parade or a similarly festive event, as suggested by the way she is dressed and her elevated position on the horse, likely part of the celebration.\n\nThe background features blurred out figures and elements that suggest a crowd, possibly other parade participants or spectators, adding to the lively, communal atmosphere. The focus on the woman, paired with the soft-focus background, draws attention to her and the details of her festive outfit and poised demeanor. This setting is likely outdoors during daylight, given the natural lighting that illuminates the scene.","title":"Costumed for aloha day parade, one of many festivities during annual aloha week","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["557058","553717","553716","557051","549574","549583","552651","549566","549576","557062","553708","557712","557041","542810","553916","554689"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","poise","parade","outfit","shawl","rein","gown","woman","grace","adorn"]}
