{"path":"554751.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene autumn scene centered around a calm, reflective body of water, possibly a lake. The primary focal point is the vibrant foliage of the trees surrounding the lake, particularly a brilliant red tree prominently displayed in the foreground. These trees showcase a variety of autumn colors, including shades of red, orange, yellow, and some remaining green.\n\nThe reflection in the water is crystal clear, creating a mirror image of the trees and their vivid colors on the lake's surface. This doubles the visual impact of the autumn colors, making the scene both vivid and tranquil. The water's stillness suggests a lack of wind and a quiet atmosphere at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe background beyond the trees is subtly lighter, likely due to a blend of sky and distant foliage which creates a soft gradient from the darker tones of the tree line towards the sky. The composition of the photograph, with trees framing the scene and the central focus on the reflection, draws the viewer's eye to the interplay of colors and the natural beauty of the setting.\n\nThis scene likely evokes a sense of peace and appreciation for the seasonal transition, capturing the essence of fall in a forested area by a lake. No human activity or artificial structures are visible, which emphasizes the natural and untouched quality of the scene.","title":"Red maple reflected off a point on Twitchell Lake in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554737","554649","554758","554757","554749","554750","554648","554738","554711","558093","554753","552599","554714","554635","554761","554748"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["autumn","lake","tree","crystal","reflection","appreciation","peace","foliage","mirror","color"]}
