{"path":"552647.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a dimly lit interior scene, likely within a small business or office setting during nighttime. The room is characterized by a subdued and quiet atmosphere.\n\nIn the central foreground, there’s a wooden table accompanied by chairs, creating a simple sitting area. An older man with white hair is seated at the table, engrossed in reading materials spread before him, suggesting he is either a patron or possibly the owner or employee of the establishment.\n\nTo the left of the photograph, there's a counter area cluttered with various items like notices, leaflets, and possibly snack boxes, indicating it might serve as a service point or small store checkout. Above the counter, shelves can be observed, likely holding files or more store-related items.\n\nThe background features a brightly illuminated glass window advertisement, providing a stark contrast to the overall darkness of the room’s interior. This bright window seems to display some type of graphic or text, adding a bit of external context to the setting.\n\nThe ambiance appears serene and somewhat solitary, with the focus predominantly on the man and his engagement with the reading material, amidst an environment filled with elements typical of a functional, routine-focused workspace. The composition employs naturalistic lighting predominantly from outside light sources, which casts shadows and highlights the quietude and isolation of the scene.","title":"This old man spends almost every evening watching TV alone in the lobby of the Midland Hotel.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["546580","555430","552619","546500","546572","553517","545986","555532","557765","547427","546560","542690","546486","555297","548072","547353"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["reading","counter","store","room","table","notice","employee","owner","patron","graphic"]}
