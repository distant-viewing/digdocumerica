{"path":"545588.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor landscape, predominantly highlighting a rugged, natural path flanked by diverse vegetation and imposing rock formations. In the foreground, there is tall grass and various shrubs glowing warmly under the sunlight, painting a rustic golden and green hue across the scene. This vegetation is dense and wild, suggesting an area that is not heavily manicured but left in its natural state.\n\nA dirt path, covered partially by grass and small plants, leads through the middle of the composition, winding gently through the scene. In the distance, a lone figure can be seen walking on the path, adding a sense of scale and life to the otherwise tranquil and still environment. This person appears small compared to the vast landscape, emphasizing the grandeur of the surroundings.\n\nThe background is dominated by impressive rock cliffs that rise steeply on one side of the path. These rock formations have layers visible, indicating geological formations that have been shaped over millennia. Their colors range from deep browns to lighter sand hues, complementing the organic palette of the scene.\n\nAbove, the sky is partly visible, peeking through areas not overshadowed by the high cliff walls and appears to be a light, serene blue, suggesting a clear day. The contrast between the sunny areas and the shadows cast by the cliffs and lush trees adds depth and a rich texture to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph is a harmonious blend of natural elements, conveying a peaceful yet awe-inspiring slice of a rugged, untouched outdoor environment.","title":"Main valley floor of the Maze","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545592","555589","545724","558083","555592","545759","549225","544903","552549","544341","547538","544902","549034","552903","550478","551520"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["path","cliff","formation","rock","millennium","overshadow","inspire","awe","manicure","peek"]}
