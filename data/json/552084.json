{"path":"552084.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph presents a close-up view of a rectangular, green road sign with white text that reads \"NO LITTERING OR DUMPING $20 FINE.\" The sign appears to be placed in a rural or semi-rural area, and it shows signs of vandalism, especially evident from multiple bullet holes which have left the metal punctured and bent in places, with rust visible around the periphery of these deformations.\n\nThe background is softly focused and presents dense green foliage, typical of a wooded or undeveloped natural area. The lighting in the image suggests it is taken during daylight with clear, perhaps sunny weather, as indicated by the brightness and vivid colors of the sign and its surroundings. The overall impression is of an isolated or less-trafficked location, emphasized by the untended state of the sign and the overgrown vegetation in the background.","title":"Despite sign, dumping continuesâ€”even to using the sign itself as a target for refuse.","placename":"Lawrence (Kan.)","location":"Lawrence, Kansas","nn1":["553729","557551","545517","547895","546386","545298","547992","544262","548846","550699","544813","546805","548845","548158","547827","554103"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","periphery","hole","present","place","dump","brightness","rust","daylight","text"]}
