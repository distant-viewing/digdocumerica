{"path":"555550.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat muddy and rocky stream. The foreground is filled with various sizes of rocks and boulders scattered around a puddle of murky, brownish water. A few of these rocks half-submerge in the puddle, with their surfaces wet and reflecting slight light. The edges of the water are uneven, with patches of mud that have cracked as they dried.\n\nIn the background, a large, round culvert or tunnel, likely made of concrete or metal, is visible. It seems to serve as a channel for the stream, disappearing into a vegetated area. The tunnelâ€™s opening is dark and water is visibly flowing into or out of it. Surrounding the area are hints of greenery, suggesting the location might be within a natural setting that's somewhat maintained or altered by human activity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the scene gives an impression of a quiet, slightly overcast day in a rural or semi-wild environment. The image captures a detailed interaction of natural elements with human-made infrastructure, indicating an intersection of a natural waterway with development, possibly for drainage or stream diversion purposes.","title":"Olentangy river was polluted june 20, 1974, when fire and explosions desTroyed a pennwalt corporation chemical storage building and chemicals spilled into the river, causing a major fish kill for four miles downstream.
