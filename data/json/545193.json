{"path":"545193.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene aboard a vessel, viewed from its stern. The deck is piled high with a mountain of discarded objects, primarily various shells, which suggests that the boat is used for some sort of shellfish processing or collecting operation. At the center of the image, standing at the edge of the pile of debris, are two individuals. These figures, wearing casual, work-appropriate clothing, appear to be involved in the task of managing or overseeing the dumping of the shells into the water.\n\nThe background offers a view of a calm sea extending to a hazy horizon under an overcast sky. Along the water, there are several long line arrays, possibly part of aquaculture operations, which are common in shellfish farming. The perspective and framing of the view provide a glimpse into the daily operation and environmental impact of this specific maritime industry. The overall tone and setting of the image convey a somewhat gritty and industrial atmosphere tied to seafood production and its by-products.","title":"Oyster rafts, where young oysters are grown prior to planting.","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545189","546305","552877","545093","552875","552863","545178","544995","545181","546758","547020","554200","551046","552876","552865","544993"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["shellfish","shell","operation","appropriate","dumping","aquaculture","seafood","pile","oversee","collect"]}
