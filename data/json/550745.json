{"path":"550745.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil lake scene during twilight or on an overcast day. The water appears calm and reflects a moody sky, giving the scene a serene and somewhat melancholy ambiance. In the foreground, there are small patches of foam or pollutants scattered across the water’s surface, and a few aquatic plants are visible, emerging from the lake.\n\nLooking further into the distance, there are small islets or rocks, upon which several sparse trees are growing. The shorelines on either side of the picture are lined with dense, dark forest, providing a sense of seclusion and wilderness. The opposite shore fades into a gentle haze, suggesting mist or fog, which adds to the dreamlike quality of the scene. The overall composition of the photograph—with its emphasis on the reflective water surface and the natural surrounding elements—conveys a deep sense of peace and natural beauty.","title":"Outlet of the androscoggin river into merrymeeting bay near Brunswick.
