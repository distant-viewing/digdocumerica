{"path":"555177.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This image appears to be a close-up or macro photograph of a densely textured surface, potentially a digital glitch or a highly abstract painting. The photographic composition reveals a dynamic and complex array of vertical and horizontal stripes that form a rich, detailed pattern. The colors are predominantly dark with shades of brown, white, and black intermixing, giving it a somewhat chaotic yet ordered appearance. The texture suggested by the photograph conveys a sense of depth, possibly indicating layers or varying focal points within the image. There are no discernible objects or people visible, as the focus is entirely on the abstract pattern presented. The overall mood is intriguing and slightly disorienting due to the intricate details and the lack of easily recognizable forms.","title":"Microphotograph of Douglas fir sectioned.
