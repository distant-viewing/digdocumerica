{"path":"557195.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a calm, wintry landscape scene. The foreground is covered in patches of snow and long brown grasses indicating the cold season. The landscape gradually rises into rolling hills, which are similarly covered in a blend of snow and exposed grassland. A single bare tree stands out in the middle ground, located slightly left of the center, providing a focal point in the otherwise sparse scenery. The hills in the background are softly shaped and lead the eye across the horizon. The sky is overcast with grayish-blue tones, suggesting a cold, wintry day. The overall feeling is one of quiet and solitude in a natural, undisturbed environment. The photo's color palette is subdued with earthy browns and cold blue tones, typical of winter landscapes.","title":"View of the Konza Prairie, 1,000 acres of virgin tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas, in the winter.
