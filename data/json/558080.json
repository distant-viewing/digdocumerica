{"path":"558080.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays a small plant with broad, serrated leaves growing atop a moss-covered log in a dark forest setting. The image focuses particularly on the vibrant green of the plant illuminated softly by sunlight, which contrasts strongly with the dimly lit, shadowy background. The log on which the plant grows exhibits a blend of rough textures and is only partially visible as it angles from the bottom left to the mid-right of the frame. The surrounding area is shrouded in darkness, emphasizing the light hitting the plant. The leaves of the plant appear fresh and lively, adding a burst of life and color to the otherwise dark, forest environment. Additionally, some patches of moss can be spotted on the log and around the base of the plant, enhancing the natural, woodland scene.","title":"Clearweed (pilea pumila) is a natural vegetation of the cuyahoga valley.
