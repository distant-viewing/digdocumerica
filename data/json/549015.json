{"path":"549015.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image primarily features a brightly illuminated sign that reads \"CASINO\" in vibrant and bold lettering. The letters are densely studded with numerous small lights, highlighting each alphabet distinctly. These lights give the text a dazzling, almost sparkling effect against the darker background. The sign is designed in a classic style reminiscent of vintage Las Vegas neon signs, meant to catch the eye and evoke a sense of excitement associated with casinos.\n\nThe background of the sign includes what appears to be additional illuminated designs, perhaps parts of other neon signs or decorative elements, which blur and meld into bands of horizontal lines. These lines, varying in color and intensity, create a sense of motion and vibrancy, enhancing the overall luminous and lively atmosphere typical of a casino environment. The photograph captures a night-time ambiance, focusing exclusively on the artificial lighting used in the signage.","title":"Night lights","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549025","553139","549009","549026","553119","549022","551321","545462","545456","555424","549017","548970","542894","553121","545448","549014"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["neon","sign","excitement","band","vibrancy","intensity","lettering","night","line","letter"]}
