{"path":"546915.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial maritime scene, likely within a port or shipyard. You can see a heavy-duty crane lifting a vehicle, specifically what seems to be a large tractor or heavy construction equipment with multiple large, black tires, into or out of the cargo hold of a ship. The crane is equipped with multiple wires and strappings that securely suspend the vehicle, showcasing its significant lifting capacity. \n\nThe background features a partially visible ship with elements of metal framework and riggings augmenting the industrial feel of the scene. The sky is a mildly hazy blue, indicating fair weather conditions during this operation.\n\nA prominent subject in the foreground is a man, viewed from behind, overseeing the operation. He wears a light yellow safety helmet, indicative of standard safety gear in such environments, and a casual, short-sleeve blue shirt. His posture suggests he is attentively watching the hoisting process, possibly in a supervisory or operational role.\n\nOverall, the composition centers around the coordination and movement of heavy machinery, underlined by the attention of skilled workers ensuring safety and precision in this logistical operation. The use of color, light, and perspective focuses viewer attention on the dramatic mechanical operation and the lone figure, emphasizing both the scale of the machinery and the human element within this industrial setting.","title":"Unloading cargo from a ship docked at Dundalk Marine Terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555285","546796","546917","555284","549597","555269","555261","546861","544161","547615","545655","555283","549308","547113","546910","547223"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["safety","operation","ship","crane","lifting","coordination","shipyard","capacity","machinery","rigging"]}
