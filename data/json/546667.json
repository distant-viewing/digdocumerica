{"path":"546667.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment inside, what appears to be, a moving vehicle, predominantly shown in a dark, moody setting. It features a woman with a solemn expression, directing her gaze out of the car window. The lighting is dim and mostly focuses on her face, highlighting her contemplative mood. The interior of the car is barely visible except for some reflections and minor details, emphasizing the isolation of the subject. In the background, blurred and faint streaks of light suggest motion or other external illumination sources, giving a faint sense of the external environment that contrasts with the shadowy interior. The composition and minimalistic use of light effectively convey a quiet, introspective scene.","title":"Stopped for speeding","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556728","545316","557871","557847","557896","544437","557863","552935","556800","548255","556516","556079","553534","556738","545373","555975"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["interior","solemn","streak","illumination","car","source","candid","gaze","direct","quiet"]}
