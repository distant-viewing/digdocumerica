{"path":"550105.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene that seems typical of a mid-20th-century American suburb. The composition includes a low, flat-roofed building with a white exterior and a sign reading \"FOR LEASE\" with a contact number, indicating availability for rent. Atop this building, there stands a larger billboard with the message \"â€¦A GREAT PLACE TO BE!\" along with the identifier \"Cleveland Convention & Visitors Bureau,\" promoting Cleveland as a desirable destination.\n\nIn the foreground, a variety of vintage cars from the 1960s or 70s are parked in front of the building, showcasing the automotive design styles of that era. These vehicles include a mix of sedans, each parked diagonally adjacent to each other, with visible design features like pointed ends and chrome bumpers.\n\nTo the left of the image, a street post appears partially, displaying the intersection sign for Route 30 and \"BELLAIRE.\" Additional context within the scene includes other small commercial or industrial buildings, a clear sky, and leafy trees typical of an urban or suburban environment. The setting gives an impression of a typical bustling area during that time period, somewhat utilitarian in its layout and function.","title":"Gas station for lease","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548477","547025","555584","548889","555438","556709","550970","542900","546184","550053","554297","557155","545216","550093","549113","550135"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["availability","suburb","70","contact","bumper","billboard","destination","promote","building","chrome"]}
