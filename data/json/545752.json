{"path":"545752.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene characterized by its naturally vibrant and warm tones. In the foreground, we see rugged terrain dotted with numerous small, water-filled potholes that reflect the twilight. These rocky surfaces are uneven and textured, indicating weathering likely from erosion.\n\nIn the middle ground, the sun sets behind a distinctive rock formation, which silhouettes against the glowing sky. The sun, positioned just at the horizon, emits a soft yet brilliant light that illuminates the sky in hues of orange, red, and yellow, transitioning to a deeper blue as it stretches upward.\n\nThe background features vast, open desert landscapes that extend into the distance under a vast sky, suggesting a remote, tranquil environment. The composition is natural and untouched, emphasizing the beauty and calm of a desert at sunset. The play of light and reflection, along with the rugged terrain, creates a tranquil and almost otherworldly atmosphere.","title":"The day after a rain the potholes in the Needles area of the Canyonlands are full. Desert animals depend upon this uncertain water supply and many small animals live in the potholes. When the water dries up, they go into a form of hibernation.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545748","552897","549847","548909","557560","550646","542678","546753","543140","547479","545207","552891","545771","543146","542680","544359"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","sunset","sun","calm","terrain","twilight","erosion","transition","glow","emit"]}
