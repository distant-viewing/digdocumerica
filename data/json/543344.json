{"path":"543344.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of historical decay in what appears to be a rural setting. The main focus is on two structures: one a significantly deteriorated brick building and the other a small wooden shack.\n\nThe brick building is largely in ruins, with most of its structure collapsed. There are no complete walls, and what remains are fragmented sections of brick walls. Some of these walls are supported by makeshift wooden braces that look like they are there to prevent further collapse. The roof of this structure is completely gone, exposing the interior to the elements.\n\nAdjacent to the crumbling brick building is a small, stand-alone wooden shack. This shack is also in a state of disrepair; however, it is more intact than the brick structure. It has a sharply sloping roof, which is covered in dark, weathered shingles. Some of these shingles are missing or look to be in poor condition, suggesting leaks or other damage. On the door of the shack, there is a sign clearly marked \"DANGER,\" signaling potential hazards within or around the structure.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is characterized by wild, untamed grass and rolling hills in the background. There is no visible human activity or presence, giving the scene a deserted and isolated feel. The overall mood evoked is one of neglect and the relentless passage of time, underscored by the clear, sunny sky and the natural vegetation slowly encroaching on the man-made structures.","title":"\"Ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["554707","551330","543171","557344","543339","555612","556330","552494","545233","553555","543342","553548","554561","554565","551111","554785"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["shack","brick","shingle","wall","collapse","structure","ruin","hazard","danger","roof"]}
