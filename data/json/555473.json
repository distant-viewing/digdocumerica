{"path":"555473.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a gas station during what appears to be the early to mid-20th century. In the foreground, there is a large white sign with the words \"GAS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY BILLS $10+\" written in black, bold lettering. This indicates a period-specific scenario possibly related to gas rationing or a shortage.\n\nBeside the main sign, to the left, there is another smaller sign saying \"MECHANIC ON DUTY - TUNE UPS - BRAKES ENGINE & VALVE WORK.\"\n\nIn the background, there are several older vehicles visible, including a prominently positioned white and green Jeep-like vehicle at the gas pumps, and other cars from the era in the further background. A gas pump with the brand \"76\" is visible in front of the Jeep, suggesting the brand of the gas station. Behind the scene, there's a faint silhouette of leafless trees and a building that blends into the background.\n\nThe environment suggests a clear day given the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground, contributing to the mid-20th-century American backdrop of everyday life and the era-specific infrastructure and automobiles.","title":"Gas by appointment signs increased each day in Portland and other parts of Oregon until the state put into effect the odd-even gas plan.
