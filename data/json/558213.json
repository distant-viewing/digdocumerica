{"path":"558213.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a young man playing a trumpet as part of what looks like a musical ensemble. He is focused on the instrument, with the mouthpiece pressed against his lips and his fingers positioned on the trumpet's valves. His expression is one of concentration.\n\nThe young man has medium-length dark hair and a side part. He is wearing a shirt with an intricate, reddish-brown pattern and a brown vest over it. The colors suggest a relaxed yet somewhat formal setting, possibly during a practice session or a casual performance.\n\nOnly the upper part of his body and the trumpet are visible in the foreground, which is sharply focused. In the slightly blurred background, another musician can be partially seen, suggesting that they are part of a group or a band.\n\nThe lighting in the photo appears natural and soft, highlighting the contours of the young man's face and the shiny brass of the trumpet. The overall mood of the image is serene and artistic, conveying a moment of musical dedication.","title":"A student at band practice at cathedral high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
