{"path":"545997.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape interspersed with natural elements. In the foreground, a significant feature is a red and white warning sign mounted on a wooden post, reading \"DANGER VERY HIGH PRESSURE PIPELINE.\" Adjacent to the sign, multiple dark pipes lay across the muddy ground, partially submerged in water, stretching towards the photo's right side.\n\nThe background shows a large industrial plant with various structures, including tall white storage tanks, metal frameworks, and other processing facilities. There is no visible human activity in the immediate area surrounding the site.\n\nThe terrain is predominantly marshy with a mixture of water, mud, and patches of dry grass. The vegetation consists mainly of tall, dense reeds that appear dry and brown, suggesting the photo might have been taken in late summer or early autumn. The sky is mostly clear with few clouds, indicating fair weather conditions at the time the photo was taken. This setting suggests a contrast between industrial development and the natural environment, highlighting the intersection of human-made and natural landscapes.","title":"Pipelines from a natural gas installation (in background) run through rattlesnake bayou at the western end of the Freeport sulphur co.
