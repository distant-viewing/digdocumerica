{"path":"548552.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a large, multi-storied building under construction. The structure appears to have several floors, each with multiple openings presumably for windows or doors, which are yet to be fitted. The building is predominantly grey, made of concrete with visible structural elements such as beams and columns.\n\nOn the right side of the building, a section of the fa√ßade has been painted or treated in a reddish tint and is reinforced by a temporary framework of red scaffolding, suggesting ongoing work or a provision for external support. The other parts of the building remain unpainted and show construction materials and techniques typical of large residential or commercial buildings.\n\nIn front of the building, the ground is uneven and scattered with building materials and debris, which demonstrates an active construction site. No workers are visible in the image, suggesting it might have been taken during a non-working period or from a distance that does not capture human activity.\n\nThe background and atmosphere are hazy, which might indicate dust from the construction or a cloudy day. The image lacks vegetation or other buildings in close proximity, highlighting the building's isolated location during its construction phase.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives an impression of an industrial scene focused on new construction, reflecting urban development and architectural progress.","title":"Apartment under construction at Century Village retirement community.
