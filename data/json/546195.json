{"path":"546195.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene focused on a large, circular water-filled pit that is emitting steam or smoke. The pit appears quite deep, with water covering its bottom and steep, bare earthen walls surrounding it. You can see steam rising vigorously from several areas of the water surface, suggesting that the water might be heated or part of some industrial process.\n\nThe foreground features a metal guardrail, hinting that this area is meant to be observed or monitored but not accessed directly due to potential hazards. The rails have a weathered appearance, with visible rust and deterioration, indicating exposure to the elements over time.\n\nBeyond the pit, the background includes a partially visible green forested area and an open field with a couple of industrial or mechanical structuresâ€”perhaps related to the processing functions taking place. There are also various poles and wires, contributing to the industrial feel of the setting. There's an overcast sky, which diffuses the lighting and casts a myriad of reflections on the water's surface, mingling with the rising steam.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a blend of natural elements and industrial activity, suggesting an environment of significant human intervention, likely for resource extraction or processing. The juxtaposition of natural beauty and industrial machinery evokes a complex narrative about development and the environment.","title":"Kimball oil field drainage ditch","placename":"Palestine (Tex.)","location":"Palestine, Texas","nn1":["550995","550684","551556","551555","546073","550694","554630","551009","552427","557374","551576","550710","544036","547539","549965","543009"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pit","steam","mingl","hazard","myriad","guardrail","deterioration","mean","water","process"]}
