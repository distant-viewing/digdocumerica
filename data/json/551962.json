{"path":"551962.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene woodland scene. In the center of the image, a large tree stands prominently with a sign hanging from one of its lower branches. The sign is labeled \"LAKE MICH.,\" presumably indicating proximity to Lake Michigan. The tree is surrounded by dense foliage and other trees, depicting a lush green forest environment. \n\nMounted high on the tree is a white street-style lamp, adding a somewhat urban element to this natural setting. The ground below the tree is uneven and partly eroded, revealing a small slope with exposed roots and soil.\n\nThe area is devoid of any people or animals, focusing purely on this interesting mix of the natural and the man-made. This composition serves a utilitarian purpose while also blending into the aesthetic feel of a forest gateway or path. The lighting in the image suggests it might be taken during daylight with ample natural light filtering through the leaves, enhancing the vivid green colors of the forest.","title":"Home sites in the forest near Pentwater","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["542791","555116","542789","543581","558103","555637","554529","554998","554732","557776","545488","546947","550791","554961","547011","554526"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["forest","tree","root","erode","filtering","lamp","proximity","sign","animal","daylight"]}
