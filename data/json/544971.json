{"path":"544971.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photo features a foreground focus on a warning sign by the edge of a body of water. The sign is clearly marked with the logo \"SORBY\" and icons indicating certain prohibitions: No Swimming, No Water Skiing, and No Scuba Diving. Below the icons, the text explains that the water is a health hazard due to harmful bacteria and viruses, advising to wash with soap any part of the body or any item that has been in contact with the water. The sign credits the Alexandria Health Department.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, is a sailboat with a white sail marked with what looks like the number 1, suggesting itâ€™s part of a sailing competition or practice. The water is calm and the horizon shows a faint outline of a landmass with what appears to be a bridge or industrial structure spanning across it under a cloudy sky. This juxtaposition implies a contrast between the recreation symbolized by the sailboat and the environmental caution communicated by the sign.","title":"Citizens of Arlington, Virginia are warned to avoid all contact with the polluted potomac river.
