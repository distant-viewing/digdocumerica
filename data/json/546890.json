{"path":"546890.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of two hands held up towards the camera, palms facing forward. Each hand is noticeably dirty, covered with what appears to be oil, grime, and patches of black and grayish residues. The skin on the hands is visible through the dirt. These hands could belong to someone who has been engaged in manual, likely mechanical or outdoor, work.\n\nBehind the hands, the background is out of focus with a deep blue and rock-like texture, perhaps indicating that the person is outside or in a similarly rugged environment. The lighting of the photograph gives the hands a slightly blue tint, which contrasts with the darkness of the grime.\n\nThe photograph is dynamic in its storytelling aspect, potentially evoking themes of hard work, environmental interaction, or the aftermath of a specific activity that involves physical labor or machinery. It captures a moment of pause, possibly reflecting either a sense of accomplishment or a break in strenuous activity.","title":"Preston sleeger, a member of the Maryland water resources administration, shows his oil covered hands.
