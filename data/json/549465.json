{"path":"549465.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene of white-water rafting. The raft is fairly large, dominated by a silver-gray base and sides, with \"JIM'S OARS\" clearly printed on the side in bold red lettering. It is equipped with long red oars, which are visible on the right side of the craft.\n\nThere are six individuals on the raft. They are all wearing orange life vests and helmets, which suggest a focus on safety due to the rough conditions. The participants are variously engaged with handling the raft; some are rowing, while others appear to be steadying themselves against the turbulent water.\n\nThe background consists of a rocky river environment. Large, dark rocks can be seen emerging from the white foamy waters on the left and right side, contributing to the challenging conditions the rafters face. These elements converge to portray an adventurous rafting expedition navigating through vigorous and splashy rapids, highlighting both the thrill and the peril of the activity.","title":"A small (17 foot) raft running Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River in Hells Canyon.
