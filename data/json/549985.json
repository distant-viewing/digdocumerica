{"path":"549985.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a woman and a young child are sitting at the edge of a fountain. The focus is on the pair from behind, who appear to be enjoying a serene moment together, possibly on a warm day. Both are pictured from the back, giving a sense of both intimacy and anonymity. The woman is wearing a sleeveless, patterned red and white dress and has her hair styled in a large afro. The child, presumably a boy, is shirtless, revealing only the back view from the waist up.\n\nThe fountain, which is the central element in the background, is actively spraying water upwards, creating a dynamic and refreshing backdrop. Water cascades down the tiers of the fountain, adding to the tranquil and picturesque setting. The sunlit water droplets appear to glisten as they are caught in motion, suggesting it might be either midday or early afternoon.\n\nThe pavement surrounding the fountain is barely visible, and there are no distinctive buildings or landscape features distinguishable in the background, focusing the viewer's attention squarely on the woman, the child, and their interaction with the fountain.","title":"Cooling off beside fountain at Philadelphia Museum of Art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553219","550080","551467","553229","551446","550748","551473","551640","552702","552700","549982","549984","551468","553192","552737","551484"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fountain","child","anonymity","woman","afro","tier","intimacy","waist","droplet","pavement"]}
