{"path":"545783.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping view of a vast, rocky landscape under a subdued sky. The composition is dominated by panoramic vistas of towering cliffs and mesas that create a rugged and layered horizon. The textures and colors range from deep browns and greens to more muted dark grays, suggesting the photo was taken either early in the morning or during late afternoon, resulting in soft and diffused lighting.\n\nIn the foreground, the rocky terrain is dotted with small vegetation, hinting at a semi-arid environment. The rocks themselves are richly textured and seem fragmented, indicative of geological weathering. Midway through the scene, a river or lake, glowing ethereally, snakes through the valley, adding a hint of luminosity and contrasting the darker tones of the surrounding terrain.\n\nThe sky above is overcast with scattered clouds that are just dense enough to filter the natural sunlight, casting an overall serene and perhaps melancholic atmosphere over the landscape. The visual depth of the scene is immense, suggesting the photograph was taken from a high vantage point, giving an almost aerial perspective over the sprawling geological formations below. This elevated viewpoint allows for an extensive view that stretches miles into the distance, accentuating the remote and untouched nature of the landscape.","title":"Looking west from Anticline Overlook, across the Colorado River to the Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544155","544745","545787","545761","544393","544392","544429","545790","544453","545696","545799","552906","545775","543665","545800","545792"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["luminosity","mesa","vista","snake","weathering","viewpoint","terrain","vantage","cliff","gray"]}
