{"path":"546727.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image is an aerial view of a bustling urban street lined by a mix of stately and modern buildings. The street runs vertically in the photograph, filled with heavy traffic composed of cars and buses, indicating either rush hour or a generally highly trafficked area. Both sides of the street are flanked by large buildings with architectural styles ranging from classical with columns and statuesque facades to more modern designs featuring simpler, cleaner lines.\n\nIn the background and to the sides of the main thoroughfare, there are other large buildingsâ€”some governmental-looking with long, horizontal builds, while others are possibly commercial or residential. The area has a formal, organized layout which suggests the area might be a government or administrative center.\n\nAdditionally, there's a noticeable green space with trees visible, which provides a break in the urban environment. Also, glimpses of a calm body of water are visible near the horizon, suggesting the proximity of a river or bay.\n\nThe image encapsulates a vibrant and densely built cityscape, usual for a significant city with economic and possibly political importance. The time period appears to be retro, possibly around the mid-20th century given the car models and the color palette of the film.","title":"14th street, looking south","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546745","548318","551507","556195","548392","549477","551478","553301","546574","556681","553840","555743","548382","548364","551510","556020"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["street","build","traffic","thoroughfare","government","rush","importance","bay","film","bus"]}
