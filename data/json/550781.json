{"path":"550781.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense meadow of white and yellow-centered wildflowers, possibly daisies or similar species. The scene is thickly packed with these flowers which dominate the foreground and midground of the image. Each flower consists of white petals surrounding a bright yellow center, presenting an effusive and lush display.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus but indicates a mixture of taller green shrubs and a couple of distinct trees, suggesting that this wildflower field is possibly bordered by a wooded area or a forest. The sky, visible at the top corner of the image, is clear, suggesting it is a bright sunny day, which contributes to the vibrant lighting of the scene and the highlighted white petals of the flowers.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or man-made structures, emphasizing the natural and wild character of the landscape. The overall composition captures a moment of natural beauty, focusing on the texture and density of the wildflowers against the contrasting greenery and blue sky in the background.","title":"Wildflowers near Moen Lake","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552503","544574","543206","553076","544443","549230","557098","544439","544876","542704","542645","547642","544938","542641","543197","543596"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wildflower","petal","flower","daisy","meadow","specie","density","midground","mixture","couple"]}
