{"path":"553996.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural landscape. In the foreground, cactus plants are prominently displayed, with the largest displaying several flat, green pads typical of a prickly pear cactus. To the right, a gnarled tree with spreading branches stands, displaying sparse, small leaves that suggest a dry environment or season.\n\nThe middle ground is filled with dry grass and scattered shrubbery stretching across a gently sloping hill. This gives way to a more barren landscape that leads up to a shoreline, visible in the mid-distance.\n\nThe background features a large body of water, most likely a sea or ocean, under a pale blue sky scattered with light clouds. Across the water, a mountain range is visible under a haze, adding to the depth and expansiveness of the view. The overall scene suggests a location that could be coastal and is likely semi-arid, showing a mix of arid-adapted plants like cacti and a somewhat barren, hilly landscape against a backdrop of water and mountains.","title":"In may, 1973, in a controversial decision now in the courts, the land use commission agreed to reclassify 22,340 acres of the island of Lanai for urban use.  Land on the eastern side (shown here) is too dry for prime agriculture.  Much of the proposed expansion (houses tourist accommodations) would be in this area.
