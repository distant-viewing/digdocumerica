{"path":"545800.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and dramatic landscape, seemingly taken within a large canyon or gorge. The image is dominated by a vast expanse of rough, uneven terrain with a variety of rock formations. The foreground shows a curved cliff edge, leading the eye towards a deep canyon that bisects the landscape. This canyon is filled with a chaotic arrangement of boulders and rock debris, suggesting a history of geological activity, possibly erosion or landslides.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is mostly in shades of brown and red, typical of desert environments, indicative of iron-rich soil and rock. The sky is a clear, deep blue without any clouds, which contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the land.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is marked by layered sedimentary rock formations and flat-topped mesas, characteristic of plateau regions shaped by erosion. These formations stretch across the skyline, adding a sense of depth and vastness to the scene.\n\nThere are no visible people or animals in this photograph, enhancing the feeling of desolation and untouched natural beauty. The scene communicates a sense of isolation and the overwhelming scale of natural geological processes. This location appears to be a remote desert area, likely in a region with a dry climate given the sparse vegetation and arid landscape.","title":"Water Canyon is named for its spring which furnishes a good supply of pure water, a rarity in this dry area.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544950","545799","544745","545787","545802","545792","545796","544429","552690","544027","545790","545804","545760","545764","545805","544401"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","rock","formation","erosion","desert","gorge","landslide","plateau","mesa","bisect"]}
