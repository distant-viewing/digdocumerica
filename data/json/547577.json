{"path":"547577.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial waterfront scene, likely on an overcast day given the subdued lighting. In the foreground, there is a line of decayed wooden pilings extending diagonally from the bottom left toward the center of the image. These pilings are uneven, jagged, and show significant signs of wear and age, suggesting they have been exposed to water and weather for a prolonged period. Alongside the pilings is a shore or embankment with debris and some discarded materials scattered around.\n\nIn the middle ground, calm waters of a river or bay reflect some of the industrial structures and scattered debris. Some broken pilings and small fragments of wood can be seen sticking out of the water, adding to the dilapidated and abandoned feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a more complex industrial site. This includes a long pier or dock, supported by additional pilings, that juts into the water body. Atop the pier, there are various industrial buildings, equipment, and frameworks that suggest some kind of manufacturing or processing activity. Distinct features include tall smokestacks and cranes, indicating heavy industrial use. The overall atmosphere is somewhat desolate and neglected, emphasizing the decline or disuse of what might once have been a bustling industrial area. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber mood of the scene.","title":"Tanker terminal dock on the Providence river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547019","547582","549300","551984","547585","547575","552240","551985","547622","548105","547581","549305","551980","543320","551954","551978"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["piling","pier","embankment","decline","disuse","jut","debris","fragment","stick","kind"]}
