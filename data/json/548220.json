{"path":"548220.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene during what appears to be late afternoon, based on the soft lighting and long shadows. The setting is a beach characterized by expansive sandy areas and gentle dunes. A prominent feature in the foreground is a wooden fence, seemingly constructed to control foot traffic and protect the dune environment. This fence zigzags from the bottom left corner into the middle distance, where it meets another section coming from the right, creating a visual path leading the eye towards the beach.\n\nThe sand is largely untouched near the fence but shows signs of foot traffic closer to the water, indicating the presence of visitors. Apart from the rolling dunes, sparse vegetation can be seen, typical of coastal dune environments, adapted to survive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils.\n\nThe beach extends towards a calm body of water, which reflects a light blue sky scattered with soft, white clouds. A few people can be observed enjoying the beach; some are walking close to the water's edge, while others are more distant, possibly families or groups enjoying the open space. The overall mood is peaceful, with nature playing a significant role in the sceneâ€™s tranquility.\n\nThe composition utilizes the fence and the shoreline to draw the viewer's eye through the scene, enhanced by the natural lighting that enriches the colors of the sand, sky, and water. This photograph not only captures the beauty of the beach but also conveys a sense of calm and spaciousness, inviting the viewer to appreciate the natural landscape and the gentle interaction of humans with this serene coastal setting.","title":"Crane's Beach, a federally-protected dune preserve between Essex and Ipswich","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["547607","548221","547600","545280","547612","543303","554159","543287","548757","557509","546953","543493","557459","546970","542890","547596"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","fence","dune","foot","sand","spaciousness","traffic","eye","viewer","water"]}
