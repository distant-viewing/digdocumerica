{"path":"544469.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor labor, likely involving utility or cleanup work after a storm or flooding. Two people, both wearing hard hats and casual clothing, are engaged in activities amidst apparent storm aftermath. One person is seen standing in the bed of a truck, organizing or handling equipment. The other is on the ground, seemingly inspecting or moving a pile of corrugated metal sheets and other debris, which includes branches and possibly damaged personal items.\n\nThe setting is an urban or suburban roadside area. There is a significant puddle of muddy water on the asphalt next to a grassy strip, hinting at recent heavy rain. The water also shows oil slicks, reflecting hues like blue and purple due to the likely presence of vehicle fluids or similar pollutants.\n\nThe photo also includes a truck equipped with ladders and other long-handled tools, which adds to the notion that the work involves physical labor and dealing with the consequences of natural events like storms. Trees and a blue sky make up the background, providing a somewhat calm contrast to the disorder and effort depicted in the foreground. The overall ambiance reflects the resilience and cleanup often necessary in the face of natural disruptions.","title":"Road crews repair damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["550224","555561","554853","555866","545535","556903","544460","542857","545657","553631","555563","555562","555876","547498","551089","557735"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["storm","cleanup","labor","notion","disorder","consequence","truck","fluid","pollutant","ladder"]}
