{"path":"553667.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a rural roadside scene featuring a sign that reads \"ENTERING NIXON.\" The sign, mounted on a single metal post, is positioned on the left side of the image along a paved road. The setting suggests a semi-arid landscape, characterized by sparse vegetation and clear skies. \n\nOn the right side of the image, a large, dense, and bushy shrub dominates, providing a touch of dark green to the mostly brown and grey terrain. Behind the shrub, the terrain extends into a flat, open area with scrubs and little vegetation. The background shows a hilly landscape under a bright blue sky scattered with fluffy, white clouds. \n\nThe road appears lightly traveled, without any visible vehicles, and stretches into the distance towards a couple of small buildings that can be seen near the horizon, suggesting a sparse, lightly populated area. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a sense of entering a quiet, remote location.","title":"Nixon--a small paiute indian settlement near the south end of Pyramid Lake, on the Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["544262","555647","543104","544245","552005","545159","555582","556429","555628","553669","547049","545620","555435","544292","552516","557154"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sparse","scrub","fluffy","paved","enter","roadside","road","terrain","post","couple"]}
