{"path":"552672.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This is a dramatic and action-packed photograph taken at a nighttime rodeo event. The main focus of the image is a cowboy mounted on a horse, captured in mid-action as they make a tight turn in the rodeo arena. The horse is showing an impressive display of agility and strength, bending deeply on its forelegs and kicking up dust from the ground, engaging in what appears to be a barrel racing or cutting event.\n\nThe cowboy is dressed in traditional rodeo attire, including a long-sleeve shirt, jeans, and a cowboy hat, enhancing the cultural and sporting essence of the scene. His posture and focus suggest intense concentration and skill in handling the horse.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor arena, characterized by a dirt floor which is partially illuminated by several large overhead lights, creating a moody and somewhat blurred atmospheric effect due to the motion and lighting conditions. In the background, there are blurred glimpses of spectators seated on stands, and additional lights that illuminate the area, suggesting a public and well-attended event.\n\nOverall, this image captures the thrill and expertise typical of rodeo sports, showcasing the blend of human skill and animal power in a classic Western American setting. The motion blur and lighting give the photo a dynamic quality, emphasizing the action and energy of the moment.","title":"Garfield county fair.
