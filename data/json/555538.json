{"path":"555538.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"The photograph captures a serene winter scene on a farm, predominantly showcasing a snowy landscape dotted with structures and animals. In the foreground stands a pale horse wearing a halter, positioned off-center to the left, partially facing the camera. Behind this horse, partially obscured, another darker animal, likely a horse as well, can be observed. \n\nThe background features several classic farm buildings. On the very left, there's a dark silhouette of a two-storey structure with a steep roof, presumably a barn or stable. Central in the image, and set further back, is a large barn with an attached silo, a staple of traditional farm architecture. This barn has a few windows visible and a snow-covered roof, reflecting the wintry conditions. Adjacent and slightly behind this central barn is another building, again typical of farm compounds, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe setting includes a partially visible fence running across the middle ground, which adds a layer of organization to the composition, suggesting the separation of different areas within the farm. The landscape around is covered with snow, punctuated by clusters of bare trees, enhancing the wintery feel.\n\nOverhead, the sky is dynamic and expressive, featuring a mixture of clouds and clear areas through which sunlight weakly filters, casting a soft light across the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of quiet and chilly winter solitude, typical of rural farm life during the colder months. This scene is both serene and robust, typical of a working farm in winter.","title":"This farm near Randolph Center, Vermont, is one of about 50 in an area where there were several hundred not so long ago.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["552557","554161","556586","556957","557186","542805","552562","542622","551229","556958","543726","552675","557194","552676","543732","557193"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["farm","barn","horse","winter","animal","halter","wintery","snow","compound","month"]}
