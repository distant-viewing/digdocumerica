{"path":"544558.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a lush, residential area along a water channel, presumably a river or canal, bordered by a neatly maintained seawall. The area is characterized by dense vegetation and various types of palm trees. The terrain is predominantly green, punctuated with residential structures which display a mix of architectural designs. Some houses have thatched roofs suggesting a tropical or subtropical climate, perhaps aiming for a resort-like aesthetic. \n\nOne visible home close to the bottom left of the image is large, with multiple sections and a thatched roof, adjacent to a similarly styled pavilion. On the property, a variety of well-maintained, tropical landscaping can be seen, including shrubbery and neatly trimmed grass. To the right of this lot, another property features a structured garden, laid out in a formal pattern with a variety of plants and possibly small statues or ornaments.\n\nThe background shows a gently curving waterway extending into the distance, flanked on both sides by more homes, lush greenery, and a road or pathway running parallel to the water. The sky above is clear with few clouds, suggesting a calm, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a tranquil, affluent neighborhood designed with emphasis on landscape and leisure, suggesting that this is a prosperous area possibly designed for vacationing or luxury living.","title":"Waterfront development","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544562","545896","553928","546951","552232","553919","556955","547636","553931","550749","553930","548011","553929","547264","548781","556953"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["property","home","pavilion","luxury","ornament","maintain","design","vacation","variety","resort"]}
