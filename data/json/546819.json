{"path":"546819.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene. In the foreground, there's a person rowing a small, white dinghy. The individual, likely a male, is dressed in a dark red shirt and appears focused on their rowing activity. The oars are partially lifted, suggesting a moment either just after pulling through the water or just before dipping into it for another stroke.\n\nBeside the dinghy is a large, flat-sided vessel named the \"HARBOR QUEEN,\" indicated clearly by the text printed in bold letters along its hull. Below the name, \"Annapolis, MD.\" is mentioned, indicating the vessel's home port or location. The side of the Harbor Queen looks quite sizeable compared to the small dinghy, giving a sense of scale and emphasizing the intimacy of the smaller boat.\n\nThe background hints at a wider body of water, likely a river or bay, given the industrial elements and buildings that can be faintly seen at a distance. The overall atmosphere feels calm, with overcast skies and placid water surface, enhancing the quiet moment of solitary rowing captured in this frame. The focus and composition of the photo draw attention primarily to the contrast between the massive vessel and the small dinghy, illustrating a peaceful coexistence in a bustling harbor area.","title":"Oarsman in Annapolis harbor","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["542877","549416","549411","548235","547556","548247","549414","544669","550050","543035","542872","548249","549419","543942","548521","547558"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["rowing","vessel","oar","intimacy","harbor","port","coexistence","male","bay","hull"]}
