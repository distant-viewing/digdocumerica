{"path":"554287.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a snowy scene featuring a large snow grooming machine, known as a \"Tucker Sno-Cat.\" The machine is red with two distinct, wide tracks that help it navigate over the snowy and icy terrain. It appears to be in the process of grooming a snow-covered surface, possibly a ski slope or a trail. The machine's cabin is enclosed, suggesting it is designed for operation in harsh winter conditions.\n\nIn the background, you can see a snow-covered landscape dotted with trees and a mountainous backdrop, indicating this scene is likely in a ski resort or a mountainous area. There's also a ski lift with a sign that is partially visible, supporting this inference. The ground is uneven and covered with tracks from previous passes of the sno-cat or other vehicles, adding texture to the snow's surface.\n\nThe lighting in the image is bright, possibly indicating that the photo was taken on a clear day with plenty of sunlight casting shadows on the snow, enhancing the contours and texture of the landscape. The focus and composition of the photograph emphasize the snowcatâ€™s role in maintaining the usability and safety of winter recreational areas.","title":"Snowcats pack the snow on the ski trails","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["556891","543107","551947","558247","555534","558246","554249","554257","549779","554246","542624","543760","554837","554284","554214","558248"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["snow","ski","machine","winter","groom","track","resort","cover","pass","know"]}
