{"path":"551733.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This image captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring a large, grassy park with several groups of people engaged in different leisure activities under a clear blue sky decorated with fluffy clouds. In the foreground and middle distance, the park is filled with people, some of whom are sitting on the grass, while others are engaged in activities like walking and kite flying. A notable feature is a blue kite soaring high in the sky, its string leading down towards an individual in the middle of the field.\n\nIn the background, there are tall buildings that offer a contrast between the natural park setting and urban architecture, providing depth to the picture. These buildings appear to be older, possibly mid-20th century, and contribute to a nostalgic feel. Overall, the composition blends elements of nature, recreation, and urban backdrop, presenting a snapshot of relaxing urban life.","title":"Part of Brooklyn's 526-acre Prospect Park.
