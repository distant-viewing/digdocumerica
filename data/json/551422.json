{"path":"551422.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant and emotionally intense scene involving three people outdoors. Central to the image is an older man, who is hunched over and appears to be giving CPR to a woman lying on the ground. The man's expression is one of concentration and urgency. The woman, wearing a light patterned blouse and dark pants, is lying on a mattress or large cushion, and appears to be unconscious. There is a young boy also involved in the scene, positioned next to the older man and leaning over the woman in what seems like an attempt to help or understand the situation.\n\nThe setting of the photograph is outdoor and rustic. It features ground that is grassy but mostly covered in dirt, suggesting either a rural or wilderness area. In the background, underexposed and slightly out of focus, is what appears to be the undercarriage of a vehicle, further suggesting that this event is taking place in a camping or similarly remote area.\n\nThe photograph conveys a sense of urgency and desperation, with the actions of CPR indicating a life-saving effort. The presence of raw emotions and the seriousness of the scene are palpable. The color tones, dominated by the earthy and neutral hues, emphasize the raw and gritty realism of the scenario.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
