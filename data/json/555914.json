{"path":"555914.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph portrays a young man using crutches on a grassy area. He has an Afro hairstyle and is shirtless, wearing only a pair of light-colored jeans that are covered in signatures and writings. The backdrop includes a suburban street setting with cars parked in the distance and a paved road crossing a grassy lawn. The environment suggests a quiet, residential area, and the time could be a late afternoon or evening based on the soft, dim light. The young man appears somber and contemplative as he navigates using his crutches.","title":"Young man with his leg in a cast in Hiland Park of Brooklyn, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor. This project is a portrait of the inner city environment. It contains architecture and the residents enjoying themselves.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554260","556555","554258","553504","553487","553494","551940","551407","548578","553537","543037","552971","545315","553506","553223","545331"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["writing","hairstyle","pair","lawn","jean","evening","man","afternoon","light","street"]}
