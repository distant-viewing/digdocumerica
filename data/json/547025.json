{"path":"547025.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a vintage street scene focusing on a distinctive building with a row of businesses under an arched white roof that resembles a series of connected arcs. The building contains multiple shops, evident from various signs, including one that prominently displays \"TV Rental,\" suggesting the photo dates back to an era when it was common to rent televisions.\n\nIn front of the building, we see a parking area filled with a lineup of cars, mainly from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s judging by their styles. These cars vary in color and model, reflecting typical automobile design of that period with larger bodies and long front hoods.\n\nThere are three individuals visible in the scene; two are beside a white van, seemingly engaged in a casual activity or conversation, while a third person is walking toward the other end of the parking lot.\n\nThe landscaping includes well-maintained grass and flower beds, and the backdrop features lush green trees. This setting suggests a well-tended suburban or semi-urban area. The overall ambience reflects a quiet, everyday life moment typical of a mid-20th-century town.","title":"Activity on St. Simon's Island","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["557655","554551","542900","542586","546428","557155","557805","556709","556766","554617","546427","545333","557705","557840","551021","548889"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["parking","tv","lineup","television","judging","arc","tend","landscaping","ambience","van"]}
