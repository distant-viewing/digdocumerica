{"path":"548254.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an elevated subway station platform, likely in an urban setting given the surrounding dense architecture and slightly smoggy background. The station is marked clearly with a \"125 Street\" sign, indicating its location. The image captures several individuals on the platform, where two can be distinctly seen standing apart; one appears to be leaning on the railing and looking outward, possibly waiting for the train. These people are seen in ordinary attire, typical of city dwellers or travelers.\n\nThe platform itself shows signs of wear and urban art, such as graffiti on the sides. Below and in front of the platform, multiple railway tracks are visible, which contribute to a gritty, industrial feel to the scene. The architecture in the background includes various buildings with visible windows and other structural details, none particularly dominant or notably taller than the others, except for one taller structure faintly seen through the mist, indicating a mixed-use urban area.\n\nThe overcast sky and the overall muted color palette of the scene suggest either early morning or late afternoon, giving the photo a somewhat dreary, melancholic atmosphere. This is further enhanced by the visible bits of graffiti and aging infrastructure, which suggest a neighborhood with rich character and history.","title":"125th street elevated train platform","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548270","556821","548265","556651","556650","548263","556663","551894","556660","556823","556662","556818","551883","548274","556812","556649"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","graffito","dweller","station","traveler","subway","architecture","art","a","history"]}
