{"path":"557522.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a tranquil and somewhat somber seascape under an overcast sky. The sun, appearing as a muted globe, is situated in the upper third of the image, slightly off-center, casting a soft, diffuse light that gently illuminates the scene. Below the sun, a vast body of water fills the lower two-thirds of the frame, its surface rendered in a dark, bluish hue suggesting either dawn or dusk. On the right side of the horizon, a large column of dark smoke rises up, blending into the gray sky and introducing a stark contrast in an otherwise calm environment. The smoke suggests some distant activity, possibly industrial or related to a fire, impacting the scene's natural serenity. The overall mood is one of quietude, tinged with an element of disturbance from the smoke on the horizon.","title":"Morning fog clearing on oxnard plain, a prime agricultural area now being developed for housing near oxnard, California north of Los Angeles.
