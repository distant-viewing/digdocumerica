{"path":"551589.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up moment of a bearded man, wearing glasses and a casual, light-colored shirt with a pinkish pattern, intently observing the contents of a fish tank. The man's gaze is fixed on what appears inside the tank, suggesting a deep focus or study.\n\nThe fish tank, positioned on the right side of the frame, is rectangular and shows signs of wear and age, indicated by slight corrosion on its rim and murky water. Inside the tank, at least two small fish and some aquatic plants can be spotted. On top of the tank, there is a black hose or tube that bends into the water, possibly part of a filtration system.\n\nThe background is dimly lit and not fully discernible, adding to the intimate and concentrated atmosphere of the setting. This setting suggests a personal or research-oriented environment, possibly at a home or a small laboratory, emphasizing a sense of solitude and dedication to the task at hand.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory: Aquatic biologist Wesley Smith removes a substrate from the bank of aquarium tanks to study the effect of industrial waste on fish egg count.
