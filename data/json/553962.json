{"path":"553962.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a stunning view of a deep canyon, marked by rugged terrain and striated walls in various shades of brown, red, and green. The canyon is expansive, stretching into the distance under a partly cloudy sky. To the right, visitors stand at a viewpoint, fenced off by a simple metal railing on a dirt ground. The people, evidently tourists, are engaged in viewing and photographing the landscape. One person appears to be a child, while the others are adults. They are casually dressed suitable for a day of outdoor activity, with one individual wearing a white hat suggesting sunny conditions.\n\nThe overall composition of the image lends a sense of depth and scale, contrasting the vastness of the natural landscape against the small figures of the visitors. The foreground features rough, dry terrain that gives way to the deeply eroded canyon. The clouds overhead provide a dynamic sky that partially shades the canyon, adding to the visual texture and depth of the scene.","title":"Tourists view waimea canyon","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["553964","545689","545693","544917","544950","545765","544899","545750","545798","545796","553965","545697","544903","544745","544931","545760"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","visitor","stun","eroded","viewing","conditions","tourist","depth","viewpoint","shade"]}
