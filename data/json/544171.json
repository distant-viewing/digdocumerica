{"path":"544171.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a man working in an industrial setting. The subject is wearing a hard hat that is covered with dust and dirt, which suggests that the environment is rugged and possibly related to construction or mining. The hard hat also has subtle stains or paint splatters, hinting at frequent use.\n\nThe man is profiled from the side and is wearing safety glasses, indicating the need for eye protection in his line of work. His clothing is a dark-colored, collared, button-down work shirt that is notably grimy and well-worn, suggesting physical labor. His ear is partially visible and he seems to be focused intently on the task at hand.\n\nThe background and surroundings are filled with various industrial elements, primarily large, curved metal pipes that dominate the composition. These pipes, coated with peeling paint and rust, crisscross around the worker, adding a complex network of lines and shapes to the scene. The colors in the image are rich but earthy, with tones of red, brown, and orange, enhancing the industrial feel of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting is natural, likely daylight, contributing to the sharpness and vibrancy of colors in the photograph. The overall atmosphere is one of hard work and industry, captured through the detailed depiction of the worker and his environment.","title":"Navajo construction worker at the Navajo generating plant when completed, the plant will be the largest of its kind in Arizona","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["556391","554953","547163","542783","558312","546032","553618","544835","553610","542497","553609","553603","556447","555816","544316","556866"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["work","pipe","worker","sharpness","ear","hat","dark","protection","need","stain"]}
