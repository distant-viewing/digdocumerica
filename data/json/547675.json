{"path":"547675.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image shows a close-up, orb-shaped photograph of what appears to be a planet or spherical object with a highly detailed and textured surface. The sphere nearly fills the entire frame and the colors are predominantly shades of green with some areas of bright red patterns, which could be interpreted as continents or regions on this planet-like object. The surface texture is rich and variegated, suggesting an intricate topographic landscape or possibly a highly stylized artistic representation.\n\nThe object's sheen and the bits of wear on its surface suggest it could be a physical model, rather than a digital rendering, covered in varied materials to give it a complex, almost tactile appearance. The green regions have a swirled pattern reminiscent of natural geological formations or perhaps marbled paint, while the red areas are more structured with geometric blocks that might be symbolic or representative of human-made structures or demarcations.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, focusing all attention on the spherical object itself, enhancing its mysterious or planetary appearance, making it seem as though it is floating in space. Overall, the composition is centered and fills the frame, giving a full, detailed view of the object, suggesting importance or significance to its features.","title":"Wide angle aerial photograph on the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548923","548814","546119","555841","550606","546152","548914","552239","557626","544682","553582","555793","553803","543521","543149","550474"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["object","representative","sphere","orb","demarcation","region","surface","sheen","appearance","representation"]}
