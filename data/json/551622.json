{"path":"551622.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"In the photograph, a vibrant sunflower is prominently held and displayed at the center of the frame by a person’s hand. The sunflower is large with broad, healthy yellow petals and a pronounced brown center filled with seeds. The leaves of the sunflower are lush and green, and its stem is thick and sturdy, hinting at the healthy growth of the plant.\n\nThe hand holding the sunflower is only partly visible, showing fingers grasping the stem, and this gesture helps draw attention to the flower itself. The background is softly out of focus, featuring urban elements such as tall, nondescript buildings which appear older due to their facade details and colors. These buildings suggest an urban garden setting or a park within a city. The blurred background enhances the sharpness and vivid colors of the sunflower, making it stand out as the focal point. The overall mood of the photo is peaceful and a bit contemplative, emphasizing nature’s beauty amidst an urban environment.","title":"City \"farmer\" displays huge sunflower grown on vacant block (92nd to 93rd Street, 2nd to 3rd Avenue).
