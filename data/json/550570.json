{"path":"550570.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a vast forest landscape intersected by a winding river. The river meanders significantly, creating several loops and bends, typical of a meandering river system found in flat terrains. The surrounding area is densely covered with lush green trees, indicating a forested region, likely in the warm months given the foliage's vibrancy.\n\nIn the distance, the terrain appears to include open patches that may be wetlands or grasslands, as they are lighter in color and appear fragmented compared to the dense tree coverage. Small bodies of water can be seen scattered throughout the landscape, which may be oxbow lakes formed from previous river courses or small ponds.\n\nThe overall composition clearly shows the river as the focal point, snaking through the terrain, surrounded by greenery, highlighting a natural and possibly untouched environment. The photo is framed in such a way that the river and its curves bring a natural rhythm and flow to the visual structure of the shot. There are no visible human-made structures or modifications; it's a showcase of natural geography and hydrology from an aerial perspective.","title":"Looking west along the chatanika river, whose winding course is typical of the majority of small interior rivers.
