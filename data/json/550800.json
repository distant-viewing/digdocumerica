{"path":"550800.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The image depicts a significantly polluted environment. It shows a body of water, likely a river or small lake, heavily littered with a variety of debris and waste. The visible trash includes numerous items such as plastic bottles, metal cans, ceramic shards, and domestic items like an upside-down umbrella and what appears to be parts of household appliances or furniture. There are also larger items submerged partially or floating in the water.\n\nThe landscape around the water is just as cluttered, with debris scattered all over the muddy and wet ground leading to the water's edge. Thereâ€™s no visible life in the form of humans or animals, which could suggest the toxicity or uninhabitability of the area due to pollution.\n\nThe background features a line of trees, possibly birches, and some vegetation which looks quite dense and undisturbed compared to the foreground. The sky is overcast, casting a gloomy light over the scene which reinforces the degradation and abandonment sensed in this environment. A fence partly visible in the background on the right side suggests boundaries or the periphery of a managed property. The overall composition powerfully illustrates severe environmental neglect and the consequences of improper waste disposal.","title":"Town of Enterprize dump, in Oneida County--on banks of Wisconsin River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550352","547907","551440","552811","547524","550812","555228","544810","548308","550259","552089","552100","547525","552127","556419","547897"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["item","waste","birch","appliance","consequence","periphery","household","umbrella","disposal","debris"]}
