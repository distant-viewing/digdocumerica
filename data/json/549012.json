{"path":"549012.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural setting, primarily centered around a body of water, possibly a flooded area or shallow lake, that has submerged parts of the grass and trees. In the foreground, a man dressed in casual outdoor attire (long pants, a t-shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat) wades through the water that comes up just past his ankles. He carries a transparent, yellow pan or basket, suggesting he might be engaging in activities such as fishing, searching for specimens, or merely exploring the aquatic environment.\n\nThe setting includes several tall, leafy trees partially submerged in the water, creating a picturesque reflection on the water's surface. The backdrop is composed of a clear sky and distant mountains, suggesting a remote or rural location. The overall ambiance is calm and tranquil, evoking a sense of solitude or escape into nature.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the person slightly off-center and the landscape stretching out behind him, draws the viewer's eye toward the expanse of nature and the interaction between man and the environment. This scene could be indicative of recreational activities, environmental survey, or a moment of leisure in a natural setting.","title":"EPA technician samples water at Ash Springs","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546293","550268","545940","553082","546298","548956","550235","543829","550666","550313","550217","542509","545031","545008","549030","551024"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["pan","ankle","specimen","basket","t","water","fishing","solitude","nature","expanse"]}
