{"path":"549442.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and rugged outdoor scene. In the foreground, we see turbulent, white-water rapids flowing over rocks, creating a foamy texture on the water's surface. The river is framed by steep rocky banks on either side, adding a sense of enclosed wilderness.\n\nBeyond the immediate riverbanks, the landscape opens up into a dramatic valley. The sides of the valley are steep, covered with dark green coniferous trees which contrast against the lighter green and brown hues of the grassy and rocky slopes. The hills rise steeply, forming sharp peaks and ridges, suggesting a mountainous terrain. The terrain and vegetation hint at this being a location likely at a higher altitude, possibly a canyon or a section of a mountain river system.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the focus on the white-water rapids in the lower section and the expansive mountainous backdrop, conveys both the wildness and the beauty of this natural setting. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched and remote character of the landscape. The lighting appears bright, suggesting that the photo was taken on a sunny day, further enhancing the vivid colors of the natural environment.","title":"Wild Sheep Rapid, Snake River, Hells Canyon.
