{"path":"553454.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape featuring a combination of natural and disturbed land areas. It captures several bodies of water that appear to be interconnected through narrow channels or streams. These water bodies are surrounded by greenery, likely trees and grass, indicative of a rural setting.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large area cluttered with what seems to be discarded materials or debris, suggesting a dumpsite or landfill operation. This area is bare of vegetation and has patches of dirt and mud, which contrasts with the surrounding green areas. Dirt roads or paths are visible, connecting this area to other parts of the landscape.\n\nJust beyond the central landfill area, there are some residential or agricultural structures. These buildings include houses, barns, and possibly small sheds, which are typical of a rural community setup. The properties are interspersed among the fields and trees, adding a human element to the otherwise natural scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph intricately balances the interaction between human activity and nature, showcasing a serene yet disturbed landscape. The aerial perspective provides a broad view, highlighting both the environmental beauty and the impacts of human habitation and land use.","title":"Groton town dump on the banks of the Oxbow section of the Nashua River","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["555752","547098","551176","555812","543767","556937","544174","544446","548894","544438","550573","553450","555684","550353","550553","553695"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["landfill","dumpsite","dirt","land","mud","shed","channel","barn","habitation","area"]}
