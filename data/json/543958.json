{"path":"543958.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverside scene. In the foreground, two people—one seated and the other standing—are observing the view. The seated person is wearing a white shirt, while the person standing beside them is clad in a white top and jeans. They appear to be in a contemplative or relaxed pose, enjoying the moment together.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features a large body of water, likely a river, on which two paddle steamboats are visible. These boats, characterized by their multiple decks and large paddle wheels, are traversing the river, seemingly in opposite directions. One of the boats emits a notable plume of dark smoke, suggesting it is powered by a traditional steam engine.\n\nThe background includes a faint view of a riverbank with industrial structures, including a large building and possibly some machinery or docks, indicating the river might be adjacent to an industrial area. The sky has a muted tone, perhaps due to weather conditions or the time of day, contributing to the overall tranquil yet somewhat somber atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboats seen from banks of Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550825","545917","554657","551148","545658","543962","550208","543935","551281","549417","550769","543964","551147","551282","551038","546019"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["paddle","river","traverse","boat","standing","engine","riverside","person","wheel","plume"]}
