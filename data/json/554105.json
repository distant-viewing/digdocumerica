{"path":"554105.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor botanical setting, possibly within a greenhouse, where a large number of striking red flowers with large shiny leaves, likely anthuriums, are meticulously planted in rows. The entire area is covered by a translucent overhead cover supported by a structural frame, suggesting this is a controlled environment designed for optimal plant growth.\n\nIn the background, a person, seemingly a worker, is attending to the flowers. The person is bent over, focused on caring for the plants. Only the top half of their body is visible, underlining their engagement in their task.\n\nThe view is lush with the vivid red of the anthurium flowers dominating the scene, contrasted against the rich greens of their foliage and the dark earthy tones of the soil. The greenhouse's controlled environment, indicated by the overhead plastic cover, emphasizes the nurturing aspect for these exotic plants. The arrangement suggests a commercial or professional setup dedicated to the propagation or sale of these specific flowers. The ambient lighting permeates softly through the canopy, adding a natural quality to this cultivated space.","title":"At Hawaiian Greenhouse, Inc, near Pahoa, anthuriums grow under a sun screen.
