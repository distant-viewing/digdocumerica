{"path":"557409.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a nostalgic, serene summer scene that seems to be from a small town or rural area. At the center of the image, three young children are playing in a puddle on a dirt or gravel road. Two of the children appear to be talking or interacting closely while the third is bent over, possibly splashing or touching the water.\n\nBehind the children, there's a modest single-story house painted in a dark color, possibly dark brown, with white trim around the windows and door. The front porch of the house is small and adorned with a couple of potted plants, adding a touch of homeliness. A white bicycle is leaning against the house, suggesting another layer of outdoor activity in this peaceful setting.\n\nIn the background, the photo shows lush greenery with densely wooded hills rising steeply on both sides, framing the scene. The brilliance of the green trees against a blue sky with sparse clouds enhances the freshness and tranquility of the rural landscape.\n\nThe overall composition, with the playfulness of the children in the foreground contrasted with the calm and dense natural elements and the simple abode in the background, evokes a sense of simplicity and the joyful, carefree days of childhood.","title":"Youngsters play in a water puddle in a residential street in boomer near the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.  The houses were built when the plant opened in the mid-1930's and rented to employees who later brought them at bargain prices.  Many people still work for the company, and others are retired.  Total plant emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975, from 113,252 to 2,649 tons annually.  (see fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
