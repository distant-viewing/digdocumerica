{"path":"542525.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor wetland or marshy area, capturing a scenic yet slightly desolate panorama. The primary focus of the image is a vast expanse of water interspersed with large, rounded clumps of dense, dry brush or tussocks, which appear golden-brown in color. These splotches of vegetation are scattered throughout the wetland, partially submerged in the dark reflective water, which mirrors the bright blue of the sky and the textures of the brush.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is flat and stretches out into the distance where it meets a clear sky. On the horizon, there are very faint silhouettes or structures that are too small to detail but suggest the presence of minimal human activity or buildings far in the distance. There are no visible animals or people within the frame. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of quiet and natural stillness, typical of a marshland ecosystem during a dry season. The color palette is dominated by the contrast between the golden dry vegetation and the dark blue of the water, accentuated by a hazy skyline.","title":"Oil sump","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547500","547532","544515","544773","544530","550788","553856","547547","547589","554717","547544","547604","547488","553085","547924","545033"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["brush","wetland","panorama","marshland","clump","blue","stillness","distance","mirror","ecosystem"]}
