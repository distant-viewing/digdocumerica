{"path":"543363.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape abundant with natural and architectural beauty. The foreground features a vibrant display of orange-yellow flowers, possibly wild marigolds or poppies, scattered across a grassy slope. The terrain gently descends towards a rustic, single-track railway line that weaves its way along the coastline, hinting at a picturesque travel route.\n\nBeyond the railway, the coastline is rugged and jagged, with rocky outcrops and cliffs defining the edge of the land before it meets the deep blue sea. Waves can be seen crashing against the rocks, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil scenery.\n\nThe middle ground of the image showcases residential architecture that appears affluent and historic. Several large houses, possibly Victorian in style, with ornate designs and multiple stories, sit overlooking the sea, offering what must be stunning views of the oceanic panorama. These homes add a human element to the natural landscape, merging luxury with wilderness.\n\nThe background extends the view of the ocean, merging into a clear sky with minimal cloud cover. Visible towards the right side of the photograph is a small lighthouse, reinforcing the coastal theme and providing a sense of safety and navigation for boats at sea.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully represents a harmonious coexistence of natural splendor and human habitation, inviting viewers to appreciate both the wildness of the seascape and the crafted elegance of seaside living. It evokes a sense of peace and awe, characteristic of picturesque coastal towns.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543346","543401","543066","543399","542968","545110","554081","545226","543362","542917","543184","543431","557429","554102","554082","543337"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sea","railway","coastline","panorama","luxury","wildness","lighthouse","elegance","awe","seascape"]}
