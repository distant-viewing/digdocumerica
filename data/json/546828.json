{"path":"546828.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a busy industrial port area. It prominently features two large ships docked at a port surrounded by deep blue water.\n\nThe ship closest to the viewer is a large cargo ship painted in red and white, fitted with multiple lifeboats, a central superstructure, and several large cranes on deck, likely for loading and unloading cargo. The other ship, moored alongside the first, is gray and similarly equipped with cranes, suggesting it is also a cargo vessel.\n\nBehind these ships, there are massive red cranes lining the dock, designed for moving containers and other heavy loads. The cranes are tall and robust, projecting over the ships they service.\n\nThe background of the image shows a vast, flat land area adjacent to the water, which appears to be part of the port complex. There are various buildings and possibly piles of industrial materials, emphasizing the industrial function of the area.\n\nThe atmosphere of the scene suggests a functional and operational maritime port, critical for trade and goods transportation, with an emphasis on heavy industry and logistics.","title":"Looking toward downtown Baltimore from dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552008","552200","555760","547998","555260","555270","548127","550021","545845","552244","546881","555271","551577","555766","551609","546934"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","port","crane","cargo","dock","first","superstructure","trade","moor","unload"]}
