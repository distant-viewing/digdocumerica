{"path":"547966.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph presents an interesting juxtaposition of environmental degradation and industrial development. In the foreground, there is a polluted and littered landscape filled with debris. Various discarded items like tires, pieces of concrete, rocks, and unidentifiable rubble are scattered across dirt ground covered partially with patches of grass.\n\nMiddle ground shows a fence that seems to mark the boundary of an airport area. Beyond the fence, the scene starkly contrasts with the immediate wasteland. Large buildings with white facades and blue \"PAN AM\" logos delineate an expansive hangar or terminal area focused on aviation. Three airplanes can be seen, each painted with the distinctive PAN AM branding on their fuselage and tail, parked on or near the tarmac.\n\nIn the background, there is a clear sky devoid of clouds. This environmental and industrial scene raises themes of pollution, waste management, and the impact of industrial facilities adjacent to natural or neglected land areas. The overall composition of the photo underscores a narrative about the co-existence of technological progress and environmental concerns.","title":"Road to Jamaica bay from john f.
