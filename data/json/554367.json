{"path":"554367.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a quirky and creative scene set in a parking lot under a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds. The main focus of the image is a small toy horse placed on the hood of a silver car. The toy offers an interesting and playful contrast against the sleek, smooth surface of the car.\n\nThe cars surrounding the one with the toy horse include a red station wagon to the right and a glimpse of another red vehicle on the left, suggesting a variety of cars typically found in a public parking area. The presence of a tall street lamp in the background along with visible signs and further infrastructure suggest an urban or suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of everyday life—the cars and parking lot—with a touch of whimsy provided by the toy horse. The photograph captures a mundane setting transformed by a small, imaginative detail, creating a striking visual narrative.","title":"Horse on a hood--outside Shea Stadium in Flushing Meadow Park, Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550005","550095","542640","548435","550094","556553","545321","544395","542817","550098","556790","552800","545328","542636","557016","547002"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["toy","horse","parking","car","lot","transform","hood","wagon","one","lamp"]}
