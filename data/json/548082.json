{"path":"548082.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features an industrial waterfront setting. Dominating the image is an old, weathered wooden structure which appears to be a riverside diner or restaurant, named \"Dinah's Columbia.\" A sign with the name stands prominently on the buildingâ€™s rooftop, equipped with what looks like three stylized representations of cigarette butts, suggesting either a brand name or decorative element associated with the venue.\n\nThe building is supported by a framework of thin, worn metallic piles driven into the riverbed, visible both under the structure and alongside it. There are several empty moorings beside the structure, hinting that this might be a popular spot for boaters to dock and dine.\n\nIn the foreground, the rocky shoreline comprises various sizes of uneven grey stones, leading from the bottom right of the image toward the river. The background features a calm, expansive river under a partly cloudy sky. The opposite shore is barely visible, suggesting a wide river.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph captures a tranquil yet somewhat desolate industrial riverside scene, indicating that the location might be primarily accessed by water.","title":"Restaurant overlooking the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552809","545005","550949","547577","547594","553462","548105","547575","547582","550204","553393","552216","547019","547622","551984","549300"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["name","river","mooring","diner","stylize","restaurant","cigarette","venue","representation","rooftop"]}
