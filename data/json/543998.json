{"path":"543998.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene at a rocky, arid lakeside environment. The foreground is blurred with hues of green, consisting of small shrubs that serve as a natural barrier blurring part of the view. The middle ground shows a group of people, mostly young individuals, who are engaged in various activities around the blue water of the lake. Some are bending over and appear to be either picking up stones or examining small objects in the rocks, while others are seated and seem relaxed, possibly chatting or watching over the others.\n\nOn the left side of the image, three people are closer to the water, donning swimwear and are in active or stooped postures, indicating motion, likely throwing stones or similar playful activities. The background is dominated by a steep, rough hill that seems devoid of vegetation and stretches across the entire scene. The top of the hill meets a clear and bright sky.\n\nOn the right, the chain continues with a more flattened area where another individual, slightly distanced from the main group, is walking along a path on the barren hill, adding a sense of exploration or distancing from the group activity.\n\nOverall, this image portrays a scene of leisure and interaction with nature, characterized by the rugged, natural terrain contrasting sharply with the water and sky, suggesting a hot, sunny day ideal for outdoor activities by a lake.","title":"Labor Day swim at Lake Pleasant","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["558233","551543","553431","553447","544442","554476","543518","548963","544006","545267","550236","550228","543892","544002","550227","553370"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["group","stone","swimwear","lake","other","ideal","hill","chain","barrier","exploration"]}
