{"path":"547384.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a roadside scene filled with political campaign signs planted on a grassy strip next to a busy street. Several signs are visible with text promoting various candidates for political positions such as \"Steve Rose for,\" \"John Miller,\" \"Re-elect Betty Abbott,\" and \"Re-elect Al Veys City Councilman.\" Each sign has different styles and colors, varying from bold yellow with black text to plain white with red text.\n\nIn the background, traffic moves along the street, with vehicles including sedans and what appears to be a camper van, all presumably from the 1970s or 1980s based on their designs. The road is flanked on one side by a sign directing a left turn and on the other side by greenery and a distant building, giving an urban yet leafy environment.\n\nThe photo also has a traffic light visible at the far end and various urban infrastructural elements like street signs and a bus stop sign, suggesting this photo was taken in a well-traveled part of the city. The time is possibly late afternoon, given the casting of shadows and the quality of the sunlight.","title":"Political signs on Dodge Street, one of the city's main thoroughfares","placename":"Omaha (Neb.)","location":"Omaha, Nebraska","nn1":["547279","547369","547042","545498","544793","553017","555584","547021","550093","557705","555438","551135","542684","550139","556753","550142"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","text","street","campaign","traffic","move","camper","turn","stop","1980"]}
