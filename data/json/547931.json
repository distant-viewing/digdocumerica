{"path":"547931.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a suburban development scene, apparently capturing the stage of ongoing construction or recent completion. In the foreground, a pile of debris, possibly including branches and wooden planks, is strewn across dirt ground. A prominent street sign standing at the intersection reads \"FAIRBANKS AV\" and \"BROOK AV,\" indicating the location within the neighborhood.\n\nThe middle ground shows a row of newly built townhouses or duplexes. These homes are uniformly designed with a simple architectural style, featuring white siding and side gable roofs. Each unit appears to have two levels and several windows visible on the side of the buildings.\n\nAt the right of the image, construction or related work is visible. A yellow bulldozer is present on the road, suggesting active development or landscaping efforts. This construction vehicle, along with other vehicles parked along the side of the road, indicates the presence of workers or residents.\n\nStreetlights are installed and run along the curve of the road, illuminating the newly developed street. The road itself is paved, surrounded by patches of earth and grass, giving a raw, newly developed appearance to the area.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed with a clear, bright blue sky dominating the upper section of the image. The setting, based on these observations, suggests a developing suburban area, possibly in the midst of transition from construction to inhabitance.","title":"Housing development in Great Kills area on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557456","557455","544814","552031","547863","553061","553934","557550","544604","547664","544600","544568","543539","547652","553700","544812"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["develop","construction","road","completion","streetlight","townhouse","development","instal","gable","resident"]}
