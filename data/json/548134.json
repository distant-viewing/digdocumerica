{"path":"548134.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a river winding through a rugged landscape. In the foreground, several clusters of tall flowers with light yellow blooms, possibly yarrow, are visible. These plants are growing from a rocky hillside that looks dry and sparsely vegetated with some shrubs and patches of grass.\n\nThe river visible in the scene cuts deeply into the landscape, carving out a valley that meanders through the terrain. On one side of the river, a series of roads closely follow the river's course, providing a clear view of a transportation route that includes both a highway and perhaps some smaller side roads. Adjacent to these roads, lines of trees and possibly some cultivated areas suggest the presence of rural or recreational developments.\n\nThe hills surrounding the river are steep and appear mostly barren or covered with low vegetation, giving them a stark, arid look. The coloration of the landscape varies from dark brown to lighter tan, punctuated by the greenery of trees and the darker blue of the water.\n\nThe sky overhead is a bright, clear blue, indicating a sunny day without any visible clouds, which enhances the vividness of the natural colors in the landscape. The composition and vantage point suggest that the photograph was taken from a higher elevation, looking down into the river valley and across to the opposite slopes, offering a broad view of this picturesque environment.","title":"Columbia river gorge looking east from the summit of the rowena hills between mosier and The Dalles","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["552548","549455","550542","549456","543716","543793","545719","550586","545633","548010","545632","550526","550562","550508","550529","550524"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","valley","roads","opposite","cultivated","overhead","course","tan","carve","coloration"]}
