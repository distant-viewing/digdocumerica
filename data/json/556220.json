{"path":"556220.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a candid, urban scene featuring two men in the foreground who appear to be sharing a lighthearted moment. The man on the left is wearing a burnt orange shirt and plaid pants, and he is making a fist with his right hand, while the man on the right wears a yellow sweater with a diamond pattern and dark pants, smiling broadly.\n\nThey stand in a street that shows signs of neglect and urban decline. The background is a city street lined with rundown buildings, with a large Pabst Blue Ribbon beer advertisement hanging from one structure. There is visible debris scattered along the curb and over the sidewalk, including papers and litter. Several vintage cars are parked along the street, and there is an elevated train track structure in the distance, implying a location near public transit.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a mixture of resilience and decay, highlighting the humanity of its subjects against a backdrop of a struggling urban environment.","title":"Chicago ghetto on the South Side. Although the percentage of Chicago blacks making $7,000 or more jumped from 26 to 58% between 1960 and 1970, a large percentage still reMained unemployed. The black unemployment rate generally is assumed to be twice that of the national unemployment rate published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556153","553558","548372","553270","548452","546445","545331","552973","545358","546551","552753","557128","556222","553519","553487","553520"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["street","diamond","struggle","beer","decline","pant","burn","curb","transit","resilience"]}
