{"path":"542736.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows two distinct piles of grain-like substances on a flat surface, which appears to be a sheet of paper. On the left, there is a pile of small, greyish seeds, which could be some variety of sesame or chia seeds. On the right, there is a pile of light beige seeds, more uniform in color and larger in size, perhaps representing a type of rice or shelled sunflower seeds.\n\nThe texture and color contrast between the two heaps are striking, as the left pile reflects less light, making it appear duller compared to the right pile, which looks brighter and more reflective under the lighting conditions. There are some stray seeds scattered around each mound, mainly near the borders where the heaps meet the paper.\n\nThe background is simple and subdued, ensuring that the focus remains on the seeds. The lighting casts soft shadows, suggesting a natural light source, and helping to accentuate the textures and shapes of the seeds. This setup likely serves a scientific, educational, or culinary purpose to compare or demonstrate differences between these two types of grains or seeds.","title":"Oat groats poisoned with zinc phosphate, colored gray for identification.
