{"path":"556804.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban, everyday scene involving two women and a bus. The bus, prominently numbered \"4211\" and partially cropped at the top, features an open door through which the interior is partially visible, hinting at additional passengers inside.\n\nThe focal point is a woman stepping off the bus. She appears to be middle-aged, wearing sunglasses, a black top adorned with a white and green striped scarf draped across her neck, a light beige skirt, and dark shoes. She holds a large grayish-brown handbag in her right hand while reaching out to grasp a handrail with her left hand, assisting her exit from the bus. \n\nStanding in front of her, facing away from the camera, is another woman partially visible on the right side of the frame. This second woman, presumably waiting to board the bus, wears a bright lime-green coat or dress and carries a large, woven basket-like handbag.\n\nThe setting and attire suggest a typical daytime scene, likely in a bustling urban environment inferred from the appearance of the bus and the attire of the women, suggesting a need for transportation and practicality in their activities. The overall composition captures a moment of movement and everyday routine, emphasizing the public transit element and the interactions that accompany it.","title":"One passenger steps off a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus as another waits to climb on in Atlanta, Georgia.
