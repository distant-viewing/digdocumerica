{"path":"543192.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive coastal landscape featuring a foreground dominated by dense, low-growing vegetation with hues of red, green, and bits of white due to some flowering or dry parts. This plant appears to be succulent in nature, suggesting a tough, water-retentive plant adapted to arid conditions. The middle ground shows more sparse vegetation on sandy soil, leading to sand dunes rolling gently towards the background.\n\nIn the background, there are distinct, white sand dunes that lead up to a clear blue sky. The horizon is largely uninterrupted except for the meeting of sky and earth, and it appears to be a windy day, as implied by the textural appearance of the sand and visible whitecaps on the ocean in the far distance.\n\nThere is no human activity or any animals visible in the scene; it conveys a sense of remote natural beauty, untouched and serene. The lighting suggests it might be midday given the brightness and clarity of the colors in the photograph. The absence of any man-made structures or objects also emphasizes the untouched state of this coastal environment.","title":"California--Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["545280","543188","547015","551554","543193","548739","555400","550490","552434","547596","547607","547592","543389","543304","543424","545215"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["dune","sand","whitecap","meeting","plant","midday","brightness","clarity","absence","bit"]}
