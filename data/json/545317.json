{"path":"545317.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures an old, two-story building located at a street corner. The structure, which appears to be of historical architecture, is painted yellow with peeling paint and signs of wear, which add character to its appearance. Notable features include multiple rectangular windows with brown trim and two main doors, one on each visible side of the building. Over one door, a canopy provides some shade, underneath which are three people, one standing and two seated, possibly engaging in a casual conversation.\n\nOn the side wall facing the camera, a large faded sign reads \"M.A. GOMEZ WHOLESALE GROCER,\" indicating the building likely houses or previously served as a grocery distribution center. The street is visible in the foreground with a distinct shadow from an overhead power line stretching across the scene, adding a dynamic element to the image. There is also a fire hydrant on the near corner, and the street is marked with various traffic lines.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests it might be late afternoon, providing a warm hue to the scene and enhancing the aged, rustic feel of the building. The sky is a clear, vibrant blue, contrasting sharply with the saturated colors of the structure and features. This photo encapsulates a moment of everyday life against the backdrop of historical urban architecture.","title":"Adobe structure in Second Ward, Spanish-speaking section","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["545355","546440","552968","557643","542811","557156","555902","544088","545333","552964","545326","545339","550108","550138","557635","550285"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["corner","street","hydrant","grocery","door","distribution","architecture","standing","building","paint"]}
