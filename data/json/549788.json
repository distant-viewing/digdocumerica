{"path":"549788.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of litter and waste, presenting a striking commentary on pollution or neglect. The central object is a dirty, white porcelain toilet seat, upturned, with its opening facing upwards and slightly filled with debris. It rests amidst a chaotic pile of trash that includes numerous discarded items. The foreground and area surrounding the toilet seat are strewn with an assortment of crushed and whole beverage cans, many of which have the \"Schlitz\" beer label visible.\n\nAdditionally, there are other varied pieces of refuse, such as papers that appear to be pages or scraps of newspapers, unidentifiable crumpled and torn paper materials, fragments of green and brown glass bottles, and dried plant matter, possibly twigs or straw. The scene is set on a rocky surface, covered partially by the litter, which contributes to the overall grim and neglected atmosphere of the photograph.\n\nThe composition and content of the image forcefully convey themes of environmental degradation and the adverse impacts of human consumption and waste disposal practices.","title":"Lot behind apartment house at Lexington Avenue and 105th Street is strewn with assorted trash.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549789","551247","551246","544640","548214","543698","551440","556640","548131","550927","550801","550352","552089","547525","552100","550687"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["litter","paper","waste","neglect","consumption","crumple","beer","matter","tear","commentary"]}
