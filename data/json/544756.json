{"path":"544756.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a lakeside scene under bright daylight. A boat with a white hull and covered passenger area is anchored in a reasonably calm body of water. The water has a mirror-like sheen to it, reflecting the clear sky above. Directly in the foreground is a stretch of muddy land jutting into the water, creating a narrow pathway or temporary jetty made of mud that extends toward the boat. This jetty appears to be formed from sediment and debris, possibly from a recent receding of the water level or erosion, and it contains numerous dried, scattered leaves and twigs.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a stark, rocky landscape, appearing somewhat desolate and marked by layers of erosion, typical of a canyon or arid region. The colors in the hills range from dark brown to reddish hues, suggesting a natural, undeveloped area. These hills encase the lake, adding to the secluded and serene atmosphere of the scene. The overall composition captures a moment of quiet isolation, emphasizing the interaction between human activities (boating) and the rugged natural environment.","title":"Debris on Clear Creek","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["554486","544770","544266","557562","551207","543531","552915","543548","544142","544567","550324","545969","554552","543579","550674","545932"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["jetty","erosion","twig","boat","boating","sheen","stretch","hill","canyon","mirror"]}
