{"path":"551211.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph provides a panoramic view of a curving river lock or dam structure with vehicles moving along a narrow road beside it. The water in the river appears dark and slightly turbulent. On the left side of the image, two vehicles, a white truck and a red car, are driving on the road that curves tightly around the edge of the water, bordered by a low barrier that separates the road from a descending grassy and rocky slope.\n\nThe dam or lock structure is equipped with infrastructure, including what looks like a control tower or gazebo-style structure on one side, painted in a green and white color scheme. This part of the dam seems to house mechanical or operational equipment, possibly for managing the water flow or for navigation purposes.\n\nThe background features a hilly landscape with patches of dense green vegetation and trees. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting variable weather conditions. On the far right, the dam extends into the distance, leading to more industrial structures and facilities along the riverbank, hinting at a populated or commercially active area. The overall atmosphere appears calm, with no visible people, suggesting the photograph might focus on the infrastructure and natural scenery rather than human activity.","title":"Bagnell Dam which created Lake of the Ozarks, was built in 1931.
