{"path":"544579.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a single sunflower. The sunflower has bright yellow petals arranged around a large, dark brown center that houses smaller, densely packed brown seeds. The petals are vibrant and slightly uneven, extending outward from the center. The stem of the sunflower is green with small hair-like structures and a few visible leaves, which are partially obscured in the shot.\n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred, primarily in shades of green and dark blue, creating a gentle bokeh effect that hints at a natural, possibly wild environment without any distinct features or distractions from the main subject, the sunflower. This focused composition helps highlight the details and colors of the sunflower, making it the clear focal point of the photograph.","title":"Sunflowers","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["551622","545699","554840","544590","543596","544586","555061","557487","555189","555033","549230","551369","554580","557167","544875","544575"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","seed","distraction","stem","center","shot","subject","leave","effect","hair"]}
