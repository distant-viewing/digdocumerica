{"path":"557203.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil scene with five birds flying in a formation against a vast, soft-hued sky. The sky itself is painted in muted shades of purple and blue, perhaps indicating either early morning or late evening light. The cloud patterns are subtle and form gentle horizontal streaks that suggest a relaxed, uneventful atmosphere. The birds, possibly geese given their V-formation, are silhouetted black against the pastel sky, highlighting their synchronized flight pattern. There are no other discernible features or landmarks in the image; the focus remains solely on the natural elements of sky and wildlife. The overall mood of the photograph is serene and contemplative.","title":"A small flight of lesser sandhill cranes above the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary near GRand Island, Nebraska. It is a major stopping area for 250,000 of these birds during their migration to the Yukon Territory and Siberia from the Gulf of Mexico. The birds require a habitat for roosting that is provided by the Platte River, which is shallow and marshy. The area is threatened by a U.S. Corps of Engineers project which would dam and dredge the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["554646","550887","553875","557209","550382","550888","550889","544605","557208","557202","544609","544834","550903","549772","544597","557204"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["bird","v","formation","streak","landmark","flight","pattern","purple","wildlife","evening"]}
