{"path":"548747.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows a beach scene characterized by environmental pollution. The foreground prominently displays a collection of discarded trash, including numerous crushed and rusted aluminium cans, some clearly identifiable as Coca-Cola cans, along with other debris such as twigs and fragments of unidentifiable rubbish. \n\nThe beach itself is sandy with a narrow strip of seaweed and debris washed up along the tideline, indicating recent high tide activity. The ocean appears calm with slight waves lapping onto the shore. The coastline stretches into the distance, curving gently out of view, and is bounded on one side by a sparse line of low vegetation.\n\nThe sky is predominantly clear with few scattered clouds, suggesting a sunny day. Overall, the image juxtaposes natural beauty and human neglect, highlighting the issue of environmental degradation on coastal areas.","title":"Beach at little duck key.
