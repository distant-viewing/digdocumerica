{"path":"557229.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a traffic jam on a highway during what appears to be a sunny day. The perspective is from an elevated position looking down on the road, emphasizing the scale of the congestion. The highway is packed with a variety of vehicles including cars, trucks, and a bus, mostly in a standstill situation with very little space between them.\n\nThe vehicles featured largely look like models from the 1970s or 1980s, suggesting the photo might be several decades old. The color palette is quite vivid with the paint of the cars displaying a range of colors including blues, reds, and whites.\n\nThe environment surrounding the highway includes green trees flanking both sides of the road, suggesting suburban or semi-rural surroundings. To the left, there is a grass-covered area with a shadow that might be cast by an overpass or another structure not visible in the photo. There are no visible landmarks or signs that immediately identify the exact location. The road itself curves gently around a bend, leading to more vehicles visible in the distance, further reinforcing the extent of the traffic jam. This scene encapsulates a common aspect of urban and suburban life—traffic congestion—likely caused by peak travel hours or possibly a nearby incident on the road.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic on parkway east at Pittsburgh Pennsylvania","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["548084","557228","549903","553727","545884","553726","556727","556732","556194","543891","546734","553018","542684","556729","546711","549890"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["jam","highway","congestion","road","incident","traffic","vehicle","extent","landmarks","overpass"]}
