{"path":"546164.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image features an industrial setting with a somewhat dilapidated appearance. The central focus of the photo is a large, weathered barn or shed with peeling white paint. The structure has a gabled roof which is also painted white but shows significant wear and discoloration.\n\nSurrounding the building are several large industrial tanks and containers, varying in shape and size. These metallic structures, primarily vertical in orientation, exhibit rust and signs of aging, indicating they have been exposed to the elements for an extended period. The tanks have various attachments like pipes, gauges, and valves, suggesting they were used for storing or processing liquids or gases.\n\nIn the foreground, somewhat overgrown grass and wildflowers are visible, adding a touch of nature to the otherwise industrial scene. Behind the shed, lush green trees partially obscure the sky, providing a backdrop that contrasts with the man-made elements in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the scene is a mix of industrial activity that has seen better days, with nature slowly encroaching on the space as the human-made objects continue to weather and degrade.","title":"Abandoned oil field tools","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["552091","546201","556402","554821","554561","547470","556351","557389","542587","545998","545982","552448","543154","546064","544719","543258"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tank","attachment","valve","exhibit","discoloration","gauge","orientation","liquid","aging","shed"]}
