{"path":"546887.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil yet polluted urban water scene. The focal point is a large submerged boat in the foreground, mostly underwater except for its bow sticking out. The vessel appears old and neglected, contributing to a sense of environmental degradation.\n\nThe water is calm with a glossy surface reflecting the clear blue sky. The water is also littered with debris such as floating wood and trash, which adds to the impression of neglect and pollution.\n\nIn the background, there is a cityscape featuring several industrial buildings along the shoreline. A prominent multi-arch bridge spans across the river, contributing a structural element to the scene. The industrial buildings vary in architecture, with one particularly large multi-storied building dominating the skyline.\n\nThe lighting is bright, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day. The overall composition and elements in the image evoke thoughts on environmental issues, urban industrial impact on natural water bodies, and the possible abandonment and decay of certain urban areas.","title":"Swamped boat rots in the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547582","546886","547890","547626","546944","551559","549306","552127","546785","547622","557234","552158","544294","551985","558003","551979"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bow","degradation","water","thought","issue","trash","vessel","abandonment","cityscape","building"]}
