{"path":"544100.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a vast, sprawling open-pit mining operation under a clear sky. The scene is dominated by layers of earth in various shades of brown and ochre, carved out in terraces and wide pits, indicating extensive excavation activities.\n\nCentral to the composition are several industrial structures, likely conveyance systems or extractors, which are supported by large metal frameworks towering over the pits. These structures have cables and belts that possibly function to transport extracted material out of the pits.\n\nDirt roads crisscross the scene, with numerous trucks and heavy machinery scattered throughout the area, indicative of ongoing work. The scale of the operation is underscored by the small size of these vehicles compared to the vastness of the landscape.\n\nIn the background, utility poles line a road that runs parallel to the mining operation, hinting at some level of infrastructure present in this industrial setting. There is a hazy backdrop which could be a result of dust from the mining activities or distant mountains, enhancing the depth and isolation of the location.\n\nThis photograph not only details the extensive mechanical and human activity involved in such a mining operation but also highlights the environmental scale and impact of the excavation.","title":"The Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine. The first 500 ft. of the 1,100 ft. mine was alluvium, a waste product. The operation has a 20 to 1 ratio of waste to usable ore.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["544112","552177","549172","549241","544111","553049","544054","544785","549242","543857","549177","555621","544110","543758","549171","549174"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["pit","mining","operation","excavation","terrace","result","scale","cable","belt","dust"]}
