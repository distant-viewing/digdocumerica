{"path":"545514.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph showcases an older, weathered wooden building that appears to serve a religious or mission-based purpose, labeled as \"ANTIOCH MISSION.\" The structure has white, worn-out wooden siding and a simple, sloping roof. The front porch is cluttered with numerous handmade signs featuring religious texts and messages. One of the signs on the front door quotes from the book of Genesis and other signs include messages such as \"Repent,\" \"Jesus Saves,\" and \"SABBATA RAIN HERE.\"\n\nThe signs are written in a variety of styles and sizes, using different colors but mostly in black or dark ink. Around the building, there are other miscellaneous items visible, like a white chair on the porch and a partly visible barrel or drum to the side of the building.\n\nThe building has two main entry points visible in the photograph: a front door accessed through the porch and a side door to its right, each flanked by windows. The windows are aged, with one showing a dark curtain or covering.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image suggests a grassroots, community-centered religious effort, seemingly involved in outreach or missionary work, marked by a distinctly homemade and rustic aesthetic. The environment is somewhat overgrown and untidy, reflecting a down-to-earth and possibly improvised setup.","title":"Mission in \"Little Korea\", in south Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["554781","552479","545813","553999","554000","545366","543353","547808","548165","554707","556480","544820","557083","552506","552681","555513"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["porch","door","message","sign","covering","entry","drum","building","barrel","curtain"]}
