{"path":"552906.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph presents a serene landscape view captured in a wide, panoramic format. The scene is divided into several layers of natural features spread under a wide expanse of sky. The foreground consists of a slightly sloped, rocky ground covered with brownish vegetation and scattered tufts of green, suggesting an arid or semi-arid region.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is a distinctive black hill or small mountain, conical in shape, which stands out against the rest of the landscape. This point of interest draws the viewer's eye as it interrupts the horizontal sweep of the terrain.\n\nFurther in the background, to the right, lies a large body of water mirroring the light blue color of the sky, which highlights its vastness and provides a calming element to the scene. Parallel to this and stretching across the image is a range of mountains that have gentle slopes and are devoid of any significant vegetation; they appear in muted shades of blue and gray, suggesting distance and a sense of untouched wilderness.\n\nThe sky above spans the entire upper half of the image, showing a faded blue color with very few clouds, fostering a feeling of openness and tranquility that characterizes this landscape. \n\nOverall, the composition offers a tranquil vista over a natural and possibly remote setting, marked by its sparse vegetation, foreground textures, and the dramatic contrast provided by the solitary hill and the expansive water body aligned against a broad mountainous backdrop.","title":"Pyramid Lake, southern end, showing desert setting for which lake is noted","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["544155","552894","552904","552900","543761","545783","552582","544905","553994","550441","550399","552899","555388","543665","551553","550586"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["tuft","vista","vegetation","mountain","openness","hill","half","rest","distance","interest"]}
