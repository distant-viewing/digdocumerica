{"path":"548651.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of architectural detailing on a building. The focus is on the apex of a white, wood-panelled pediment showing intricate carving or moulding work in a floral or leaf-like pattern. The craftsmanship is detailed, featuring symmetrical scrolls and curving elements, reflecting an ornamental style typical of classical or Victorian architecture.\n\nThe pediment is partly in shadow, highlighting the three-dimensional aspect of the relief detailing. The angular directness of the photo underscores the precise lines and shapes of the woodwork. Below the pediment, a portion of a pale green, possibly metal, gutter is visible, providing a contrast in both texture and color to the white, elaborately carved wood above.\n\nThe sky behind the pediment is clear and vividly blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day. This backdrop emphasizes the brightness of the white paint and provides a stark contrast that makes the architectural details more pronounced. The overall composition emphasizes verticality and the sharp, clean lines of the structure, set against the smoothness of the sky.","title":"Pediment of one of the historic houses of Key West.
