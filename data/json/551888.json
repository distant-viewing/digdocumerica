{"path":"551888.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively indoor food stall named \"IMBISS - Express\" with a vibrant yellow theme. There are several people engaged in different activities around the stall. Two food service counters can be seen, each brightly lit and displaying various options like \"Apfelsaft\" (apple juice), \"Coca-Cola\", \"Limonade\" (lemonade), \"Hot Dogs\", \"Currywurst\", and several types of sausages with prices listed in Deutsche Marks (DM). \n\nAt the left of the image, a young man stands at a small table, which is a barrel bearing the \"OPAULI\" logo, seemingly discussing something with a vendor or staff member dressed in a dark uniform. The two appear to be in the midst of a conversation, and the vendor is attentively listening to the young man.\n\nAt the central and right part of the stall, several other customers, including adults and a child, are either browsing the menu, ordering food, or waiting for their orders. Behind the people at the counters, the background shows other parts of what appears to be a shopping area or a market with more stores visible in the distance.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a typical bustling snack or fast-food area inside a larger commercial or shopping complex, offering quick, convenient meals to shoppers and visitors.","title":"Underground stations include shops and restaurants as well as amusements, shower and washrooms, telephone and locker areas.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551844","554217","551485","554187","556816","554708","545457","546979","551887","551731","551840","551871","551838","554495","556291","557810"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["food","stall","vendor","counter","shopping","menu","shopper","option","staff","snack"]}
