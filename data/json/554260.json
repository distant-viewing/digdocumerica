{"path":"554260.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a city street scene featuring a person walking with the aid of crutches in the foreground. The individual, likely a male based on physical appearance, wears a black leather jacket, blue jeans, and what appear to be hiking boots. He has thick, curly dark hair and is facing away from the camera, suggesting movement along the street. His posture and reliance on crutches indicate a mobility impairment or injury.\n\nIn the background, other people can be seen. Notably, there's a person in a bright yellow jacket who seems to be walking away from the camera as well, in the opposite direction of the foreground figure. Further adding to the urban setting of the scene are architectural elements that include buildings with large windows and detailed columned facades, typical of late 19th or early 20th-century architecture. There is also a parked car in the mid-ground, a Volkswagen Type 2 van (often referred to as a Transporter or Microbus), that also defines the era likely indicated by the photograph, perhaps the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and the overall softness of the light, providing a mood of quiet transit or end of day activity. The overall tone of the image conveys a sense of everyday life with the emphasis on the resilience or daily routine of individuals navigating city life with physical challenges.","title":"Casts and crutches are part of the skiing scene","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554258","555914","543037","545331","551816","547816","547820","550118","555904","548368","556226","551835","545351","556221","549812","549923"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["reliance","refer","mobility","softness","leather","jacket","walk","city","aid","hiking"]}
