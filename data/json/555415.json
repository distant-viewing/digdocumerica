{"path":"555415.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The scene depicted in the photograph is of a gas station, presumably taken during the day under clear skies. The setting shows a neatly arranged station with several signs and visible brand markings. Notably, two signs prominently stand out: one reads \"OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" suggesting that the station is operational, and another larger sign states \"WE WAX CARS NO GAS,\" indicating that while the station offers services like waxing, it likely cannot provide gasoline at the time.\n\nThe gas station has multiple pumps visible, branded with the Exxon logo. To the left background, a competing Shell gas station sign is also visible, creating a subtle contrast between the two stations.\n\nOn the road adjacent to the station, there are several cars visible â€“ a white car is seen in motion, while others are parked or driving near the edge of the station. The surroundings include a mix of commercial signage, telephone poles, wires crisscrossing above, and sparse greenery. The architecture and vehicle designs hint at the photograph being set in mid-to-late 20th century, possibly during a period of fuel shortage reflected by the no gas service available at this particular station.","title":"\"No gas\" signs were a common sight in Oregon during the fall of 1973. This station on the coast was open for any business other than selling gasoline. Many stations closed earlier, opened later and shut down on the weekends.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["555484","555405","555473","555467","550096","548173","555452","555506","555485","555489","548047","555487","548170","555414","555498","550103"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["station","gas","sign","service","shortage","car","gasoline","telephone","fuel","pump"]}
