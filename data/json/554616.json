{"path":"554616.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph presents a serene natural landscape, portraying a calm body of water, presumably a lake or wide river, with a dense forest in the background. The image foreground is framed by various types of trees, including a birch trunk on the left and pine branches extending from the right. These natural elements create a window through which the viewer glimpses the scene.\n\nIn the distance, a range of mountains shrouded in a light mist or fog can be seen, enhancing the atmospheric depth of the picture. The mountainsâ€™ slopes appear lush and wooded, suggesting they are covered with a dense forest. The sky, though visible in only a few patches, appears overcast, casting a soft, diffused light that subtly illuminates the scene and reflects off the water, creating a tranquil mood.\n\nThe water itself is smooth, capturing reflections of the surrounding greenery and the slightest hints of the sky peeking through the clouds. This landscape scene is devoid of any human presence or man-made structures, emphasizing a natural and untouched environment. The quiet and peaceful setting evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation.","title":"High peaks area with mist after rain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve above tahawus, New York and mines of the nl industries","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554527","554526","543643","546963","543611","555692","552141","550579","552336","543816","553410","550691","554529","550656","557159","556930"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["birch","forest","mountain","peek","shroude","fog","pine","contemplation","mist","trunk"]}
