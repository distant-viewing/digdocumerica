{"path":"542824.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image depicts a logging site densely packed with activity and visual elements. A sweeping view of the area shows a vast expanse of cleared land surrounded by dense forests. The center and foreground of the photograph are dominated by areas where trees have been recently cut down, showcasing piles of logs and scattered debris across the muddy ground. Dirt roads twist through the landscape, connecting different parts of the site.\n\nThe site is scattered with heavy machinery, possibly for cutting and transporting timber. These machines are small in scale compared to the overall size of the clearing but are noticeable as focal points of human activity in the area. The forest perimeter encloses the clearing, highlighting a stark contrast between the lush, untouched tree line and the disturbed land.\n\nThe environment reflects typical logging operations, with the organized chaos of fallen timber and operational logistics clearly visible. The scenery implies significant human intervention in a natural landscape, emphasizing themes of resource extraction and environmental impact.","title":"Clear cutting and timber damage","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550354","542852","542851","542948","542947","542949","542827","552198","556922","555143","554416","553468","555198","545266","542624","542828"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["timber","logging","clearing","site","perimeter","chaos","logistic","land","forest","extraction"]}
