{"path":"554191.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring a \"Wisconsin Ducks\" amphibious tour vehicle parked in front of a store called \"Dime N' Dollar\" with a sign advertising \"Official Duck Tickets\" above it. The Wisconsin Ducks vehicle, prominently labeled as \"Ride the Original Wisconsin Ducks,\" is a blue and white amphibious land-water craft designed for tours. It displays additional text that states \"Fun and Adventure on Land-Water,\" alongside tour scheduling information (\"Tours Daily 8 am - 7 pm\"). \n\nThe vehicle is adorned with red, white, and blue stripes, giving it a festive, patriotic look. Awnings with similar color stripes are visible on the store behind the vehicle, creating a visually coherent theme. The store's entrance seems to feature various signs advertising souvenirs and jewelry, suitable for a tourist spot.\n\nTo the far right, an illuminated round sign with \"One Dime\" is visible, partially revealing the store's price theme. The top of the store and the boat features a few small flags fluttering, contributing to the cheerful, active atmosphere typical of tourist areas.\n\nA number of individuals are in the vehicle, appearing as passengers ready for a tour, dressed casually suitable for a leisure activity. The environment includes a clear sky and a hint of greenery, possibly indicating a warm, sunny day ideal for outdoor activities. This setting suggests that the photograph was taken in a busy commercial area geared towards tourists, probably during a mid to late 20th-century summer.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554173","554175","550029","554484","545154","554657","552119","554063","553274","554176","544002","552406","554180","554683","543934","554457"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["tour","store","tourist","vehicle","stripe","jewelry","ticket","sign","awning","price"]}
