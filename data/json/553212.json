{"path":"553212.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts two young women walking along a brick-paved path. Both are engaged in eating ice cream cones, suggesting a casual, leisurely atmosphere. The woman on the left is dressed in a white t-shirt with a colorful pattern on the front and flared jeans, accessorized with a dark belt. She appears focused on her ice cream. The woman on the right wears a light pink top, pale blue flared jeans, and is accessorized with a white belt, a watch on her left wrist, and dark wedge sandals. She is also carrying a small, patterned shoulder bag and holds what appears to be a folded piece of paper or pamphlet in her other hand.\n\nThe background features a dark, rounded structure that might be part of a building or a large archway, contrasting with the brightness of their clothing and the path. The setting and their attire suggest this could be a warm, sunny day, likely captured in a public, possibly urban environment conducive to pedestrian activity. The overall mood is relaxed and captures a moment from everyday life, emphasizing themes of youth and leisure in an urban setting.","title":"Quick snack in Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553204","551923","551845","543036","551436","555896","551545","551817","554495","553164","545231","549678","554909","551466","553211","546461"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["cream","ice","belt","pamphlet","woman","jean","path","sandal","archway","wrist"]}
