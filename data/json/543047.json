{"path":"543047.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a beach scene where several people are engaging in various activities around a rocky area by the water. In the foreground, large, dark rock formations rise from the sand, creating nooks that the beachgoers appear to be exploring. The ocean in the background has frothy white waves gently meeting the shore.\n\nTo the right, a large rock partially shades multiple individuals. Around the rocks, the sand appears dark and possibly damp. A few people, including children and adults, are visible in this area. One adult in white clothing bends over, seemingly examining or picking up something from the ground. A child wearing a yellow top and dark shorts stands close to the center, holding a bucket. Other individuals are seated or standing, oriented towards each other, suggesting a social or family group activity.\n\nThe sunlight is bright, casting stark shadows and giving the water a silvery sheen. The overall setting suggests a leisurely day at the beach, with visitors engaged in casual exploration and enjoying the natural surroundings.","title":"Picnic on beach","placename":"Trinidad (Calif.)","location":"Trinidad, California","nn1":["545097","543322","553952","543310","543072","543492","543225","543216","543372","552286","557458","547009","555923","543161","551931","543534"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["rock","sand","adult","beach","beachgoer","child","silvery","pick","sheen","explore"]}
