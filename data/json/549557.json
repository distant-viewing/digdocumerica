{"path":"549557.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a large, majestic waterfall. This is likely an image of Niagara Falls, taken from a vantage point that offers a panoramic perspective of the cascading water and surrounding area.\n\nThe waterfall is seen at the center and is the most striking feature in the image. The water is pouring over a curved cliff, forming a massive, semi-circular cascade. A massive cloud of mist rises from the point where the water crashes down, adding a mysterious and powerful aura to the scene. The water appears white and frothy at the top and transitions into darker shades as it moves away from the waterfall due to the depth and turbulence.\n\nJust upstream of the waterfall, the river is relatively calm and speckled with small patches of land or islets covered in greenery. These patches add a touch of serene green contrasting against the predominantly blue and white hues of the water.\n\nThe background and the areas adjacent to the waterfall show signs of human presence and urban development, indicated by structured rows along the riverbanks. Parking lots and buildings are visible, suggesting a popular or accessible region for tourists and locals alike, facilitating viewing points or recreational facilities near the water.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a dynamic natural scene juxtaposed with signs of human activity, emphasizing both the beauty and the tourist appeal of the location.","title":"Canadian, or \"horseshoe falls\" seen from the air above goat island","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549558","549554","549563","549466","549544","549534","544456","549535","549549","549530","549562","549546","553354","549536","542699","549496"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","tourist","point","water","islet","local","turbulence","cascading","pour","aura"]}
