{"path":"544443.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a lush, vibrant meadow filled with numerous small yellow flowers, each centered with a brown, cone-shaped core surrounded by a fringe of short brown petals. These flowers densely dot the green grass, adding a vivid splash of color to the landscape.\n\nIn the background, the terrain becomes rocky and uneven, with large boulders and patches of earth visible. Sparse vegetation and a few trees appear toward the top of the hilly incline, suggesting a more rugged natural environment beyond the flower-covered meadow. The sky, while mostly obscured by the terrain and foliage, hints at a clear day due to the bright lighting and shadows visible on the ground. \n\nThe composition focuses on the contrast between the soft, colorful foreground of flowers and the harsh, stony landscape in the distance, emphasizing the diversity of the natural terrain in this area. The overall effect of the image is of peaceful natural beauty, highlighting both the delicacy of the wildflowers and the resilience of the landscape.","title":"Texas--near Lake Austin","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["545723","544938","550781","544439","544574","552503","544881","553076","557098","545718","545296","555186","543206","542704","549230","544894"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","meadow","core","fringe","terrain","cone","incline","become","petal","boulder"]}
