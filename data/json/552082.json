{"path":"552082.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph shows a large river in the background, with a wide expanse of water stretching to a tree-lined far shore under a bright sky. The foreground is dominated by a pile of debris that includes various objects such as a rusty metal barrel, scattered cans, branches, and other miscellaneous waste materials. The debris leads up to the bank of the river, suggesting either a dumping ground or wash-up from the river itself. The overall scene presents a contrast between the natural beauty of the peaceful river and the human-created pollution cluttering its bank, signaling environmental neglect or damage.","title":"The south bank of the Kansas River on the east side of Lawrence has become a much used dumping ground.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["545945","552098","551531","550352","552080","550950","552046","552100","556419","544810","552127","552811","550946","550250","548308","550687"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","bank","clutter","wash","debris","barrel","dump","signal","can","up"]}
