{"path":"552860.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features an older man standing on what appears to be the deck of a boat. The man is dressed in a light blue collared shirt and dark trousers, secured with a belt. He wears eyeglasses and a wristwatch on his left wrist. The man is holding an open oyster in his right hand, exhibiting it towards the camera with a serious expression on his face.\n\nThe background includes the blue and white cloudy sky and part of another individual visible only in partial view. The setting suggests an outdoor, marine environment, possibly taken during a boat trip. The structures like the metal framework, possibly part of the boat’s canopy, add to the maritime ambiance.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting of the photo give it a candid and somewhat documentary feel, focusing on the man’s activity of showing the oyster, which may suggest a context of marine biology, environmental study, or a casual expedition.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oysterbeds.
