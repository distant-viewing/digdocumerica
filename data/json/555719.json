{"path":"555719.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil maritime scene featuring a small fishing boat on a calm blue sea. The boat is primarily white with a red trim running along its lower edges and has a green cabin. On the boat, three individuals, possibly fishermen, are engaged in activity, likely preparing or handling fishing equipment. The ocean extends broadly around the boat, meeting a pale blue sky at the horizon. The water appears calm with minimal wave activity, suggesting a serene day perfect for fishing. The overall composition of the photo focuses on the isolation and peacefulness of the boat in the vast expanse of the ocean.","title":"Commercial lobstermen in the New York Bight, a unique coastal marine environment because of the extent of man's activities.
