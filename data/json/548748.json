{"path":"548748.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene camping scene set near a large body of water. In the foreground, partially visible is an automobile, specifically a station wagon painted in a two-tone color scheme, suggesting a model from around the 1970s or 1980s. This car is parked on a dirt path, indicating a rural or less-developed area often found in camping sites.\n\nCentral to the image are two large tents, arranged staggered but close to each other, suggesting the presence of a group or family staying together. The tent to the left sports a green and lighter green color scheme, while the one to the right has beige and orange hues with a large, darker cover draped over one side, probably for extra shade or shelter. These tents have a traditional triangular structure, typical for older, more spacious camping tents.\n\nBehind the tents, the expanse of calm, blue water forms a tranquil background, reflecting sunlight and enhancing the peacefulness of the setting. A small, solitary bush or small tree stands near the waterâ€™s edge, adding a touch of greenery to the lakeside atmosphere.\n\nNo people are clearly visible in the scene, emphasizing the quietness and possibly early morning or late afternoon timing of the photograph, which can be inferred from the soft lighting and shadows under the tent. The overall composition of the photo speaks to a moment of leisure and nature engagement, typical of a camping excursion. The setting is uncomplicated and rustic, which aligns with traditional outdoor recreational activities.","title":"Camping at Bahia Honda State Park in the lower Florida Keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550977","548796","548795","548668","545500","553133","549450","554181","542747","554863","548797","544855","543889","554480","545293","542746"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["tent","camping","scheme","timing","excursion","quietness","shelter","peacefulness","wagon","automobile"]}
