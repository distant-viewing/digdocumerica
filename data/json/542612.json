{"path":"542612.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor environment showcasing eroded terrain characterized by deep gullies carved into a slope of sandy soil. The foreground is marked by a stretch of uneven, exposed ground that appears dry and devoid of vegetation. The erosion on the slope has left pronounced, narrow channels that provide a textured appearance, running vertically down the incline. These gullies suggest recent rainfall or water flow that has stripped away the topsoil, exposing the underlying earth.\n\nThe slope is bounded by a forested area at the upper edge, with tall pine trees that suggest a mountainous or hilly region. The presence of these trees highlights the contrast between the forested area and the eroded section, emphasizing the environmental impact in the scene. The lighting is bright, indicating daylight conditions with ample sunlight that casts shadows within the gullies, enhancing the three-dimensional quality of the terrain.\n\nScattered debris, including small branches and logs, can be seen both on the slope and at the bottom, hinting at natural occurrences such as windfalls or minor landslides contributing to the terrain's rough texture. This setting is likely a natural landscape experiencing significant soil erosion, posing environmental concerns such as loss of fertile soil and potential impacts on nearby ecosystems.","title":"A successful and an unsuccessful attempt at erosion stabilization on a mountain road","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555598","551231","557100","545938","555595","545899","549176","543817","555098","551232","547157","545534","554547","554548","555136","543721"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["gully","slope","soil","erosion","landslide","loss","terrain","incline","impact","rainfall"]}
