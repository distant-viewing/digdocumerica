{"path":"552380.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a person working on a complex set of electronic equipment within an enclosed setting, which appears to be modified for technical operations, perhaps a mobile lab or unit. The person, a man, is focused on adjusting or inspecting one of the pieces of equipment within an open-faced cabinet or rack filled with various electronic systems and devices.\n\nHe is dressed in a casual brown shirt and has dark hair styled in a typical manner for a previous era, suggesting the image might be several decades old. The equipment surrounding him includes multiple racks and enclosures fitted with dials, switches, meters, and displays suggesting functionalities like monitoring, recording, or communications. The electronics looks dated with analog controls and reel-to-reel tape drives, indicative of mid-to-late 20th-century technology.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears utilitarian, possibly part of a vehicle or portable structure given the confined space and the partial view of a window which might look outside to a bright day. The complexity and arrangement of the electronics suggest a specialized application, likely scientific or communications-related. The focus, posture, and equipment convey a sense of professional engagement and technical expertise.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542765","548855","549378","552367","542668","547720","549367","551595","542659","549625","545952","548857","549610","555334","557317","549364"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["reel","rack","communication","equipment","application","recording","expertise","tape","switch","modify"]}
