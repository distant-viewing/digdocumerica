{"path":"553873.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a biplane in silhouette against a softly lit sky, presumably dusk or dawn, as it flies low over a field. The biplane, featuring two main wings stacked one above the other and a rear-facing propeller, is engaged in crop dusting, evidenced by the plumes of spray that trail densely behind it. These sprays, possibly of pesticides or fertilizers, create dramatic, swirling patterns in the air, enhancing the dynamic quality of the scene.\n\nThe landscape is nondescript, suggesting the image's focus is on the activity of the plane rather than the specific location. The lighting is moody and subdued, with the horizon barely discernible and the sky taking on a gradient of dark to lighter hues that suggest the sun might just be below or near the horizon line. This backlighting silhouettes the plane dramatically, highlighting its outline and the action of the spraying.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is dynamic, capturing a moment of agricultural activity in a visually striking manner, emphasizing the intersection of technology and nature.","title":"Crop dusting near calipatria in the imperial valley.
