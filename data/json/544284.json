{"path":"544284.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph presents a dynamic and scenic view of a coastal or lakeside environment. At the forefront, the rocky shoreline is seen stippled with grass and small plants, with the edge dipping into the dark, choppy waters of a large body of water. The waves, capturing the light, create sparkles and splashes as they interact with the rocks and vegetation.\n\nLooking beyond the immediate shoreline, the water is expansive and features several posts sticking out of it, possibly remains of a broken-down pier or fishing stakes. Farther out, there is an interesting structure that stands on stilt-like supports above the water, resembling a small hut or gazebo, which might be used for observation, fishing, or as a shelter.\n\nThe background shows a vast, open sky with scattered fluffy clouds, hinting at a clear, bright day. The horizon is largely unobstructed apart from the water and sky meeting seamlessly, enhancing the sense of openness and tranquility in the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo balances the ruggedness of the near shore with the serene expanse of water and sky, creating a contemplative and naturally beautiful scene. This setting could potentially be used for leisure activities like fishing or simply as a peaceful retreat to enjoy nature.","title":"Louisiana--lake pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["549338","547602","543289","543362","543053","548030","553773","548034","554102","543060","545122","545173","552922","547143","543297","542870"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["fishing","gazebo","shoreline","hut","contemplative","water","stake","dip","fluffy","retreat"]}
