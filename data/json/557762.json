{"path":"557762.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor scene, likely at a fishing or recreational area. The primary focus in the foreground is a large sign that reads \"STOP CATCH TROUT,\" advertising free rods, reels, no license required, free bait, no limit, and a \"no catch no pay\" policy. It advertises Eagle Mountain Trout Tours, suggesting that the location might be Eagle Mountain in Rabun County, Georgia.\n\nBehind this sign, to the left, there is a small, red-roofed building labeled \"Live Minnow & Tackle,\" indicating that it likely serves as a bait and tackle shop. Several cars are parked near the building, including a pale yellow or white coupe and a red sedan, which seem to be from the 1970s or early 1980s, based on their design.\n\nTo the right, further back in the photo, there is a green pond surrounded by lush, dense greenery and trees. People are visible around the pond; two are standing near the waterâ€™s edge in the process of fishing, while another person is seated farther back on the grass. The setting appears peaceful and leisurely, with individuals engaging in outdoor activities in a forested, rural environment. The area is sunny and looks secluded, creating a serene atmosphere perfect for fishing and relaxing in nature.","title":"Three women fish in a stocked trout pond off Georgia highways 17/75 at robertstown, a mile northeast of helen.
