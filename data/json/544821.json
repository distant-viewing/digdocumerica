{"path":"544821.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people, mostly young and a mix of adults, in a rural, grassy field under a clear sky. The landscape is vast and flat, suggesting a grassland or prairie environment. The group is scattered, with most individuals walking towards the right of the frame and a few bending down or looking closely at the ground, possibly observing or examining something in the grass.\n\nA variety of casual, outdoor clothing can be seen, including jeans, shirts, jackets, and hats, suitable for a day of field activity. At the far left, a boy is bending forward, intently looking at something on the ground, which is not visible in the image. Near the center, other participants are engaged in conversation or walking together in pairs or small groups.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests an educational or exploratory outing, perhaps a field trip or ecological study, with participants engaged in learning or observing natural elements in the environment. The open, undisturbed nature of the setting underlines a sense of exploration and discovery.","title":"Students observe prairie dog colonies at the plains conservation center","placename":"Aurora (Colo.)","location":"Aurora, Colorado","nn1":["558245","544003","554666","554665","558242","543234","554672","557785","557207","544802","557659","543736","557005","546449","545308","543238"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["participant","field","group","bending","prairie","underline","discovery","observe","learn","walk"]}
