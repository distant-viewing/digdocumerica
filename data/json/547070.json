{"path":"547070.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures an individual who is using a mounted viewing telescope. The person is dressed warmly, wearing a large red knitted hat with a pom-pom and a dark blue coat. The viewer, engaged with the telescope, is standing behind a metal fence that demarcates the viewing area from a grassy slope leading down to a body of water. The background shows a hazy, overcast sky and a calm sea extending to the horizon. The composition suggests a chilly, possibly windy coastal location often visited for its scenic overlook, where visitors can use the telescope to gain a better view of distant objects or landscapes.","title":"Lookout station at the Ludington Consumer Power Plant on Lake Michigan","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547125","547124","546835","557179","543495","547853","547849","547150","553592","549602","547864","542677","547089","543469","554491","549603"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["visitor","coat","slope","fence","sea","hat","object","location","viewer","person"]}
