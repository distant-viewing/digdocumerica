{"path":"553501.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman seated against a weathered wooden wall in what appears to be an outdoor, shaded area. The woman, who has dark hair and is wearing a dark T-shirt layered over a white undershirt, has her arms crossed and looks toward the right side of the frame with a somewhat pensive or serious expression.\n\nBehind her are hand-written graffiti markings on the wall that include names and other unclear markings. Adjacent to her, on the left side of the image, there is a disheveled pile of various items including clothes and a cardboard box. The scattered and untidy nature of these belongings suggests they may be personal items possibly in use or abandoned.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of neglect or hardship, emphasizing the possible challenges faced by the individual depicted. The lighting and faded colors give the photograph a somber tone, enhancing the emotional impact of the setting.","title":"Residents of Mulky Square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side, face large scale displacement by a new interstate highway (I-635).
