{"path":"549565.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people dressed in yellow protective rain gear, complete with hoods and masks, probably protecting against mist or spray. They are gathered on a series of wooden viewing platforms built around what appears to be a large, rocky, and potentially wet environmentâ€”suggesting they might be near a waterfall or other natural water feature. The platforms are interconnected with staircases and railings, aiding in navigation and safety.\n\nThe focus is shallow, making the surroundings slightly blurred, which enhances the centrality and visual impact of the brightly dressed individuals. The misty or foggy atmosphere adds a mysterious or dramatic quality to the scene. The natural rock formations surrounding the platforms are dark and jagged, contrasting sharply with the vivid yellow of the rain gear and the light brown of the wooden structures. The composition and setting suggest a tourist or educational expedition exploring a natural, possibly harsh environment where protective clothing is necessary.","title":"Observation ramp at \"cave of the winds\" at the base of the american Niagara Falls.
