{"path":"547851.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a classic American fast food meal served on a car window tray, emphasizing the nostalgic drive-in dining experience. The meal features three hamburger sandwiches with buns that look soft and are pinned together with small white skewers to hold the components in place. The burgers are accompanied by a serving of golden French fries placed in a white dish to the side.\n\nAdditionally, there are several small containers lined up neatly in a row beside the fries, filled with ketchup for dipping. The food tray is attached to an open car window, and the tray itself has a textured mesh surface, likely for grip and stability.\n\nIn the background, although blurred, a person can be distinguished wearing a blue shirt, suggesting the presence of either a driver or a passenger in the car, or a server at the drive-in. The lighting and focus on the food highlight its appeal, likely intended to create an inviting and appetizing effect. The overall setting conveys a slice of Americana, reflecting a popular cultural eating habit specific to the mid-20th century in the United States.","title":"Lunch in the car-Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547855","552614","556816","548544","553211","551419","554187","555422","555438","547862","551276","554482","554188","556052","556036","546183"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["tray","food","meal","drive","bun","sandwich","car","in","stability","dish"]}
