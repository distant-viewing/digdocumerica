{"path":"549234.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, densely wooded scene likely taken during the day. The image features a variety of tall trees, predominantly conifers, that stretch upward filling most of the frame. These trees are slender and appear to be fairly mature, with some light filtering through their branches and foliage.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a thick undergrowth of shrubs and smaller plants, creating a lush greenery at the bottom of the image. The vegetation looks verdant and slightly wet, possibly indicating recent rain or a moist environment.\n\nThe sky is not very visible due to the dense canopy of the trees, but where it peeks through, it appears to be overcast, contributing to the overall moody and serene feel of the scene. The photograph does not include any people or animals; it focuses solely on capturing the natural beauty and calm of the forest environment. The angle of the shot is from ground level, looking slightly upward towards the tops of the trees, emphasizing their height and the thickness of the forest.","title":"Stately forest in the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.
