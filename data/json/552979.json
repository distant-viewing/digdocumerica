{"path":"552979.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph shows an underwater scene with the sunlight shining through clear water onto a sandy bottom. Four stingrays are visible on the sandy floor, partially buried under the sand; their outlines can be clearly distinguished. The water appears shallow and has a slight ripple to its surface, indicating a calm water body. The sunlight creates patterns and light reflections on the sandy bottom and aquatic environment. This serene aquatic setting captures the natural camouflage behavior of stingrays in their habitat.","title":"(from the documerica-1 exhibition.
