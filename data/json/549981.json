{"path":"549981.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a young man standing on a balcony framed by large, classical columns in the background. The columns are tall, with ornate Corinthian capitals, indicative of classical architectural influence and likely part of a large, stately building. The backdrop creates a strong vertical rhythm which contrasts with the horizontal lines of the balcony railing.\n\nThe young man appears engaged in a casual activity, possibly speaking or gesturing to someone off-camera, as he holds a small object in his hand which might be a pen or a cigarette. He wears a simple white T-shirt paired with dark pants and casual shoes. His hair is curly and somewhat unkempt, adding to his relaxed demeanor.\n\nThe lighting is diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky or a shaded area, which gives the image a soft, muted feel. Overall, the composition harmoniously blends the elements of classic architecture with the contemporary casualness of the young manâ€™s appearance and demeanor.","title":"Columns of the Philadelphia Museum of Art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545232","556027","546495","547812","556618","551269","546515","549335","557393","551486","545401","546105","552971","557078","553537","546419"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["balcony","demeanor","column","rhythm","capital","cigarette","pen","influence","man","shoe"]}
