{"path":"556882.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a rail yard, focusing on a group of railroad workers engaged in an activity beside a moving train. The left side of the image shows a part of a large, diesel locomotive labeled \"SOUTHERN\" in white letters on a dark blue background. The locomotive's number, \"2603,\" is visible near the engine operator's window.\n\nThe right side of the image features multiple workers wearing hard hats; they are busy with some kind of manual labor involving rail equipment. One worker, standing closer to the foreground, is wearing a pink shirt and a dark hat, and is seen gesturing or perhaps throwing something. Other workers in the background are handling or adjusting a large, triangular metal frame or structure that is part of the rail infrastructure.\n\nThe setting appears to be overcast, with a hint of industrial ambiance underscored by the presence of gravel, railway ties, and other machinery. The environment conveys a sense of organized, bustling activity typically associated with railway maintenance or construction tasks.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way work crew, stops work to let a train pass on parallel tracks. On a good day, when they don't have to stop too many times for other trains, they can lay slightly less than two miles of quarter mile long sections of track. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track. In that year the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556860","556894","556879","556886","556872","556871","556899","556900","556884","556895","556116","551007","556897","556878","551006","556012"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["worker","rail","locomotive","railway","operator","hat","railroad","engine","kind","gravel"]}
