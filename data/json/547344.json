{"path":"547344.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a contemplative young man wearing a cowboy hat. He appears to be indoors, perhaps in a barn or similar rustic setting, suggested by the wooden beams and the pattern of light streaming in through what may be slatted windows or openings. The man has a focused expression, his eyes slightly downturned and hand resting pensively on his chin, as if in deep thought or evaluating something in his hand which is not visible in the image. He wears a dark, quilted vest over a light blue long-sleeve shirt.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is soft, emphasizing his facial features and the texture of his attire, particularly the rough material of the cowboy hat. The background is softly blurred, drawing attention primarily to his well-lit face and the upper part of his torso. His expression and pose lend a thoughtful or introspective mood to the overall image.","title":"At the annual lamb sale at seward county fairgrounds buyers are mostly youngsters who use the lambs for 4-h club livestock shows","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553091","552561","553516","553115","547679","549199","549120","551300","546068","554923","552579","557173","554858","554926","556084","555297"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cowboy","quilt","torso","ching","hat","focused","expression","opening","thought","hand"]}
