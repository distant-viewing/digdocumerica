{"path":"557919.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a car garage or service station. The primary focus is on a man standing next to an open car door. The man appears to be a service attendant or mechanic, indicated by his white shirt with a name patch and dark trousers. He is leaning slightly into the car, extending a ticket or a receipt towards someone inside the vehicle. The car is a classic model, characterized by its shiny, curved black exterior and chrome detailing.\n\nInside the car, you can see another person, although details about this person are not very clear due to the reflections and angle of the photo. The background is slightly out of focus, featuring what looks like a large garage with open doors, possibly revealing other cars and a somewhat busy atmosphere typical of a service station. The natural lighting suggests it might be daytime, and the overall ambiance evokes a sense of everyday activity and automotive maintenance. The setting and attire of the attendant suggest this photo could be dated back a few decades, given the vintage look of the car and the style of the uniform.","title":"City employee affixes a temporary 30-day sticker to the windshield of a car after it had failed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
