{"path":"547908.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a neglected and polluted narrow creek or waterway. The setting shows visual signs of environmental neglect and urban debris accumulation. Key elements in the image include:\n\n1. **Waterway**: The central focus is a creek muddied and partially filled with stagnant water, which reflects a small portion of the sky and surroundings.\n\n2. **Shopping Cart**: A conspicuous, rusty shopping cart lies abandoned in the water, dominating the foreground. This discarded cart, tipped over on its side, is partially submerged in the muddy water, suggesting human negligence or urban decay.\n\n3. **Vegetation**: Dense overgrowth flanks both sides of the creek. To the left, there are bushes and flowering plants, possibly wildflowers, exhibiting some signs of life and resistance against the backdrop of pollution. The right side shows tall, dense grass or reeds stretching upwards, indicating perhaps a less maintained area.\n\n4. **Litter and Debris**: Apart from the shopping cart, there are smaller pieces of trash scattered along the creek bed and partially submerged. There is also an unseen cylindrical object (possibly a barrel or a large pipe) lying on the left side, contributing to the creek's cluttered and dirty appearance.\n\n5. **Background and Lighting**: The image is taken in daylight as indicated by the bright lighting and clear visibility of the detailed texture of the natural and non-natural elements. The background reveals a continuation of the waterway, bending slightly out of view and hinting at a wider landscape context that remains largely unseen.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo captures a scene of environmental degradation within an urban or suburban setting, highlighting issues of pollution, neglect, and the encroachment of human waste into natural water bodies.","title":"Clogged stream at entrance to Great Kills Park on Staten Island.
