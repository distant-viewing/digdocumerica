{"path":"550238.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a natural and serene setting dominated by a winding stream of water, which reflects the light unevenly along its surface, creating ripples and a play of shimmering light. The environment surrounding the waterway appears lush, with green vegetations encroaching near the waterâ€™s edge, hinting at a possibly secluded area.\n\nTwo individuals, one male and one female, are seen wading gently in the shallow stream. The man is shirtless and wearing dark shorts, whereas the woman is decked in light-color shorts and a shirt with her hair tied up, suggesting a relaxed, informal ambiance. Both individuals walk slowly, side by side, possibly enjoying a leisurely conversation or savoring the tranquility of their surroundings.\n\nIn the backdrop, the environment turns slightly rugged with what appears to be debris or driftwood scattered along the banks, adding a raw, untouched feel to the scene. Additionally, there are hints of other people further upstream, barely discernible, which conveys that this area is somewhat accessible to visitors or locals enjoying the outdoors.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its focus on the two central figures amidst a rustic and natural backdrop, evokes a sense of intimacy and peaceful coexistence with nature. It's a reflective, perhaps candid snapshot of simple outdoor pleasures, human connection, and the beauty of an undisturbed natural locale.","title":"Strolling along constantly eroding strip of Huntington Beach on lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550234","554903","545489","555376","550235","546922","546320","554901","546338","550213","543530","557740","552976","551967","557743","549030"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["stream","short","local","female","enjoy","encroach","pleasure","intimacy","wade","driftwood"]}
