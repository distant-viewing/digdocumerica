{"path":"554345.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman in profile, partially illuminated in a dimly lit environment. She is engaging actively with a microphone, which is positioned in front of her at about chin height. The woman appears to be in the midst of speaking or singing, suggested by her open mouth and the expressive posture of her face.\n\nShe wears dark clothing, which blends into the dark background, highlighting her face more vividly due to the contrasting light source that focuses mainly on her facial features. Her hair is styled in a smooth manner, flowing gently down her back and shoulder.\n\nThe mood of the photograph is intimate and somewhat mysterious, partly due to the low-key lighting which casts most of the image in shadows. The focus and lighting emphasize the woman's engagement and possibly the emotional intensity of her performance. The background remains unobtrusive and nondescript, adding to the focus on her facial expressions and the microphone.","title":"Participant in a citizens' forum held in Midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York City proposed by EPA's regional office.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545373","556516","553499","556244","551318","556251","556412","554344","554337","554340","553217","556310","558261","556318","554283","556151"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["microphone","woman","face","midst","performance","mouth","intensity","manner","profile","source"]}
