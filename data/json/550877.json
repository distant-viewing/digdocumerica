{"path":"550877.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph presents a large, dense pile of cut logs viewed up close. The logs are mostly uniform in diameter but vary slightly in size, creating a textured pattern of circular cross-sections of wood. The hues range from light beige to dark brown, highlighting the natural variations in wood color and age. The ends of the logs are in various states of freshness and aging, with some appearing newer with lighter colors, whereas others are darker, suggesting weathering or decay.\n\nThe upper left portion of the image shows some logs covered by a thin layer of white, which could either be sawdust, frost, or some other residue. In the lower foreground, a few logs and branches are not as neatly stacked, lying horizontally across each other adding a slight irregularity to the pattern.\n\nThe focus and clarity decline slightly towards the edges of the frame, centering the detail and sharpness toward the middle. The background is uniformly filled with logs, providing no distinct backdrop other than the logs themselves. This composition amplifies the sense of abundance and the scale of the wood pile, portraying a scene likely related to logging, wood storage, or forestry management.","title":"Detail of Fox River pollution near the Thilmany Pulp and Paper Company at Kaukauna","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555144","542596","542595","552203","552547","552197","545036","552199","543489","555143","555507","550337","553648","553647","543541","548155"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","wood","sawdust","frost","pile","freshness","residue","sharpness","amplify","abundance"]}
