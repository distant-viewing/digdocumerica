{"path":"543141.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene landscape focused on a lighthouse standing prominently in the background. The lighthouse features a red and white tower topped with a traditional lantern room and gallery, surrounded by greenery and some lower buildings possibly related to the lighthouse operation.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a calm body of water reflecting the lighthouse and its surroundings, adding a picturesque quality to the scene. The water is bordered by lush reeds and grasses that add texture and a natural feel to the composition. Additionally, near the base of the lighthouse, an array of wooden poles and some debris are visible, suggesting perhaps recent maintenance or structural reinforcements.\n\nThe scene is set against a bright blue sky, and the lighting implies it is either early morning or late afternoon, giving the colors a warm hue. Electrical poles running vertically through the image suggest human presence and infrastructure supporting the area. Overall, the photo captures a tranquil maritime or coastal scenario, highlighting natural beauty and human ingenuity side by side.","title":"Lighthouse reflection","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["546151","547916","550361","544996","550362","542796","543086","549375","551600","547131","550314","547154","545118","550360","543403","547561"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","reinforcement","lantern","pole","maritime","reed","scenario","base","room","array"]}
