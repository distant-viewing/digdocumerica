{"path":"544445.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an intriguing scene featuring a uniquely structured blue and white building, tilted and appearing damaged or maybe partially sunken. This building has an asymmetrical design, featuring various sized windows which include a row of six square windows closer to the roof and a single, possibly octagonal window close to the middle part of the facade.\n\nThis structure is constructed near or on a body of water, as indicated by the water visible in the background and to the side of the building. The setting seems serene with clear skies and tall, leafy trees in the background that reflect on the water surface, enhancing a sense of tranquility.\n\nIn the foreground, there are grass and a wooden platform leading up to the building. On this platform, there's a somewhat worn or soiled \"Welcome\" doormat, suggesting an entrance though itâ€™s interestingly placed given the structure's current precarious angle. Beside the mat lies a crumpled piece of cloth or a small sack.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of abandonment or damage to what might once have been a vibrant and uniquely designed lakeside home or shack. The scene evokes curiosity about the story behind this structure's current state and the contrasting message of the welcoming doormat in such a distraught setting.","title":"Flood-damaged houseboat","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["547038","547040","556999","554788","553479","546871","544698","551111","551330","551115","548180","545137","550129","548044","557640","544820"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["platform","sack","mat","window","shack","cloth","building","damage","curiosity","message"]}
