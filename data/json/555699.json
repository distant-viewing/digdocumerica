{"path":"555699.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque natural scene dominated by a large, cascading waterfall surrounded by dense foliage. The waterfall, which appears to be several stories high, consists of multiple flows that combine into a foamy white cascade over dark, rugged rocks. Lush green trees envelop the sides of the waterfall, emphasizing the waterfall's raw, natural beauty.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is framed by a vibrant array of pink wildflowers, possibly lupines, spread across a meadow. These tall, slender flowers add a splash of color contrasting vividly with the deep greens of the forested background and the white of the rushing water.\n\nThe overall composition is that of a tranquil natural landscape, showcasing the serenity and wild beauty of a wooded area combined with the dynamic movement of the waterfall. The colors and lighting, with the bright greens and pinks set against darker tones of the rocks and the shadows in the forest, create an inviting and refreshing vista.","title":"Waterfall in mineral king valley north of Valdez.
