{"path":"546069.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial railway scene. In the foreground, a dark-colored switch engine labeled \"474\" is prominently positioned, coupled to a series of freight cars, one of which has \"L&N\" insignia. The engine and railcars are stationed on multiple tracks, indicative of an active rail yard.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by a vast industrial complex with numerous tall, slender smokestacks emitting white and gray smoke into the air, suggesting heavy industrial activity. The plant spans the entire width of the photo behind the rail yard. The visual effect is somewhat haze-filled, likely due to the emissions and atmospheric conditions.\n\nSeveral utility poles and street lamps are visible, adding to the infrastructure theme. A small building, possibly an office or control room for the rail yard, is seen on the right side of the image. On the far left, a portion of a parking lot with vintage cars provides a hint of the era, likely mid-20th century. The overall color tone and quality of the image suggest that it could be from the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nThis photograph evokes a strong industrial mood and is representative of the era's heavy reliance on railroads for freight transportation within industrial settings.","title":"Industrial pollution shrouds.
