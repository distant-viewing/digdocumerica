{"path":"548110.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy industrial salvage yard or scrapyard dominated by a large, central crane. The crane, painted in white and mounted on an elevated platform, has a claw-like grabber suspended in the air, holding a large container or metal structure labeled \"NORTHINGTON,\" which appears to be swinging slightly as it's moved.\n\nThe scene is cluttered with a variety of machinery, parts, and debris all around the yard, contributing to a chaotic appearance. Among these are various large cylinders, drums, metallic scraps, and partially dismantled machinery placed haphazardly throughout the area. The background features additional industrial structures, possibly part of the same facility or neighboring factories, with small visible details like pipes, tanks, and other machinery.\n\nThe sky is cloudy, casting a diffused natural light over the scene, which paradoxically adds to the overcast, somewhat grim industrial feeling of the place. No visible human figures are seen, emphasizing the focus on machinery and the industrial environment. The entire composition conveys a sense of ongoing heavy industrial activity, typically involved in the processing and recycling of metallic waste.","title":"Old railroad box cars, auto Bodies and other junk for scrap metal pile up at the American Ship Dismantling Division on the Willamette River.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547610","548324","547621","547625","546253","553012","547611","545544","546267","547777","546256","554318","546255","556323","546260","547054"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["machinery","yard","crane","salvage","claw","neighboring","cylinder","scrapyard","drum","recycling"]}
