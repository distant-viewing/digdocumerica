{"path":"550197.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a cluttered beach scene filled with a large amount of debris. The beach is strewn with wooden planks, branches, and assorted flotsam that have washed ashore, creating a dense layer of litter along the sandy and stony waterline. The tide appears to be coming in, as waves interact with the scattered debris, breaking slightly and generating foam.\n\nThe shoreline stretches into the distance, curving gently to the right. In the background, there are hints of green vegetation and trees, possibly indicative of a beachside park or a natural area. Further in the distance, buildings or industrial structures can be faintly seen through a mist or haze near the horizon, adding a layer of depth to the scene.\n\nThe sky is overcast, with a heavy, gray cloud cover suggesting an imminent or recent rain, which might have contributed to the accumulation of debris. The lighting in the image is relatively dim, due to the cloud cover, giving the entire scene a muted, somber tone. This photograph likely captures environmental concerns, specifically oceanic or costal pollution, highlighting the impact of human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"White City Beach on Lake Erie.
