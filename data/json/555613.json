{"path":"555613.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph shows an old, weathered road in a rural or wilderness setting. The road itself appears unkempt and is dominated by a large pothole near the center of the image. The surface of the road is a mix of gravel and dirt, and shows signs of erosion, particularly around the pothole, where patches of earth have collapsed and broken apart, partly filling the hole. Small plants have begun to grow along the surface of the road, indicating it has possibly been long disused or poorly maintained.\n\nThe surrounding area includes sparse vegetation, with a few small trees visible in the grassy area lining the road. The terrain near the road slopes slightly and is covered in scrub and sporadic greenery, consistent with a dry or semi-arid environment. The sky is brightly lit, suggesting the photograph was taken during a sunny day without visible clouds. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of desolation and neglect, typical of backcountry roads that have fallen out of regular use.","title":"Holes remain after mining machinery probed for coal.
