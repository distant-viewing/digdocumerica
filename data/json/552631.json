{"path":"552631.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and busy livestock auction in an indoor setting, distinguished by its rustic and utilitarian feel. The scene is brightly illuminated, highlighting several distinct areas of activity and creating a lively atmosphere representative of traditional agricultural practices.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of spectators, predominantly wearing cowboy hats, is seated on benches, observing the auction. Their attention is directed towards the main action in the center of the photographâ€”a cattle auction taking place within a fenced area.\n\nWithin the auction ring, there are several individuals: a man in the center guiding a cow, and another man, seemingly an auctioneer, standing at the edge with a microphone, engaging the audience and coordinating the sale. The auctioneer's attire, including a cowboy hat and formal jacket, signifies his authoritative role in the event.\n\nThe background is filled with a myriad of advertising signs that cover the walls, illustrating the local business culture and services related to farming, livestock, and rural needs. These ads promote various entities from banks specializing in livestock banking, truck lines for livestock hauling, to local radio stations and agricultural credit associations. Each sign is visually cluttered yet colorful, adding to the vibrant and somewhat nostalgic appeal of the scene.\n\nAn upper booth overlooks the auction area where more individuals are observing. The people in the booth and the casual attire of the audience indicate a tightly-knit community atmosphere prevalent in rural settings where such auctions are a regular and significant social event.\n\nOverall, the photograph vividly captures a moment filled with community engagement, centered on agricultural commerce, against a backdrop that loudly advertises the interconnectedness of local businesses and the agricultural economy.","title":"Livestock auction held every friday at the Rifle sales-yard","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552666","552664","552665","547328","553104","553271","543779","543686","550671","552677","554886","554880","549073","552662","552569","548959"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["livestock","booth","audience","cowboy","business","farme","entity","fenced","economy","radio"]}
