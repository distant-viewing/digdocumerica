{"path":"551196.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a river valley with various elements. The river, possibly at the center of a mountainous region, flows from the upper left corner to the middle right of the image, surrounded by densely forested hills or mountains. On one side of the river, there's a small town with clustered buildings that are likely residential, given their proximity to each other and organized layout. On the opposite side, there are several large industrial facilities visible. These facilities include large buildings, possibly factories or processing plants, storage tanks, and a smokestack emitting a substantial amount of white smoke, contributing to environmental pollution.\n\nA major road, possibly a highway, runs parallel to the river on the side with the industrial facilities, facilitating access and possibly serving as a transport route for goods and services. The natural scenery combined with industrial activity presents a contrast between environmental beauty and industrial development.\n\nThe photograph portrays a mix of human activity and natural landscape, highlighting interactions between industrial developments and their surroundings. The overall composition of the image shows a balance between these elements, captured from a perspective that emphasizes both the built environment and the natural setting.","title":"Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant at Alloy emits more smoke than any factory in the Kanawha Valley.","placename":"Charleston (W.
