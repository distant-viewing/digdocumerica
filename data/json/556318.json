{"path":"556318.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a person in a dim, shadowy environment that creates a mysterious and intimate ambiance. The individual, likely a man based on the visible profile, is wearing a traditional or ceremonial outfit, including a headpiece adorned with designs and a red-colored decoration resembling a feather or plume on the side. He appears to be seated and is engaged in an activity involving his hands, which are positioned in front of him, suggesting he might be handling an object or performing a task that requires attention.\n\nThe lighting is minimal, with mainly the head and upper body of the person lit, partially illuminating his face and the shiny fabric of his garment. The remainder of the setting is shrouded in darkness, obscuring detailed background elements and contributing to the focus on the central figure.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is contemplative and serene, possibly capturing a moment during a cultural or religious ceremony, given the attire and solemn atmosphere. The composition and use of light emphasize the solitude and significance of the moment being depicted.","title":"Miner bathed in the glow of a co-worker's lamp is shown with a shutter car used for transporting safety men or other small groups.
