{"path":"553287.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant gathering of numerous people in an urban setting, likely during a public event or celebration. The scene is densely packed with spectators who are seated or standing on a street lined with tall buildings. The architecture suggests a mix of older classical and more modern styles, typical of a city center.\n\nThe crowd is diverse, with adults, teenagers, and children, dressed in a range of casual clothing typical of the late 20th century. Many are wearing summer attire, such as T-shirts, shorts, and sun hats, which suggests the event is taking place in warmer weather. Several individuals are holding cameras or are engaged in conversation, indicating a lively and interactive atmosphere.\n\nThe background shows tall buildings that flank the street. Notable among these is a building with a classical facade and a white arch that dominates the mid-ground of the photo. The presence of green trees and what looks to be a park area also suggests that this location might be near a city square or public gathering space.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its perspective of looking down the street, captures the essence of a bustling, urban festivity, focusing on the community spirit and the architectural context. The ambient lighting and shadows suggest that it is either late afternoon or early evening, adding to the atmosphere of the scene.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
