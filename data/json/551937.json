{"path":"551937.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts two elderly women standing next to a car on an urban street. The setting has a vintage feel, likely dating back a few decades based on the style of clothing and the car model. The woman on the left is wearing a white and black polka-dotted dress with a cardigan, white shoes, and glasses; she has her hand partially covering her face, either shielding her eyes from the sun or possibly chuckling. The woman on the right stands more confidently, dressed in a patterned black-and-white outfit with a matching headscarf, sunglasses, large dangling earrings, and white shoes; she has her hands on her hips.\n\nIn the background, there are partially visible signs advertising a cleaners offering services such as 'Formals', 'Gowns', and 'For Better Cleaning, Finish' which suggests they might be standing in front of a dry-cleaning business. The environment captures an essence of a bustling city life with a focus on everyday scenes and personal style.","title":"Elderly ladies watch as grape/lettuce boycotters march.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551817","549678","556711","556176","543036","557039","556730","556715","556726","558253","545231","545350","547191","547190","546855","556742"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["shoe","woman","matching","earring","polka","hip","cardigan","headscarf","hand","decade"]}
