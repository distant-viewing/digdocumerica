{"path":"546356.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two individuals on a small motorboat, placed gently against a backdrop of a serene and expansive body of water. The boat, appearing sleek and white, is slightly tilted to one side, near the shallow edge where the water meets a sandy bank. The focus appears on the foreground, where an aged, gnarly tree with thick trunks and branches draped with Spanish moss leans dramatically over the water, giving a sense of the local flora and adding a slightly mysterious aura to the scene.\n\nIn the boat, there are two people, potentially a man and a woman. The man, piloting the boat, is seated and appears to be engaging with the boat controls, while the woman stands, looking towards the tree. Both individuals are dressed in casual, light-colored summer clothing suitable for a day on the water, reflecting a leisurely activity possibly involving exploration or simple enjoyment of the natural setting.\n\nThe background continues with a view of the broad, tranquil lake bordered by distant trees under a cloud-filled sky, suggesting a calm, overcast day. The overall aesthetic of the image captures a moment of peaceful leisure in a picturesque, natural environment, typical of a recreational outing in a lake or river setting known for its scenic beauty and quiet ambiance.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Field trip to Tom King Bayou biologists will fish for contaminated and non-contaminated female shrimp.
