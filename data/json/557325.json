{"path":"557325.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a snowy landscape with a focus on an architectural structure. In the foreground, there is a large, semi-cylindrical greenhouse covered with clear plastic sheeting, reflecting sunlight. The structure's framework is visible beneath the plastic, indicating a geodesic or hexagonal design. Its right side has a triangular appendage possibly serving as an entrance or additional space.\n\nThe background presents a panoramic view of a mountainous area with vast stretches of snow-covered terrain and dense coniferous forests. There are also scattered snow-capped hills and mountains under a clear blue sky, hinting at a crisp, cold environment. The scene is bathed in ample sunlight, suggesting a bright, sunny day despite the snowy condition.\n\nOn the left side, there is another smaller, dome-like structure that appears to be another type of greenhouse or observational dome. This enhances the overall impression of a remote, environmentally integrated habitat or research facility, designed to withstand and operate within harsh winter conditions.","title":"Solar greenhouse owned and built by Peter Howell, located at about the 8,500 foot level in the Front Range.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557323","556644","546534","546844","555369","556645","557324","555364","554249","550406","555353","554232","543770","554213","543755","554233"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["greenhouse","dome","snow","coniferous","stretch","sunlight","plastic","condition","research","habitat"]}
