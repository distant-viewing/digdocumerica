{"path":"546662.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a snowy, overcast day at a bus stop, depicting a group of people waiting for transportation. In this vivid scene, snow falls heavily, adding a white, misty haze over the atmosphere. There are eight individuals gathered. A mix of men and women, they are dressed in warm attire suitable for cold weather, including coats and hats. Some of them hold umbrellas, one of which is a striking red, standing out brightly against the monotone wintry backdrop. \n\nThe bus stop itself features a simple, sheltered waiting area with a transparent enclosure, which is partially filled with more people seeking refuge from the snow. To the right, a red and white bus is visible, suggestive possibly of its imminent departure or arrival. The ground is wet and reflective, indicating recent or ongoing precipitation. The atmosphere is a blend of mundane daily commute and the serene beauty of a snowy day, suggesting both the discomfort and quiet beauty of winter weather in urban life.","title":"Park and ride metro bus station at Springfield, VA.
