{"path":"557897.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a car inspection or adjustment scenario in a garage or workshop setting. Inside the car, there is a man on the left wearing a white shirt, adjusting or inspecting something on the car's roof, likely a part of the interior. He is leaning into the frame of the car and appears focused on his task.\n\nOutside the car, there are two individuals standing by, both dressed in white shirts and dark pants, suggesting a uniform or a common dress code for this workplace. One man is looking towards the third man, who is facing towards the camera; this third individual is simultaneously adjusting his glasses with one hand. The background beyond them shows a large window with square panels letting in natural light, reinforcing the workshop or garage setting. Evident also in the background are metal shelves or racks that store various items, typical of a workshop environment.\n\nThe mood captured in the photo is one of concentrated work or inspection, suggesting these individuals are professionals possibly involved in automotive work or quality control checks. The style of the car, particularly the sharp edges and design of the interior, suggests a vintage timeline, possibly from the mid-20th century.","title":"City employee inside a motorist's car with a vehicle information sheet in his hand as it travels through an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
