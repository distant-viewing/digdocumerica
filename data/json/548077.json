{"path":"548077.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling river scene with several small boats, both motorized and rowboats, spread out across the water. In the background, there is a substantial waterfall cascading over a rocky ledge, creating a dramatic backdrop to the serene river in the foreground. The water appears calm and the presence of numerous boats suggests a popular spot for fishing or leisure boating. Rocks and islets punctuate the river, contributing to the rugged landscape around the water. The lighting in the image indicates it might be taken during the early evening or late afternoon, as the colors are somewhat softened and the shadows are gentle. The overall setting is one of natural beauty mixed with human activity, illustrating a place where people interact closely with a powerful river environment.","title":"Crown-Zellerbach Corporation and Publisher's Paper Company on the Willamette River at Oregon City have cleaned this stretch of river so effectively that sports fishing thrives side by side with industry. One of their mills is just out of range of this picture.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["551209","550976","551282","557972","548921","551217","548301","551218","551208","551281","551350","551286","550989","548076","549532","550769"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","islet","rowboat","boat","ledge","boating","waterfall","spot","fishing","water"]}
