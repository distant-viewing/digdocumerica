{"path":"545977.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in an overgrown, cluttered outdoor area, suggesting neglect or abandonment. In the foreground, there is an old metal swing set, partially rusted, framing the view like a window to the background. Attached to the swing set is a green bench swing, which leans slightly to one side, showing signs of age and disrepair.\n\nScattered around the swing are various discarded items and debris: a couple of portable chairsâ€”one foldable and made of metal tubes with a green fabric seat and back, and the other, a simple, straight-backed chair lying on its side. There's also a wooden table with two chairs, suggesting it was once an area for sitting and possibly eating. Nearby, fragments of broken furniture and other unidentifiable junk cover the ground.\n\nBehind this immediate area of discarded home items, there is a larger pile of debris, including what appears to be household trash, further emphasizing the sense of abandonment. The background shows a treeline with bare, deciduous trees, indicating it might be late fall or winter. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene and reinforcing the bleakness and sense of desolation.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a stark, somewhat melancholy snapshot of a place once perhaps used for leisure or domestic activities, now left to decay and overrun by nature and refuse.","title":"The backyard of a local bar at Crown Point is littered with solid waste mostly non-returnable bottles.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552102","543165","547024","547988","556324","553551","549307","544809","550253","549786","556491","553870","547473","547477","556640","556313"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["swing","chair","discard","abandonment","treeline","item","eat","household","tube","refuse"]}
