{"path":"544845.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a landscape that appears to be a semi-arid, possibly desert-like environment with red, barren soil and scattered vegetation, mostly low-lying shrubs and bushes. The sky is clear and blue without clouds, suggesting a sunny weather.\n\nCentrally positioned in the frame is a conspicuous maroon-colored sign with white lettering mounted on two metal posts embedded in the ground. The sign reads:\n\n\"WHOA, PODNER!\nIT IS UNLAWFUL TO DIG OR\nDESTROY RUINS. DOZER OP-\nERATORS MUST CALL B.L.M.\nDURANGO 247-4082 THANKS\"\n\nThe peculiar greeting \"WHOA, PODNER!\" uses a colloquial, cowboy-like expression, hinting at a regional, perhaps Western American cultural context. The sign imposes a warning against the destruction of potential archaeological sites or ruins and mandates that bulldozer operators should contact the Bureau of Land Management (B.L.M.) before proceeding with earth-moving operations. The presence of this sign indicates the area might have historical or archaeological significance. The inclusion of a phone number suggests that the area is managed and protected to prevent unauthorized alterations.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the photo, which enhances the focus on the environmental setting and the sign. The natural backdrop and the seriousness of the signâ€™s message contrast with the light-hearted tone of the initial greeting. This blend of humor and sternness in the sign's text adds a unique character to the scene.","title":"Near Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah Junction (Colo.)","location":"Utah Junction, Colorado","nn1":["545620","543637","549129","545624","545824","543641","545746","545591","545109","555858","544245","545617","548845","557546","546386","549001"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","ruin","maroon","seriousness","operator","phone","inclusion","alteration","warning","cowboy"]}
