{"path":"549023.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large, scattered collection of junked vehicles and debris. It appears to be a junkyard or a similar waste disposal site, sprawled out over a dusty, barren landscape. The vehicles, which range widely in color, type, and degree of disrepair, are randomly distributed but somewhat loosely cluster into several groups over the terrain. Near the center of the image, a dirt road curves around a large pile of junk that includes not only automotive parts but also possibly other kinds of metallic waste.\n\nThe colors of the vehicles include shades of blue, red, white, green, and rust, showing various signs of deterioration and exposure to the elements. The landscape itself does not show signs of vegetation; it is primarily dusty and rocky, typical of waste disposal spaces that are not regularly maintained. The scene evokes a sense of abandonment and points towards environmental issues associated with vehicle disposal and waste management. There is no visible human activity in the photograph, emphasizing the desolation and purely functional nature of the site.","title":"Auto dump at Henderson","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["542590","552999","553006","545365","546268","553004","542656","545010","545340","543166","553009","547476","554335","545303","546249","553005"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["disposal","waste","vehicle","junkyard","deterioration","site","degree","distribute","sprawl","kind"]}
