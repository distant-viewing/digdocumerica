{"path":"555009.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph focuses on a close-up view of what appears to be a rough-textured surface, which might be a wall or a tree trunk, given its grained and somewhat weathered appearance. Predominantly, the image captures intriguing shadow patterns cast upon this surface. The shadows look like silhouettes of two people engaged in an activityâ€”possibly children playing. One shadow shows a figure with what seems to be outstretched arms, possibly in a gesture of openness or play, while the other figure appears to be interacting with the first, potentially also in a playful stance.\n\nThe lighting that creates these shadows is directional and strong, highlighting the texture of the surface while casting crisp, defined shadows. The background is wholly dark, focusing all attention on the interplay of light and shadow on the textured surface. The overall composition relies heavily on the contrast between the rough texture of the surface and the smooth outline of the shadows, creating a dynamic and somewhat mysterious scene. This use of light and shadow might be suggesting themes of presence and absence, or reality versus illusion.","title":"Closeup of an alder trunk shadowed by western sword/fern on green mountain in Kitsap County, Washington.
