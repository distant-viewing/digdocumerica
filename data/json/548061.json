{"path":"548061.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and scenic river landscape dominated by rushing waters and industrial surroundings. The river, possibly swollen with the turbulent flow of a waterfall, occupies the forefront of the image, swirling and foaming as it moves through the scene. It appears to be a sunny, clear day with a blue sky above, enhancing the vividness of the water's white froth against the darker waters and rocky riverbed.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a mix of industrial buildings and some natural foliage. The buildings vary in architectural style and function, visible by their differing sizes, designs, and signage that includes commercial advertisements. Some notable features on the buildings include flat roofs and rectangular structures, which hint at a commercial or light industrial area. There also appears to be construction or industrial activity nearby, evidenced by the presence of a crane.\n\nThe overall setting of the photograph suggests an intersection between natural waterways and urban development, possibly on the outskirts of a town or within an industrial sector. The river, while beautiful and vigorous, contrasts with the man-made environment in the background, creating a juxtaposition of natural beauty and industrial pragmatism.","title":"The spokane river with city in background","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553392","547238","550673","553389","548091","549514","550647","553380","549515","553354","547242","553349","550710","550658","548097","551519"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["rushe","differing","river","riverb","froth","sector","outskirt","waterfall","swirl","vividness"]}
