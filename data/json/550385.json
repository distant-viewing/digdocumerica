{"path":"550385.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a single caribou walking across a landscape that suggests a semi-wild, possibly grassy area, typical of tundra or alpine regions. The caribou is in motion, depicted at a moment when all four legs are in contact with the ground, suggesting a calm, steady pace. It features a large, impressive set of antlers that branch out widely, indicating that it is likely a male and possibly in the rutting season when such antlers are fully developed.\n\nThe animal's fur appears thick and predominantly greyish, with patches of white, notably around its mane and the rear. The texture of the fur suggests the photograph might have been taken in conditions that are not overly warm, fitting for species accustomed to colder climates.\n\nThe background is blurred, drawing focus to the caribou, but it includes green, grassy patches that hint at either a spring or summer season in a high-latitude area. Very faintly, the background may show hints of a water body or an open, flat field, contributing to a tranquil yet wild natural setting. The overcast lighting in the image adds to the serene and slightly somber tone of the setting.","title":"Bull caribou near the start of the Alaska pipeline route","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550377","550384","550379","550380","550381","550386","550485","546163","552697","544571","554621","550378","558368","546159","544916","545902"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["antler","fur","season","tundra","mane","pace","contact","hint","rear","specie"]}
