{"path":"551677.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene in a park, distinguished by a large expanse of grassy area and several people engaged in a leisure activity. In the foreground, there's a white table set up with numerous patches of fabric spread out. Several children, predominantly young girls, are seated along one side of the table. They appear engaged in a crafts activity, possibly sewing or decorating the fabric pieces. Each child is busily working on her respective piece, focusing intently on the task at hand.\n\nTo the left of the frame stands a man who seems to be overseeing the activity. He is dressed in a patterned short-sleeve shirt and trousers, indicative of a casual setting. His posture, with hands possibly in pockets and his attention directed towards the children, suggests he is either supervising or simply observing the craft activity.\n\nOn the far side of the table, there appears to be a woman assisting or participating in the activity with the children. She, along with the seated children, contributes to a lively, communal atmosphere. \n\nThe background showcases an expansive grassy field dotted with more people, some of whom are indistinctly engaging in various recreational activities. In the far distance, urban architecture is visible, including a couple of prominent high-rise buildings that suggest this park might be near a city center or within an urban environment. The slightly overcast sky suggests a soft, diffused lighting over the scene, enhancing the relaxed, communal feel of the activities depicted.","title":"Midsummer evening quilting in central park, sponsored by the New York parks administration department of cultural affairs materials were provided free, and people of all ages took part in the fun","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551676","551719","555947","552033","552036","551688","553065","551017","547756","556296","551011","557410","554072","551736","550074","556522"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","table","craft","fabric","activity","supervise","piece","pocket","distinguish","oversee"]}
