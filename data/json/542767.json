{"path":"542767.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene featuring a young child standing near a large conifer. The child, positioned on the left side of the image and facing away from the camera, is dressed in rugged outdoor attire including a light-colored hat, gray jacket, and brown pants. The child is also carrying a small backpack.\n\nThe forest around the child is dense with tall, sturdy trees, primarily conifers, exhibiting deep green needles. The soil is covered with a thick blanket of pine needles and small branches, suggesting a natural and minimally disturbed setting. Beyond the child, the forest extends into the distance with numerous trees both standing and some fallen.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of exploration and wonder within a tranquil natural environment. The overcast or cloudy sky results in a diffuse lighting that softens the scene, enhancing the mood of quiet solitude and forest expanse.","title":"D.
