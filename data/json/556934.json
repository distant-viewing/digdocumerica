{"path":"556934.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph capturing a landscape predominantly covered in dense, lush green forests. A highway cuts through the scene, curving gently and flanked on both sides by thick trees. The highway is multi-lane, suggesting a major transportation route, and a few cars can be seen traveling along it. \n\nIn the distance, beyond the highway, there are patches of cleared land, some appearing to be used for industrial or commercial purposes given the presence of large, flat buildings and open spaces that might serve as parking lots or storage areas.\n\nThe photo is slightly overcast, with soft sunlight filtering through the clouds, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of the forest canopy. In the background, the horizon fades into a misty, bluish-gray due to the atmospheric perspective, giving the scene a somewhat mysterious and vast appearance.\n\nThe overall impression is of a region where natural landscapes are interspersed with human development, particularly transportation and possibly industrial facilities. The image provides a sense of the scale and impact of human infrastructure within natural environments.","title":"Aerial view looking northeast at the Navy's Bangor Annex railroad switching yard. The clearing in the upper left background is the proposed site of the Trident submarine administration buildings. Extensive construction will take several years before the Navy finishes work on the new base. Humans and animals now living in the area will be affected by the expected population growth.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["546733","550613","556938","556935","556933","546603","550600","550567","546587","546714","556904","556918","546721","556970","550575","556996"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["highway","transportation","forest","cut","route","lane","lot","gray","canopy","parking"]}
