{"path":"551364.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of a school of fish swimming in water. The fish, which vary slightly in size and appear slender in shape, are captured from above the water surface. The water is relatively clear, allowing for a detailed view of the fish and the sandy or pebbly bottom beneath them. The lighting in the photograph is natural, producing a somewhat dark and moody ambiance but still clearly illuminating the fish and the textures of the water. The ripples on the surface of the water create a dynamic, textured look, making areas of the image appear in motion. The overall composition of the photograph focuses primarily on the congregation of fish, giving a sense of their movement and behavior in their natural habitat.","title":"Rainbow trout swim in a pool at Troutdale Ranch Hatchery located at Gravois Mills.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["548142","553877","553878","543315","548713","555556","542892","543567","548718","557496","546792","548677","543189","547704","545169","546784"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","congregation","behavior","water","school","produce","swim","habitat","surface","allow"]}
