{"path":"554066.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene with two surfers riding waves in a dark blue ocean. The image is taken from a substantial distance or height, giving an aerial or long-range perspective. The two surfers are positioned on their surfboards, with one surfer slightly ahead of the other. \n\nThe surfer in the foreground is riding a breaking wave and appears to be in a crouched stance, expertly managing their balance as they navigate the turbulent water. The second surfer, in the background, is also managing a wave, seen in a more upright stance, suggesting movement and control in their surfing.\n\nThe water around them is vibrant and foamy, indicating strong wave activity, adding a sense of energy and motion to the scene. The expansive ocean around them is darker, contrasting with the white of the surf, emphasizing the isolation and size of the water body in which they are surfing.\n\nThe background offers no distinguishing features, just the vastness of the ocean, which fades into a uniform dark blue toward the edges of the image, focusing viewer attention entirely on the surfers and their interaction with nature. The lighting seems natural, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the deep blue tone of the ocean.","title":"Surfing at Maui County's Hookipa Park","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["543393","544964","557424","543073","554065","543138","543397","553690","547609","557481","543876","543251","554002","553687","552354","545086"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","wave","stance","surfboard","surf","balance","white","energy","control","height"]}
