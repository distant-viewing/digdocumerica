{"path":"547765.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a bustling urban area, possibly taken from a helicopter judging from the visible edge of the helicopter's window in the bottom right corner. The dominant feature of the image is a complex network of large highways crisscrossing in the foreground, a typical scene of urban infrastructure designed to manage high volumes of traffic. These highways are busy with numerous vehicles, indicating a time of active traffic flow.\n\nIn the background, the city's skyline is prominently visible with various high-rise buildings that suggest a dense downtown region. These buildings vary in height and architectural styles, which is characteristic of many major cities, mixing modern high rises with possibly older, shorter structures. The cityscape stretches to the horizon, giving a sense of the city's extensive size.\n\nThe topography is relatively flat, and the urban layout spreads extensively around the central business district (the area with the high-rises). Small patches of greenery can be observed, which could be parks or trees aligned along the streets, adding a bit of natural elements to the urban environment.\n\nIn addition to the built environment, the clear sky suggests a bright, sunny day which enhances the visibility of the city layout. The image provides a comprehensive visual summary of an urban center, illustrating key urban planning and transportation elements.","title":"Expressways of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553001","553016","547764","547755","549476","546617","553838","555743","549478","546574","546707","546678","553559","555781","553015","548392"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["helicopter","city","highway","layout","rise","traffic","judging","addition","volume","downtown"]}
