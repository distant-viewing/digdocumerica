{"path":"549922.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and intimate moment in a grassy urban park. In the foreground, there are two people sitting closely on the grass. They are engaged in a caring embrace, suggesting a moment of affection or a deep conversation. The person on the left is wearing a dress with a polka-dot pattern, while the person on the right is dressed in a horizontally striped shirt.\n\nThe background reveals a park setting characterized by lush green grass and scattered shade trees. A traditional wrought iron fence and distant pedestrians create an atmosphere of a bustling park life. Behind the fence, the blurred outlines of people and urban structures suggest the park is located in a city.\n\nThe lighting in the picture, which seems natural and soft, highlights the subjects and the grassy environment, emphasizing a peaceful day outdoors. A small red object, possibly a bag or clothing, lies next to them on the grass, adding a splash of color to the predominantly green and blue scene. The overall mood is tranquil and private, a snapshot of life in an urban green space.","title":"In Battery Park, on the lower tip of Manhattan Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553065","551682","549755","551027","548467","548267","549911","555947","558182","554900","558187","551017","557935","549324","550051","547072"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["park","grass","affection","fence","embrace","iron","person","care","splash","pedestrian"]}
