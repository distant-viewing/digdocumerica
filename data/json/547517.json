{"path":"547517.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a wetland area heavily polluted with discarded tires and other debris. The scene is set outdoors with a body of stagnant, murky water densely filled with various sizes and types of old tires. Some tires are submerged in water, while others are partially or completely visible above the water's surface. Amidst the tires, there are clumps of tall grass and dried reeds, suggesting a neglected or unmanaged natural environment.\n\nIn the background, there are more tall grasses or reeds growing densely, blotting out any view of the horizon and deepening the sense of an undisturbed yet contaminated wetland ecosystem. The sky above appears clear and possibly suggests that it is a sunny day, which contrasts with the polluted state of the landscape.\n\nThe photograph serves to highlight environmental issues such as water pollution and improper waste disposal, emphasizing the impact of human actions on natural habitats. The overall tone is somber and may provoke thoughts on ecological conservation and the need for enhanced environmental stewardship.","title":"Middletown dump spills over into Salt Marsh Creek","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547521","546878","546838","547520","551440","547846","543559","546913","557973","551441","547590","550812","547524","547907","550352","555851"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","reed","wetland","provoke","clump","disposal","need","conservation","grass","grow"]}
