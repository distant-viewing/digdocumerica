{"path":"552285.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph shows a large crab perched on a damaged wire mesh, likely part of a fishing net or trap. The crab has a robust, round carapace that is predominantly dark with a purplish hue and sprinkled with lighter speckles. Its body exhibits striking colors, particularly the reddish and yellow hues on its robust claws. The legs, articulated and spiny, match in color and have a reddish tint towards their ends.\n\nThe mesh itself is coarse and appears broken in multiple spots, suggesting it might have seen considerable use or endured rough conditions. The background is blurred with hues of blue, likely indicating that the photograph was taken near or over water, which is consistent with the crab's natural habitat.\n\nThe focus of the picture is on the crab with a decent amount of detail visible, including the textures on its shell and the fine structures on its limbs. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the natural, vibrant lifeform and the worn, man-made object.","title":"Small Dungeness crab netted on a tide flat near Brinnon on the Hood Canal.
