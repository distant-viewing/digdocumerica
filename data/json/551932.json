{"path":"551932.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph features a large, doll-like figurine of a hockey player, prominently positioned in the foreground. The figure is colorfully painted, wearing a red hockey jersey with black and white stripes around the sleeves and waist. The jersey is adorned with a logo on the chest. The face of the figurine is human-like, with detailed facial features such as large eyes and eyebrows, and it displays a facial expression that seems somewhat exaggerated, almost comical.\n\nThe hockey player figurine is also wearing black hockey pants, secured with a traditional hockey belt, and white skates. One hand is extended toward the viewer, suggesting a gesture of reaching out. The figurine is mounted on a four-wheeled base labeled with the words \"HOCKEY PLAYER\" in yellow letters.\n\nIn the background, an urban setting is visible, possibly a city plaza or a wide sidewalk adjacent to a street. There are a few people, seated and engaged in various activities. There is also a street visible with some cars and a multi-story parking garage in the backdrop. The overall environment suggests an outdoor public area, possibly in a downtown setting, and the scene likely captures a moment during a public display or event involving this oversized figurine.","title":"Preparing a float for the Lakefront Festival parade.
