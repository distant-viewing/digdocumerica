{"path":"554804.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive view of a rugged landscape, likely a large-scale excavation site or mining operation. The area is characterized by numerous large mounds of earth and deep pits, suggesting extensive digging and earth-moving activities. The textures and colors of the exposed soil vary, indicating different layers and types of earth material.\n\nThe environment shows scant vegetation; small trees and bushes appear along the foreground and edges, but they are sparse and seem somewhat dwarfed by the scale of the earthworks. This suggests that the area is either naturally barren or has been cleared for mining purposes.\n\nThe sky is clear, showing no signs of pollution or cloud cover, and it is either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the soft lighting and long shadows cast across the mounds, which emphasize the unevenness and depth of the terrain.\n\nThere are no visible machines or human activity in the immediate view, which gives the landscape a deserted, almost eerie appearance. The background features a flat horizon line that could suggest this area is part of a larger, flat geographic region. The overall composition and the play of light and shadow create a dramatic and almost otherworldly scene focused on the impacts of industrial activity on the natural environment.","title":"Although this land was stripped twenty years ago, the scars remain, off Route 9.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["552422","554815","549170","544418","552004","550574","555610","554817","545533","545529","554768","552420","545534","554769","555622","544139"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["earth","mound","mining","digging","pit","scale","excavation","machine","cover","play"]}
