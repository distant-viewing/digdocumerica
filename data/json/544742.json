{"path":"544742.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up portrait of a young woman outdoors. She is lying down and resting her chin on her crossed arms, possibly over a blue fabric or cushion. The woman has light brown, shoulder-length curly hair and is looking directly at the camera with a playful, subtle smile. Her expression conveys a relaxed and casual mood.\n\nShe is wearing a white tank top, and her skin is softly illuminated by natural light, suggesting the photo may have been taken on a sunny day. The background is blurred, but it features shades of green and hints of darker areas, likely indicating foliage or trees, common in an outdoor, possibly wooded setting.\n\nOverall, the image has a warm and inviting tone, with a focus on the woman's gentle facial expression and the informal, comfortable setting. Her gaze and the soft focus on her surroundings lend the image a personal and intimate atmosphere.","title":"Alaua james, 15, of the Alta youth conservation corps","placename":"Alta (Utah)","location":"Alta, Utah","nn1":["556412","553499","553156","544747","554923","556143","556414","550048","557114","549983","552961","543835","553509","543864","551448","556139"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","cushion","chin","portrait","expression","skin","fabric","outdoor","woode","shoulder"]}
