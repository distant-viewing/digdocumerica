{"path":"550599.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic aerial view of a mountainous landscape. At the forefront, a large, deep blue lake curves around the frame, hugging a winding road that traces its shoreline. Beyond the lake and road, the terrain sprawls into a broad, flat valley rich with greenery and multiple winding stream paths, which suggest an active flow of water through the valley floor. \n\nThe valley is flanked by rugged mountains, some of whose peaks are obscured by low-hanging clouds. The mountains appear steep and are partly covered with snow and ice, indicating a cooler climate or high altitude. The snow-capped peaks and glaciers feeding into the valley imply that this might be a glacial region. The colors in the image are muted, suggesting either overcast weather conditions or the photograph being taken either early in the morning or later in the evening, which casts long shadows and a diffused light across the scene.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the majesty and isolation of this wilderness area, likely untouched by significant human activity, save for the road that cuts through the scene. The photograph captures the serene and rugged beauty typical of remote, mountainous regions.","title":"View north toward Gulkana Glacier, headwaters of Phelan Creek, and Isabel Pass, from a point above Summit Lake.
