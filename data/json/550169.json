{"path":"550169.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of an industrial complex with multiple large smokestacks emitting thick plumes of white and gray smoke. The sky above is partially obscured by this smoke, which blends into the clouds, creating a somewhat ominous effect. The stacks are dark, silhouetted against the lighter sky. An American flag is visible on the right side of the image, attached to a pole on the ground amidst the smokestacks. The overall atmosphere of the image is heavy and intense, emphasized by the dark colors and the significant environmental impact suggested by the smoke emissions. The image likely conveys themes related to pollution, environmental concerns, or industrialization.","title":"Smoking chimneys of Ford foundry in Brook Park, just outside Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550184","545435","545491","550981","553841","550871","550938","550875","550983","550176","548376","557218","550716","545468","546808","550172"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","smokestack","industrialization","emission","concern","flag","plume","complex","stack","attach"]}
