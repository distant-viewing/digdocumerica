{"path":"548652.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an ornate structure, likely part of a building's architecture. The primary focus is on a beautifully detailed section of the roof and columns of what appears to be a classical or Victorian-style construction.\n\nThe image highlights intricate architectural details including:\n- A roof section topped with a sharply pointed, triangular pediment that is trimmed with what appears to be metal sheeting, painted white.\n- Below the rooftop, there is a decorative cornice with a series of rounded, bulbous ornaments, which seem to dangle like charms; this adds a textured, three-dimensional aspect to the design.\n- Further down, the structure showcases an elegant, pierced fretwork or lattice under the eaves, featuring a repeating circular and crisscross pattern, which provides both visual interest and ventilation.\n- Supporting the roof and decorative elements are robust, fluted columns or pilasters, which also feature white paint. These columns reinforce the elegant traditional aesthetic.\n\nThe background suggests a clear, sunny day with a hint of power lines visible, indicating an urban setting, although the focus remains tight on the architectural details without broad contextual clues about its surroundings.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a segment of a structure that emphasizes classic design and fine craftsmanship, suggesting an appreciation for architectural beauty and historical styles.","title":"Detail of one of the old Bahama style houses of Key West, the intricate carving is characteristic of this kind of architecture.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["557074","548650","557066","548651","557073","548657","557064","555949","548649","548658","555305","557093","558117","548653","555579","557067"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["column","roof","eave","ornament","pediment","cornice","dangle","pierce","repeat","ventilation"]}
