{"path":"545572.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural arch, likely situated in a national park or rocky terrain. The arch is massive and rugged, with textured surfaces that appear smooth and curved on some sides, and rough with vertical streaks on others. Its rich, warm red and brown tones suggest it is likely formed from sandstone, a common material for such formations.\n\nUnder the arch, a person can be seen in the middle distance, providing a sense of scale to the otherwise monumental landscape. The person appears tiny compared to the massive arch and is positioned on what looks like a natural rock ledge or pathway. Their presence emphasizes the grandeur and size of the natural formation.\n\nThe sky in the background looks slightly overcast with soft, diffused light illuminating the scene. This lighting enhances the natural red and ochre shades of the rock, adding a dramatic effect to the overall composition. Thereâ€™s a sense of isolation and tranquility, typical of remote natural settings, further highlighted by the absence of any modern elements in the scene. The focus is purely on the interaction between the human figure and the awe-inspiring natural architecture around them.","title":"Double O Arch is at the end of the Devil's Garden Trail.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545555","544935","544939","553077","545563","545568","545580","545566","545554","545551","545573","545585","545116","545584","545550","545582"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["arch","formation","sandstone","inspire","awe","ledge","rock","streak","person","absence"]}
