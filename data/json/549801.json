{"path":"549801.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a waste disposal facility, where garbage is being transported and deposited. The setting is an extensive, open area with a body of water running through it, likely a man-made channel specifically for waste management purposes.\n\nIn the foreground and extending towards the middle ground of the image, there are large, flat barges loaded with heaps of trash. These barges appear to be linked in a row and are parked along the edge of the waterway. The heaps of waste on these barges are varied, including items like plastic bags, boxes, household waste, and other miscellaneous debris.\n\nAdditionally, floating in the water, there is visible scattered trash ranging from small pieces of plastic to larger debris, which indicates the degree of pollution in the water.\n\nThe far background shows a flat, barren landscape with minimal vegetation. A bridge is visible crossing the channel, and beyond, the terrain remains flat and featureless under a clear blue sky. This suggests that the area might be on the outskirts of a city or in a designated industrial zone. The overall scene underscores the environmental issues related to waste management and disposal.","title":"Garbage scows from Manhattan wait to be unloaded at the Staten Island landfill.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549808","548315","549936","549799","549817","549780","550248","546246","549818","550801","549816","548366","546235","549750","548210","546761"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","barge","disposal","heap","channel","plastic","trash","management","degree","designate"]}
