{"path":"552617.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of seven middle-aged men engaged in a discussion around a large table covered with architectural blueprints or plans. The room appears to be a simple meeting hall with a wooden panel wall on one side and white walls on the remainder. The room is lit by overhead fluorescent lighting, contributing to a slightly shadowed, yellow-tinged atmosphere.\n\nThe men are dressed in casual and semi-formal attire typical of a professional environment from the 1970s, indicated by styles such as short-sleeved shirts, and glasses with larger frames. Their expressions and postures suggest a focused, serious discussion, with some leaning in to view the documents more closely, while others hold their chins or sit back to gather their thoughts. \n\nOn the far end of the table, there's a chair partially visible, and the background shows an additional room or hallway, suggesting the setting is quite spacious. Overall, the image conveys a sense of professional collaboration, likely in an architectural, engineering, or construction context.","title":"The coordinating committee representing community and governmental groups meets at city hall to consider proposed routes for I-70 in the Rifle area.
