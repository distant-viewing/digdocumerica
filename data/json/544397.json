{"path":"544397.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive desert landscape dominated by striking geological formations. In the foreground, a tall, layered rock formation presents a rugged and eroded appearance, with horizontal stripes varying in shades of red and orange, showcasing sedimentation patterns. The rock's structure arches inward, creating a natural alcove or window through which another distinctive rock formation is visible. This distant formation consists of two smaller structures resembling short, stout columns with flat tops, often referred to as \"hoodoos.\"\n\nThe composition of the photo allows for a view through the arch of the foreground formation to these hoodoos, effectively framing this unique desert scenery within the natural window. The ground around and between these formations is barren and covered with cracked, reddened earth, indicating arid conditions. The sky above is partly cloudy but bright, suggesting a sunny day with scattered cloud cover.\n\nOverall, the scene evokes a sense of isolation and the raw beauty typical of arid, desert environments, possibly capturing a moment in a region like the American Southwest, renowned for such spectacular geological features.","title":"Balancing rocks","placename":"Tuba City (Ariz.)","location":"Tuba City, Arizona","nn1":["545791","545789","545804","545803","544401","545696","545797","544429","544745","545754","544376","545799","545771","544950","545550","545748"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","desert","arch","rock","window","stripe","cover","column","scenery","red"]}
