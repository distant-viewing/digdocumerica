{"path":"550794.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a cluster of flowers, specifically displaying distinct details of their structures and colors. These flowers have a rich maroon or burgundy color and are composed of many small, star-shaped florets. The cluster is dense and appears fluffy or feathery due to the numerous filaments of each floret.\n\nThe stems holding the clusters are also visible, showing a similar burgundy color that intensifies to darker shades near the flowers themselves. The background is softly blurred, featuring hints of green from surrounding foliage, which suggests that these flowers are located in a garden or natural setting. The overall image is rich in detail, focusing on the texture and natural beauty of the plant, with a shallow depth of field that enhances the focus on the flowers while gently softening the background.","title":"Wild flowers","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542970","555024","545695","553366","547613","554595","554587","554843","558075","543596","545708","547815","557167","545707","554576","554744"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","cluster","maroon","star","detail","garden","color","green","foliage","hint"]}
