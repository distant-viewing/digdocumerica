{"path":"554180.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This vintage photograph captures a street scene likely from the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the style of the cars and fashion. In the foreground, two young men are sitting on a bench. The man on the left wears a red and black plaid shirt and blue shorts with black sandals, while the man on the right sports a white sleeveless shirt with dark shorts. Both appear relaxed and are engaged in conversation.\n\nThe background features a busy street lined with shops and signs. There's a variety of signage, including those advertising Dells Boat Tours, soft serve ice cream, and other tourist attractions. The architecture has a distinctly mid-20th century American style, with low-rise buildings and visible brickwork. \n\nVehicles from the period, including sedans that look typical of the 1970s American automotive design, are parked and in motion along the street. The scene also includes a randomly placed green trash can near the bench where the men are sitting, which adds a touch of everyday urban life.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a glimpse into a lively commercial strip on a sunny day, populated by pedestrians and adorned with signs aimed at attracting tourists. It captures a sense of time and place with its period-specific elements.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554178","556218","548452","556764","556214","543471","546770","556221","554173","556222","545327","549909","551124","551742","553183","554852"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["tourist","bench","street","period","short","sandal","brickwork","man","attraction","advertising"]}
