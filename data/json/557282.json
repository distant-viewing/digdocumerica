{"path":"557282.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene focused on a large, dynamic water fountain located within a city park. The fountain is vigorously spraying water upwards, creating a mist around it. In the foreground, a relatively calm body of water stretches across the frame, upon which a small speedboat with two visible figures is moving left to right, highlighting a sense of motion.\n\nBehind the fountain, a lush area with neatly trimmed grass and autumnal trees can be seen. This area serves as a recreational space, as a few individuals are visible enjoying the park setting. The backdrop is dominated by two large office buildings, featuring facade designs typical of mid-20th-century architectureâ€”rectangular and densely windowed, reflecting the vertical emphasis of urban design.\n\nThe composition uses the fountain as a central focal point, framed by nature (water and trees) in the foreground and human-made structures (buildings) in the backdrop, emphasizing a contrast yet coexistence between natural elements and urban development. The scene is imbued with a quiet yet vibrant city life atmosphere, typical of a sunny, clear day.","title":"New foundation on the point at Gateway Center. It is part of a continuing beautification program. This area was part of the original urban renewal renaissance program in the early 1950's. At that time beautification was begun with park-like settings of various kinds of plantings, sculpture, and pools to give a sense of human dimension and complement the towering office buildings.","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550747","551772","551663","551647","550752","551661","547784","557268","552726","552705","551449","553224","551855","553289","550762","557258"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","speedboat","park","city","coexistence","water","design","emphasis","office","mist"]}
