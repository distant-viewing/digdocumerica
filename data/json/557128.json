{"path":"557128.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a friendly moment between two men standing in what appears to be an outdoor flea market or garage sale setting. The man on the left is grinning widely and looking towards the man on the right, who is seen from behind and wearing a mustard yellow T-shirt. The jovial expression and open posture of the man on the left suggest a moment of amusement or shared laughter.\n\nThey are surrounded by various items that hint at the nature of their environment, likely a casual sale or outdoor market. Directly in front of the men is a table covered with a colorful striped cloth, on which several decorative items are displayed, including what look like green ceramic cats and a small white statue.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured by the men and the items on the table, is a yellow station wagon with a \"POLICE\" sign visible through the windshield and decorative lights mounted on top, adding a quirky or whimsical element to the scene.\n\nThe overall ambiance is relaxed and cheerful, characterized by bright sunlight and casual attire, suggesting a warm, friendly atmosphere typical of a community gathering or local outdoor market.","title":"Flea market at White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in the northeast corner of the state.
