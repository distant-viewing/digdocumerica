{"path":"547958.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene on a clear day. In the foreground, a body of water is visible, calm with little reflection. An aging wooden pier extends partway into this water, supporting various industrial equipment and a small structure that looks to be used for operational purposes in the waterway. Some green pipes also lie horizontally along the pier, slightly rusted and weather-worn, indicating regular use and exposure to elements.\n\nIn the background, a rocky shoreline with some vegetation helps to demarcate the boundary between the water and the industrial area. Across this shoreline, large storage tanks dominate the scene. These tanks are uniform, large, cylindrical structures commonly used for storing oil, gas, or chemicals. They are painted in a light grey color, slightly dulled likely due to exposure. The area appears organized and functional with no visible activity or personnel, suggesting a photograph taken during a quiet period or from a distance that limits the visible detail of human activity.\n\nFurther beyond the storage tanks, there are some additional industrial structures and possibly other facilities that hint at a larger industrial complex. There is a clear sky above, which casts natural light across the scene, enhancing the visibility of the industrial details. The entire setting is indicative of a waterfront industrial area, possibly linked to the energy sector or manufacturing, emphasizing functionality and utility.","title":"Oil and fuel tanks adjacent to the John F.
