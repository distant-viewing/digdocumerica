{"path":"553067.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a missile launch captured during the night or twilight. The image is dominated by a dark sky, with a light gradient near the horizon suggesting sunset or sunrise ambience. The missile, visible as a bright, thin streak of light, arcs gracefully upward from the bottom central part of the frame towards the upper left direction, signifying its trajectory.\n\nThe foreground is mostly silhouetted, showing the dark outlines of rolling hills which form a shallow, sweeping valley. The horizon is illuminated just behind these hills, providing a faint light that subtly highlights their contours.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or people; the entire scene is tranquil yet dynamic due to the missile's motion. The overall feel is serene and somewhat isolated, focusing purely on the technological spectacle against the natural landscape. The composition utilizes the contrast between the dark landscape and the bright missile trail to draw the viewer's eye along the path of the launch.","title":"Contrail at dusk. Searchlight, Nevada.
