{"path":"551595.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a professional environment where a man is interacting with an elaborate piece of scientific equipment. The man, appearing middle-aged with dark hair and wearing a pink short-sleeve shirt, is focused on adjusting controls on a panel. In the foreground, he is seated and turning a knob on a control panel that has various switches and display screens.\n\nThe centerpiece of the image is a large, cylindrical apparatus, mounted vertically on a sturdy base with several bolts and flanges visible. This machine likely serves an industrial or research purpose, given its complexity and robust build. The equipment is made of metallic materials and features various gauges and pipes attached to its surface.\n\nThe background is relatively plain, consisting of pastel tiles on the wall and a ceiling with visible air vents, suggesting an indoor laboratory or factory setting. To the right of the scientist, on the workbench, there are papers and possibly manuals or logbooks, indicating ongoing work or experiments. The lighting in the room is bright, enhancing the visibility and focus on the work process.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes work, technology, and concentration, typical of a research or industrial environment focused on precision and technical processes.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory: Operating the electron microscope","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["551594","542765","553329","542664","549378","549364","549627","556557","546284","549607","542666","546327","555265","549684","542668","547720"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["research","panel","control","work","centerpiece","bolt","switch","knob","screen","process"]}
