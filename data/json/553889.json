{"path":"553889.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Brill, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly woman and a young man examining a green lawn mower in a grassy yard. The woman, dressed in traditional attire including a headscarf, sweater, and skirt, leans over the lawn mower with a curious expression. The young man, wearing a casual striped shirt and jeans, bends slightly as he appears to explain something about the lawn mower. Both individuals are focused intently on the lawn mower, which is old and appears to be the focal point of their discussion.\n\nIn the background, a large house with white siding and a porch is partially visible. This suggests the setting might be a residential area. Trees and a clear blue sky contribute to the peaceful suburban atmosphere. The lighting indicates that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, enhancing the colors and details of the scene. Overall, the image captures a moment of interaction and learning between the two individuals, emphasizing a sense of community or family assistance.","title":"Trying to hear.
