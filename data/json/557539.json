{"path":"557539.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of two symmetrical leaves positioned against a dark, blurred background. The leaves display a rich, green color with a complex, detailed network of yellowish-white veins that are prominent against the leaf's darker green surface. The leaves are elongated with a somewhat pointed shape at the tip, and their surface appears slightly textured, suggesting they are sturdy or tough in nature. The orientation and lighting emphasize the intricate vein structure, making it a focal point of the image. The background is uniformly dark, which contrasts sharply with the brightness of the leaves, highlighting their detailed vein patterns and lush coloration.","title":"Leaves of plantlife in the Malibu canyon area of the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.  The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county, but are threatened by development.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure.
