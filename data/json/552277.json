{"path":"552277.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset over a body of water. The sun, positioned slightly above the center, is partially obscured by cumulus clouds, casting rays of light that penetrate the cloud cover and illuminate the scene. The sky features varying tones of dark blue and black, mingled with the golden hues of the sun's light.\n\nBelow the sky, the water reflects the sunlight with an array of shimmering golden highlights. The surface of the water appears slightly choppy, indicating some wind or current, and these conditions create textured patterns on the water's surface.\n\nThe distant horizon is lined with a silhouette of a forested shoreline. The trees are dark and barely distinguishable against the shadowy backdrop, further emphasizing the sunset's glow in the sky and its reflection in the water. The entire scene is enveloped in a tranquil yet somewhat somber atmosphere, typical of late dusk. This composition offers a sense of calm and the natural beauty of an undisturbed wilderness at sunset.","title":"Puget Sound at sunset, seen from Marysville","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552294","557447","554404","552335","544711","554759","542618","552338","543144","557497","551206","543608","550299","547731","544707","552038"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sunset","cumulus","ray","sun","water","highlight","calm","cover","wind","glow"]}
