{"path":"547163.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a middle-aged man wearing a hard hat and work clothes. The hard hat is white with visible scuffs and dust, suggesting that it has been well-used in a rugged environment. He has a rugged, weathered appearance with noticeable lines on his face, indicative of spending considerable time outdoors or in tough working conditions. His expression is serious and contemplative, gazing off into the distance.\n\nHe’s wearing a dark, possibly denim, jacket over a collared shirt, and there is a protective or reflective collar visible on his jacket, aimed at safety and visibility in an industrial or construction setting.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the subject’s face, but faint outlines of industrial or construction equipment can be seen, implying that the setting is likely a work site. The overall tone and background suggest an outdoor, industrial environment, possibly during an overcast day due to the diffuse lighting.","title":"Member of work crew repairs flood damage of Shore Road.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["542783","554953","553618","544382","544171","558312","544835","553634","556391","553609","553610","554441","556867","556345","542779","556343"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["work","jacket","construction","hat","spend","collar","aim","face","denim","close"]}
