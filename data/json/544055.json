{"path":"544055.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts an expansive industrial mining operation. The image is primarily dominated by large, open-pit mines with various excavation levels, visible as concentric circles and spiraling roads descending into the earth. Multiple large mining structures, including buildings and smokestacks, are situated around and within these pits. These structures are emitting a significant amount of white and gray smoke, which is dispersing into the atmosphere.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes a mixture of barren land and patches of sparse vegetation. To the top right of the image, there appears to be a large body of water adjacent to the mining area, juxtaposed with the dry, earth-toned terrain of the mining zones. There are various roads and tracks crisscrossing the area, used for transport and operational purposes within the mines.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting shadows that accentuate the contours and depths of the pits and the relief of the surrounding land. The overall view showcases the scale and environmental impact of industrial mining activities, highlighted by altered landscapes and visible emissions.","title":"Tailings piles from miles and smelter","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["543980","544781","543758","544785","549174","544064","544789","552177","544100","543857","549172","542513","543674","549177","550572","549173"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","pit","mine","relief","earth","circle","land","emission","amount","excavation"]}
