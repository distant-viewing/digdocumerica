{"path":"543898.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph depicts a poignant moment of an elderly woman gently holding the head of a young girl, who appears serious or contemplative. The elderly woman, seen mostly from behind, places her right hand on the girlâ€™s head with a caring gesture. Her facial expression is visible, showing concern or affection.\n\nThe young girl faces towards the camera, her expression somber. She has short light-colored hair and wears a crew-neck shirt, featuring a striped pattern around the neckline.\n\nThey are seated inside a vehicle, possibly a bus or train, evidenced by the rows of windows and the metal frames visible in the background. Through the window, a snowy, blurred landscape can be seen, indicating it might be winter or they are traveling through a cold region.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, another passenger is visible, who appears to be a young child wearing a red hat and sleeping or resting against the back of the seat.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the image is intimate and somewhat solemn, highlighting an everyday travel scene yet enriched with emotional nuance between the two main subjects.","title":"A worried mother and her child leave Louisville by bus when the city was evacuated, evacuation centers were set up when a barge carrying liquid chlorine broke loose from its tug and threatened to spill its poisonous contents, the barge carried enough liquid chlorine to devastate much of the city of Louisville.","placename":"Kentucky","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552935","556839","552931","550090","556842","543863","557871","543854","555975","552962","556796","557863","556550","551473","553484","546667"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["girl","neckline","head","affection","crew","gesture","expression","neck","seat","concern"]}
