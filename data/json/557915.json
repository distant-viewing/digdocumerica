{"path":"557915.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a scene outside a garage, featuring three individuals around two vintage cars, set against the backdrop of a brick wall building with three large garage doors. The outdoor setting is sunny, casting prominent shadows on the ground.\n\nTo the left side of the image, two people, a man and a woman, are engaged with the open hood of an older, light-colored sedan parked in front of the left garage door. Judging by their postures, they appear to be examining or discussing the car's engine. The man is wearing a light colored, long sleeve shirt and dark pants, while the woman is in a colorful short dress, possibly red, exposing her legs, which was a typical fashion of an earlier decade, suggesting the photograph may be from around the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nOn the right, there's a second vintage car, darker in color, also with its hood open. Another man, dressed in a white short-sleeve shirt and darker trousers, seems engaged in actively working on or inspecting the engine of this second car. He appears to be leaning into the engine bay, with his back to the camera.\n\nThe environment suggests a casual, perhaps spontaneous, car maintenance session outside a professional or semi-professional garage setting. The presence of open engine hoods and the positions of the individuals suggest a deep inquisition into mechanical issues or a regular maintenance check.","title":"Woman, center, is having minor adjustments made to her auto's carburetor during retesting after her vehicle had failed at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.

They also must have a safety check which has been in effect since 1940.
