{"path":"551167.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts an agricultural scene centered on hay baling operations under a vast, expansive blue sky adorned with fluffy cumulus clouds. In the foreground to the left, there is a trailer loaded with tightly packed rectangular hay bales. The trailer displays a faded and partly obscured white label or sign on its side. \n\nThe middle ground shows an open field, which appears to be freshly harvested, with stubble and short grass covering the ground. Two tractors are visible in this portion of the scene: one in the middle distance directly ahead, and another on the far right. Both tractors are towing machinery used for hay baling, moving horizontally across the frame.\n\nOn the far right, and at various distances across the field, there are multiple stacks of hay bales similar to the ones loaded on the trailer in the foreground. These stacks delineate the completed work areas of the field.\n\nThe setting is rural, suggested by the absence of buildings or other structures, emphasizing the open, unobstructed landscape typical of farmland. The sky above dominates the upper third of the image, contributing a sense of openness and scale to the scene. Overall, the composition and elements within the photograph vividly portray a day of active farm work focused on hay baling.","title":"Farm on Route 35 near Pt. Pleasant.
