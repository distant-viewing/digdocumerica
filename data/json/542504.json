{"path":"542504.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a biplane flying low over a field that appears to be in full bloom. The plane is an old-fashioned model with two wings stacked one above the other, connected by a series of struts and wires. The aircraft's engine and propeller are visible at the front, and it seems to be emitting a spray over the crops, likely a pesticide or herbicide.\n\nThe plane is captured from a side view, showing one of its sides and the undercarriage wheels. It is slightly tilted upwards as it flies.\n\nThe field itself extends across the entire foreground, filled with tall, dense foliage that could be a type of crop. The green of the plants contrasts starkly with the pale blue of the sky above.\n\nThe background is predominantly sky, taking up the upper half of the photograph, suggesting itâ€™s either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft light that bathes the scene. The horizon line is barely visible but suggests a flat, open landscape typical of agricultural areas.\n\nThe image captures a dynamic moment of rural activity, emphasizing the role of aviation in agricultural management during the mid-20th century. The plane's close proximity to the crop tops and the spraying activity indicate the photograph's focus on capturing this specific agricultural practice. The overall composition and the age of the plane suggest that this could be a historical photograph, documenting farming techniques from a past era.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542503","553044","553873","549072","542495","542506","542508","542505","542500","542502","542496","548884","542499","544491","548883","542498"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["plane","crop","biplane","pesticide","propeller","aviation","technique","spray","wing","field"]}
