{"path":"542997.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene dominated by a large silo or smokestack emitting white smoke into the air. The structure is notable for its dome-like top and sits prominently in the foreground. In the immediate foreground, there are blurry blossoms or leaves that suggest the presence of bushes or small trees, contributing a natural element to the scene. \n\nBehind the industrial structure, a dense forest of trees covering a series of hills or low mountains forms the background. The trees are lush and provide a stark contrast to the industrial activity in the foreground, emphasizing an interplay between nature and industrialization.\n\nThe sky above is partially visible and appears slightly overcast, with some clouds visible but predominantly clear. The lighting in the image suggests daylight conditions. The overall composition of the photograph aligns the natural and man-made elements in a way that juxtaposes the environmental and industrial themes.","title":"Burning wood chips","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["550997","543009","550998","545113","551026","548157","546141","550939","545910","551059","548195","557374","543013","546236","550672","550938"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["blossom","industrialization","dome","silo","way","smokestack","daylight","interplay","tree","bush"]}
