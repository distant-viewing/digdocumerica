{"path":"554857.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of an elderly man. The man appears to be of advanced age, with deep, expressive wrinkles and a pensive gaze. He is wearing a straw hat that sits snugly on his head, which casts a slight shadow over his forehead, highlighting the experience and years etched in his face. His attire includes a light pink shirt which contrasts with his weathered, yet calm face.\n\nThe man's expression is thoughtful, with a mix of solemnity and gentleness. His eyes are dark and seem to carry a wealth of stories, possibly reflecting resilience and wisdom gained over the years. The background is blurred; however, a hint of another person, possibly a man in lighter-colored clothing and a hat, can be glimpsed in the softer focus area behind him.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph subtly enhances the textures of the man's face and his hat, bringing attention to the details of his visage and the fabric of his shirt. The overall mood of the photo is one of dignity and a quiet intensity, inviting viewers to contemplate the life and experiences this man might have encountered.","title":"Ranch hand who works in the area near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554858","552103","543701","548226","544409","556133","547179","548616","556563","553091","542613","556452","556084","553055","552871","547282"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["year","man","experience","hat","face","encounter","etch","forehead","solemnity","contemplate"]}
