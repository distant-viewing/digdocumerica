{"path":"550567.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a vast, dense forest punctuated by a two-lane road running horizontally through the scene. The trees appear lush and uniformly green, suggesting that the photo was taken during a verdant time of yearâ€”likely spring or summer. The road is mostly straight with slight curves and is lined on both sides by what appears to be a thin strip of grass, giving it a ribbon-like appearance as it cuts through the woodland.\n\nThe variations in the shades of green among the trees indicate a mix of different types of trees or possibly variations in sunlight reaching the forest floor. The image is captured from a high altitude, providing a broad overview that highlights the contrast between the man-made road and the natural forest. There are no visible vehicles or people, reinforcing the quiet and remote feeling of the area.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of tranquil isolation and the dominance of nature, interrupted only by the small scale of human-made infrastructure.","title":"A view west across the route.
