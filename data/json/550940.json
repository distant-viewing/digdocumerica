{"path":"550940.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and contemplative moment featuring a silhouetted female figure seated by a body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea, indicated by the shimmering spots of light reflecting on the surface which suggest sunlight dancing on water. The setting sun or possibly light filtering through trees creates a bokeh effect with circular light patterns dominating the background. This artistic effect adds a layer of texture and depth, enriching the visual interest of the scene. \n\nThe young woman is centered in the composition, dressed in a casual manner, and appears engaged in adjusting or examining a camera, suggestive of preparing for a photograph or reviewing one she has taken. The act hints at a peaceful pastime or a moment of personal creativity. Nearby, a drink can is visible beside her, enhancing the casual and relaxed atmosphere of the scene. The overall tone conveys solitude and a close connection with nature, coupled with elements of leisure and artistic pursuit. The setting is tranquil, focusing on individual activity in a naturally beautiful environment, emphasizing themes of reflection and tranquility.","title":"Child crabbing on the banks of the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543835","548291","549322","553156","550826","554486","552026","543535","547217","551468","551280","542556","552310","543143","545774","543753"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["review","creativity","pursuit","dance","effect","filtering","enrich","drink","act","manner"]}
