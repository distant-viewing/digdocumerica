{"path":"545167.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil yet somber natural scene, juxtaposed with industrial elements. In the foreground, there's a worn, rusty pipeline running horizontally, partially elevated above a muddy shore by a rudimentary wooden structure with pillars and beams, some of which are submerged in water. This pipeline leads the viewer's eye towards a large body of calm water that reflects the gray, overcast sky.\n\nOn the right side of the image, in the distance, stands a solitary and towering cooling tower, typical of nuclear or industrial plants, which dominates the otherwise natural landscape. Its reflection can be seen in the water, adding to the visual impact of its presence.\n\nThe background is framed by a line of dense, dark evergreen trees under a cloudy sky, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. Flies or small insects are visible in the air, captured by the camera in the sky area, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is contemplative, highlighting the intersection of human-made structures and the natural environment, possibly raising questions about ecological and technological impacts.","title":"The controversial Trojan Nuclear Plant on the Columbia River","placename":"Prescott (Or.)","location":"Prescott, Oregon","nn1":["548208","544695","544673","552040","544289","550995","543006","557220","545862","550684","548035","545996","546073","546118","552194","546974"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipeline","question","insect","tower","cool","impact","elevate","pillar","fly","intersection"]}
