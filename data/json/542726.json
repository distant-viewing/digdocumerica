{"path":"542726.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a serene outdoor scene likely captured in a forest park. In the foreground, an adult male sits on a small portable stool, actively engaged in cooking over a small camping stove, which appears to be placed on a makeshift stand. He's wearing a blue jacket over dark clothing and is focused on his task, with several cooking utensils and plates around him. A small unidentified black-and-white dog sits nearby him, attentively looking in the direction of the camera.\n\nTo his right, there’s a tall tree which frames the scene, and further in the background, the forest’s denseness is visible with numerous tall trees bathing in soft, hazy sunlight filtering through the canopy. This creates a tranquil atmosphere.\n\nOn a paved road in the middle and far background, various people can be observed engaging in different activities: walking and conversing in groups or standing. Their clothing suggests casual, outdoor leisure wear typical for a setting intended for relaxation and recreation. There's also a glimpse of a parked trailer and a car, indicating this area is accessible for vehicles and is likely a designated camping or picnic spot within the park.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on natural and human elements, highlights a peaceful moment in a natural setting, capturing the interaction of humans with nature in a leisure context.","title":"Azalea camp ground at dawn","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["545497","554511","544855","542727","554687","554537","549451","545500","554682","554686","545786","545523","551942","554863","554862","542732"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["cooking","camping","park","stove","stool","leisure","utensil","clothing","sit","designate"]}
