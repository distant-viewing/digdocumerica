{"path":"553300.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph presents a panoramic aerial view of an urban area, densely packed with a variety of buildings, roads, and infrastructure. The setting appears to be an older city based on the architectural styles and close congregation of structures.\n\nBeginning with the foreground, multiple low-rise buildings—comprising residential homes, commercial establishments, and industrial facilities—are seen tightly nested together, creating a complex urban tapestry. The roofs show an assortment of colors but mostly shades of brown, gray, and red, typical for historical or older urban districts.\n\nA few notable larger buildings punctuate the seascape of rooftops. These include what seems to be a large central building painted in white and red, possibly serving a commercial or community function based on its prominent and distinct design.\n\nThe network of streets is visible weaving through the cityscape, with intersecting lines indicating both smaller local roads and wider thoroughfares, likely facilitating the main traffic flow. The absence of visible green spaces in the central area suggests a highly urbanized environment.\n\nMoving toward the background, the city is bordered by verdant, tree-covered hills, suggesting the urban area may be situated in a valley or surrounded by a hilly terrain. This natural backdrop provides a stark contrast to the dense urban environment.\n\nOn the whole, the photograph captures the bustling complexity and dense architectural layout of a city, emphasizing an environment shaped through years of development and habitation.","title":"\"over the rhine\", an old residential neighborhood north of the business district, is being rehabilitated","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556180","548364","548424","555743","549979","548425","548318","548417","549476","551506","553673","551509","547210","556030","551510","552233"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","nest","congregation","thoroughfare","base","begin","tapestry","seascape","rooftop","building"]}
