{"path":"556457.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a middle-aged man seated in a rustic, partially built log cabin. He is positioned on a simple wooden bench formed by logs. The man is dressed in a casual outfit consisting of a soft orange short-sleeved shirt and dark navy trousers. He is also wearing dark, sturdy shoes. His expression is neutral, and he appears calm, looking directly at the camera with a hint of a smile.\n\nThe structure around him is made of thick wooden logs, clearly visible with their rounded surfaces and natural textures. These logs are stacked horizontally to form the cabin walls with gaps that suggest the cabin is still under construction. The vertical support beams are robust and serve as the framework for the cabin.\n\nIn his hands, the man holds a cigarette. His relaxed posture and secure grip suggest a moment of rest or contemplation. The background, which is slightly blurred, reveals a natural wooded environment, hinting that the cabin might be located in a forested or rural setting. The ground around him is covered with small stones and wood chips, indicating recent work or activity in building the cabin. The lighting is soft, possibly indicative of a bright day, highlighting the textures and natural colors of the wooden logs and the man's attire.","title":"Paul davis, 49, of newton, West Virginia, near Charleston seated in a log smokehouse he has under construction","placename":"West Virginia","location":"West Virginia","nn1":["555529","545974","544232","552104","544202","555532","553516","556484","552684","555297","547313","555295","553517","552523","548458","552113"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cabin","log","build","man","grip","gap","cigarette","chip","form","shoe"]}
