{"path":"542904.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene marina filled with various types of boats, most notably sailing yachts and fishing vessels. The scene is set against a bright blue sky with few clouds, indicating clear weather conditions. The harbor is calm, with the water displaying multiple reflections of the boats and their masts, which vary in height and create an intricate network of lines against the sky.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the boats are more utility-oriented, likely used for fishing, as indicated by their sturdier build and less streamlined shapes. These boats feature equipment like winches and masts that are typical for commercial fishing vessels. The central and right portions of the photo show a collection of sleek sailing yachts with tall, slim masts and tidy rigging, hinting at recreational use.\n\nThe lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, as the light bathes the scene in a soft glow, enhancing the tranquility of the marina. There are no people visible in the photograph, adding to the stillness and the focus on the maritime elements. The background contains hints of shore-side facilities and greenery, but they are mostly obscured by the boats, focusing attention on the water and vessels.\n\nThe composition uses the reflections in the water for a symmetrical effect, mirroring the boats and their masts, thereby doubling the visual impact and creating a sense of depth and balance within the frame.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["543545","543246","556191","546388","548247","542871","548078","546877","544248","544661","542872","542907","549407","542902","542903","557450"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["mast","boat","yacht","vessel","fishing","marina","tidy","sai","winch","double"]}
