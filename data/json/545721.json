{"path":"545721.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures two young women engaged in outdoor activities in a lush, green environment with a mountainous backdrop. The setting appears to be a forest clearing filled with small flowers (likely dandelions), with trees sparsely dotted around.\n\nThe woman on the left is wielding a spade and is in the motion of digging into the earth, suggesting she might be planting something, or possibly engaging in some form of environmental conservation work. She is dressed in a casual outdoor outfit, wearing a pink or red shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue denim shorts, and hiking boots. Her hair is covered by a bandana, contributing to her practical look for outdoor work.\n\nThe woman on the right is observing or possibly waiting for her turn to dig. She is wearing a light blue tank top and carries a dark-colored backpack, which hints at an expedition or a serious hiking activity. She also wears light-colored jeans rolled up just below her knees, hiking boots, and white socks pulled up high. Her hair is styled in braids that suggest preparation for a day in the outdoors.\n\nBoth are equipped with what can be considered essential gear for hiking or fieldwork, which includes sturdy boots and practical clothing. The impression is of an active, possibly eco-conscious duo involved in an outdoor project or adventure.\n\nThe backdrop is a majestic mountain, partially covered with snow, indicating that this location is at a higher altitude and it might be late spring or early summer when the snow has not yet fully melted. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting temperate and favorable weather for outdoor activities.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of active, youthful engagement with nature, likely associated with environmental stewardship or outdoor exploration.","title":"Aspen residents plant seedlings at maroon lake campsite, 12 miles north of Aspen.
