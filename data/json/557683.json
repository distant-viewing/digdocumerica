{"path":"557683.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man engrossed in mechanical work on an open engine of a vehicle. He is wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, dark suspenders, and a stereotypical engineer's cap, also known as a newsboy cap. His attire suggests practical work wear, likely intended to protect his clothes underneath.\n\nThe man's expression, concentrated with a slight frown, indicates he is carefully evaluating or repairing something within the engine bay. His hands are visibly dirty, suggesting he has been at work for some time. One of his hands is reaching deep into the engine area, while the other supports his activity.\n\nThe setting indicates this is taking place in a residential area; a blurred background shows a quiet street, part of a white car, and homes amid greenery, suggesting a suburban neighborhood. It appears to be daytime with overcast lighting, which softly illuminates the scene without harsh shadows.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image focuses on the man and his interaction with the engine, framed by the engine bay and parts of his body, creating a close, intimate view of a moment of skilled labor.","title":"Chief westmoreland, known as \"mr.
