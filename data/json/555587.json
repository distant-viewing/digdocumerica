{"path":"555587.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape featuring distinct geological formations. Shown are two large, rugged cliffs or bluffs, partially covered in vegetation, prominently positioned in the middle of the scene. They are characterized by exposed sedimentary rock layers with varying shades of brown and red, indicating possibly different types of soil or minerals.\n\nThe cliffs are topped with sparse greenery, including a few trees and bushes, which suggests a relatively arid climate or possibly the edges of a larger forested area. The foreground of the photo captures a wide expanse of flat, dry grassland, appearing yellow and sun-bathed, which leads to the base of these rock formations. This suggests the photo was taken in a season of lower rainfall or during a dry period.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, hinting at a sunny, cloudless day, which further accentuates the arid, tranquil, and natural setting. The overall composition and the natural lighting conditions suggest this photo might be taken during the golden hours near sunrise or sunset, providing a warm, soft light that enhances the natural reds and browns of the cliffs.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched, rugged nature of the landscape. This picture could depict a remote area, possibly a park or natural reserve, focused on highlighting the natural geological beauty and the serenity of the environment.","title":"Buttes, mesas and canyons result from strip mining for coal after the machinery has moved on","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["555592","545799","545800","544745","545792","544429","545805","552685","544392","545797","555589","549147","545804","545775","544950","543838"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cliff","brown","formation","reserve","photo","grassland","serenity","rock","rainfall","mineral"]}
