{"path":"545091.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man standing in a vast field of golden-brown grass. The man, appearing in his late sixties or seventies, has a stately posture with his left hand resting on his hip and the right slightly extended outward. His expression is serious and contemplative as he looks directly at the camera. He wears a short-sleeved, checkered shirt with a mix of beige and white colors, paired with dark trousers and dark shoes.\n\nThe grass around him is long and appears dry, suggesting a late summer or early autumn setting. The undulating terrain adds a textured backdrop, with ripples of grass flowing like waves in different directions, indicating perhaps the impact of wind over time. There are no trees, buildings, or other distinctive landmarks visible in the immediate background, emphasizing the isolation and expansive nature of the landscape.\n\nThe lighting is natural, casting shadows on the man's face and creating a contrast between the bright sky and the muted earth tones of the grass. The composition of the photograph places the man slightly off-center, giving more space to the sprawling landscape, which may evoke a sense of openness and the ruggedness of the natural environment. Overall, the image portrays a quiet moment of reflection in a serene and vast outdoor setting.","title":"Barney McPhillips, chairman of the Oregon State Environmental Quality Commission for 28 years","placename":"McMinnville (Or.)","location":"McMinnville, Oregon","nn1":["542548","557112","552113","554028","553418","553801","547416","546262","542613","549083","547679","544295","546068","554424","552871","551347"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["grass","hip","man","ruggedness","openness","landmark","sprawl","undulate","shoe","autumn"]}
