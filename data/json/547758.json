{"path":"547758.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful moment with three people riding in an unusual, vintage-style, yellow vehicle. The vehicle has an open-top design and a boxy construction, reminiscent of early 20th-century military or utility vehicles. It features distinctive elements such as large circular headlights, horn, and a passenger compartment that is somewhat crudely adorned with a cross symbol on the side, suggesting a playful or decorative imitation of an ambulance.\n\nTwo women and a man are visible in the vehicle. The women, seated at the back, are wearing sunglasses and casual, sleeveless tops, and they both have their hair pulled back. They are smiling broadly, contributing to the lively, carefree atmosphere of the scene. The man, who is driving, also wears sunglasses and is shirtless, further underscoring the informal and fun setting. He has a cigarette in his mouth, adding to his rugged, relaxed demeanor.\n\nThe background shows a tree-lined park or roadside area, indicating that this scene is taking place on a sunny day, ideal for a leisurely drive. Behind the yellow vehicle, there is another car visible, reflecting typical automotive design of the 1970s, which helps to anchor the time period of the image.\n\nOverall, this photograph exudes a sense of freedom and enjoyment, capturing a moment of fun among friends in a quirky, eye-catching vehicle during a bright, sunny day.","title":"City folk come in droves each weekend to once-isolated white rock lake.
