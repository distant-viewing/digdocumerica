{"path":"553577.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a unique and striking view of a forest scene centered on an enormous tree with multiple trunks. The tree, which is the main focus of the image, has several large and thick trunks that seem to split from a single, massive base. The tree's bark is rough and textured, emphasizing the aged and sturdy nature of the tree. The ground around the tree is covered with a thick layer of what appears to be ash, giving the scene a somewhat eerie, desolate feel, reminiscent of a post-wildfire landscape.\n\nThe background features a dense collection of tall, slender trees that stretch up towards the sky, their branches bare, suggesting it might be either winter or a result of the same event that left the ash. The forest floor is visible between the trees, uniformly covered with the same ashy substance seen around the base of the main tree. The lighting in the photograph is dim, possibly due to the time of day or the filtering effect of the smoke or haze in the air, casting deep shadows and contributing to the somber, quiet atmosphere of the scene.\n\nNo human figures or animals are visible in the image, enhancing the feeling of solitude and emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of the forest setting. The composition and the perspective make the viewer feel as if they are standing right at the base of the tree, looking up at its imposing structure and out into the eerie expanse of the forest.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora scene within the section of the burn area known as \"Granite Fire.\" This part of the territory has not yet been logged.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["550792","557621","554967","557622","554989","553576","554995","548687","542749","543488","543442","542928","554977","543445","554966","552551"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["ash","base","tree","forest","trunk","result","substance","bark","collection","winter"]}
