{"path":"550776.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring several children engaged in fishing activities by a body of water. The setting includes a grassy area leading up to a wooden, aged dock where the children are gathered. There are six children visible in the frame, with varying attire suggesting casual, comfortable outdoor wear. On the left, a boy stands somewhat elevated on the dock, actively casting his fishing rod into the water. Beside him, on the lower level of the dock, two boys and one girl are seated or standingâ€”likely baiting hooks or watching the others fish.\n\nTo the right, two children stand at the edge of the dock, both holding fishing rods and looking attentively towards their lines in the water. The background shows a sunlit, shimmering water surface, hinting at a bright, sunny day. An environmental detail included in the scene is a circular sign on the dock that reads \"IDLE SPEED CAUSE WAKE,\" indicating a warning or regulation likely aimed at nearby boaters.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and focused, capturing a quintessentially idyllic summer activity. The composition balances activity and stillness, with calm water and engaged children juxtaposing each other harmoniously.","title":"Youngsters fishing at Wisconsin Dells on the Wisconsin River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554518","546800","543220","547004","554517","548737","543164","542740","552029","544223","549935","550848","542564","553914","552828","543516"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dock","child","fishing","rod","boy","bait","hook","regulation","water","warning"]}
