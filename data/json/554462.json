{"path":"554462.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor river rafting scene in a lush, verdant environment. In the foreground, an individual is bending over, seemingly securing or retrieving a raft; this person is wearing a bright orange life jacket, a yellow helmet, and holding a paddle. Only part of this individual’s figure is visible, emphasizing the actions rather than the person. A collection of canoes and rafts are scattered throughout the image, both near this individual and further into the river. Some rafts are occupied with people wearing similar safety gear who are either seated or preparing their vessels.\n\nOther participants are standing in the river or by its banks, engaged in activities related to managing the rafts and canoes, contributing to a busy and active scene. The river itself is lined with dense forest, which fills the background and adds an air of seclusion and wilderness to the scene. There’s a dynamic composition created by the mix of standing and seated individuals, the diagonal lines of the rafts, and the natural flow of the river painted with ripples and light reflections off the water surface.","title":"Canoe and kayak club from Vermont prepare to paddle down the upper Hudson River near Indian Lake via Indian River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545733","549441","545741","549439","554465","544925","549462","549437","550659","545729","549465","549461","545937","558069","549447","545737"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","river","canoe","individual","rafting","retrieve","paddle","seclusion","secure","participant"]}
