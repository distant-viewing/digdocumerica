{"path":"543204.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal scene, most likely taken on a sunny day given the bright lighting and clear skies. It features a rocky shoreline with a diverse texture of jagged rocks that extend into the sea. The foreground of the image shows dense clusters of thick, fleshy succulent plants with greenish-red leaves, which are typical of coastal vegetation that can withstand salty, windy conditions. These plants are interspersed with pockets of sandy areas and some smaller rocks.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, the sea is visible with waves breaking against the rocky outcrops, creating white foam, indicating the dynamic nature of this coastal environment. The horizon is clear, showcasing a deep blue sea meeting a slightly lighter blue sky, devoid of any noticeable clouds.\n\nThere are two people visible in the scene, suggesting human interaction with this natural landscape. One person is standing on a higher rock formation towards the central part of the image, seemingly looking out towards the sea or down at the rocks. Another person is seen further away, perched on another rock. Their presence adds a sense of scale to the image, emphasizing the rough and uneven nature of the terrain.\n\nOverall, the photo depicts a serene yet rugged coastal setting, common along rocky shorelines, where natural elements and human presence intermingle under vast, open skies.","title":"Wild flowers bloom at Shell Beach Point","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543297","553775","543492","543289","543139","543389","543291","543419","545122","543243","542917","547486","553773","543290","543184","543295"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","sea","shoreline","meeting","pocket","outcrop","plant","foam","person","presence"]}
