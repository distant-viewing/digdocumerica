{"path":"547244.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, located in Arlington, Virginia. The Pentagon is famously shaped like a five-sided polygon, and its massive structure is clearly visible in the image. The building has a centralized courtyard, also pentagonal in shape, and is made up of five concentric rings.\n\nThe photo shows several parking lots surrounding the building, heavily filled with cars, indicating either a peak work hour or a general full capacity during working days. The roads around the Pentagon are busy with traffic, hinting at the accessibility and the constant movement associated with such a critical governmental hub.\n\nIn the background, the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol can be seen in the distance across the Potomac River, placing the Pentagon within its broader geographical and political context. The river itself adds a natural element to the urban environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the scale and importance of the Pentagon within the larger landscape of Washington, D.C., emphasizing its role as a center of military administration.","title":"Aerial view of the Pentagon and one of its parking fields","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546737","546717","547267","546577","546613","547228","546585","546570","546679","546674","547226","546692","546584","546741","546693","547268"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["courtyard","capacity","ring","accessibility","importance","hub","hour","role","lot","peak"]}
