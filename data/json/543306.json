{"path":"543306.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a vivid coastal scene dominated by deep blue ocean water speckled with white caps indicating moderate wave activity. The foreground and midground are composed of dark, jagged volcanic rocks forming a rugged coastline. These rocks appear sharp and uneven, cutting into the ocean and creating bursts of white spray as the waves crash against them.\n\nThe colors of the rocks range from dark brown to black, and they are interspersed with patches of lighter colors, possibly from salt deposits or bird droppings. Some greenish hues can be spotted on the rocks, suggesting small growths of marine vegetation or moss.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a steep rock face, suggesting a cliff or a steep drop, which continues to the series of smaller rocks stretching towards the horizon. The sky is not visible in the image, putting an entire focus on the interaction between sea and land.\n\nThe natural lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the deep color saturation and contrast, giving a dramatic and rugged feel to the scene. This setting, devoid of human presence and any modern elements, presents a raw and natural state of the oceanic landscape which appears untamed and beautifully harsh.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543295","543092","543243","545122","543290","553775","547486","553771","543309","545173","545130","545230","543291","543250","543289","543061"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","ocean","wave","drop","burst","salt","deposit","spray","saturation","moss"]}
