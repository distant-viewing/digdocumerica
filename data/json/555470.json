{"path":"555470.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a rugged coastline strewn with large logs and driftwood. The setting is sunny with clear skies. In the foreground, a man is actively engaged in sawing a large, circular section from a huge log. He is wearing a gray jacket and brown pants, and his focus is intensely on his task as he bends over the log.\n\nBehind him, a red pickup truck with an open tailgate is parked parallel to the beach, with some items visible inside the vehicle, suggesting the man might be loading the wood into the truck. The background is naturally scenic, showing a gentle slope covered with green vegetation. In the distance, hills or low mountains can be faintly seen under the blue sky, enhancing the sense of a remote, coastal location.\n\nThe composition focuses on the manual labor involving natural resources, with an emphasis on the interaction between the human effort and the raw, natural environment. The image captures a moment of physical work and the rugged beauty of the coastal landscape, filled with driftwood, potentially after a storm or natural event that deposited the wood onto the shore.","title":"Conservation of electricity resulted in more people collecting firewood along the beaches as did this person near Lincoln City. When this picture was taken in January, 1974, there was a wind-chill factor of minus 12 degrees.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["555472","553612","553643","553614","554411","554412","542771","542623","553641","545060","552583","553642","554416","554419","553602","553648"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["log","driftwood","truck","wood","pickup","storm","resource","emphasis","coastline","effort"]}
