{"path":"544855.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil, outdoor camping scene. It is set in a wooded area, with several large pine trees providing patches of shade. The foreground shows a part of a tree branch with out-of-focus leaves adding a natural frame to the image.\n\nIn the center of the image, there's a small, blue tent set up on a patch of grass. Just beyond the tent, three people are engaged in various activities. To the left, a man is kneeling and tending to a campfire, which is emitting a plume of white smoke that rises up through the trees. Near the center, a woman, standing and facing away from the camera, is holding what appears to be a stick possibly used for cooking or poking the fire. To the right, another man is standing at a picnic table and seems to be preparing or organizing food or camping gear.\n\nThe background shows another picnic table and hints at more camping equipment, giving the impression that this area is a designated campsite. Further back, more trees and a glimpse of a vehicle suggest the proximity of a parking area, indicating accessibility.\n\nOverall, the image captures a serene moment of outdoor leisure, characterized by camping activities like setting up tents, preparing meals, and enjoying the natural environment. The lighting is soft and warm, suggesting that the photo was taken during the early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Campground","placename":"Rocky Mountain National Park (Colo.)","location":"Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado","nn1":["554863","542727","548796","545500","548797","543889","545497","548748","549450","554480","545698","550977","551314","545293","554464","542726"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["tent","camping","prepare","table","campfire","organi","camp","cooking","campsite","tend"]}
