{"path":"552772.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This image features an up-close view of an open engine compartment of a bus. The rear engine cover is lifted upwards, revealing the intricate components of the engine housed within. The engine appears well-maintained, with visible components such as pipes, filters, and metal casings. The exterior of the bus is partially visible, showing a white bumper with rivets and a side section that is red colored. \n\nThe background includes a modern building with windows and what looks like a metal roof. The bus is parked on a concrete surface, suggesting that this might be a service area or near a bus depot or maintenance facility. The focus and composition of the image highlight the mechanical details and the contrast between the complex engine interior and the simplistic, functional design of the bus's exterior.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
