{"path":"551917.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a scene inside a well-lit garage with a neat lineup of police motorcycles, predominantly appearing to be BMW models. The motorcycles are parked in parallel, facing toward the camera, each featuring prominent windshields and side boxes labeled with \"POLICE.\" The motorcycles are predominantly black with chrome details, and each has a white \"P\" inscribed on a red background on the windshields.\n\nAt the far end of the garage stands a man, wearing a dark uniform, perhaps a police uniform, overseeing the motorcycles. He stands with a straight posture, his hands slightly apart from his body, suggesting a supervisory role or a readiness to undertake action. The geometrical arrangement of the motorcycles, combined with the linear fluorescent lighting above and the clean floor with visible parking guides, highlights a sense of order and discipline characteristic of a police environment.\n\nThe architecture of the room hints at an older, possibly historical, building with arched white windows and doors visible in the background. This gives a contrasting sense of tradition and modernity when viewed against the sleek design of the motorcycles. The overall composition and elements of the photograph suggest a meticulous organizational setting, possibly prepping for a parade or a public service duty, emphasizing readiness and discipline.","title":"Police department motor-cycles","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["546614","556719","549316","551918","551237","546645","551383","558232","555461","544859","551120","551464","546665","556206","546634","557845"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["motorcycle","police","readiness","windshield","garage","uniform","inscribe","lineup","modernity","tradition"]}
