{"path":"545546.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image captures a scene in a narrow muddy alleyway flanked by stained wooden buildings or barracks. It appears to be shortly after a rain, as the ground is wet and filled with puddles of water. Most immediately noticeable are several children and a few adults within the alley. In the foreground, we see two boys with their backs towards the viewer—one is particularly distinct in a blue shirt—and it looks like they are observing or interacting with something out of frame to the left.\n\nFurther down the pathway, there are other children and adults. Several children are walking towards the viewer, while a group in the background is gathered around an adult, possibly conversing or engaged in some community activity. The lighting suggests it might be a cloudy or overcast day, given the soft natural light and lack of harsh shadows.\n\nOn the left side, laundry is visibly hanging from the exterior of one building, adding a homey, lived-in touch to the otherwise stark environment. The buildings themselves are functional and simple, with visible signs of wear such as peeling paint and uneven wooden planks. Each building has a gabled roof and some small, curtained windows.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of everyday life in a compact, communal setting, possibly within a low-income or rural area, where the community dynamics are prominently observed even in such a constrained space.","title":"Scene in \"Little Korea,\" in south Birmingham. Despite the significant progress of recent years, many Birmingham blacks still live in areas of substandard housing of which this is a prime example. Several creeks flow through the community. During heavy rains, these are apt to overflow, and residents must often be evacuated.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545526","545343","552969","551114","546958","555951","545542","551001","544368","551129","545383","556166","545509","556163","556167","553497"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["adult","child","income","alleyway","laundry","alley","observe","community","dynamic","puddle"]}
