{"path":"555388.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape scene dominated by an expansive body of water, presumably a lake, flanked by forested hills. In the foreground is a wide, barren terrain that appears to be a lakebed, possibly exposed due to low water levels. The terrain is rocky and sparsely vegetated, with scattered debris and small patches of grass evident.\n\nTo the left, the lake extends to a densely wooded peninsula or island, covered in coniferous trees, which sharply contrasts with the barren foreground. This green, forested area provides a rich color contrast against the blue of the water.\n\nIn the background, the scene is enclosed by a range of hills, also densely forested, enhancing the feeling of a secluded, natural environment. The sky is noticeably clear and the lighting suggests it may be midday, contributing to the sharpness and vividness of the colors in the photograph.\n\nThe composition of the image, with a foreground of rocky terrain leading the eye towards the water and wooded hills, creates a sense of depth and vastness, emphasizing the tranquility and rugged beauty of the landscape.","title":"Detroit Lake shown at an all-time low in the fall of 1973 due to infrequent snowfall and rain the year before.
