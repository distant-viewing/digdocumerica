{"path":"554536.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a cluttered, chaotic scene of a debris pile. The focus is an assortment of discarded and broken items thrown together in a haphazard manner. Prominently, there is an overturned car chassis, stripped of most of its parts, with a faded and dirtied blue and white paint job. The chassis is entangled among various other types of refuse.\n\nAround and on top of the car are pieces of wood of varying sizes and conditions, some with peeling paint, suggesting they might come from old furniture or demolished structures. A tangle of branches and possibly some roots are mixed within, adding to the natural debris in the scene. Notably, there are also scattered mechanical parts, including a black tire visible near the top of the pile.\n\nIn the background, against a distressed wall showing signs of deterioration and exposure, more rubble is found. The wall, made of cement or stone, has patches where the material has fallen away, exposing underlying layers. \n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a setting of neglect and abandonment, where various elements have been disposed of or have accumulated over time in a disorganized manner. The setting might be an abandoned lot or a similar environment where debris commonly accumulates.","title":"Debris and old truck thrown into a factory foundation at McKeever, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543165","554302","542590","552102","547587","553863","553470","553009","556640","542585","547024","549307","550264","546249","554335","553006"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["chassis","manner","paint","debris","cement","pile","job","deterioration","root","refuse"]}
