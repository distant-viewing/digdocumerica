{"path":"555254.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph showcases a science laboratory scene. The foreground is dominated by large, transparent plastic bags placed on a flat red surface. These bags are filled with what appears to be a granular substance or some form of chemical, each sealed off and tagged with labels and cautionary symbols indicating hazardous material.\n\nIn the background, a man wearing a white lab coat is actively engaged in his work at a bench. He is partly obscured by the items in the foreground but is focused on handling or examining something at the bench. The background further features extensive laboratory equipment and containers, as well as shelves stored with various scientific tools and materials. Natural light seems to be coming through a window, hinting at a daytime scenario. The overall ambiance is that of a busy, professional laboratory environment centered around scientific research or experimentation.","title":"Sealed pesticide samples are shown as they were delivered by the inspectors in the field to Environmental Protection Agency Mississippi Test Facility at Bay St. Louis.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546278","549608","549332","546277","546284","543834","548859","555249","555281","549333","555253","555250","555280","542666","549342","543801"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["laboratory","bench","bag","experimentation","science","lab","symbol","shelf","material","substance"]}
