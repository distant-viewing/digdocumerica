{"path":"557370.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man wearing sunglasses, interacting with a vehicle. The man, who has tousled dark hair and a rugged appearance, is sitting sideways in the front seat of an open-door white car. He is wearing a light-colored shirt that's unbuttoned at the collar and blue jeans. His expression is somber or thoughtful as he gazes downwards, covering his eyes with one hand, which might suggest a moment of distress or deep thought.\n\nThe car has a vintage design, evident from the rounded curves and the style of the dashboard. The driver's door is wide open and the man sits with one leg hanging out of the car, touching the ground, and the other inside, bent at the knee.\n\nIn the foreground, quite close to the viewer, the carâ€™s white body shows signs of wear and rust. The scene is set in a nondescript outdoor location with a faint view of power lines and utility poles in the background, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The lighting in the image suggests a bright day, contributing to the contrast and deep shades in the photograph.","title":"Ernest watkins sits dejectedly in his car after he realizes he is unable to fix it himself at the family's new home.
