{"path":"543043.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a charming, nostalgic scene involving four children and a small horse or pony outdoors, bathed in warm sunlight, suggesting it could be either early morning or late afternoon. In the image, a young child with a joyful expression rides the pony; she wears a cozy looking blue fleece jacket with a hood lined with lighter fur and appears to be smiling broadly. She is supported from behind by an older boy who wears a red, zippered jacket and has an earnest expression. To the right stands an older girl, her attention focused on the rider, wearing a simple white sleeveless top and her hair in a long ponytail. Another young child, a boy wearing a light blue long-sleeve shirt, knit cap, and striped pants, stands to the pony's side, his hand on its mane, looking into the camera with a happy grin.\n\nThe background, though mostly sunlit and blurred, hints at a residential setting with the appearance of what might be parts of houses or structures that are typical in such areas. Light falls through the scene, illuminating particles in the air and creating a soft, golden glow around the subjects, adding a sense of warmth and serenity to this simple but joyful moment among children and animal.","title":"Northern California--Orick","placename":"Orick (Calif.)","location":"Orick, California","nn1":["549108","556562","543678","544358","556553","543784","543788","553064","553116","543783","557992","543841","554689","557418","542972","543366"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["child","boy","ponytail","mane","jacket","particle","rider","knit","fur","serenity"]}
