{"path":"546443.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a sunny day in front of a modern, industrial-looking building characterized by a wide, white facade and a row of robust, square columns supporting a deep overhang. A striking feature of the building is its dark brick wall beneath the white facade, detailed with a horizontal white stripe at mid-height, which contrasts sharply against the lighter upper portion.\n\nOn the far left, a woman is walking briskly along the sidewalk, dressed in casual, bright clothing and carrying a bag and another item under her arm. Meanwhile, in the center of the frame, a young child, likely a toddler, rides a small tricycle along the sunlit sidewalk, appearing independent and focused on maneuvering the bike.\n\nThe right side of the image shows a group of young people lounging on the pavement against the building under the shade of the overhang. They are seated and lying down in relaxed postures, suggesting a casual, leisurely moment. This cluster of individuals appears engaged in conversation, with their attention turned towards each other, contributing to a laid-back, communal atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts everyday urban life, highlighting moments of transit and relaxation in a distinctly architectural environment. The combination of movement and rest, along with the interaction among the figures, paints a vivid picture of social dynamics in a public space.","title":"Columbus east senior high school, built in 1972","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546452","557272","549992","546465","550751","544808","551823","551493","553159","549926","551829","551815","546522","556226","546541","554691"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["overhang","sidewalk","tricycle","facade","toddler","lounge","bike","dynamic","maneuver","pavement"]}
