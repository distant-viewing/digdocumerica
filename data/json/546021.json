{"path":"546021.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image is a silhouette scene captured at dusk or dawn, featuring the vibrant gradient of twilight colors transitioning from deep purple at the top to a fusion of red and blues towards the horizon. In the foreground, several dark figures are visible. These include multiple people standing and perhaps engaging in a conversation or observing their surroundings. To the left, larger structures resembling traditional haystacks or teepees contribute a rustic and rural feel to the setting.\n\nThese figures and structures are backlit by the fading light, which accentuates their outlines against the twilight sky. The overall ambience is serene and somewhat mysterious, emphasizing the beauty of natural twilight colors juxtaposed with the stark silhouettes of people and rustic elements. The setting is likely in an open field, given the unobstructed horizon and the presence of agricultural elements, which adds a sense of tranquility and spaciousness to the scene.","title":"One of the Christmas Eve bonfires which take place every year in the small communities along the Mississippi River levee between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["543417","547716","548222","552225","544359","543062","542625","554644","553228","543024","547705","554403","554674","544597","554397","554421"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["twilight","spaciousness","silhouette","figure","ambience","horizon","purple","gradient","outline","dawn"]}
