{"path":"549994.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant street scene with a focus on both human interaction and floral beauty. In the foreground, a variety of colorful flowers line the sidewalk in buckets and crates, bringing a burst of life and color to the urban setting. The flowers, including tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths, are neatly arranged, indicating a flower market or a display outside a shop.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, three people engage in what appears to be a friendly conversation. One of them is dressed in a dark police uniform and cap, suggesting he is an officer. He is facing a man in a dark coat who is holding a white shopping bag, while they speak to each other. A third man in another dark coat stands slightly behind and listens in. \n\nIn the background, a young woman walks by, seemingly uninvolved with the conversation. She wears bright pink pants and a white jacket, carrying a purse and looking down, possibly at a phone or another small item in her hands.\n\nBehind these characters, the scene shows parts of parked cars and a city street bustling with more pedestrians and typical urban architecture. The atmosphere feels lively and everyday, encapsulated in a moment of casual urban life.","title":"Flowers for sale on boylston street opposite public garden","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549924","550027","551698","553242","550044","551697","551699","551815","551665","551687","551779","551700","551685","549906","551802","551742"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["flower","coat","conversation","purse","burst","crate","phone","officer","police","shopping"]}
