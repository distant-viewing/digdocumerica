{"path":"546054.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and scenic landscape centered around a large body of calm blue water, possibly a lake or river. Dominating the right side of the image is a tall, red and white electricity transmission tower. The tower extends into the clear, sky-blue background, and several power lines emanate from its top, stretching across the frame. The landscape around the tower subsides into flat, low-lying terrain densely populated with small, brushy trees and shrubbery marking the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nOn the horizon, the sky is vivid and clear, showcasing various gradations of blue, and adorned with a contrail from an airplane, indicating a subtle hint of human activity that contrasts with the otherwise natural setting. The overall composition, with its open skies and reflective waters, offers a serene sense of spaciousness and the peace often found in undisturbed natural environments.","title":"High voltage utility line crosses the Bayou Segnette waterway approximately 10 miles south of the Westwego public boat launch.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544690","549110","548208","557977","544695","548136","544355","550753","553086","555574","545050","549135","553028","543728","543903","556929"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tower","spaciousness","gradation","transmission","electricity","blue","airplane","peace","emanate","shrubbery"]}
