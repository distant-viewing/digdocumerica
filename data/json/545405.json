{"path":"545405.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing prominently in the foreground on a dirt road. He is dressed in a long-sleeve shirt featuring an animal print and layered with a pair of denim overalls. The man is pointing off to his left with his right hand, possibly guiding the viewerâ€™s attention or making a comment. His expression is earnest and engaged, suggesting he is in the middle of a conversation or explanation.\n\nThe background shows a stark contrast to the rural or suburban attire and setting the man is in. It features industrial structures, including tall, tower-like facilities with visible staircases and several chimneys or stacks emitting no visible smoke, suggesting inactive or dormant industrial operations. The area around these facilities is unkempt, with overgrown grass and a bare dirt road leading towards these structures.\n\nIn the middle ground, behind the man, there is a small house with a porch, indicating a residential area close to industrial operations. The house is partially obscured by some foliage, and there are other greeneries, like bushes, visible around the house, adding a touch of life to the otherwise industrial backdrop. The contrast between the residential setting where the man stands and the industrial background suggests a narrative of community living in close proximity to industrial zones, possibly exploring themes of industrial impact on residential life and the environment.","title":"Residential street near U.S. Steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545401","545390","543648","545388","547277","556541","545520","548850","550246","545442","552091","542548","546262","545087","551151","548299"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["house","man","dirt","print","overall","operation","facility","staircase","pair","denim"]}
