{"path":"550093.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene that appears to be from the 1960s or 1970s, based on the style of vehicles and signage. The image is taken from the perspective of someone in a vehicle, looking down a busy suburban or urban road lined with various businesses and signage.\n\nProminently, on the left side of the photograph, there's a large sign for \"The Scott Auto Wash\" featuring the promotion \"FREE CAR WASH With Fill-Up 15 Gallons\". Below this sign, thereâ€™s another that advertises an \"American\" gas station brand with its logo visible. The design elements and typography are very characteristic of mid-20th-century commercial design in the United States.\n\nAlong the roadside, there are multiple other signs, including ones for a dry cleaners, a restaurant named \"Venice\", and \"Mann's Restaurant\", typical of dense commercial strips in this era. These businesses display a variety of mostly vertical and some horizontal signs, employing bold text and bright colors to attract attention.\n\nThe street itself is filled with cars that are typical of the 60s-70s era, including sedans and station wagons, mostly in subdued tones. The road is a multi-lane street with oncoming traffic visible and several traffic signals along the span.\n\nOverhead, a multitude of electrical and telephone wires crisscross above the street, indicating the common infrastructure of the time. The sky is relatively clear with a hint of overcast, suggestive of a bright but cloudy day.\n\nOverall, the picture offers a nostalgic look into American commercial life during the mid-20th century, highlighting the automotive culture and the prevalent advertising style of the period.","title":"Intensive development follows the freeway","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546184","545216","549113","554551","542586","547369","548889","547651","556709","554297","555910","555584","555438","545614","551135","545618"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","sign","signage","business","promotion","station","employ","traffic","era","strips"]}
