{"path":"549572.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant parade scene on a sunny day in a city street lined with large buildings. The main focus of the image is a procession of vintage-style fire trucks, each brimming with uniformed firefighters. The front truck is particularly striking with its bright red color, polished chrome details, and shiny headlamps. It also features a white license plate marked with number \"3240\" and a smaller green plate labeled \"29.\"\n\nEach vehicle carries several firefighters dressed in traditional dark-colored uniforms, including helmets. Some are seated facing forward while others stand on the rear of the trucks, looking out towards the crowd.\n\nThe street sides are densely packed with onlookers, many of whom are seated on the curb while others stand behind them. The crowd includes people of various ages, all focused on the parade. American flags are prominently displayed on the buildings and along the street, adding to the festival atmosphere.\n\nThe sun casts shadows on the road, adding depth to the scene, and the procession appears to be moving down the street, enveloping the viewer in this moment of celebration and community spirit. The backdrop features large buildings, many adorned with flags, which bear signage that is partly visible, suggesting a bustling urban setting.","title":"Crowds estimated at over 750,000 line the route of the \"old milwaukee days\" annual circus parade.
