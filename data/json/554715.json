{"path":"554715.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural landscape during what appears to be the autumn season. The foreground of the image features a vast and open field, dotted with the reds and browns of autumnal foliage, suggesting it might be a meadow or a marshy area. Sparse grass and wild shrubs dominate this section, hinting at a chilly yet vibrant late fall vibe.\n\nIn the middle ground, a variety of trees are seen, creating a dense belt of woodland. The trees are a mix of conifers and deciduous types, showing off a palette of colors from deep green to golden yellow, indicating the diversity of the local flora. Some trees, particularly the deciduous ones, are mid-transition with their foliage, adding a splash of yellows and lighter greens.\n\nThe background features a dense forest that gradually rises to a gentle hill. The colors here are more muted, composed mostly of greens and yellows, blending seamlessly under a clear, bright sky that suggests a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph offers a tranquil and untouched glimpse into nature, highlighting the quiet beauty of a forested landscape in fall. The absence of human activity or man-made objects enhances the sense of peace and natural beauty in the scene.","title":"Atypical flat, open plains found only here at moose river plains, and at the oswegatchee river plains, also in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
