{"path":"548718.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene underwater scene, likely taken in a coral reef environment. The primary subjects of the image are three large fish with predominantly dark bodies and striking yellow pectoral fins. These fish, possibly surgeonfish due to their coloration and body shape, are swimming close to the sandy seafloor.\n\nThe background features a variety of coral formations, including a large, brain-like coral structure on the right-hand side of the frame, and various other types of branching and fan corals throughout. The water has a deep blue hue, indicating the photograph was taken at some depth where sunlight is diffused.\n\nThe sandy bottom is dotted with small patches of sea grass and smaller coral pieces, enhancing the sense of biodiversity typical in reef ecosystems. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of calm and tranquility, with the fish appearing to move gracefully through their aquatic habitat, perfectly adapted to their environment.","title":"A few of the many species of coral and marine life at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo.
