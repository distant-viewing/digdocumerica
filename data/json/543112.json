{"path":"543112.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, open area undergoing what appears to be some form of land development or excavation. The scene captures a wide, barren piece of land with distinct tire or machinery tracks crisscrossing the dirt, suggesting recent activity. The soil itself is uneven and has a rough texture, with piles and dips throughout the area, indicative of earth-moving or construction work.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest of tall, green conifer trees provides a stark contrast to the stark, exposed dirt in the foreground. This backdrop adds a natural element to the scene and also hints at the location being in a region that may commonly have wooded areas, possibly in a rural setting.\n\nToward the middle of the photograph and toward the background, there is a body of calm water running parallel to the forest line, reflecting a small portion of the trees on the opposite bank, which enhances the scenic yet industrial nature of the locale.\n\nA small white car or vehicle is parked in the middle distance, near the forest edge, by the water. No people are visible in the photograph, suggesting the focus is on the landscape and developmental activity rather than human interaction at the moment of capture.\n\nThe overall impression is a blend of natural beauty and man-made alteration, perhaps capturing a moment in an environmental transformation or a construction project.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["549255","556456","547523","552584","549180","555882","547652","544438","554809","554548","545677","549205","552004","545138","547979","555812"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["forest","dip","transformation","dirt","construction","alteration","undergo","land","locale","crisscross"]}
