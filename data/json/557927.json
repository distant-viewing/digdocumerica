{"path":"557927.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a car maintenance or repair setting, possibly a gas station or a service garage. The focus is on two individuals and a vintage car.\n\nThe car, which appears to be from the mid-20th century, is a prominent part of the image. It's dark-colored, possibly blue, with a round design, and the trunk of the car is open. A man is kneeling next to the open trunk where a car battery and some tools or mechanical parts are visible. He is wearing a light blue mechanic's shirt and dark pants, indicative of a typical mechanic's uniform. He seems to be either inspecting or repairing something inside the trunk, concentrating on his task.\n\nStanding some distance behind the car is a young woman. She has long blonde hair and is dressed in a plaid skirt with a matching blazer over a dark blouse. She seems to be waiting or watching the mechanic's work, holding what looks like a checkbook or a small notebook along with a pen, suggesting she might be either paying for the service or taking notes.\n\nThe background includes other white vintage cars parked nearby, a red brick building which might be part of the garage or another facility, a wooden fence, and a tree. The ground looks wet, indicating recent rain, and the overall ambiance is slightly overcast.\n\nThis photograph captures a typical everyday moment, with a focus on automotive care from a past era, showcasing the interaction between a service professional and a customer.","title":"Service station mechanic adjusts the engine for a young woman whose vehicle had failed the emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Although the station does not have the same type of exhaust analyzer that the city uses, he will be able to adjust the carburetor to pass inspection. Emissions testing has been in effect since January, 1975 for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.
