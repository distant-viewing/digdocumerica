{"path":"554281.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque winter scene in a mountainous village. The setting is defined by snow-covered streets lined with traditional buildings, some of which have characteristic alpine architectural elements such as steep roofs and wooden balconies, adorned with snow and icicles. Prominent in the foreground are people dressed in winter clothing, engaging in daily activities; some appear to be walking while one bends over what looks like a snow pile, suggesting mundane outdoor actions like clearing snow or perhaps retrieving something. \n\nThe architecture of the buildings displays a charming, rustic style typical of mountain resorts, with visible shutters on the windows and decorative elements that add to the quaint atmosphere. The street is flanked by tall, thin trees, possibly firs, which are also covered in snow, enhancing the wintry ambiance. \n\nIn the background, majestic snow-covered mountains rise dramatically against a clear sky, providing a breathtaking backdrop to the village activities. The presence of vehicles and flags on some of the buildings suggests a blend of residential and possibly commercial use, indicating that this might be a hub for both locals and visiting skiers or tourists. The scene is peaceful yet vibrant, encapsulating a serene yet active winter day in a mountainous locale.","title":"The village of Vail was built exclusively for skiers.","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554213","543640","554214","554279","554288","552607","554255","554275","554233","554236","554249","554291","543738","543755","554284","554235"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["snow","village","winter","local","skier","shutter","resort","locale","mountain","street"]}
