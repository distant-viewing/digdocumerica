{"path":"542622.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, pastoral scene set in a rolling countryside. In the foreground, a group of horses, including a foal, peacefully graze on a grassy plain. The horses, bathed in natural light that suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon, add an element of lively warmth to the scene.\n\nThe background features undulating hills dotted with a sparse scattering of trees, which are likely oaks, given the shape of their canopies and the typical landscape. These hills rise gently into the distance, where a more prominent hill crests the horizon. The tonality of the landscape shifts from the yellow-gold of dried grass in the foreground to deeper greens of the wooded areas on the hillsides, illustrating a natural transition in vegetation.\n\nThe sky above is partially visible, hinting at a clear day with good visibility, enhancing the vibrancy of the outdoor setting. There is a soft quality to the light overall, suggesting the time of capture might be when the sun is lower in the sky, either morning or evening. The setting appears tranquil and secluded, evoking a sense of peaceful isolation from urban hustle. Apart from the natural elements, there are also faint indications of a fence running along the field, which subtly underscores the managed aspect of this otherwise wild landscape. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—combining the equine subjects with the expansive, layered backdrop—creates a picturesque view that celebrates rural beauty and tranquility.","title":"California--Sierra foothills","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["552501","551229","543726","542619","542972","557186","556958","546102","554161","552562","545894","556957","551327","550833","545890","542956"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","hill","oak","celebrate","scattering","plain","crest","indication","countryside","hustle"]}
