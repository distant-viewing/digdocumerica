{"path":"542755.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a scene on a highway during the day. In the foreground, there's a vehicle marked as \"VEHICLE PATROL\". The car, which appears to be from the 1970s, is painted in a dark color and has two red lights mounted on top. The car is seen from the rear, on a road with multiple lanes, indicating it's a highway.\n\nIn front of the patrol vehicle, we see the back of a large truck, hauling a cargo container. The truck appears somewhat aged and industrial, typical of the freight vehicles used for transporting large quantities of materials.\n\nThe setting around the vehicles indicates a typical highway environment, with distant billboards and signs. One visible sign mentions \"Dominguez\" which could be a reference to a location or business. There are several other vehicles on the road, though the traffic is not dense.\n\nIn the background, beyond the road, the horizon shows an industrial area with visible smoke, possibly indicating factories or power plants. The sky is clear with light cloud cover, contributing to the overall daylight setting of the image.\n\nThe photograph likely documents a moment in traffic or road patrol activities, emphasizing themes like road safety, vehicle regulation, or highway patrol duties in an urban or semi-urban setting. The presence of the \"VEHICLE PATROL\" car suggests a focus on monitoring or assistance duties on the road.","title":"Air pollution control department officers following truck violator (who later received a citation)","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["542760","555447","555461","542758","555505","546661","549932","542754","545455","555437","542764","554293","548084","547569","547811","554309"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["highway","road","vehicle","duty","clould","haul","themes","truck","assistance","car"]}
