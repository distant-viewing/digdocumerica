{"path":"550383.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a field of fluffy, white, cotton-like plants, glowing softly under muted light. These plants, which resemble cottongrass, are seen with several delicate, feathery tufts protruding from slender stalks. They are clustered together densely in the foreground, creating a texture-rich scene amid a backdrop of a calm, soft-focus environment that fades into a neutral, dark brown hue.\n\nThe image exudes a peaceful, serene vibe, with the soft, white tufts contrasting subtly against the darker, blurred background, making the individual stems stand out. The lighting is diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or a very soft light source, enhancing the ethereal and delicate quality of the scene. The field itself gives an impression of a wild, natural setting, and there is a gentle interplay of light and shadow across the plants, highlighting their intricate details and fragile beauty.","title":"\"Alaska cotton\" found in marshy areas along entire 789-mile route of the pipeline","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552554","554111","557618","545495","554745","549158","557098","557191","557104","555187","545695","547642","555106","555031","545069","545291"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["tuft","plant","stalk","field","stem","protrude","exude","source","vibe","light"]}
