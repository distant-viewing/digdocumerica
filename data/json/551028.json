{"path":"551028.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a relaxed and joyful outdoor moment among a group of people. On the left, a man with long, dark hair and large glasses wearing a dark brown shirt smiles gently as he looks at two other people conversing. In the middle, a woman clad in a floral dress, which has a white background dotted with small, colorful flower patterns, is leaning forward and appears to be laughing or reacting to the conversation. She has her hair pulled back and seems engaged in the dialogue.\n\nOn the right, another man, showcasing a broad, joyful smile, participates actively in the conversation. He wears a wide-brimmed straw hat and a dark blue, unbuttoned shirt, which reveals his chest. His expression and gesture, with his hand raised slightly as if making a point or sharing a joke, add a lively dynamic to the scene.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, suggesting a grassy area with other people who are also seated and mingling. The overall atmosphere is casual and cheerful, indicative of a leisurely gathering, possibly a picnic or an outdoor festival. The lush green hints at a verdant setting, likely a park, contributing to the laid-back aura of the moment. The image captures a snapshot of simple pleasures and human connection, highlighted by bright daylight and vibrant expressions.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 100th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
