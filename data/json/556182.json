{"path":"556182.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a residential building, likely an apartment or a small complex, presenting a calm and managed setting. The building itself shows an architectural style with exposed dark wooden beams and a steep roof, suggestive of a Tudor or neo-Tudor design. The fa√ßade combines elements of brickwork in a regular pattern and smooth, painted sections in light blue.\n\nThe frontage of the building includes large windows, some of which are vertically aligned with dark frames. The bottom floor reveals two entry doors, each complemented by light fixtures and adorned with small, neat gardens that feature notably bright red flowers and green shrubs, adding a pop of color and life against the brick and blue backdrop.\n\nThe grounds in front of the building are well-kept, with a manicured lawn and visible leaves scattered around, which could imply a season like early fall. There are also small decorations and pots near the doorways, further personalizing the space.\n\nOverall, the photograph exhibits a tranquil residential scene, with no visible people or animals, focusing instead on the architecture and landscaping of the environment.","title":"Closeup of townhouses owned by Blacks on Chicago's South Side.
