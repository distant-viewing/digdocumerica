{"path":"554518.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment with three young children engaged in fishing on a wooden dock overlooking a calm body of water. Two girls, one on the left and the other in the center, are seen from behind, sitting close to the edge of the dock. The girl on the left has her hair pulled back with a white headband and is seated on a cushion, holding a fishing rod with its line extended into the water. The girl in the middle has dark hair in a long, cascading ponytail, wearing a dark sleeveless top, and is also holding a fishing rod.\n\nOn the right, a younger boy is sitting, facing more towards the camera compared to the girls. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a horizontally striped t-shirt in shades of green, yellow, and red, paired with red pants and white sneakers. He appears somewhat distracted or tired, looking down towards his lap, beside a bright yellow hat placed on the dock.\n\nThe water in the background is shimmering under the light, likely sunlight, with small ripples suggesting a gentle movement in the water. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, portraying a simple yet engaging outdoor activity often associated with childhood.","title":"Family fishing from dock at cascade pond near Lake Placid New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550776","546800","552828","543220","544200","553914","544303","554517","543164","548737","552029","542564","550848","547004","543516","550851"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["girl","dock","rod","hair","ponytail","fishing","cushion","sleeveless","headband","sneaker"]}
