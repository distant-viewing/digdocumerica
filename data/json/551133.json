{"path":"551133.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph presents an expansive field scattered with tall pillars, the terrain covered in tall, dry grass. Two individuals are captured in the scene, providing a sense of activity and life amongst the otherwise still landscape. The first individual, a woman, is dressed in a white dress and appears to be walking with a pram, pushing it towards the right side of the frame. The second person, possibly a construction worker due to the helmet worn, is standing among the pillars, seeming to inspect or contemplate the surroundings.\n\nThe background features a continuation of these robust, concrete pillars which vary in height but are generally quite tall and cylindrical. They impose a somewhat industrial contrast to the natural, overgrown field. In the distant background, the silhouette of a hill can be seen, along with a hint of buildings that suggest the proximity of a more urban environment. Also noticeable in the far distance is a yellow vehicle, perhaps a school bus or a similar type of transportation, that adds a small burst of color to the otherwise earthy and neutral tones of the landscape and infrastructure. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of development in progress or perhaps a paused construction site, captured under a hazy sky that suggests it might be a warm, dusty environment.","title":"Supports for interstate 77 stand in space cleared by the Charleston urban renewal authority.
