{"path":"543222.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed and picturesque scene by the sea, featuring a man and a woman engaged in fishing from a pier. The woman, positioned in the foreground, is actively using a fishing rod, casting it into the water, while the man stands beside her, observing attentively. The woman is wearing a long-sleeve yellow knit top and blue jeans, and has dark, shoulder-length hair. Meanwhile, the man is shirtless, revealing a tanned back, and wears patterned brown pants.\n\nThe background showcases a calm, expansive sea with subtle ripples and several boats casually sailing at a distance under a clear sky. The side of the pier is visible along the bottom and left side of the frame, painted white with chipped paint and inscribed cautionary text about fishing regulations. The image evokes a sense of leisure, focusing on recreational fishing in a serene coastal setting. The atmosphere is peaceful, highlighted by the bright sunlight and vast, blue horizon.","title":"Fishing off the pier","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["552291","547884","548499","550851","553081","543240","545178","546222","546330","554008","549933","548738","546410","551393","549935","546972"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","pier","woman","sea","regulation","rod","man","shoulder","length","ripple"]}
