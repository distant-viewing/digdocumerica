{"path":"543237.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene beach scene with a rugged, rocky backdrop. The beach is lined with numerous dark-colored rocks of various sizes scattered across the sandy shore. The sand itself appears soft and is marked by tire tracks, suggesting the recent passage of a vehicle.\n\nTowards the center of the image, a lone individual is seen standing on the beach, facing towards the ocean and the rocky cliffs. This person is dressed in light-colored clothing, including a long-sleeve shirt and pants, suitable for a breezy day at the beach. They seem to be either gazing at the sea or possibly taking a photograph.\n\nThe sea is relatively calm with gentle waves lapping at the shore. Despite the tranquility, the sky above looks overcast, giving the entire scene a slightly muted, cool tone that enhances the sense of isolation and peaceful solitude.\n\nThe impressive cliffs in the background are rugged and steep, contributing to the dramatic and natural beauty of the setting. Their textured surfaces are highlighted by the lighting, adding depth and interest to the photograph. The overall composition and the cool color palette convey a mood of reflective solitude and natural beauty.","title":"Sierra Club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557470","543055","543287","542976","543252","547612","543091","543078","546953","543250","543081","545173","545106","543299","551554","548757"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","cliff","solitude","shore","sea","passage","tire","beauty","interest","sand"]}
