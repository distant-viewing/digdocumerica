{"path":"552716.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a visually striking scene on a broad avenue with a vibrantly painted road surface. The road features an array of colorful stripes spanning its width in a multitude of colors like red, yellow, blue, green, and several shades in between. \n\nTwo individuals, a young girl and a slightly older girl, are walking across the road, hand in hand, from left to right. The younger girl, on the left, is dressed in green shorts and a dark top, while the older girl on the right wears a patterned skirt and a light-colored top. Both have dark hair and appear casually dressed for a day out.\n\nThe scene is set against a background of a tree-lined boulevard with parked cars on either side. It's a sunny day with shadows indicating it might be morning or evening. In the distance, a misty city skyline fades into the background, providing a contrast between the bustle of city life and the playful, colorful foreground created by the painted avenue.","title":"Crossing the painted road which extends east from the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
