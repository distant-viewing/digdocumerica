{"path":"552301.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a man actively engaged in a task involving ropes and buoys. He is dressed in casual work attire, consisting of a white baseball cap, a dark green sweatshirt, and blue jeans. His focus is intensely directed towards handling a rope, which is threaded through a series of sizable white buoys, arranged neatly in a straight line on a rough, wooden dock.\n\nThe man's posture is one of concentration and effort, as he appears to be either setting up or adjusting the buoys on the rope. The image captures a moment of hands-on, physical work, likely related to a marine or fishing activity given the presence of buoys, which are typically used in maritime settings for marking locations.\n\nThe background is out of focus, emphasizing the subject and his immediate environment, enhancing the viewer's attention on his activities. The setting seems to be outdoors, under overcast or subdued lighting conditions, contributing to a moody atmosphere. Nearby, there are additional equipments and structures that suggest this area is utilitarian, possibly part of a waterfront or dockside workspace. The composition of the photograph focuses closely on the man and his work with the buoys, providing a detailed snapshot of a specific, task-oriented moment.","title":"Ford Sexton, of Gig Harbor, makes a headline for a purse seine he will use in Alaska.
