{"path":"548103.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a pair of hands engaged in the intricate task of rope work, specifically splicing a line through a small wooden block, often used in maritime or nautical settings. The hands, belonging to an adult, exhibit signs of experience and labor, indicated by visible veins and slightly weathered skin. The person is handling a thick, twisted white rope, manipulating it through a small, narrow wooden pulley block that contains a metallic pin. The focus is solely on the activity and the hands, with a blurred background that hints at a wooden surface, possibly a deck or a workbench.\n\nThe image emphasizes manual skill and craftsmanship, with a strong sense of precision and care in the task being performed. The lighting and color saturation give an almost vintage feel to the moment captured, highlighting the texture and detail of the rope and the wood. The overall composition of the photograph brings the viewerâ€™s attention directly to the hands and the craft, illustrating a moment of skilled workmanship.","title":"Fisherman mends a net at st.
