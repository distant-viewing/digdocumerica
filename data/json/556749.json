{"path":"556749.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban scene focusing on public transportation and pedestrians. Several red and cream-colored buses are lined up on a city street, with the first bus carrying the number 51. The side of this bus has a safety notice instructing to \"Caution—Door Opens Outwards.” Additionally, there's a sign on the sidewalk by a pole, instructing that the location is a “CD Donation Zone.”\n\nThe central figure in the image is a young woman dressed in a light-colored jumpsuit, walking and holding a baby. The woman looks directly ahead, seemingly focused on her destination. The baby she holds appears calm and is looking towards the photographer.\n\nOther pedestrians include a man with a satchel and partially visible individuals who appear to be engaged in their own activities or conversations, clustered near the buses. In the foreground, a portion of another individual is captured from behind, observing the street scene, their head turned towards the buses. This person is dressed in a patterned garment that adds texture to the diverse urban setting.\n\nThe environment is bright, indicated by the clear weather and the shadows cast on the pavement, suggesting it is midday or early afternoon. There are bicycles parked along the sidewalk, hinting at a cyclist-friendly city area.\n\nThis image evokes a sense of daily life and movement in a bustling city, emphasizing modes of transportation and the variety of people that interact within this public space.","title":"Dial-a-ride radio-dispatched door-to-door buses line up at the train station in Haddonfield, New Jersey to operate as zone buses during the rush hour. At other times they picked up individual passengers at their home. The service began February, 1972, as a demonstration project between federal and state transportation departments, and ended in March, 1975. At its peak, the service transported about 1,000 riders a day, some 30 to 50 percent to or from the train station.","placename":"Haddonfield (N.J.)","location":"Haddonfield, New Jersey","nn1":["556809","556786","556806","556804","556203","549891","556742","551504","551471","551445","556791","546735","556746","551478","556807","546643"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","baby","pedestrian","sidewalk","city","jumpsuit","transportation","notice","mode","caution"]}
