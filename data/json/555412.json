{"path":"555412.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents a close-up view of two handwritten notices attached to a dark, presumably glass, surface at night. Above the notices, there is a partially visible sign that reads \"DUE TO LIMITED SUPPLY OF CAS,\" likely truncated from \"GAS.\"\n\nThe first notice, larger and located at the top, reads:\n\"WE WILL BE OPEN FOR SERVICE SATURDAY BUT WILL BE UNABLE TO PUMP ANY GASOLINE BECAUSE OF SHORT SUPPLY. OUR GAS PUMPS WILL OPEN AGAIN 6:00 A.M. MONDAY\"\nIt is signed at the bottom right corner with a name that appears to be \"Jack Garrison.\"\n\nThe second notice, below the first one, is smaller and reads:\n\"MOBIL STATION 1 MILE NORTH WILL BE OPEN SATURDAY & SUNDAY 'NO LIMIT'\"\nThe content of the notices suggests a situation of gasoline shortage where the station is unable to provide gasoline until a specified day, meanwhile, directing customers to another location where there is no limit on gasoline.\n\nThe overall composition and context suggest a scenario from the past, depicting a gasoline crisis or shortage, leading stations to post temporary service adjustments and directions.","title":"Out of gasoline signs were increasingly evident in Oregon during the month of October, 1973.
