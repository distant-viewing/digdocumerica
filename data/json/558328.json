{"path":"558328.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man and woman seated at a small round table, sharing a meal in what appears to be a cafeteria or dining hall that suggests a care facility setting. The man is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and khaki shorts, seated on a wooden chair. The woman is in a floral dress and seated in a wheelchair, with a blanket over her lap.\n\nOn the table, there are various items indicating a mealtime setting, including plates, cups, and a teapot, with the man appearing to be either serving food to the woman or assisting her with eating. Their expressions suggest a calm, caring interaction.\n\nIn the background, there is a Christian religious elementâ€”a crucifix hanging on the wall above a fire alarm. This hints that the setting could be affiliated with a religious organization. Additionally, there is a door with a nameplate labeled \"MSGR. ROLNES,\" implying the presence or office of a monsignor, further suggesting a religious context.\n\nThe ambient lighting and composition give the image a warm, intimate atmosphere, focusing on the moment of care and connection between the two individuals.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire.
