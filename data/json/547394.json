{"path":"547394.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a senior man standing in a barn-like setting. He wears practical farm attire, including a faded blue jean, a grey zip-up jacket with dark patches, possibly dirt or dust, and worn work boots, indicating he has been working. He is also wearing a cap. In his right hand, he carries a basket filled with eggs, suggesting he has been collecting them. The background is slightly darker, but numerous chickens can be seen behind him, clustered around the area and filling the scene with a sense of activity and rural life. The lighting is dim, with what appears to be natural light coming from a window straddling the top of the frame. The ground is littered with soil and small stones, accentuating the rough, working environment.","title":"John Dolezal, dressed for rain, in hen-house of his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
