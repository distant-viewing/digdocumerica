{"path":"544429.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph portrays a rugged, natural landscape characterized by striking geological features and sparse vegetation. In the foreground, several large boulders and patches of soil are visible, interspersed with small shrubs and scattered trees, predominantly conifers. The central focus of the composition is a broad, expansive view of a valley surrounded by steep cliffs and rock formations that exhibit a variety of red, orange, and brown hues typical of sedimentary rock formations.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large, standalone rock formation rises prominently, positioned between trees that anchor the foreground to the expansive view. Further into the scene, a small cluster of white and light-colored buildings can be seen, suggesting a small settlement or community. These buildings appear to be simple in structure, potentially mobile homes or modular constructions, loosely arranged along dirt roads that weave through the valley.\n\nThe background is dominated by a wide, open sky with dynamic cloud formations suggesting a breezy, possibly cool day. This cloud cover casts dappled shadows over the entire landscape, enhancing the texture and depth of the terrain.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of isolation and unspoiled natural beauty, typical of many Southwestern United States landscapes, which are characterized by their distinctive rock formations and resilient vegetation adapted to arid conditions. This kind of environment often attracts viewers with its unique topography and serene, expansive views.","title":"A Navajo community","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545791","544950","552690","545800","544745","545696","545804","545792","545783","543838","544392","545805","544453","544376","545799","545754"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","rock","valley","adapt","attract","conifer","anchor","weave","boulder","topography"]}
