{"path":"548947.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a striking aerial view of a massive dam and its surrounding landscape. The dam itself seems constructed of concrete, curving gently across the frame and holding back a large body of deep blue water. There are several towers rising from the dam structure, and a road runs along the top of the dam, bending around the reservoir in a sweeping curve.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is rugged and mountainous, characterized by sharp rocky outcrops and a barren, desert-like terrain that has an arid appearance. The colors are predominantly shades of brown and gray, suggesting a harsh, dry climate. In the background, the mountains stretch into the distance, forming a dramatic and inhospitable backdrop.\n\nThe infrastructure related to the dam includes winding roads that carved through the landscape, connecting various facilities and viewpoints. The roads are noticeable by their smooth, black tarmac which contrasts sharply with the natural surroundings. There appears to be minimal vegetation, underscoring the arid environment of the region.\n\nIn the foreground, right next to the dam, the water from the reservoir is calm and mirrors the clear sky above, reflecting a deep blue hue. This view emphasizes the engineering achievement represented by the dam and the stark beauty of the natural environment in which it is set. The photograph captures both the grandeur of human engineering and the ruggedness of the natural landscape.","title":"Hoover dam on the Colorado river.
