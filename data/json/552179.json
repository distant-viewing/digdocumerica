{"path":"552179.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene with numerous prominent features. At its forefront is a wide body of water, reflective and calm, stretching across the bottom portion of the photograph. Lining the far edge of the water are various industrial buildings and structures. These buildings vary in size and shape but primarily appear as mid to large-sized facilities constructed with metal and possibly concrete. They sport utilitarian design elements, typical of industrial architecture, with angular sections and large cargo doors.\n\nThe most notable features are the several tall smokestacks scattered throughout the industrial complex. Thick plumes of white smoke or steam billow out of these stacks, rising high into the air and dispersing into the cloudless sky. The sky serves as a stark, light blue backdrop, highlighting the white smoke and contrasting sharply with the industrial grays and muted colors below.\n\nThe overall scene conjures thoughts of manufacturing or energy production, suggesting significant industrial activity. There are no visible people or moving objects in the image, suggesting the photo aims more to capture the essence of the place rather than specific events or activities occurring at the time. The photograph combines elements of human engineering and natural elements in a composition that speaks to both industrial might and environmental impact.","title":"St.  Regis kraft pulp mill on commencement bay","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550344","550868","550956","546087","551576","545987","547696","550869","550332","548068","547084","544328","548340","545236","557225","550761"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["might","smoke","disperse","occur","engineering","aim","production","thought","cargo","billow"]}
