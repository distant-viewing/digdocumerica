{"path":"543010.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene juxtaposed with industrial activity. In the foreground, three cows graze peacefully on a lush green meadow. The cows are silhouetted and spread out across the frame, which gives a serene and naturalistic feel to this part of the image.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features an industrial setting where large plumes of white smoke billow from multiple stacks. These smoke clouds dominate the upper third of the image, suggesting significant industrial operations. In the middle ground, various farm buildings, possibly barns or storage facilities, are visible. These buildings appear to be part of the farm environment rather than the industrial complex.\n\nThe overall composition uses the layering of these elements to create a thought-provoking contrast between agricultural peace and industrial activity. The lighting and the clarity of the sky also suggest that the photograph was taken on a clear day, which further enhances the visibility of the smoke clouds against the blue sky.","title":"Farm with wood chip burner","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["543012","549214","546130","555645","545989","553842","543668","544676","546398","543159","545013","550997","546394","553933","552091","549191"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["cow","smoke","farm","layering","meadow","peace","third","cloud","barn","thought"]}
