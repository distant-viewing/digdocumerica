{"path":"546039.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image portrays a suburban scene with a distinct industrial backdrop. In the foreground, a street intersection sign displays \"Chalmette Cir\" and \"Livingston St,\" positioned at the corner of a manicured lawn bordered by a sidewalk. A child on a bicycle rides along the sidewalk, dressed in a red top and blue shorts, passing in front of a single-story brick house typical of mid-20th century American suburbs. The house features a prominent, steeply pitched gable roof and a neatly trimmed front yard.\n\nThe central visual tension in the photo arises from the large smokestack visible in the background, which emits a substantial plume of dark smoke into the sky, juxtaposing the domestic tranquility of the suburban setting with industrial activity. The smokestack serves as a reminder of the proximity of industrial operations to residential areas, and it dominates the skyline behind the serene neighborhood scene. The overall composition captures a slice of everyday life, possibly hinting at environmental or societal commentary regarding the interplay between residential living and industrial impact.","title":"The Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack spreads fumes over the residential area in the Chalmette section.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["551074","545246","551075","551145","550187","545388","551072","546035","551146","551152","556584","557300","557213","550166","550196","545437"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["sidewalk","smokestack","suburb","reminder","tension","house","commentary","front","ride","bicycle"]}
