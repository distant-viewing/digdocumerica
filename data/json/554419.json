{"path":"554419.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an active logging scene in a dense, wooded area. In the foreground, several large cut logs are stacked horizontally, with one individual standing on the left side of the frame observing the scene. This person is dressed in dark clothing, possibly a dark shirt and pants.\n\nCentrally in the image is a large, industrial log loader handling a tree trunk. The loader is painted yellow and features a powerful mechanical arm positioned vertically, lifting the trunk at an angle. The back of the operatorâ€™s cabin on the loader can be seen, suggesting the presence of an operator inside, though not clearly visible.\n\nThe background is populated with tall, green trees filling the space with a variety of tones of green, indicating a rich, forested environment. The sky is slightly overcast, giving the surroundings a soft, diffused light. \n\nThe overall composition combines elements of human activity, mechanical intervention in nature, and the natural forest environment, presenting a scene of industrial forestry with a focus on the machinery and the scale of the logging operation.","title":"A heel-boom loader (the only one in the northeast) operating on Litchfield Paper Company lands near Tupper Lake","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554416","554418","542623","542790","542856","542616","542769","554427","542624","555472","552201","548155","545046","542770","550337","554417"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["loader","operator","log","trunk","forestry","cut","intervention","logging","cabin","arm"]}
