{"path":"557766.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at a rural gas station, likely in the mid to late 20th century. The image shows two people with a cream-colored vintage convertible Volkswagen Beetle. The car's black soft convertible top is pulled back, revealing its interior.\n\nOne person, who appears to be a woman, is sitting in the driver’s seat with the door open. She seems relaxed, wearing a short red dress, and has her arms resting atop the steering wheel and the side of the open door. \n\nThe other individual, also appearing to be a woman, is standing at the trunk of the car, which is open. She is actively engaged in checking or fixing something inside the trunk, leaning forward with her back toward the camera. She is wearing shorts and a striped tank top, with her hair pulled back, which speaks to a casual, possibly hot day.\n\nThe setting includes a vintage gas pump station, indicated by a few analog dial pump machines standing beside the car. This old-style pump station contrasts with the modern essence of the car, providing a nostalgic look into past automotive and roadside culture.\n\nThe background features a quiet street with a grassy knoll sloping upwards, leading to houses with peaked roofs and simple, home-style architecture, typical of rural American towns. There’s another vehicle visible in the background, further reinforcing the period setting and possibly indicating the kind of vehicles common at the time.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is informal and calm, a slice of life from a bygone era, depicting routine activities in a simple setting.","title":"Volkswagen being serviced in front of the H.C.
