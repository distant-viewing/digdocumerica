{"path":"545237.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a leisurely scene at a sandy beach. In the foreground, there are two classic cars parked with their trunk lids open, possibly indicating that the occupants are using items from the trunks for their beach outing. One car is dark blue and the other is black, both of coupe design, reflecting a vintage style typical of sports or muscle cars from around the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nAdjacent to the cars on the sandy beach, a small group of people is visible. There are three individuals: two lying on the sand close together and one sitting up. They seem to be relaxing and enjoying a casual interaction or conversation. They are adjacent to two folding, aluminum lawn chairs with green and white stripes, suggesting a planned stay at the beach.\n\nThe beach itself appears wide with calm waves gently breaking on the shore, indicating mild weather conditions. The sky is mostly clear with few clouds, suggesting a sunny day, which is consistent with the people's choice to spend time outdoors.\n\nThis scene conveys a relaxed, recreational atmosphere typical of beach outings, featuring vintage cars and casual beach gear, emphasizing enjoyment and leisure.","title":"On this beach cars are restricted to one area. On most other Washington beaches, motorists can drive anywhere.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547499","547478","550934","545857","545252","557475","550925","547495","550922","550933","545849","548698","550921","546412","550935","543474"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","car","outing","trunk","folding","coupe","aluminum","lid","occupant","choice"]}
