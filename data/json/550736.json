{"path":"550736.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene centered on a set of vibrant, cascading waterfalls. The falls tumble over a series of rocky levels, with the water appearing powerful and frothy as it crashes down into a calmer river at the foreground. The rocks around the waterfall are jagged grey and partially covered with deep green vegetation, creating a rough, natural texture.\n\nOn the left side of the waterfall, there is notable graffiti painted on the rocks, adding a touch of human influence to the otherwise natural scene. This juxtaposition of nature and urban elements is echoed in the background of the photo.\n\nIn the background behind the waterfalls, the scene shifts to an urban environment, showcasing red and beige industrial buildings typical of a factory or mill setup. There are visible architectural features like a smokestack and flat roofs, suggesting a mid-20th-century industrial design. Tall, densely foliaged trees line the area between the waterfalls and the buildings, partially obscuring the full view of the structures and blending the natural and man-made components of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat moody, conveyed by the overcast sky that casts soft, muted lighting over the entire landscape, enhancing the vividness of the greenery and the rough textures of both the natural and built environments.","title":"Great Falls and part of the city of Lewiston seen from the Auburn side of the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["553389","550738","553354","553386","557745","550857","553340","545874","553387","542698","550697","542699","542594","553349","543578","555073"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","echo","graffiti","crash","rock","mill","shift","vividness","cascade","influence"]}
