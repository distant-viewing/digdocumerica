{"path":"547944.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a visually striking scene centered around electrical and railway infrastructure. Dominating the foreground is an iconic “Railroad Crossing” sign, composed of two wooden boards in an “X” shape, with the words \"RAILROAD\" and \"CROSSING\" painted in white on a black background. Attached to the top of this crossing sign are two black circular lights and possibly a bell, elements typically used to alert approaching vehicles when a train is near. \n\nThe background features a large electricity pylon constructed of metal, with a complex network of wires and cables stretched across its frame, extending out towards additional pylons visible in the distance. This network creates an intricate lattice against the sky. The pylon’s geometric structure contrasts with the organic silhouettes of the wires and adds industrial texture to the composition. \n\nThe overall ambiance is somewhat dramatic, with the silhouette effect lending an air of mystery and emphasizing the mechanical and man-made against the twilight sky, which is subtly illuminated, giving a hint of either dawn or dusk. This lighting casts the entire scene in silhouette, highlighting shapes and forms while softening finer details. The scene encapsulates a moment of quietude, typically unseen and unappreciated elements of everyday infrastructure dramatically captured through photography.","title":"Transmission lines and railroad crossing at electrical power station on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547940","544681","547711","544706","544613","543903","556783","546389","543007","548848","543728","544732","544355","548849","553830","551030"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pylon","crossing","silhouette","wire","network","shape","lattice","electricity","bell","infrastructure"]}
