{"path":"548926.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a stretch of a wide river. On the river, there are at least five boats speeding, each creating a distinct wake pattern that fans out dramatically behind them. The photograph captures the boats from behind and afar, as they move away from the lower part of the image towards the upper part. \n\nOn the left side of the river, thereâ€™s an organized shoreline with what appears to be a mixture of small buildings, possibly industrial or residential, adjacent to areas that seem to be under development or used for storage. There are docks visible, suggesting this side might be utilized for commercial or recreational purposes. The terrain beyond the riverbank transitions into a flat landscape with sparse vegetation.\n\nOn the right side of the river, the landscape is more natural and undeveloped, covered with low shrubs and trees. In the far background, one can see a mountain range under a clear sky, adding to the picturesque setting.\n\nThe water itself shimmers under what seems to be bright sunlight, highlighting the white frothy trails left by the boats. The overall atmosphere of the photograph indicates a leisure or sporting activity taking place in a calm and sunny environment.","title":"Boating on the Colorado River below Parker Dam","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548921","548934","548939","551208","549066","542697","547708","548935","548077","551218","548081","551993","549458","549088","551209","550840"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","boat","sporting","fan","shimmer","wake","speed","utilize","trail","mixture"]}
