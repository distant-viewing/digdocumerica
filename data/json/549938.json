{"path":"549938.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a landfill operation under a clear sky. In the foreground, we see uneven, muddy ground strewn with a variety of discarded items, such as papers, plastics, and other refuse, highlighting the massive amount of waste being processed. The center of the image features heavy machinery at work: a large bulldozer, pushing and organizing piles of garbage, is prominent, with dark smoke emanating from its exhaust, indicating its operation. The bulldozer is accompanied by a truck to its left, partly cut by the edge of the image, involved in the transport or management of the waste.\n\nThe background reveals a tree line far off in the distance, barely discernible beyond the mounds of disposed items. The overall scenery is a stark portrayal of environmental impact, dominated by the dusty tones of the earth and the various colors of the waste materials spread across the site.","title":"Spreading and compacting garbage before covering it with one foot of earth.
