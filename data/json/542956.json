{"path":"542956.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, coastal scene under a hazy or misty atmosphere. The image is dominated by a dimly lit foreground featuring a group of five horses. The horses, varying in shades of brown and gray, are positioned almost centrally in the frame, seemingly grazing or standing idly on a grassy field. The scene is set against a backdrop of a tranquil ocean, which blends into a soft sky along the horizon. The glistening of the water suggests that the photograph was taken at a time when the sun was either setting or rising.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a small, distant structure that resembles a lighthouse or some kind of coastal building, along with possibly one or more human figures near it, though they are too small to discern distinctly. The presence of the structure adds a sense of scale and solitude to the vast landscape.\n\nMost noticeable is the overall muted color tonality, suggesting this might be an early color photograph or it has faded over time. The edges and corners of the image show slight wear and scratches, adding an element of age and nostalgia to the scene. The composition balances the natural and the tranquil elements of a coastal environment captured in a moment of quietude and simplicity.","title":"Horses pasture in fields near Little River Lighthouse.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543071","542972","543014","542806","542800","542622","552501","557186","556957","542885","551229","556958","542619","543726","554128","542870"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","lighthouse","scratch","quietude","nostalgia","show","time","kind","simplicity","corner"]}
