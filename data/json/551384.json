{"path":"551384.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a woman in a candid setting, possibly at a festival or a fair. She is wearing a pale yellow tank top and a matching headscarf with a floral pattern that suggests a casual, summery outfit. Her expression is slightly quizzical or thoughtful, with her eyebrows slightly furrowed and lips closed, and she appears to be engaged in a conversation or deep in thought.\n\nBehind her, there is a backdrop that includes a game booth wall, with large, colorful balloons (red, teal, and orange hues are visible) pinned to it, suggesting a playful, festive environment typically found at fairs. The woman's jewelry includes a simple necklace with a pendant, adding a subtle touch to her overall look. The lighting in the photo is natural, casting soft shadows on her face and highlighting her features gently.","title":"Operator of dart-throwing, balloon-breaking concession at Bagnell Dam amusement strip","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["556150","556134","544742","556414","556412","556151","554923","553165","557114","557901","553916","557039","543864","553499","553275","544311"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["jewelry","teal","balloon","lip","necklace","headscarf","festival","booth","game","thought"]}
