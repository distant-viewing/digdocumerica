{"path":"546746.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a Metropolitan Police vehicle, specifically marked as belonging to the Washington D.C. police force, identified by a badge with an emblem featuring an image of the U.S. Capitol building. The vehicle, appearing to be an older model truck, is painted white with blue stripes running along its sides. On the door of the truck, the police emblem is clearly visible and labeled \"Metropolitan Police.\"\n\nThe cab of the truck has a large window, and through this, an individual can be seen sitting, though their details are not clear due to the perspective and focus of the image. On top of the truck, a red beacon light, along with another similar light, is mounted, indicating the vehicle's capacity for emergency signaling.\n\nAdjacent to the police truck is another part of a vehicle, possibly related to towing or lifting, suggesting that this police truck might be equipped for specific utility purposes, perhaps for traffic control or road incident management. This evident hardware includes what seems to be a controlled lifting mechanism.\n\nThe background is blurred with traces of greenery and distant automotive or architectural structures, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the police truck and its immediate surroundings. This setting suggests the photograph was taken on a roadway or an area frequently accessed by vehicles.","title":"Police tow truck","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546638","546641","546649","542755","546645","546634","546654","546661","555447","546647","546653","546635","546631","542758","554309","554369"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["police","truck","lifting","emblem","vehicle","hardware","incident","capacity","cab","emergency"]}
