{"path":"553608.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of manual labor in a forestry setting. A man wearing a white hard hat, a light-colored t-shirt, and dark pants is engaged in cutting a large, felled tree with a chainsaw. The chainsaw, clearly in active use, is throwing off a spray of wood chips, indicating the force and motion of the work. The man is bent over his task, focused intensely on cutting through the tree trunk.\n\nBehind the man, a large bulldozer is positioned. It is yellow with visible signs of use and dirt, typical of heavy machinery used in such environments. The bulldozer's presence suggests that it is likely used for moving heavy logs or clearing areas in the forest.\n\nThe background reveals a forested environment with blurry trees and possibly overcast skies that suggest a secluded and perhaps damp setting, typical of a forest logging area. The ground is scattered with branches, wood debris, and other elements indicative of recent logging activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the intensity and physical nature of forestry work, while also highlighting the tools and machinery essential in such operations.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
