{"path":"555445.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a prominently featured large sign mounted high, likely on a building or a standalone structure. The sign contains two backlit panels, each with a marquee-style format where letters can be switched out. The text on these panels is arranged in bold red capital letters and carries a striking message: \"IT'S NOT RAIN YOU KNOW IT'S RAINING KILOWATTS.\" The playful message underscores an emphasis on electricity consumption or generation, possibly referencing heavy electrical use or a weather condition causing high electricity production, such as storm-driven wind turbines.\n\nAbove and to the right of the sign, there is a large circular clock with a golden rim, featuring black hands on a warmly lit yellow face. The time on the clock appears to be just past 10:00. The positioning of the clock, with its classic design, contrasts with the modern message of the sign, adding a layer of juxtaposition to the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph is subtly lit and predominantly features a dusky sky, suggesting the photo was taken either in early morning or late evening. Overall, the composition effectively juxtaposes time and energy themes, underscored by the blending of visual elements from different eras or contexts.","title":"Lack of rain turned into a message on an outdoor advertising sign, asking people to conserve their energy output during the fuel crisis in late 1973 in the pacific northwest","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555410","556128","555380","555456","555439","555389","547944","549188","548674","555442","555421","542794","555464","544296","545241","555404"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["clock","message","electricity","letter","panel","sign","blending","consumption","capital","switch"]}
