{"path":"551896.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a male individual sitting at a desk in a control room-like environment filled with surveillance or monitoring equipment. The individual, likely a security or military personnel given the uniform, is wearing a white shirt adorned with badges and rank insignia, black tie, and dark trousers. He has a serious expression on his face, and his arms rest on the desk, hinting at a formal pose for the camera.\n\nThe desk in front of him features an array of buttons and switches, indicative of control or communication functions. To his left, there's a blur of motion, possibly another person moving, emphasizing a busy work environment.\n\nThe background is noteworthy, lined with multiple black-and-white television screens embedded into a tan-colored wall, displaying various images that might be security feeds. There's also a large map mounted on one wall, suggesting this could be a location-specific monitoring station, potentially for traffic or public safety.\n\nAbove, the ceiling is dark with a grid design, punctuated by rows of small, bright ceiling lights providing ample illumination. The overall tone of the setting is professional and serious, reflecting a space dedicated to surveillance and operational control.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day, controls all traffic lights, receives remote TV inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551916","551901","551905","551902","551900","551904","549378","551903","542668","555334","557394","547720","551898","551915","552375","557317"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["desk","surveillance","security","control","ceiling","feed","insignia","television","switch","personnel"]}
