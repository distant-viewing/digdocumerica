{"path":"549369.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of scuba divers preparing for a dive on the deck of a boat. The setting suggests a cool, overcast day, evidenced by the subdued lighting and overcast sky visible in the background.\n\nThree men are the primary subjects in this picture:\n1. The leftmost individual is wearing a bright orange buoyancy control device (BCD) over a black wetsuit, adjusting something around his waist area.\n2. The central figure, also in a black wetsuit, is wearing a darker (possibly black) BCD. He is gazing down, possibly at some diving gear or instrument in his hands.\n3. The man on the right is most engaged with a piece of equipment, holding a camera housing or underwater light, looking intently at it. He, too, is dressed in a black wetsuit with a similar BCD.\n\nAll three are equipped with diving masks pulled up to their heads and flippers, which suggests they are gearing up for underwater activity. Other pieces of diving gear scattered around include more flippers, an inflatable signal buoy marked \"Saab\", an air cylinder, and a yellow plastic crate, likely containing additional equipment or supplies.\n\nThe deck itself shows details typical of a diving or fishing vessel, like coiled ropes, netting hanging in the background, and wooden planks. The water is calm, and a distant coastline can be seen, providing a tranquil maritime setting. The overall atmosphere is busy yet organized, with a focus on the preparations for the dive.","title":"Scientist prepare to dive from the Vila Velebita II, research ship of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["544388","552276","554614","549347","549265","544129","555834","554613","555830","555831","543065","555833","549359","556597","555832","547134"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["diving","wetsuit","dive","gear","deck","diver","coil","cylinder","piece","crate"]}
