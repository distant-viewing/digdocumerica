{"path":"549955.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph features a young person wading through shallow water at a waterfront. The primary focus is on the person who is visible in the foreground. This individual, appearing to kick gently through the water, is holding a small pail or bucket in their left hand. They are dressed in blue shorts patterned with white details.\n\nIn the background, there is a small group of individuals by a boat moored in slightly deeper water. Those individuals seem to be engaging in various activities, possibly preparing to board or disembark from the boat. The setting is tranquil, emphasized by the clear and calm water, and the atmosphere suggests a leisurely day at the lake or river. The lighting in the photograph primarily casts a soft and natural tone, indicating it might be taken during the late afternoon or early evening.","title":"Fun in the Hudson River off Croton Point Park","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["542556","552940","544200","550240","550236","547913","543942","550227","544197","553431","546336","544302","553429","550231","551310","547727"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["individual","boat","person","water","bucket","waterfront","short","evening","lake","afternoon"]}
