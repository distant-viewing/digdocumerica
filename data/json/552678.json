{"path":"552678.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene dominated by an older man standing atop a haystack. He is wearing a denim jacket, a red scarf, glasses, and a wide-brimmed hat which suggests outdoor, farm-related work. He appears to be in the process of handling or sorting the hay, with a pitchfork leaning against the stack beside him.\n\nThe background is predominantly a pale, overcast sky, giving the scene a softened daylight ambiance. The image's overall color palette is muted with earthy tones that evoke a serene and somewhat timeless rural setting. The focus is primarily on the man and his interaction with the haystack, depicting a moment of everyday farm life. The photograph possesses a granular texture typical of film photography, adding to its rustic charm.","title":"Frank Starbuck, last of the old time ranchers near Fairview manages a spread of 1300 acres and 400 head of cattle.
