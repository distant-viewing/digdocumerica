{"path":"547046.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image features a chain-link fence that dominates the foreground, serving as a boundary to a coastal area. Attached to the fence at the center is a weathered sign with red lettering on a faded white background which reads \"RESTRICTED AREA KEEP OUT.\" The camera's focus on the fence and the sign slightly blurs the background, which depicts a calm sea and a clear sky. In the blurred horizon, gentle clouds float against an expansive blue sky that gradients into deeper blue as it meets the ocean. The coastline peeking through the fence is rocky, with large boulders strewn about, foreshadowing a rugged landscape beyond the enclosure. The setting suggests a location meant to restrict public access, potentially for safety or environmental reasons. The atmosphere of the scene, considering the lighting and shadows, suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, given the soft sunlight.","title":"Illinois beach state park on lake Michigan.
