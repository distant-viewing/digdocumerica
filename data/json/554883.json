{"path":"554883.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic scene in a sheep pen. A man, appearing to be a shepherd or farm worker, walks through a packed enclosure filled with a large group of sheep. He is dressed casually in a blue short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and black shoes, conveying a sense of daily work attire suitable for farm activity. His expression and posture suggest activity and perhaps guiding or herding the sheep.\n\nThe pen itself is a basic wooden structure with fences and support beams made of rough timber. It is sheltered partially by a roof, which extends over the area where the sheep are gathered, providing them shade. The ground in the pen is muddy, indicating recent use or rainy weather.\n\nIn the surrounding environment outside the pen, we can see a landscape of sparse trees and open fields, hinting that the pen is located in a rural or pastoral setting. The light filtering through the trees suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThis image conveys a sense of rural life and animal husbandry, focusing on the interaction between the farm worker and the animals he tends, within a simple, functional structure designed for livestock management.","title":"Sheep in the process of being sheared on a ranch in the Leakey Texas, area near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["544391","554894","554880","554881","554886","547396","554882","547326","554928","554887","554884","554892","543690","552573","544317","548959"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["pen","sheep","farm","animal","worker","herd","enclosure","tend","livestock","timber"]}
