{"path":"546597.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a serene moment inside a bus or public transit where a young woman is engrossed in reading a book. She is seated, facing the window which allows natural light to illuminate her face. She appears composed and focused, with her eyes cast down towards the page. The woman has a stylish hairstyle typical of mid-20th century fashion, and she wears a thick, fluffy white collar that looks like faux fur, possibly part of a coat or jacket.\n\nIn the background, there are other passengers. One man directly behind her looks out the window, reflecting a passive interest in the outside view or perhaps deep in thought. There's a general blurriness to the other figures, giving a sense of the motion or the ambient activity inside the bus.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests a quiet, typical day of commuting, with individuals absorbed in their own worlds, highlighted by the womanâ€™s engagement with her book. The use of natural lighting and the composition focusing on the woman reading creates a focal point that draws the viewer into this peaceful moment captured during a routine bus ride.","title":"Morning rider on Shirley Highway (VA) express bus to Washington, DC","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556033","556796","556839","556795","556034","556743","556745","554370","549893","556800","556699","556834","556756","556776","555975","546593"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","woman","book","commuting","fur","collar","hairstyle","ride","transit","world"]}
