{"path":"544668.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban cityscape under a stormy sky. The composition is a rich blend of architectural styles, showcasing both modern and historic buildings. In the foreground and middle of the image, various building types can be observed, including what appears to be commercial structures with flat roofs. One prominently features advertising signage.\n\nDominating the central to right of the frame is a tall, historic building topped with a steep clock tower, identified by the \"Tribune\" sign, indicating it may house or be associated with a newspaper office. Adjacent to the left of this historic building is a much taller, modern skyscraper with a simple, stark facade that contrasts starkly with the ornate detailing of its neighbors. Another prominent building on the left has a \"UCB\" logo, implying it may be a corporate or bank office.\n\nThe lighting is notably dramatic, with dark, ominous clouds in the sky suggesting an impending storm. This adds a moody, almost cinematic quality to the scene, emphasizing the silhouettes and architectural details of the buildings. The overall palette is subdued with shades of blue and gray, enhancing the stormy atmosphere and giving a somewhat timeless feel to the photograph.","title":"Before the storm","placename":"Oakland (Calif.)","location":"Oakland, California","nn1":["544660","553821","548328","548408","545255","552251","548384","552265","551455","552252","550007","549997","549971","557233","555736","550011"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["stormy","office","building","neighbor","styles","clock","advertising","newspaper","identify","observ"]}
