{"path":"558040.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a moody and atmospheric scene in what appears to be a cemetery. The primary focus is on a large, imposing gravestone, which is prominently displayed in the foreground. This gravestone, occupying most of the image, features engraved text, although the details are difficult to read due to the lighting and angle.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of tall, slender trees that rise starkly against the sky, creating a silhouette effect. This gives the photograph a somber and solemn tone. The light appears to be dim, suggesting it might be either dawn, dusk, or an overcast day, which intensifies the gravitas and quietude of the cemetery setting.\n\nThe overall composition and the use of natural lighting amplify the feelings of solitude and introspection commonly associated with such locations. The absence of visible human figures or activity further underscores the stillness and the eternal nature of the setting.","title":"Grave of the reverend abraham bronson in the cemetery at Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
