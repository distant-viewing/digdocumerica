{"path":"557501.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a multifaceted landscape that combines urban and natural elements. Most prominently, the image showcases a network of highways that intersect and wrap around several bodies of water, including a large lake-like feature at the foreground and a winding river running towards the top right corner, surrounded by patches of greenery.\n\nOn both sides of these water bodies, there are vast urban areas with dense clusters of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The cityscape extends to the horizon, with no visible boundary to its sprawl. In the background to the left, there appears to be the coastline with what looks like the ocean, suggesting the proximity of this urban setting to a sea or large lake. \n\nAdditionally, smaller patches of green can be seen throughout the urban area, indicating parks or other forms of managed vegetation. The network of roads includes complex intersections and bridge structures, facilitating traffic flow across the different parts of the area. One of the bridges seen spans across the main river, linking the urban expanses on either side.\n\nThe topographical variety, from flat urban areas to rippling waters bordered by more rugged terrains, alongside the well-developed infrastructure, suggests a densely populated and heavily developed urban environment located close to natural water sources.","title":"Aerial of Buena Vista Lagoon. It is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. There is concern the wildlife sanctuary is endangered because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and it has resulted in increased land use pressures.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["546578","555762","549478","555745","550557","549480","552223","546574","546573","553559","546616","548344","546581","547765","545892","546673"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["network","bridge","sprawl","span","lake","infrastructure","intersection","river","water","source"]}
