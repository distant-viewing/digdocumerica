{"path":"550279.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated rural scene, suggestive of abandonment and economic decline. In the foreground, there is an overgrown field with tall, dry grass, and a rusty, red car that is partially visible among the weeds. The car appears to be in a state of disrepair.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a small, run-down wooden building with a facade that includes a sign reading \"Used Cars\" in faded paint. The structure has two windows and a door, all appearing old and weather-beaten, with broken or boarded-up parts evident. This building looks to be formerly a commercial space, now neglected and partly collapsing.\n\nIn the background, there are leafy trees in full bloom, suggesting the season is spring. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its combination of natural overgrowth and decaying human-made elements, conveys a strong sense of place and time, typifying a deserted or economically forgotten part of rural America. The scene evokes feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, hinting at stories of better days gone by and the relentless passage of time.","title":"Abandoned shack, junked truck on northeast corner of routes 113 and 58","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["554561","556313","550797","556330","547535","547771","552673","544809","547782","543354","550144","557701","547587","550795","552997","553007"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["typify","overgrowth","beat","forget","collapse","weed","decline","nostalgia","go","time"]}
