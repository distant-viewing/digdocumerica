{"path":"549583.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant moment during a parade, featuring a beautifully adorned horse. The horse, central to the image, is clad in a striking red and gold decorative covering with elaborate tassels and emblems, signifying a ceremonial or celebratory function. The horse's gear includes polished brass fittings and its mane is neatly groomed, enhancing its majestic appearance.\n\nBehind the horse, the backdrop is composed of a large, modern building with many rectangular windows reflecting the sky and clouds. The structure's facade gives a stark, linear contrast to the rounded and organic forms of the horse and the gathered audience.\n\nThe sun, positioned directly above the building, appears as a radiant starburst effect caused by the camera's interaction with the intense light, adding a dramatic and somewhat surreal quality to the scene.\n\nOn either side of the street, spectators of various ages and appearances are seated and standing, focused on the procession. They are casually dressed, typical of a public event audience, and appear engaged and entertained.\n\nThe image captures movement and celebration, set against the static, urban environment of the high-rise building, under a clear, bright sky. It artfully combines elements of tradition and modernity, public celebration, and architectural starkness.","title":"Magnificent animals in brilliant trappings are among the sights that draw people by the thousands to the \"old milwaukee days\" annual circus parade","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["549576","549566","549574","557712","553716","557058","557062","549581","553717","547002","552651","553715","557716","557046","557051","549585"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","audience","celebration","procession","radiant","adorned","celebratory","mane","modernity","fitting"]}
