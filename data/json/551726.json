{"path":"551726.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene featuring two young children in an open, paved area. In the foreground, the two children can be seen walking alongside each other; one child is pushing a small red tricycle while the other walks beside. Both kids appear to be engaged in a conversation or some interaction, creating a casual, playful atmosphere.\n\nThe most striking element of the photograph is the large, geometric mural on the wall behind the children. This mural displays a bold pattern of triangles in a mix of red, blue, yellow, and white colors. The angled shapes form a vibrant and visually captivating background that contrasts sharply with the grayness of the ground and the simplicity of the urban environment.\n\nThe surrounding area includes visible urban features like a dark underpass to the right which adds a sense of depth and enclosure to the scene. The image's overall composition emphasizes a contrast between the vividness and creativity of the mural and the mundane, everyday setting in which the children play. This juxtaposition highlights a slice of childhood against a backdrop of urban life, offering a narrative of finding vibrancy and playfulness in unexpected places.","title":"Children playing beneath eye-catching mural in a small city park on the corner of 29th street and second avenue in eastside Manhattan.
