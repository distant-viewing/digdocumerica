{"path":"553258.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features an abstract composition with two main elements against a predominantly black background. On the left side of the frame is an object that resembles a blurred, moving fish, displaying a brilliant spectrum of colors including reds, blues, and yellows. This object appears dynamic, as if captured in motion, with a trailing effect that emphasizes its swift movement.\n\nOn the right side, a cluster of objects resembling pale, translucent balloons or orbs are grouped together. These orbs are soft in focus, giving them a ghostly, ethereal appearance. They vary slightly in size and are overlapped in a way that suggests depth, adding a three-dimensional quality to the image.\n\nThe contrasting elements — the vivid, colorful \"fish\" and the muted, serene \"balloons\" — create a striking visual dichotomy. The dark background enhances the subjects, making the colors and forms stand out more prominently, and contributes to the overall mysterious and abstract nature of the image.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
