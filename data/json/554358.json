{"path":"554358.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a large, towering pile of compressed scrap materials. The image shows numerous cube-shaped bales of various compacted materials stacked haphazardly on top of each other. Each bale is densely packed with assorted debris and appears to be bound by metal wire, likely to maintain its shape.\n\nThe content of the bales includes smashed and crumpled metal parts, fragments of vehicle parts, bits of plastic, fabrics, and possibly other types of municipal or industrial waste. Some parts retain recognizable shapes, like a portion of a metallic object or a crushed piece of electronic equipment, but most are rendered unidentifiable due to the compression.\n\nIn the composition, the overall tone is grimy and dark with colors predominantly reflecting the grays of metals, browns of rust, and miscellaneous darker tones, suggesting oxidation and aging. There are spots of lighter material, likely papers or light plastics, that provide visual contrast.\n\nThe background of the image is a dull, overcast sky, enhancing the somber mood of the photograph. This setting is possibly a recycling plant or a scrapyard where such materials are stored and processed.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["550880","554301","550882","557308","554318","547611","554300","554304","550881","554357","554320","550265","546261","547625","548109","548147"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bale","material","plastic","metal","shape","scrapyard","recycling","fragment","scrap","aging"]}
