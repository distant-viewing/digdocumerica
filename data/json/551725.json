{"path":"551725.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of an urban playground, set between old brick buildings with a glimpse of a city skyline in the background, notably featuring the Empire State Building. The playground consists of a wooden structure, which seems to be a series of interconnected platforms and posts, likely designed for climbing and exploration. It has a rustic and rugged appearance, with some graffiti visible on the wood, adding a sense of urban grit.\n\nIn the foreground, two children are actively engaged with the playground equipment. One child, wearing a striped shirt and jeans, is standing confidently on a high platform, looking out over the scene. The other child, dressed in a light-colored top and darker shorts, is busily climbing up one of the wooden posts, displaying a moment of action and effort.\n\nThe environment around the playground suggests a densely built area with limited green space, as evidenced by the dense foliage peeking through behind the buildings and the limited open area visible in the photograph. The overall mood of the image is one of youthful adventure and play amidst an urban background, capturing a moment of childhood exploration and activity.","title":"Play area of park at 29th street and second avenue--a good example of an attractive park whose basis is stone rather than grass","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555928","547188","556166","555901","547875","549674","555931","557987","551724","555946","549666","545867","549274","551720","546562","551924"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["playground","child","post","exploration","platform","climbing","graffito","childhood","peek","adventure"]}
