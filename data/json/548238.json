{"path":"548238.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage urban scene, likely from the 1960s or 1970s, showcasing a tranquil street that brings together elements of residential architecture and automotive history. In the forefront, a yellow car, possibly a muscle car from the era, is captured in motion, passing through the street, which appears to be a typical residential area.\n\nThe surroundings suggest an older neighborhood with distinct features. The houses, which visibly line the left side of the street, display a traditional architectural style with clapboard siding, evident by their alignment and construction details. Some of the houses have front extensions with large windows, resembling porches or small conservatories, adding to the quaint charm of the street.\n\nThe street itself appears worn, with patches of snow or melting ice, hinting at a colder season, though not heavily laden with snow. The presence of bare branched trees reinforces the chill in the air. There is minimal pedestrian or vehicular activity aside from the central yellow car, providing a sense of quietude and slow pace. \n\nIn further detail, the photograph shows signs like \"NO PARKING\" visible in the background, indicating regulated traffic measures within the neighborhood. Another car is parked farther down the street, and a streetside lamp post is also visible, which provides a historical context regarding the urban planning and public amenities of the time.\n\nIn the background, the road curves slightly and leads to more residential structures with similar architectural features, preserving the coherence of the neighborhoodâ€™s design and historical era. This elicits a nostalgic sense of a bygone era of neighborhood design, car design, and everyday life.","title":"Labrador sleeps in the middle of the street in dock square center of rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["556709","551119","549287","555922","551021","556718","557155","545419","556707","548489","556724","557288","549882","557692","556435","554297"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["neighborhood","street","car","era","snow","chill","melte","regulate","design","regard"]}
