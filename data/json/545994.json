{"path":"545994.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene characterized by a large, thick plume of dark smoke rising into the sky from an industrial facility. In the foreground, there is tall, dry grass that gives the impression of a rural or semi-rural setting. The middle ground of the photo shows several large storage tanks and industrial structures, including a tall vertical tank with what appears to be a chimney or exhaust stack. There are no visible flames, but the volume and color of the smoke suggest a significant fire or an industrial accident causing heavy pollution.\n\nThe sky is visible above and around the smoke, suggesting that the photo was taken during the day under clear weather conditions. The industrial buildings are relatively non-descript, functional, and constructed with materials typical for such facilities, like metal sidings and frameworks. The scene does not include any visible people, suggesting the photo was taken from a distance or from a restricted area, focusing mainly on the environmental impact of the incident depicted. The overall composition balances the natural elements in the foreground with the dramatic industrial scene behind, creating a stark contrast between the natural environment and industrial activity.","title":"A natural gas installation burns its petro waste marshlands in foreground near the Freeport sulphur co.
