{"path":"548136.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph shows a landscape dominated by energy infrastructure, specifically high-voltage transmission towers. These large, metal lattice towers are evenly spaced in a line from the foreground to the middle ground of the frame. Each tower is connected by multiple power lines that stretch across the top, forming a linear pattern that spans the width of the image. The towers and lines are prominent against a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the background, there is a large industrial structure that appears to be a power plant or a dam. This structure is elongated, with several sections visible, and it sits at the base of a mountain range. The mountains rise steeply behind the plant, devoid of vegetation, and have a rugged texture which suggests a dry, arid environment.\n\nThe terrain is relatively flat in the area immediately around the towers and the plant, and the landscape is largely barren, hinting at a desert or semi-desert region. The overall scene is devoid of people or any moving objects, giving it a static and isolated feel. The photograph capturing this scene has a historical or dated quality, indicated by the tone and saturation of the colors.","title":"The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River has a powerhouse collection system.","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["549110","555574","544355","553028","544296","557977","544300","548145","543728","542524","544277","553830","546054","542643","544405","549011"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tower","plant","power","voltage","lattice","transmission","width","mountain","dam","line"]}
