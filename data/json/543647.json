{"path":"543647.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a picturesque natural landscape featuring a meandering river framed by imposing cliff faces. The river, appearing robust and muddy, curves gently through the composition, bordered by lush, verdant vegetation that includes shrubs and perhaps small trees. This greenery clusters densely along the riverbanks, contrasting crisply with the water's surface.\n\nDominating the background are sheer, towering cliffs that ascend abruptly from the flat terrain surrounding the river. These cliffs are predominantly stratified, showcasing horizontal layers that imply geological formation over many eons. The rock faces are a mosaic of dark purples and blues, likely accentuated by the soft light conditions, which suggest either early morning or late evening.\n\nThe sky, mildly overcast, casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, muting the colors and adding a sense of tranquility and timelessness to the landscape. There are no visible human elements or activities; the scene is wholly natural and serene, evoking a feeling of seclusion and untouched wilderness. The photograph captures not only the awe-inspiring beauty of these geological features but also the quiet and calming presence of the natural world.","title":"Colorado--near Gateway","placename":"Gateway (Colo.)","location":"Gateway, Colorado","nn1":["548156","548050","550562","550680","550700","542653","545301","545633","550560","545632","550542","542537","543793","550414","553452","550658"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["cliff","river","mosaic","timelessness","face","awe","seclusion","world","purple","curve"]}
