{"path":"545538.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a misty suburban scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The muted sunlight, diffused through the haze, hangs low in the sky above a line of identical, one-story residential buildings. These houses are simple in design, featuring flat roofs and dark-colored facades, and they stretch from the foreground into the mist-filled background along the left side of the image.\n\nIn the foreground, a young tree with slender branches and sparse foliage stands on the left side of the frame. It is positioned on what looks like a grassy verge beside a paved street that runs in front of the houses. The street is empty, enhancing the quiet, desolate feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somber and serene, with the fog softening the outlines of objects and scattering the light, creating a sense of stillness and isolation. The composition is balanced between the natural elements (the tree and the light) and the man-made structures (the row of houses), emphasizing the interaction between the environment and residential development.","title":"A community in north Birmingham, the area of the city most badly affected by pollution from the steel plants. The north Birmingham pipe plant is adjacent. The plant has no chimney to lift the smoke to a higher altitude. Often the smoke blankets the community. At times it is impossible to see ahead more than a few feet.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556425","550311","557025","547920","547567","557013","556333","556985","556950","556472","557427","546533","556601","550315","547292","556426"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","street","fog","stillness","outline","dawn","mist","haze","dusk","facade"]}
