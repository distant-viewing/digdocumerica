{"path":"557760.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a rural American scene, containing several interesting elements that contribute to a serene and residential atmosphere. The foreground prominently displays an unusual mailbox mounted on a weathered wooden post. The mailbox itself is metal and features names and addresses on two sides – \"Vernon Hunter\" and \"RS BE IN Baylor.\" Attached above the mailbox is a small red model truck, adding a distinctive and personal touch.\n\nBeyond the mailbox, a dirt driveway leads to a single-story house with a red facade and a dark shingled roof. The house is equipped with large windows and a porch, visible on the right side. There’s a row of blooming yellow plants in front of the house, possibly marigolds or similar flowers, providing a splash of bright colors against the red background.\n\nThe background of the image is heavily wooded, with dense green trees suggesting a secluded, forested area. To the left side of the house, at least three cars are parked along the driveway, implying the presence of family or visitors. No people are visible in the photograph, adding a quiet, undisturbed quality to the scene. The sky appears overcast, giving the colors in the photo a muted, soft tone.\n\nOverall, this photograph creates a narrative of rural life, personal expression through unique mailbox customization, and a peaceful living environment nestled in nature.","title":"Mailbox and home on Georgia highways 17/75 midway between Robertstown and Helen, which are a mile apart.
