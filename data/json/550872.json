{"path":"550872.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of a dark red tugboat on a body of water. The boat is shown from a side angle and features a curved bow with the numbers \"09576\" visible on it, possibly indicating the boat's identification or tonnage. The hull of the tugboat extends above the waterline, marked with a scale of numbers that measure the depth of the boat's draft.\n\nOn the upper deck of the tugboat, there are three crew members visible. They appear to be engaged in navigational activities, as two of them are looking forward from the vessel, perhaps monitoring the surroundings or coordinating the tug's movement. The third crew member seems to be operating or adjusting something on the dashboard or control panel.\n\nThe boat is equipped with various maritime necessities, including a life ring and navigational lights. There are also multiple lines and fenders visible, likely used for securing the tug when docking. On the deck, various equipment and materials are stored, including what looks like piled planks or boards.\n\nThe background features a glimpse of another water channel or similar tubular structure, but it is obscured and not the main focus. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day. The overall scene conveys a working environment focused on maritime activities, emphasizing the functionality of the tugboat in water navigation or docking operations.","title":"Coal freighter docked in canal at the Charmin Paper Company","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550893","550913","546845","546832","545073","546938","547694","550894","550892","548067","547194","550901","550043","555798","557815","546834"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","boat","crew","member","deck","number","fender","waterline","dashboard","identification"]}
