{"path":"545587.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a close, ground-level view of a dry, sandy terrain with various natural elements. The focus is on a trail of flattened, semi-circular objects—possibly dried cow dung—arranged in a line across the center of the image. Surrounding these objects are sparse, dry grasses and small desert plants. The soil is rough and sandy, indicative of a dry, arid climate, possibly a desert or semi-desert region. The background shows a similar landscape, but with denser vegetation, featuring more prominent shrubs and grasses under a bright, clear blue sky. The overall scene is sunlit, casting distinct shadows on the ground, emphasizing the roughness of the terrain and the dryness of the environment. The photograph might suggest a sense of isolation typical of arid landscapes, highlighting the survival of flora and the traces of fauna activity.","title":"Cattle grazing on this park land is scheduled to end by 1975.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553057","545341","545604","544428","545579","544401","545593","552435","545575","545843","549183","544019","555882","549179","555883","549133"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","fauna","survival","flatten","cow","trace","object","grass","dry","flora"]}
