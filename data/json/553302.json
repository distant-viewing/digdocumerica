{"path":"553302.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"In this photograph, a diverse group of people is captured in what appears to be a public, urban setting. Several individuals, including both men and women, are seen either standing or sitting on a series of concrete steps. The people present display a variety of 1970s attire, from suits and ties to casual shirts and flared trousers. Key focal elements include a man sitting centrally on the steps with a large sign, facing away from the camera, that reads “GOD CHOOSES AMERICA NOW INTERNATIONAL ONE WORLD CRUSADE CONVENTION CENTER THEATER DEC 4TH-6TH REV. SUN MYUNG MOON.”\n\nThe backdrop features a plain building facade with the visible signage of “DIENER & SMITH,” hinting that the setting might be near a business or commercial area. The photograph reveals a mix of engagement and indifference among the onlookers and passersby; some seem to be observing or engaging with the person holding the sign, while others are conversing among themselves or watching the area generally.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of public expression and varied social interaction, set against the everyday backdrop of a cityscape in the 1970s.","title":"'D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
