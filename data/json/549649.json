{"path":"549649.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an old-fashioned fuel station, most likely from the mid-20th century, set in a historic European square. Prominently in the foreground, there is a white fuel pump with the logo \"Esso\" on two visible sides. Beside the pump, there is a red and narrow fuel dispenser, also branded with the Esso logo and equipped with a hose and nozzle.\n\nThe background features an ornate architectural facade of a large building with Baroque details, including sculptural elements, pilasters, and elaborate window framing. The buildingâ€™s symmetry and decorative embellishments suggest that it might be part of a palace or an important civic structure.\n\nThe asymmetric placement of the modern fuel station against the classical and historical backdrop provides a striking contrast of eras and functionalities. The image is a snapshot of the juxtaposition between the everyday service like fuel dispensing and the grandeur of architectural heritage, capturing a moment where different timelines meet in a public space. The sky is clear and the square appears to be quiet with only a few parked cars, indicating a peaceful scene likely captured during a non-busy period of the day.","title":"One of Vienna's great plazas, Am Hof, is now marred by a gas station.
