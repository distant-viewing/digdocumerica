{"path":"546282.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a scientific or medical research setting, showing an individual focused on observing a specimen under a microscope. The microscope is large and appears technologically robust, suggesting that the setting might be quite advanced. \n\nVisible in the frame is the back of the observer’s head, slightly out of focus, as he leans in to get a closer look through the microscope’s eyepiece. The viewer mostly sees the microscope's detailed structure including adjustment knobs and the eyepiece which reflects a green image of what appears to be a microscopic sample, likely a biological specimen.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, there is a digital display reading \"440,\" possibly indicating a measurement or setting related to the microscope's function, accompanied by a man's hand adjusting this setting. Below this display, a piece of paper with rows of handwritten notes or data is partially visible. This paperwork likely relates to the observations being made.\n\nThe overall ambiance is dimly lit, largely in shades of green and black, emphasizing a focused, serious environment typical of scientific investigation or analysis. The specific details of the setting are obscured, focusing the viewer’s attention on the interaction between the scientist and the microscope. Such a quiet yet intense atmosphere implies a deep concentration and a moment caught during critical research or diagnostic work.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: A pathobiologist studies the nucleus of a white cell, magnified 8000 times, through an electron microscope.
