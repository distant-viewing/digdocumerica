{"path":"546608.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a busy urban highway, exhibiting a significant amount of traffic predominantly moving in one direction. The highway is distinguished by its elevated structure and curves slightly as it progresses through the frame. The scene is set against a backdrop of various urban buildings—an eclectic mix of residential blocks and industrial infrastructures, including a notable tall chimney.\n\nOn either side of the multi-lane highway, we observe the organization of the urban environment. To the left appears to be a residential area with green spaces interspersed among buildings. To the right, industrial or commercial properties dominate, highlighted by an area filled with parked vehicles—primarily white, resembling a depot or a car lot. \n\nThe general atmosphere captured in the photograph includes a sense of dense urban living, juxtaposed with the function and congestion of major transportation infrastructure. The picture may capture a typical workday scenario, providing a stark visualization of city life and mobility challenges, including traffic congestion which is apparent from the accumulation of vehicles in certain stretches of the road.","title":"Whitehurst freeway, looking east; evening home-bound traffic","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546726","547780","546713","546686","546617","547770","546734","546670","555781","546707","546681","546612","546678","556194","555745","547785"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","congestion","infrastructur","traffic","workday","distinguished","mobility","organization","progress","parked"]}
