{"path":"552688.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In the photograph, a person is seen outdoors immersed in a lush field of tall grass or reeds. Framing the foreground prominently are these green linear plants, which appear vibrant and partially obscure the view, creating a sense of depth. \n\nThe person is dressed casually in a light-colored long-sleeved shirt and jeans, wearing a wide-brimmed hat that shadows their face, enhancing the outdoor, sunny environment feel. They are holding what seems to be a camera or similar device, possibly engaging in photographing the surroundings or examining the area.\n\nThe background consists of a clear blue sky and a rugged mountain or cliff that lends a dramatic contrast to the soft textures of the foreground vegetation. \n\nThe composition uses the natural lines of the grass and the positioning of the person leaning slightly forward to draw the viewer's eye through the scene, suggesting a narrative of exploration or study in a natural, possibly remote setting. The lighting is bright and suggests a sunny day, which emphasizes the vividness of the natural elements in the frame.","title":"The colony plant (near GRand Valley in the Piceance Basin) after years of research, has taken oil shale from an underground mine and has successfully processed it in an experimental retort. Ten percent of Colony's twenty-four million dollars research program has been devoted to environmental research. It has been found that certain species of grass will grow on processed shale if given water during the first two years.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["557111","557104","545069","557191","549233","551370","554424","556990","549251","553084","545588","549134","557146","555589","557659","557099"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["person","positioning","reed","grass","vividness","study","device","cliff","exploration","narrative"]}
