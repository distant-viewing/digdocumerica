{"path":"549494.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large industrial area, likely a steel mill, located by a river. The complex includes multiple large buildings, primarily long and narrow, which are likely production facilities or warehouses. There are also several smokestacks within the complex, some emitting smoke or steam, suggesting ongoing industrial processes.\n\nThe facility is surrounded by numerous plots filled with parked cars, indicating either employee parking or possibly storage areas for manufactured goods awaiting transport. Several circular and cylindrical tanks can be observed, which may be used for storing gases or liquids used in or produced by the manufacturing process.\n\nThe river next to the industrial complex features a few small boats and barges, hinting at the transport of materials or goods via the waterway. Alongside the river, there are additional industrial structures, which may include loading docks or processing buildings.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a mix of densely packed smaller buildings and open spaces. There are roads and possibly railway tracks that hint at a well-connected infrastructure, facilitating the transport and logistics essential for such a large industrial operation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its expansive industrial setup alongside a river illustrates a significant industrial hub likely involved in heavy manufacturing or processing activities.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant at Lackawanna on Lake Erie, just south of Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["545889","555774","551201","549526","549510","549511","549968","550856","549725","553891","552187","555761","551988","550886","557223","555779"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["transport","complex","river","good","manufacturing","employee","process","logistic","facility","mill"]}
