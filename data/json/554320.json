{"path":"554320.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image captures an expansive heap of crushed and compacted scrap materials, predominantly comprised of damaged and dismantled automobiles. The composition shows the vehicles crushed into dense, cube-like forms with various colors prominently featuring shades of red, blue, and white metal with patches of rust and dirt, indicating weathering and decay. The textures visible in the pile vary from shiny, metallic surfaces to sections that are bent and torn, displaying the inner components and structures of the cars.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a clear sky with a few light clouds, suggesting an open-air environment typically found in a scrapyard or recycling facility. There is a highway visible in the distance, characterized by an elevated roadway and a road sign, which further contextualizes the setting as being on the outskirts of or near an urban area.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a scene of industrial waste handling, specifically the recycling or storage of cars that have reached the end of their lifecycle, highlighting themes of consumption, waste management, and environmental impact.","title":"Flattened autos are ready for recycling at auto scrap yard.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554352","554348","542656","552738","551517","546172","553006","545303","545545","542660","553005","554311","554357","553011","544819","546267"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["recycling","waste","lifecycle","consumption","scrapyard","scrap","heap","outskirt","automobile","handling"]}
