{"path":"544315.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene and somewhat eerie scene of two people walking in what appears to be a heavy mist or fog. The visibility is significantly reduced by the fog, contributing to a mystic and somber atmosphere.\n\nBoth individuals are shown walking away from the viewpoint, deeper into the haze. They are dressed in heavy, possibly winter clothing, suggesting that the weather is cold. One person is wearing a backpack, indicating they might be engaged in a hiking or travel activity. Each is seemingly focused on their path ahead, immersed in the quiet and isolated environment.\n\nThe background is largely indistinct due to the fog, allowing very little of the surroundings to be visible. There are no discernible landmarks or objects, except for the enveloping mist that blurs the separation between the ground and the sky, creating a continuous canvas of whites and grays.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its vintage or damaged edges and specks of imperfections, adds to the feeling of age and timelessness. The lack of vibrant colors and the dominance of muted gray tones highlight the solitude and the almost tangible chill of the atmosphere. The scene is quiet, still, and introspective, capturing a moment of solitude against nature's obscured backdrop.","title":"Walkers in dust storm","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["544330","547180","554919","547045","556425","557018","545763","550234","555536","542926","542925","554971","545012","555126","554755","553615"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["fog","mist","chill","imperfection","solitude","dominance","timelessness","separation","canvas","speck"]}
