{"path":"543603.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an intricate close-up of nature involving a small butterfly perched delicately on yellow flowers. The butterfly, predominantly in shades of blue and black, has its wings partially closed, displaying a textured pattern on the visible parts of its wings. The butterfly is positioned towards the right side of the image, seemingly nectaring on the flowers.\n\nThe flowers exude a bright yellow color and are grouped together atop what appears to be a single stem. Their petals are slightly spread out, with visible stamens and pistils, which suggests they are at the peak of their bloom, providing an attractive source of nectar.\n\nThe background is blurred with a gradient of dark green and browns, enhancing the focus on the butterfly and the flowers through a shallow depth of field. The lighting appears natural, possibly filtered through a canopy of trees, resulting in a soft, moody effect that accentuates the textures and colors of the primary subjects. The overall composition draws the viewerâ€™s attention directly to the interplay between the butterfly and the flowers, symbolizing the symbiotic relationships within nature.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["544619","547818","544479","544553","544618","551381","544603","544517","544514","544614","544566","554839","548283","544590","545699","555189"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","stamen","relationship","stem","petal","bloom","close","source"]}
