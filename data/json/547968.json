{"path":"547968.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a large glass jar containing a collection of preserved octopuses. The jar is filled with a fluid that helps keep the octopuses intact and is sealed with a metal lid, which shows signs of corrosion, possibly due to aging or exposure to the preserving agents. The octopuses vary in size and are tightly packed, revealing details of their tentacles and suction cups.\n\nThe backdrop includes a blurred window, with natural light streaming in, creating a somewhat dramatic illumination on the jar and enhancing the visibility of details within. The pale blue light suggests it might be daylight outside. On one side of the jar, partially outside of the frame, another object appears, possibly another jar or container, hinting at a collection or some form of scientific or educational setup. The focus and lighting emphasize the jar and its contents, setting a somewhat mysterious or scientific ambiance.","title":"Specimens used in marine biology class at the spermacetti cove nature center at Sandy Hook","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["543811","552810","554094","546354","544972","543897","555060","553658","546353","543834","551591","557134","543702","555069","543696","555253"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["jar","preserve","collection","seal","streaming","corrosion","lid","fluid","cup","aging"]}
