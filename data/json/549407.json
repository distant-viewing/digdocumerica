{"path":"549407.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a serene marina setting. In the forefront, a wooden dock extends into the image, leading to an entrance framed by a black signpost and a structure with the sign \"PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY\". This entrance acts as a gateway to the more distant parts of the scene.\n\nOn each side of the dock, numerous sailboats are moored neatly in rows. These boats, of varying sizes and designs, feature tall masts that stand parallel to one another, creating a rhythmic vertical pattern against the sky. The close proximity of the sailboats suggests a well-organized and possibly exclusive marina.\n\nA few boats are covered partially with blue and red canvas covers, indicating measures for maintenance or protection against the elements. The water around the boats is calm, reflecting some of the masts and the light brightness of the day.\n\nIn the background, modest marina buildings or boat storage facilities are visible. They are simple in construction and painted white, blending into the bright and clear day. Trees can also be seen beyond the confines of the marina, suggesting a lush, green environment surrounding the area.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of quiet and exclusivity, likely taken on a bright and clear day, underlining the leisure and privacy associated with private maritime clubs.","title":"Chesapeake bay marina","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548515","543246","542904","543545","546388","542871","544248","556191","546877","548639","557450","552028","548763","542912","546853","546935"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boats","mast","sailboat","entrance","signpost","dock","club","confines","privacy"]}
