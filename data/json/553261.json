{"path":"553261.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures the shadowy figures of three people projected onto a warmly lit background. The figures appear in varying shades of silhouette within an ambiance that graduates from amber to deep burgundy, creating an evocative and somewhat abstract scene. The leftmost shadow is the darkest and most defined, showing a person seemingly with long hair in a stance that suggests movement or dance. The central figure is less clearly defined but appears to be in a pose that could indicate reaching or stretching with arms possibly elevated. The figure on the right is the most faint and shows a form that might be interpreted as throwing an arm outwards or balancing.\n\nThe interplay of light and shadow, along with the gradation of colors, contributes to a sense of dynamism and perhaps an impression of a performance art piece, where human movements are playing out expressively. The overall composition blends elements of motion, art, and emotion through the use of silhouette and colored lighting, making the photograph dramatic and open to various interpretations relating to themes of human expression and interaction.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
