{"path":"557714.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a parade setting on a street lined with spectators. In the foreground, two young women are holding a large banner that reads \"A.H.H.: IT AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE\". One woman is wearing a green and white sports jersey with the number \"28\" and shorts, while the other is in a gray tank top and blue shorts. Both appear jovial and are walking confidently down the street.\n\nBehind them, spectators of various ages can be seen sitting and standing along the sides of the road. Many are focused on the banner and the women. The environment suggests a small-town atmosphere, evident from the tree-covered hill in the background and the modest size of the crowd.\n\nThe street is typical of a small town, with a clear road flanked by grassy areas and a few visible structures that hint at a residential zone. A glimpse of a vehicle and an American flag further suggests a festive, patriotic occasion.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of community engagement and light-heartedness during a local parade, emphasizing a message of change or nostalgia as implied by the banner's text.","title":"White county 4-h girls march down main street of helen Georgia, near robertstown, with a banner proclaiming the changing role of their organization.
