{"path":"545019.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil sunset over a coastal scene. It is dominated by a dramatically lit sky where clouds scatter the light, creating a blend of deep blues, purples, and radiant yellows and oranges near the horizon. Below the expansive sky, the landscape features a calm body of water that reflects the twilight hues.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, there are silhouettes of stilt houses and other structures built directly over the water, suggesting a coastal or riverside community. The peaceful water extends towards a distant shoreline that is faintly visible and merges with the horizon under the sunset. There are no visible people or moving objects, which contributes to the overall serene and undisturbed atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe composition effectively uses the natural gradients of the sunset and the silhouette of the waterfront community to create a vivid contrast and a sense of tranquility.","title":"Sunset at the mouth of the Columbia River, between Astoria, Oregon, and the state of Washington","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545030","545000","552335","547731","552263","544707","552338","557497","545149","557447","554759","545022","552294","543144","550296","550288"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","stilt","silhouette","community","riverside","merge","horizon","purple","gradient","yellow"]}
