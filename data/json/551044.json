{"path":"551044.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at a lock and dam area, featuring a barge loaded with coal. In the foreground, two men are visibly engaged in manual labor on the barge, which is filled with heaped piles of black coal. They are bending over, possibly tying or adjusting something near the edge of the flatbed surface of the barge. The barge is partway through what appears to be a lock, with high concrete walls on either side.\n\nThe focus then shifts to the barge's superstructure located in the middle of the image. The visible section of the barge includes a blue and white multi-level cabin, which houses the piloting and operational controls, evidenced by various antennas, lights, and what appears to be windows for visibility.\n\nIn the background, part of the lock infrastructure is visible; it includes a dark structure with diagonal stripes presumably as a safety or warning indicator. There is also a small water jet or fountain shooting upward, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The surroundings hint at a rugged, industrial river environment, slightly blurred in the background, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention more directly on the workers and their immediate environment on the barge.","title":"A Coalburg tug and eight coal barges go downstream through the London locks, one of three lock systems on the Kanawha River. The other locks are at Marmet and Winfield. The coal is being transported to a power plant on the Ohio River.","placename":"Charleston (W.
