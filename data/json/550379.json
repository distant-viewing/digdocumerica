{"path":"550379.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scenic landscape featuring a group of caribou grazing in a wide grassy area during what appears to be the late hours of the day, given the low light and long shadows. There are four caribou visible in the foreground of the image. Each displays distinctive large antlers and is seen in various poses, mostly bent towards the ground grazing. In the background, the scene opens up to a tranquil water body that reflects the fading light, surrounded by what seem to be distant land formations or islands.\n\nThe overall tone of the photograph is muted with earthy colors dominating the frame, featuring greens, browns, and greys. The horizon is softly blended with the sky, suggesting a misty or very subtle transition, which contributes to the serene and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the scene. There is also one bird captured in mid-flight over the water, adding a dynamic element to the peaceful landscape. The image evokes a sense of quiet solitude and the untouched beauty of a natural environment.","title":"Caribou graze near the sagavanirktok river, eight miles east of the north slope site where the Alaska pipeline will start.
