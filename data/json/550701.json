{"path":"550701.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a dynamic and industrial landscape focusing on a hydroelectric dam and its surroundings. On the right side of the image, there is a large hydroelectric dam structure with a vertical, brown facade featuring multiple doors or gates. This part of the dam is aligned vertically, juxtaposing with the natural flow and chaos of the water.\n\nTo the left of the dam, there is a vigorous, frothing waterfall cascading over a series of rock ledges. The water looks powerful and is rushing down in white torrents, creating a foam on the surface as it meets the river below. The rocks appear rugged and uneven, accentuating the wild character of the scene.\n\nIn the background, and topping the dam, dense, dark green forests line the hillside, suggesting a remote or less urbanized location. Above the treeline, numerous tall, thin utility poles with power lines can be seen, hinting at the distribution network for the electricity generated by the dam.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is moody and dramatic, with overcast skies casting a dim light over the scene, enhancing the rough textures of the natural and man-made elements. This photograph likely emphasizes themes of renewable energy production and nature's force, illustrating the intersection of human technology and the natural environment.","title":"Androscoggin River falls and power plant at Rumford","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550743","550654","553136","549004","548007","553349","548013","549486","548145","553372","544166","553828","553137","548024","548150","548936"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","treeline","electricity","distribution","gate","chaos","ledge","rock","waterfall","foam"]}
