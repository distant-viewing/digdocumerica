{"path":"552061.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a water flow over rocks. The camera's angle is close to water level, focusing on the interaction between the flowing water and the rocky riverbed. The water appears turbulent and frothy, indicating a swift current, as it washes over an assortment of brown and tan colored rocks. \n\nThe left side of the image shows the water's edge meeting a darker, possibly muddy bank. The main body of water extending towards the upper right corner is darker, suggesting deeper water contrasting with the shallower, rock-strewn area where the water is churning and breaking. The overall mood of the scene feels natural and untouched, with the water's movement imparting a sense of raw energy. The focus and exposure capture the textures of the rocks and the fluent motion of the water, blurring slightly to emphasize movement. The colors in the image suggest it might be either dusk or dawn, adding a muted or soft light quality to the scene.","title":"Outfall from the Shawnee Avenue pumping plant into the Kansas River, just downstream from the Kansas City railroad terminal bridge.
