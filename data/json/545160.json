{"path":"545160.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively campground scene set in a forested area with a significant expanse of sand in the foreground. The image shows numerous recreational vehicles (RVs) and a few tents scattered throughout a clearing surrounded by tall, dense coniferous trees that contribute to a secluded, natural setting. The RVs vary in size and style, suggesting a diverse group of campers.\n\nThe foreground features sandy soil with evident tire tracks and footprints, indicating frequent movement of vehicles and people across this area. The sun appears to be shining brightly, casting shadows from the trees onto the sand, adding texture and depth to the scene. There is a calm and peaceful atmosphere, yet there's also a sense of community and outdoor activity typical of a camping experience. The trees and clear sky suggest it might be late spring or summer, which is a popular season for camping.","title":"Campsite near lake in national recreation park","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["542746","543599","554478","557514","554181","554480","548795","552898","553133","551428","542747","548796","548748","548668","548797","544855"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["camping","sand","campers","shin","footprint","tent","clearing","tire","vehicle","experience"]}
