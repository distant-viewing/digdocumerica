{"path":"548402.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene likely from the mid-20th century in an urban setting. The foreground features a bustling street with pedestrians and vehicles. In the lower left, a woman with blonde hair and wearing a light jacket is walking towards the camera. Behind her, the street is occupied by a red Wells Fargo truck and a dark blue delivery van labeled \"Boeffer Services Inc.\" There are other pedestrians in the background who are less distinct.\n\nThe background is dominated by colorful and bustling storefronts and signage. Prominently displayed is a facade with signs for \"Follies Burlesk,\" advertising it as \"the world's most beautiful showgirls\" and \"most spectacular.\" Below the burlesque sign, there's a Howard Johnson's restaurant, notable for its \"Cocktails\" sign. The myriad of signs and billboards, including a large billboard above reading \"PURE WOOL\" with a spiral design, adds to the vivid commercial atmosphere typical of the era.\n\nAbove the street, various commercial signs and a traffic light hang over the road, enhancing the urban commercial feel of the scene. The composition of the photograph, with its deep focus, captures the bustling energy and variety of activities happening simultaneously in a busy city block. The clarity and color saturation give a strong sense of the time period and location.","title":"Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550142","550139","551125","550127","549014","551135","545216","556224","549882","554297","549872","551494","552411","547369","544793","549113"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["billboard","street","sign","pedestrian","wool","myriad","delivery","happen","restaurant","storefront"]}
