{"path":"549330.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a man positioned behind a large, complex geometric model, possibly representing molecular structures or a science-related abstract concept. The man appears to be middle-aged and wears thick black-rimmed glasses. He has short, slicked-back dark hair and a calm, serious facial expression.\n\nHe is dressed in a white lab coat over a suit consisting of a dark tie with a detailed, ornamental design and a white shirt. The background is a non-descript, faintly lit plain wall, emphasizing the contrast and interaction between the man and the intricate model in front of him.\n\nThe composition of the image uses the geometric model as a focal point that partially obscures and frames the man's face, creating a sense of depth and interest. This positioning suggests a connection between the man and the scientific or intellectual content symbolized by the model, indicating that he may be a scientist or involved in academic research.","title":"Dr. Ing.
