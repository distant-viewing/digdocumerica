{"path":"544282.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor environment where some sort of construction or excavation activity is taking place near a body of water, possibly a river or canal. The body of water bends gently to the right, bordered by a raised, rocky embankment that appears man-made, enhancing the water's edge for structural reinforcement.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a prominent construction crane stationed on a flat, dirt area that seems to be recently cleared or being prepared for some project. The crane is positioned near the edge of the water, suggesting it might be used for dredging or other water-related construction tasks.\n\nThe surrounding area displays a variety of vegetation, including grass and sparse patches of bushes close to the water. The background features more trees, with some appearing leafless and possibly dead, giving a sense of a possibly marshy or flood-prone environment. The environment has a flat terrain, and the colors in the image reflect an overcast day, casting soft, diffuse light on the scene, which reduces shadows.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a setting that is undergoing significant human intervention, likely for development or environmental management purposes such as water control or resource extraction. The absence of people in the shot focuses the viewer's attention on the impact of machinery and constructions on the natural landscape.","title":"Near Mississippi Gulf Outlet","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545858","548775","547171","545648","553379","545631","548361","554545","553392","545655","545641","548559","545657","548641","553353","546833"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","water","crane","dredging","reinforcement","embankment","flood","extraction","canal","intervention"]}
