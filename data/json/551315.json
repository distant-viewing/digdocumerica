{"path":"551315.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features three individuals gathered around a campfire during nighttime. The campfire, located at the center of the image, illuminates the scene with a bright, warm glow and sends sparks into the air, adding a dynamic feel to the photograph.\n\nThe people are sitting on the ground in a semi-circular arrangement around the fire. The person on the left side of the image appears to be partially blurred and in motion, perhaps adjusting their sitting position or interacting with someone outside the frame. This individual's features and details are not clear due to the motion blur and the lighting.\n\nThe two individuals on the right are more clearly visible and appear to be engaged in conversation. The person in the middle is turned towards the person sitting on the far right, suggesting an interaction or communication between them. Both are wearing casual, light-colored shirts.\n\nThe background features a dark, out-of-focus landscape that could indicate a lake or a similar wide-open space, suggested by a barely visible horizon line. Above this, the sky is dark, hinting at a clear night. The overall atmosphere is one of a serene, outdoor nighttime setting, likely in a natural environment away from city lights.","title":"Camdenton High School students sit around bonfire on a Bluff overlooking the lake.","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["545778","548792","551399","551431","551314","545774","544855","557028","551402","546026","546013","542727","554510","554863","544008","545497"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["campfire","nighttime","person","spark","motion","individual","communication","blur","night","fire"]}
