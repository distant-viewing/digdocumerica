{"path":"549135.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged, remote landscape characterized by rolling hills and expansive greenery. The hills are uneven and covered with a mix of vegetation, including patches of grass and dense shrubs. The terrain has an overall patchy texture with varying shades of green and brown, suggesting variability in vegetation density and soil moisture.\n\nIn the background, there is a distinctive structure that stands out prominently against the fairly flat horizon line. This structure appears to be a large, metal framework, possibly related to energy transmission or telecommunications, given its tower-like design and the presence of other similar but smaller towers faintly visible on the horizon.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, with blue sky peeking through white clouds, contributing to a serene and somewhat remote natural setting. Overall, the scene captures a moment of natural tranquility while also featuring elements of human-made infrastructure, indicating some level of interaction or intervention with the landscape.","title":"A 350 megawatt power plant under construction at Colstrip overlooks 20-year old strip mine spoil piles.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["550440","549236","555616","549142","555671","549155","555603","549238","549182","549186","552903","555567","549157","545828","549179","552553"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["telecommunication","variability","tower","transmission","intervention","peek","hill","moisture","horizon","density"]}
