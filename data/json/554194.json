{"path":"554194.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"In the photograph, we see a small wooden house, painted white, with a single window and an open door. A woman stands in the doorway; she has long dark hair, and is smiling slightly as she looks towards the camera. She is dressed casually in a plaid, button-up shirt and blue jeans, and is barefoot.\n\nThe window beside the door is adorned with a colorful, patterned curtain, and the window frame is simple and white, matching the house's exterior. Just in front of the doorstep, there's a small concrete slab, and a white bucket is placed on one corner of it. The surrounding area appears to be grassy, though the immediate ground around the house is covered in dirt. The overall setting suggests a rural or semi-rural environment, with a relaxed and homely atmosphere.","title":"Ann Schindler stands in the doorway of her house in Grygla.","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["544410","548246","556487","554798","553503","546987","546992","551091","548232","555295","558036","554193","552956","553502","553480","546997"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["house","slab","door","window","curtain","doorway","button","bucket","plaid","exterior"]}
