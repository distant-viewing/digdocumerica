{"path":"545651.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene, moody waterfront scene under an overcast sky. The setting appears to be a wide, shallow river or lake with a stony shore. The foreground is cluttered with rocks and pebbles, contributing to a rugged and natural feel. Toward the middle of the frame, several boats are visible; these include a white boat with a red interior and a smaller, possibly motorized boat to its right. Notably, there's a helicopter near these boats, adding a modern, unexpected element to the otherwise rural and tranquil landscape.\n\nIn the background, the waterscape extends into the distance, flanked by mountainous terrain that partially fades into the mist or low clouds, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation and quietness. The setting is dimly lit, suggesting either dawn or dusk, which casts a cool, bluish tone over the entire scene, punctuated by the white and red hues of the boats and helicopter. A lone figure can be seen near the boats, adding a human presence to the scene, yet appearing small and distant, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape around them.","title":"Helicopters bringing relief work crews land in rain at site of oil spill clean-up operations in Monument Valley, Utah, on the banks of the San Juan River. Oil had flowed 200 miles downstream from burst pipeline near Shiprock, New Mexico. A log boom made chiefly of telephone pole sections at this site served to contain most of the slick and debris until flooding caused overflow into Lake Powell.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["556905","544266","549458","548247","545658","548235","556927","544567","555394","552330","552157","549417","555694","557972","542872","555693"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["boat","helicopter","waterscape","quietness","pebble","dawn","mist","interior","vastness","dusk"]}
