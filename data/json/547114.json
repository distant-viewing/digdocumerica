{"path":"547114.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene along a water's edge, most likely at a river or coastal location. In the foreground, there is a structure with a slanted red roof and white walls, possibly part of a building such as a houseboat or a dockside establishment. The building features an air conditioning unit on its side, indicating some level of modern infrastructure. The architecture includes terraced levels, each descending closer to the water, creating a layered effect in the image.\n\nThe focal point of the image is the vigorous spray of water crashing against these terraced structures, suggesting either strong waves or a rapid current. The water is muddy, indicating it might carry a lot of sediment, which is typical of rivers or shallower coastal areas. The water's energy is captured mid-splash, with droplets visibly suspended in air, highlighting the force at which the water is hitting the structures.\n\nThe light in the photograph suggests it could be late afternoon, with shadows cast over parts of the structure and a golden hue reflecting off the water, adding a warm tone to the scene. There are no visible people or moving objects, which focuses the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the interplay between the built environment and the natural force of the water.","title":"Waves explode against seawall.
