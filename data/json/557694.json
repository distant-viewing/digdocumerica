He is an older man with gray hair and is wearing a white polo shirt with checkered trousers. Behind him stretches the busy interior of the factory, lit by rows of harsh fluorescent lights overhead.\n\nThe factory setting includes multiple workers, mostly women, seated at various stations, each engaged in different garment-making activities. The array of equipment visible includes sewing machines, fabrics, tools, and unfinished garments spread across the workstations. \n\nThe workers appear focused on their tasks, contributing to a scene that captures the industrious atmosphere typical of such environments. The background is slightly dimmer, emphasizing the depth of the factory floor and the span of operations.
