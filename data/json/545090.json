{"path":"545090.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a portrait of an elderly man sitting beside a waterfront. The man is dressed in a casual, layered outfit consisting of a light green shirt and a beige and brown cardigan. He wears black-rimmed glasses and his expression is mild with a slight smile directed towards the camera. His hair is white and neatly combed, and he appears relaxed and composed.\n\nThe background shows a wooden dock structure leading into the water, with weathered wood pilings visible alongside the dock. The water appears calm yet murky, typical of a serene yet aging waterfront area. There's a blurred structure in the distance beyond the dock that hints at some industrial or storage use near the water. The overall mood is tranquil, with an overcast sky softly illuminating the scene with diffuse light, highlighting the textures of the man's clothing and the wooden structures surrounding him. This setting suggests a quiet moment captured in a possibly coastal or lakeside community.","title":"Oregon--Astoria","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["552871","548278","550739","544981","552103","551397","542613","547179","556563","552523","543701","543232","548616","554857","552864","556449"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Portrait"],"terms":["dock","waterfront","piling","cardigan","portrait","smile","man","outfit","water","structure"]}
