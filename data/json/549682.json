{"path":"549682.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a man sitting in a horse-drawn carriage on an asphalt surface. The carriage, which appears to be fairly ornate, is positioned slightly off-center in the image and is connected to two brown horses. The horses are harnessed side by side and have gleaming brown coats. Each horse is outfitted with a dark, detailed harness that connects them to the carriage, equipped with large, decorative wheels and front-facing lamps that suggest a vintage design.\n\nThe man seated in the carriage is wearing sunglasses, a white shirt, and darker pants. He appears relaxed, sitting back in the seat of the carriage with his arms at his sides and his legs crossed.\n\nThe pavement where the carriage is running shows signs of wear and tear, with visible cracks and patches, set against an unstated, unclear background. The perspective provided suggests the photo was taken from an elevated position overlooking this scene. This allows the viewer to capture not only the details of the carriage and horses but also the pattern and texture of the pavement surrounding them. Overall, the scene holds a somewhat timeless, serene quality, juxtaposed by the ordinary and rough texture of the asphalt.","title":"Vienna's famous fiakas (horse-drawn carriages) are the only form of transportation permitted in the pedestrian-only zones.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["550098","549667","557050","551717","557712","544395","550087","549574","550091","550094","549576","557041","542891","550095","544425","553118"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["carriage","horse","asphalt","pavement","tear","harness","crack","show","seat","lamp"]}
