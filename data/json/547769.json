{"path":"547769.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph portrays an aerial view of a suburban neighborhood. The layout features a series of detached, single-story homes predominantly with slanted roofs, many of which appear to be surfaced in a light-colored material, possibly shingles. Each house is accompanied by a well-maintained yard, with some properties featuring visible trees and shrubs.\n\nThe neighborhood is arranged with curving streets and cul-de-sacs, enhancing the peaceful, residential feel of the area. The roads are asphalt, and there are several cars parked both on the driveways of some homes and alongside the streets. There are sidewalks lining at least one side of the streets, suggesting a pedestrian-friendly environment.\n\nThe individual houses vary slightly in architectural details and orientation but maintain a cohesive look typical of suburban residential developments. Some homes have attached garages, and there's at least one instance where a small camper is parked in a driveway.\n\nOverall, the area looks verdant and tranquil, with a layout that prioritizes privacy and community, underscored by open lawns and scattered tree cover. The photograph captures the essence of suburban living with a focus on single-family dwellings within a well-planned neighborhood structure.","title":"A residential section of North Dallas, near the L.B.J.
