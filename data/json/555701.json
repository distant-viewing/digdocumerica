{"path":"555701.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The image features a picturesque overhead view of a landscape that predominantly consists of a cluster of thickly forested islands or peninsulas. These landmasses are surrounded by vibrant turquoise water, which could be a lake or a slow-moving river.\n\nThe most striking elements in the scene are multiple trails of white wakes in the water, created by boats. These boats are not completely visible but their motion and paths can be inferred from the wake patterns they leave behind. The boats appear to be moving away from the forested areas, cutting through the water and heading in various directions.\n\nThe dense forests are rich in color, ranging from deep jade to almost emerald hues, suggesting a healthy, lush environment. The boundaries between the water and land are well-defined, showcasing smooth curves and natural outlines of the shorelines.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph is aerial and possibly taken from a high altitude given the wide scope of the landscape covered. This vantage point allows for an expansive view of the area, capturing not only the interaction between the natural elements but also the human activity impacting the scene. The overall composition and the interplay of natural colors contribute to making this an eye-catching photograph.","title":"Logs from a small sawmill operation on the south shore of port Valdez like jackstraws in the water.
