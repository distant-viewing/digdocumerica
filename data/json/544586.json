{"path":"544586.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two sunflower-like plants captured in detailed silhouette against a slightly dark and blurry greenish background, imparting a serene and somewhat mysterious atmosphere. The left side of the image displays a sunflower bud that is still closed and its top appears somewhat spherical with a textured surface, likely covered in small hairs or bristles. This bud is mounted atop a tall, stiff stalk lined thickly with fine hairs, enhancing its detailed silhouette.\n\nTo the right, there stands a mature sunflower with its head fully opened, exposing numerous slender yellow petals radiating from a dark center. The back of the flower reveals the green bracts with a slightly jagged edge enclosing the base of the petals. The stalk of this flower, like its counterpart, is also covered in visible fine hairs and bears a single narrow leaf that extends outwards, characterized by a gentle fuzziness.\n\nThe composition exploits the interplay of light and shadow, where the fine details such as the hairs on the stalks and the delicate structures of the petals and leaf are richly accentuated against the subdued background. This image likely emphasizes themes of growth and natural beauty, capturing a moment of both budding potential and flourishing life.","title":"Sunflower","placename":"Ingram (Tex.)","location":"Ingram, Texas","nn1":["544579","557617","555189","549230","544875","543596","544575","553361","545715","551369","557167","545291","554587","553368","545699","554745"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stalk","petal","bud","hair","leaf","potential","flower","silhouette","growth","base"]}
