{"path":"553400.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of young adults engaged in a rowing activity. There are two rowboats in the image, each filled with four individuals. The participants appear focused and are holding oars which are dipped into the water, indicating they are actively rowing or pausing between strokes.\n\nThe first boat has individuals wearing maroon and white clothing, while the second boat has rowers in a mix of white and gray tops. One person in the first boat is captured in mid-motion, presumably shouting or cheering, contributing to a lively atmosphere. The participants show diverse expressions, some concentrating on the task while others look more relaxed and cheerful.\n\nThe setting is a calm body of water surrounded by lush green trees that form a serene background, suggesting this activity could be taking place in a park or natural reserve area during a sunny day. The lighting is bright, casting clear reflections on the water and highlighting the participants' faces and the natural surroundings. This outdoor sporting event exemplifies teamwork and leisure, encapsulating a moment of youthful energy and camaraderie.","title":"Visiting crew at Groton School on the Nashua River.
