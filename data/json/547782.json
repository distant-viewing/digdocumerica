{"path":"547782.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene with a somewhat melancholic and abandoned feel. In the foreground, there is a prominent advertisement sign that has fallen over onto the ground, tilting to one side. The sign is colorful, displaying the word \"inSight\" with graphic elements, including a stylized eye and an orange shape that could resemble a horizon or landscape.\n\nThe background shows a flat, expansive landscape typical of farmland or grassland. There is little vegetation, mainly sparse grass and a few weeds. The scene includes a dilapidated barbed wire fence and a few scattered, fallen wooden fence posts. Not far behind the sign, there is an old, rusted car abandoned in the field, enhancing the sense of neglect and disuse. Further back, partially obscured by mist or fog, stand two structures. The first is a small, dilapidated wooden shack to the left. The second, more prominent, is a larger old farmhouse-style building with visible damage, standing in isolation.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is somber and desolate, highlighted by the overcast sky and the general lack of vibrant life or activity, punctuated by signs of decay and abandonment. The juxtaposition of the colorful advertisement sign against the decaying rural backdrop creates a striking contrast, possibly commenting on themes of commercialism, neglect, or rural decay.","title":"Farmland, north of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["550279","543104","556313","554707","554561","552455","552515","547771","555435","544028","547522","552673","547535","556330","548248","555612"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["decay","sign","advertisement","abandon","fall","fence","barbed","neglect","comment","insight"]}
