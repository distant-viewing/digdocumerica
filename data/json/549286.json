{"path":"549286.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures three men engaging in a discussion on a city sidewalk. The man on the left, who is in focus, is wearing a pink-checked shirt and black glasses, and is looking down at a newspaper he is holding open. The middle man, who appears to be of smaller stature and older, also holds a copy of the same newspaper and is looking attentively towards the newspaper in the hands of the man on the left. The third man, on the right, is dressed in a dark plaid suit and tie, and seems to be listening to the conversation while looking down toward the newspaper as well.\n\nThe background of the scene shows a typical city street lined with parked cars and leafy trees. There is a glimpse of a residential building with distinct architecture, suggesting an urban environment likely in the mid to late 20th century based on the style of the cars and the menâ€™s clothing.\n\nThe overall setting and activity suggest that these men are discussing something they've read in the newspaper that holds their interest. The fact that they each hold a copy of the newspaper indicates that it might be a topic of public concern or community interest. The newspapers are named \"Community News,\" implying they are likely discussing local issues.","title":"Community leaders anthony bruno (center) john briganti (left), and joseph porzio.
