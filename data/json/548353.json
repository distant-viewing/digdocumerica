{"path":"548353.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an industrial or dockyard area. In the forefront, there’s a yard filled with various debris and materials, possibly a scrapyard, which includes piles of discarded items and debris spread across a vast area. Nearby, there are several industrial buildings, some with flat roofs and others with multiple stories. Many of these buildings appear functional and are possibly used for processing, manufacturing, or administrative purposes.\n\nIn the middle ground, there’s a busy network of roads with numerous vehicles, suggesting a high level of activity, usually associated with commercial or industrial operations. You can also see railway tracks, indicating that this area likely accommodates both road and rail transport. There’s a canal with a raised bridge and two docked barges, which implies that goods might also be transported by water, pointing towards a multi-modal transport hub in this industrial setting.\n\nIn the distance, another layer of infrastructure is discernible, including more large buildings, numerous parked vehicles, and additional roadways. The backdrop includes a raised highway or bridge structure, further emphasizing the transportation theme prevalent throughout the image.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph indicates a typical working day in an industrial or dockyard environment, focusing on transportation and goods handling, and characterized by the presence of heavy machinery, vehicles, and industrial buildings. The image provides a comprehensive overview of an industrious region dedicated to various operational activities involving logistics and material handling.","title":"Waterfront industrial area","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548346","550886","551988","555761","548423","555763","550890","549479","549969","555779","555796","552007","547214","549526","555765","555776"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["handling","good","transport","transportation","bridge","vehicle","scrapyard","overview","logistic","canal"]}
