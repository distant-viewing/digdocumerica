{"path":"544575.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features the shadow of a sunflower cast onto a flat surface, presumably paper or a wall. The sunflower silhouette is shown in great detail, highlighting its distinct, rounded shape and the individual petals which radiate outward from a central point. The shadow captures the flower's long, slender stem slightly leaning towards the right. The image has a soft and somewhat faded quality, with gentle hues of yellow highlighting the flower's features and a pale, almost white background that serves to emphasize the figure of the flower. The overall composition is minimalistic, focusing solely on the shape of the sunflower projected as a shadow, which creates a sense of simplicity and tranquility.","title":"Sunflower","placename":"Ingram (Tex.)","location":"Ingram, Texas","nn1":["544586","544579","551622","555189","551369","545699","544880","557586","544590","545431","555009","543596","554586","555033","550464","557487"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","shadow","radiate","shape","petal","stem","slender","project","pale","paper"]}
