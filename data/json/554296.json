{"path":"554296.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a series of electricity or telecommunication poles aligned diagonally across the composition, receding into the distance. They dominate the image, stretching across the dusty lavender sky. The poles differ in height and are unevenly spaced, equipped with cables, crossbeams, and a variety of insulators and connectors. In the mid-ground, prominently positioned and somewhat incongruously juxtaposed against the industrial scene, is the Statue of Liberty. The statue appears quite small in comparison to the foreground elements, almost as if itâ€™s nestled among the wiring and structural components of the utility poles, illustrating a contrast between iconic national symbolism and everyday utility infrastructure. The overall mood evoked by the color palette is somewhat muted and melancholic, emphasizing a stark, almost surreal coexistence of these elements within a single frame.","title":"Statue of liberty seen through power lines of Hoboken","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554350","543903","544613","549110","557977","544355","549803","553028","547732","545050","543823","553830","550183","543728","557538","549763"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pole","telecommunication","utility","comparison","differ","electricity","statue","recede","coexistence","cable"]}
