{"path":"546837.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid construction scene where two workers are actively engaged in work. The background consists of a large, complex framework made up of vertical and diagonal wooden beams, suggesting a temporary structure possibly for concrete casting or support.\n\nOne of the workers is standing on a lower part of the structure; he's wearing a gray sweater, blue jeans, and has protective gear that includes a white hard hat, a safety harness equipped with various tools, and safety boots. He is intently staring upwards, possibly listening or communicating to the other worker.\n\nThe second worker is perched slightly above on a wooden board across the beams. He is wearing a plaid shirt, dark pants, and similar protective gear including a yellow hard hat and safety boots. He appears to be using a tool or adjusting something on the structure.\n\nBoth workers exhibit a focus and professional engagement typical to construction sites, illustrating teamwork in a potentially hazardous environment. The intricate wooden scaffolding around them emphasizes the scale and complexity of the construction project.","title":"At work on piers for new bridge that will cross the Baltimore Harbor at Hawkins Point.
