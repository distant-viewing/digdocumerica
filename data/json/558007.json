{"path":"558007.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents a rural outdoor scene dominated by a narrow, lengthy concrete pathway or footing stretched across a narrow waterway. The structure, possibly a small dam or bridge, parallels a pipe that extends along its side, both cutting through the flowing body of water. The concrete surface is worn, showing signs of age and exposure to elements, with various spots and debris scattered on its surface.\n\nThe water below the concrete pathway appears calm with reflections of sunlight, suggesting a serene but possibly stagnant water body. Vegetation, lush and green, flanks both sides of the waterway and the pathway, indicating a rural or outlying location with minimal human alteration.\n\nFurther into the distance, the waterway continues through a pastoral landscape characterized by more greenery and open fields. In the background, a few structures or machinery, potentially related to water management or agriculture, can be seen, adding a functional aspect to the scene. The sky is brightly lit, adding to the calm and quiet ambiance of the setting.","title":"Ohio-Erie canal overflow diversion which allows pollutants to flow into the Cuyahoga River. Canal Road is to the left and the towpath at the right south of Rockside Road near Cleveland, Ohio. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and competition from the railroads put the waterway out of business. The canal is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558015","548870","544542","553083","544674","551423","550721","547952","542555","547890","558005","555550","552255","558016","552254","546868"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["waterway","pathway","alteration","dam","agriculture","water","pipe","exposure","spot","aspect"]}
