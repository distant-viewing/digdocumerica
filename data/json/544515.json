{"path":"544515.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a natural wetland scene dominated by a large expanse of water and vegetation under an overcast sky. The foreground of the image shows a body of water with visible reflections, dotted with green grass and other aquatic plants poking through the surface. The water appears calm, and dense, grassy tufts lead the eye towards the middle distance.\n\nFurther back, there are more patches of dense, tall grasses and probable water reeds surrounding and interspersed with open water areas, creating an intricate marshy landscape. Beyond this vegetated area, the terrain levels up slightly to what appears to be dry land covered sparsely with low vegetation and scattered bushes.\n\nThe sky, occupying the upper third of the image, is cloudy with some lighter patches suggesting a possibility of scattered light, but overall, it conveys a moody atmosphere typical of stormy or impending rainy weather. The natural landscape is devoid of any human presence or man-made structures, giving it an untouched, serene, yet somewhat somber feel.","title":"TaMiami canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544530","553856","547532","552834","547488","545033","547589","547500","554717","547544","550788","550785","550345","542525","546205","547547"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["possibility","tuft","stormy","water","third","reed","grass","wetland","vegetate","patch"]}
