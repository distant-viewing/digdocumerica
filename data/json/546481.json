{"path":"546481.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph features a modernist architectural structure composed of a combination of various shapes and materials. Dominating the right side of the image is a building that showcases large, flat surfaces in an array of muted colors, which contrast sharply with a striking red, slanted roof section. This red portion appears glossy, possibly metallic, and protrudes forward, setting a bold contrast against the rest of the structure's concrete and dark-colored panels.\n\nOn the left of the image, a tall cylindrical concrete pillar occupies a segment of the frame, its smooth, stark form breaking the expanse of complex building elements. Between the pillar and the main building, a sliver of a darker interior or shadowed area is visible, adding depth to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, lush green trees soften the otherwise angular and rigid scene, suggesting the building is situated in a landscaped or green environment. This inclusion of nature juxtaposes with the modern materials and architecture, blending the structure into its environment to some degree. The photograph captures the building during daylight, with sunlight illuminating the building and trees, highlighting their colors and textures. No people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the architectural forms and the interplay between built environment and nature.","title":"North christian church, designed by eero saarinen and built in 1964","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546473","546539","546464","546542","546531","544565","546484","546506","546468","546415","546456","546472","555318","546448","546543","546518"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pillar","building","concrete","degree","built","materials","protrude","inclusion","soften","form"]}
