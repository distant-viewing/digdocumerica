{"path":"554841.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a vibrant pink thistle flower against a softly blurred background. The thistle flower, positioned towards the left side of the frame, displays its distinctive features vividly: numerous, thin, spiky petals radiate outward from the center, creating a bushy, spherical form that is characteristic of thistles.\n\nIn the midst of the pink petals, the flower's central bud is readily apparent and presents an intriguing contrast in both color and texture. This bud is comprised of tightly packed, small, green and white striped segments that resemble scales. These scales cover the bud and give it a textured, almost armor-like appearance.\n\nThe stem of the flower slopes gently across the image from the upper right towards the lower left corner, hinting at the flower's natural habitat, likely in a field or meadow. The background, while out of focus, suggests a natural outdoor setting with hues of green and brown that complement the striking pink of the thistle.\n\nThis image captures the intricate details and delicate beauty of the thistle, emphasizing the juxtaposition of its soft appearance and defensive, prickly nature.","title":"Closeup of a milk wort in the Texas countryside, near San Antonio","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545691","554839","544578","557545","550462","555053","554595","543200","558079","553588","555034","555035","554843","543623","543597","554586"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bud","flower","petal","bry","radiate","intriguing","meadow","pink","scale","appearance"]}
