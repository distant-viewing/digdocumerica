{"path":"552165.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at dusk or twilight. The skyline is dominated by multiple tall chimneys, which are emitting dark smoke into the sky. The ambient lighting indicates it might be either early morning or late evening, as the sky in the background transitions from a vibrant orange near the horizon to a darker blue higher up, suggesting either a sunrise or sunset.\n\nIn the foreground, various industrial structures and buildings can be seen, their silhouettes outlined against the lighter sky. There are visible lights from the facility; some lights appear bright against the dusk, highlighting parts of the structure and adding a dramatic effect to the scene. The overall mood created by the lighting and the smoke is somewhat somber and might connote themes related to industry and environment.","title":"Smoke and steam from lumber and pulp mill stacks","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["546042","545433","544684","557381","546384","544173","545410","545446","545414","547090","551140","544696","552188","552164","545425","547200"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["dusk","smoke","sunrise","twilight","chimney","orange","sunset","outline","industry","skyline"]}
