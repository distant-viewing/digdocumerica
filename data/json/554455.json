{"path":"554455.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an amusement park scene with a scenic chair lift ride, where each chair is designed to look like a hot air balloon. The seats of the lift are suspended by cables and the \"balloons\" atop each seat are painted in alternating stripes of white, red and gray. The main focus is on two individuals seated in one of these lift chairs, enjoying their ride. Other similar balloon-style chairs can be seen in the background.\n\nBelow the lift, the park includes a rustic, two-story building resembling a traditional Southern-style mansion with wrap-around porches and intricate balustrades. The house is painted in hues of red and white. Near this building, there is a horse-drawn carriage moving along a gravel pathway, adding to the old-fashioned and leisurely atmosphere.\n\nThereâ€™s a noticeable contrast between the leisurely technology of the balloon ride and the charmingly old-fashion elements such as the horse carriage and the mansion, which lends a sort of timeless quality to the scene. Several people are visible around the building and carriage, adding life to the scene. The environment is lush and green, indicating it might be late spring or summer. Overhead, the sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day perfect for amusement park adventures.","title":"Chair lift at enchanted forest tourist attraction at Old Forge, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543212","545458","554490","554248","543224","543218","551299","554247","543213","551298","549711","554246","549708","557721","543227","552950"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["balloon","lift","carriage","chair","ride","amusement","horse","seat","park","rustic"]}
