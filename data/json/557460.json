{"path":"557460.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day at a beach setting, focusing on a scene framed by a long, vertical metal railing that extends across the image, creating a striking perspective by converging towards the top right corner of the frame. The foreground shows textured sandy ground with a stone-paved pathway adjacent to the railings, casting a series of angular shadows.\n\nA person is leaning on the railing, facing towards the beach, which stretches across the middle of the photograph. They appear relaxed, dressed in light-colored shorts and bare upper body, suggesting warm weather and a casual atmosphere. Their head is tilted as if looking out towards the sea, adding a contemplative or serene quality to the scene.\n\nIn the distance, the beach is spacious and sandy, meeting the calm ocean under a clear blue sky. There are few visible beach-goers, emphasizing a sense of quiet or off-peak time at the beach. To the right, parked cars hint at a nearby parking area, showing the place is accessible yet not overcrowded.\n\nA street lamp and part of another railing or structure can be seen on the far right, mirroring the main railing and adding to the architectural framing of the image. The overall ambiance is tranquil, with natural and man-made elements combining to depict a typical beach day scene from an interesting visual perspective.","title":"Access to Niguel Beach Park along the ocean in Orange County, through an area that was scheduled for development; however, the plans were halted when the state passed the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development. Some 84 percent of the state residents live within 30 miles of the coast.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["548220","545162","548221","547607","547612","554159","550239","546417","546953","553882","557529","547034","547600","543303","543072","553772"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","railing","goer","perspective","converge","pave","tilt","framing","lamp","mirror"]}
