{"path":"555963.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a view of a spacious and grand hall, possibly a train station or public waiting area given the presence of ticket counters and luggage at one end. The room is expansive with a high ceiling constructed with dark wooden beams, which add warmth and richness to the atmosphere. The ceiling is fitted with large chandeliers emitting soft lighting, enhancing the serene environment.\n\nThe hall has large rectangular windows with deep sills, allowing natural light to illuminate parts of the room, further adding to the ambience. The walls are made of stone or similar material, also contributing to the opulent feels.\n\nFurnished with multiple sets of dark leather seating, the layout is arranged to facilitate easy waiting, with lounges facing each other in a structured fashion. Each seating area consists of plush sofas and soft chairs, inviting relaxation.\n\nAt the far end of the room, there are signs indicating the presence of ticket counters, with a logo \"Amtrak\" visible, suggesting this may be a train station in the United States. Luggage and personal belongings are neatly lined along the perimeter near the entrance, indicating the transit nature of the space.\n\nThe flooring is tiled in terracotta, laid out in a regular grid pattern, reflecting utility and durability necessary for a high-traffic area. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a sense of classic travel elegance, mixing functionality with a hint of historical grandeur.","title":"Interior of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, built for the 1932 Summer Olympics held in that California city.
