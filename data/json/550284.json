{"path":"550284.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site where residential development is underway. In the foreground, three construction workers can be seen actively engaged in the process of pouring concrete. Each worker wears a hard hat in blue or red, and they are using shovels to manipulate the material being dispensed from a concrete mixer chute into a trench reinforced with steel bars. The setting is a muddy terrain typical of an active construction site, with exposed earth and undeveloped ground around the workers.\n\nIn the background, a row of new houses lines the street. These homes exhibit a variety of architectural styles, including features such as peaked roofs with shingles, visible timber framing, attached garages, and fully or partially constructed exteriors. Some houses have windows installed, while others are in varying states of completion. The sky appears overcast, suggesting cool or cloudy weather, which complements the muddy and gritty nature of the construction environment. Various construction materials, such as wooden planks and tools, are scattered around the site, indicative of ongoing work. The overall scene is a typical snapshot of suburban expansion or housing development, showing the blend of manual labor and mechanical assistance used to build modern residential neighborhoods.","title":"Colonial style buildings will distinguish shopping center under construction in Franklin, on Interstate 75 near State Route 73.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550269","547833","543592","553394","550273","553922","547829","557730","544812","547989","557479","553385","546414","543583","546988","543591"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","worker","site","completion","chute","assistance","development","trench","shovel","house"]}
