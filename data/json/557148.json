{"path":"557148.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph focuses on the rear window of a white car where a notable environmental sticker is visible. The sticker reads \"SAVE TALLGRASS PRAIRIE\" in white lettering on a green background with an image of tall grass. Beyond the sticker, inside the car, there is a glimpse of various objects that appear to be personal belongings. These include a white fabric item resembling a garment or a bag, and some indistinct colorful items that might be clothes or plastic bags. The image captures a sense of activism for environmental conservation while also suggesting a snapshot of daily life, possibly hinting at travel or outdoor activity as it seems like the car is being used to transport personal items. The inside of the car is dark, contrasting sharply with the bright daylight reflecting off the carâ€™s exterior.","title":"Rear window of a car shows a \"Save the Tallgrass Prairie\" sticker.
