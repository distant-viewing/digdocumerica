{"path":"548765.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a tropical setting with a foreground filled by lobster traps and a background featuring a wooden two-story building. The building, likely a residence or business, is painted in two-tone colors, predominantly white and with darker trim. It features architectural details like a porch with wooden balusters and a sign with the name \"EGERO\" prominently displayed on the facade.\n\nIn the foreground, several lobster traps of varying constructions and conditions are stacked or placed around. These traps include some that are traditional wooden slat designs and others that appear to be made of wires or more contemporary materials, some showing signs of wear or corrosion.\n\nThe setting includes tropical foliage, with palm trees visible in the background swaying slightly, suggesting a gentle breeze. There's also an expanse of sand visible, indicating that the location is near a beach. The atmosphere captures a quiet, sunny day with clear skies, common in coastal or tropical environments.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of daily life in a coastal, possibly Caribbean or similar, region where lobster fishing might be a part of the local economy. The presence of the building adds a human element, hinting at habitation or a base of operations for local activities.","title":"Lobster fisherman's house at Conch Key during the off-season.
