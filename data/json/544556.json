{"path":"544556.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This aerial photograph displays a lush wetland ecosystem, prominently featuring a boardwalk that meanders through a dense marsh filled with abundant green vegetation. The boardwalk is constructed in a serpentine pattern, weaving through the landscape and allowing for an immersive experience in the natural environment. Along this wooden pathway, there are a few sections where the boardwalk expands into larger platforms, which could serve as observation decks or rest areas for visitors. These platforms are distributed at strategic points offering broader views of the wetlands.\n\nThe photograph captures a variety of water bodies interspersed amongst the vegetation. These waters reflect the sky, adding a deep blue hue to the predominantly green palette of the scene. The surrounding foliage appears lush and dense, suggesting a healthy, thriving wetland system.\n\nThe sky above is clear, indicating good weather, which enhances the visibility and vibrancy of the scene. The overall composition of the image, with its winding pathways and interspersed bodies of water, highlights the delicate balance and beauty of wetland ecosystems. The perspective suggests it was taken from a significant height, offering a comprehensive view of the area that emphasizes both the expanse of the wetlands and the human-designed pathway integrated within it.","title":"Auhinga trail; follows an elevated boardwalk through a typical everglades slough.
