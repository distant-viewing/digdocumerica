{"path":"557946.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a pastoral farmland scene under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a portion of a worn wooden fence runs diagonally from the bottom left corner of the image, guiding the eye into the scene. Beyond the fence lies a lush green field, possibly containing crops, which extends to the middle ground where a line of trees slightly obscures the view.\n\nIn the middle distance, two distinct buildings are visible: a red barn and a white house, both traditional in their rural architectural style. These structures are surrounded by more green fields and scattered trees. The landscape subtly rises into gentle hills in the background, enhancing the depth of the scene.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, emphasizing the tranquility and natural beauty of the rural setting. The overall composition, with its contrasting elements of man-made structures and natural vegetation, evokes a serene and timeless agricultural environment.","title":"Cornfield and new construction seen from the sawmill at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve village area near Akron, Ohio. Wood shaped at the mill was used in construction of the new building, which is the recreation of an old Ohio glass-making plant operated by the Western Reserve Historical Society. The community is the re-creation of 19th-century farm and village life. The site is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["549256","554767","555577","556963","547291","555635","544481","554819","547305","549257","551305","549237","549142","549222","551304","557748"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["fence","farmland","field","barn","crop","corner","bottom","portion","tranquility","eye"]}
