{"path":"552391.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, a man is seen in an indoor environment, possibly an office or laboratory setting. He is seated at a desk while multitasking; he is talking into a handheld communication device, possibly a walkie-talkie, and simultaneously writing in a notebook with a pen.\n\nThe man is dressed casually in a dark, short-sleeved T-shirt and wears tinted glasses. His hair is cut in a style typical of the 1970s or 1980s, suggesting the photo may be from that era.\n\nThe background shows a complex setup of electronic or technical equipment housed in an open metal rack. There are numerous wires and parts visible, indicating a workspace used for technical or experimental purposes.\n\nTo his right, on the wall, there is a large mounted board featuring a schedule or a project timeline made of colored rectangular labels, which seems to track progress or assignments. The wall also features miscellaneous papers and a visible calendar or chart, adding to the busy and functional nature of the room.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of focused activity, typical of professional settings involving technical or scientific work.","title":"The Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), is a unique, multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group.
