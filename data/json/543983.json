{"path":"543983.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and intense scene at what appears to be a large waterway, possibly during an emergency situation such as a flood or industrial accident. In the foreground is a river or lake with turbulent, muddy water indicating strong currents or recent heavy rains.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a sizable structure, likely a dam or floodgate, made from concrete and steel. It is designed to control water flow, and part of it extends horizontally across the picture. The floodgate or dam is partially open, with water forcefully rushing through the opening.\n\nOn the right side of the image, immediately adjacent to the dam, there is a significant fire occurring on the water's surface. Thick black smoke billows upward from the flames, heavily contrasting against the lighter sky and contributing to a sense of chaos and danger.\n\nThe setting suggests a remote or rural area, emphasized by the presence of tree-covered hills in the background. It's a cloudy or overcast day which adds to the somber atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of intense environmental and possibly man-made turmoil, highlighting the powerful forces of nature and the potential dangers associated with water management infrastructure.","title":"Burning barge on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["553136","552928","550654","547215","550701","544734","547238","547037","553392","550710","550222","550743","550865","553349","548309","543978"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["dam","danger","accident","emergency","water","flame","chaos","flood","situation","current"]}
