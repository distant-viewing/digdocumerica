{"path":"543309.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and picturesque view of a rocky coastal scene, characterized by the powerful interaction between the sea and the land. The image is taken from an elevated perspective, looking down onto a section of coastline where the ocean meets jagged cliffs and rocks.\n\nThe ocean, predominantly occupying the upper half of the frame, appears vigorous with swirling white foam and deep blue waves crashing against the rocky outcrops. The movement of the water suggests a strong, possibly turbulent sea, highlighting its natural power and the relentless action of waves breaking upon the shore.\n\nThe rocks are dark and angular, creating a stark contrast against the vibrant blue of the ocean and the white foam of the crashing waves. These rock formations extend from the middle to the bottom right of the frame, showing layers and geological textures which indicate weathering and erosion, possibly shaped by centuries of maritime influence.\n\nThere is also a noticeable cove or indentation where the waves have receded at this moment, revealing a small beach area covered with sand or fine pebbles along with some scattered larger rocks. This secluded spot, encased by towering cliff faces, adds an element of calmness and isolation juxtaposed with the surrounding vigorous ocean activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the natural interplay and contrast between rock and water, along with the capture of intense marine colors and textures, beautifully conveys the rugged and unyielding character of a coastal landscape.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543295","545122","543092","543289","553775","543300","543291","543067","543297","543139","543250","553771","543061","543308","543433","543243"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","wave","rock","foam","cliff","cove","sea","pebble","capture","outcrop"]}
