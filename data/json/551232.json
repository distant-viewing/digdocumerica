{"path":"551232.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a natural scene featuring eroded landforms. In the foreground, there is a sandy area with distinct ripples and patterns suggesting water flow; this forms a shallow groove leading toward a small stream or collection of water nestled between two large mounds of soil. These mounds appear to be composed of reddish-brown earth, likely rich in iron, showing signs of erosion with jagged edges and loose debris.\n\nBetween the two mounds, the area is strewn with various-sized rocks, hinting at a dried up riverbed where water may intermittently flow. Behind the mounds, the land rises gently and is covered with lush green vegetation, dominated by grasses and small shrubs, suggesting a semi-wild environment.\n\nThe overall setting is remote and appears to be in a natural state with no immediate signs of human influence visible in the scene. The light is soft, possibly indicating a cloudy sky, which adds to the moody, untouched atmosphere of the landscape.","title":"Siltation is a problem of the Lake of the Ozarks region, a result of shallow clay soil and poorly bound land.
