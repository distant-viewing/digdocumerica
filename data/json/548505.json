{"path":"548505.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph features a young osprey in its nest. The bird, positioned in the foreground, has a distinctive appearance with speckled plumage in shades of brown, black, and white, and intense, piercing eyes. It appears to be half-seated within the nest, giving the viewer a direct and slightly intimidating stare.\n\nThe nest itself is large and constructed from an array of sticks and other natural debris. It is built atop what looks like a man-made structure, suggested by the presence of a white, cylindrical object with a clear, ribbed top, possibly housing some sort of light or sensor.\n\nThe setting around the nest is not intensely detailed due to the shallow depth of field, but hints of a natural environment—likely a coastal or riverine area—are visible in the blurred background. The sky is mainly clear with soft lighting, adding to the serene yet wild atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Nesting atop chesapeake bay channel marker","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548497","548490","548493","544513","544505","544501","553876","544489","555010","548501","555011","555012","544477","549231","544547","544497"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["nest","stare","pierce","plumage","stick","sort","bird","build","construct","array"]}
