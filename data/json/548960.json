{"path":"548960.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene probably within a research or agricultural setting. It features a large cow, predominantly brown with white patches, secured in a harness within a washing or grooming area. Intriguingly, the cow has what appears to be a scientific or medical device attached to its side, resembling a circular port window, possibly for observation or collection of biological data.\n\nAn individual, possibly a scientist or technician, who is actively engaged in washing or grooming the cow is visible to the right of the image. The person is using a hose and seems focused on the task, indicated by how they are reaching towards the top of the cowâ€™s back.\n\nThe setting is outdoors within a sturdy, fenced enclosure made of wood and wire, indicative of a farm or experimental station. In the background, a distant view of a mountain range under partly cloudy skies adds a naturalistic element to the setting, suggesting a remote or rural location.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of agricultural activity, scientific research, and natural scenery, emphasizing an intersection of animal care and scientific inquiry.","title":"On experimental farm operated by epa's Las Vegas national research center: \"big sam\", steer with \"see through\" hole in his hide","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548959","552669","548993","554950","554949","552569","554917","548952","548962","548957","553107","553271","552465","551732","554560","553100"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["cow","groome","research","technician","inquiry","scientist","harness","data","enclosure","hose"]}
