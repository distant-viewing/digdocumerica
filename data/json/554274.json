{"path":"554274.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"In the photograph, an adult, likely male, is seen pulling a sled across a snow-covered surface. The sled carries a small child dressed warmly, with an apparent hat and pacifier, and some other personal items, possibly blankets or clothing. The adult is dressed in casual winter wear, including a dark jacket, jeans, and boots, with a hat and is facing away from the camera, moving towards the right of the frame.\n\nThe background features a parking lot scenario with several vehicles, indicating it might be a public or communal area, possibly near shops or a market. The vehicles include a variety of models from what appears to be the late 20th century, including a station wagon and a couple of pickup trucks, one of which is branded \"Chevrolet.\" Some of the vehicles have snow on them, which underscores the wintry setting.\n\nThere is a subdued, overcast lighting, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The environment and the clothing of the individuals suggest that this photo was taken in a region that experiences a harsh, cold climate during winter. The simplicity and mundanity of the scene evoke a sense of everyday life in a wintery setting.","title":"Snug as a bug in a carton on runners","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["555539","552675","548153","558246","543386","554229","558247","554290","554262","558248","554263","554291","554272","545078","548032","548029"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["winter","snow","adult","vehicle","clothing","wintry","subdued","hat","pickup","trucks"]}
