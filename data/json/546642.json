{"path":"546642.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features an urban street scene during what appears to be twilight or evening, as indicated by the dark ambiance and street lighting. The main focus is a person standing in the middle of the street, likely at a crosswalk, wearing a bright red jacket which sharply contrasts with the darker surroundings. This individual is captured in mid-stride, suggesting movement across the street. In the foreground, a blurred light, possibly a traffic signal or reflective object, dominates the lower left corner, adding a surreal, glowing effect to the scene.\n\nThe background shows a cityscape including buildings, a street lined with vehicles, and other elements typical of a busy urban environment. One of the buildings has distinctive architecture with a curved façade and striped detailing. There is observable traffic, both stationary and in motion, with headlights and street lights contributing to the urban night-time setting. The overall composition uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus primarily on the person and elements in the mid-ground, while the foreground and the far background softly blur, emphasizing the atmospheric and moody quality of the image.","title":"Traffic officer at busy intersection of Pennsylvania avenue and 11th street, nw","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546646","553822","545368","547051","555930","549916","557277","556199","548368","549863","556983","555446","548373","551864","555381","557276"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","surreal","traffic","stationary","atmospheric","headlight","signal","detailing","façade","person"]}
