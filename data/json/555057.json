{"path":"555057.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and lush forest scene, rich in greenery and natural textures. The focus of the image is on a large, moss-covered tree trunk on the left, with its rough bark providing detail and texture. The trunk leans slightly, directing the viewer's gaze deeper into the forest.\n\nSurrounding the base of this tree is a variety of ferns and small plants, flourishing in the damp environment typical of a temperate rainforest. The ferns are particularly prominent, their leaves ranging from bright green to rusty red, suggesting different levels of sunlight and moisture in different areas.\n\nIn the background, numerous other trees can be seen. These trees appear tall and straight, demonstrating a dense woodland setting. The trees further back are shrouded in a soft, diffuse light, potentially a result of moisture in the air or a light mist, typical for forest environments like this.\n\nThe ground is barely visible beneath a carpet of ferns and moss, indicating a healthy, undisturbed natural environment. Overall, the composition emphasizes depth and the lushness of the ecosystem, inviting the viewer to contemplate the quiet and complex beauty of a forest.","title":"Salal, red huckleberry shrubs, western sword fern and bead ruby forest floor cover on an ocean strip in the Pacific Coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545271","555000","555054","545285","554975","555043","554961","554999","554978","554992","554958","542958","554972","555028","545278","554970"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","forest","moisture","moss","trunk","rainforest","lushness","tree","carpet","result"]}
