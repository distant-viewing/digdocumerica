{"path":"554453.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a picturesque landscape scene. In the foreground, there's an area of large, moss-covered boulders which provides a naturalistic texture to the image. Near the right side of the boulders, an individual is seen bending over, apparently engaged in some activity on the rock, possibly observing or interacting with something.\n\nDominating the middle ground is a rustic wooden fence, somewhat weathered and rugged, adding a rural character to the scene. This fence runs horizontally across the image and appears to be a boundary or part of an enclosure on the rise of a hill.\n\nBeyond the immediate foreground and middle ground, the landscape opens up into a sweeping view. It features lush, green patches of forests and fields descending towards a large body of water, which reflects a hint of the sky above. This expanse of water is bordered by rolling hills and shores that are dotted with trees, contributing to a serene and tranquil environment. In the distance across the water, more agricultural fields or possibly settlements can be seen, enhancing the pastoral feel of the photograph.\n\nThe scene is captured under an overcast or softly lit sky, contributing to the muted tones and tranquil ambiance of the setting. The image overall suggests a blend of natural beauty and peaceful rural life, possibly taken from a high vantage point that overlooks this serene landscape.","title":"View from the top of Mount Defiance overlooking Fort Ticonderoga and Lake Champlain, scene of major military maneuvers during colonization in what is now New York State.
