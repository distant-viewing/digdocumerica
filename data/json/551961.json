{"path":"551961.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph shows an older man standing outdoors, directly facing the camera with a serious expression. He is shirtless, revealing his bare chest and stomach, and his silver hair appears slightly tousled. In his hands, he holds two large, ripe peaches, positioning them slightly in front of his waist.\n\nThe background features a rustic setting with a weathered house partially visible, featuring pale green walls and white window frames. There appears to be a door open behind him. The lawn is green and the area is shaded, indicating either dawn or dusk or the presence of dense tree coverage, suggested by the blurred green and brown shapes that frame the top portion of the image.\n\nThe overall mood of the image carries a strong, impactful presence, focusing on the man in a very straightforward, unembellished manner. The simplicity of the scene and natural lighting contribute to a somewhat raw and intimate portrait.","title":"Retired man stretches his income by growing vegetables.
