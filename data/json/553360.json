{"path":"553360.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a mature woman outdoors, engaged in orienteering or a similar navigational activity in a forested setting. She is attentively looking down at a map she holds with both hands, concentrating on finding her way or a specific location. The woman is dressed in a light long-sleeve shirt with a high collar and cuffs, paired with dark pants, and she wears a pen or tool clipped to her shirt. A strap crosses her body, possibly from a bag or camera slung over her shoulder.\n\nShe is surrounded by a natural environment composed of rugged and partially sunlit terrain. There's a large rock immediately next to her, covered in moss and small plants, indicating a moist or shady location. The background is softly blurred with greenery, suggesting a dense woodland area. Sunlight filters through the canopy, offering a contrast of light and shadow which highlights the textures of the leaves, rock, and the woman's focused face.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses on the woman and her interaction with the map, contextualized by the tranquil yet wild nature around her.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["545515","543835","554557","552398","546316","545785","543380","543864","544345","545527","545516","554513","554570","546280","543319","554672"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["map","woman","clip","sling","cuff","strap","pen","rock","concentrate","location"]}
