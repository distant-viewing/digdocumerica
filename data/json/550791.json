{"path":"550791.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, densely wooded area, primarily featuring a variety of tall trees and dense undergrowth. The trees are mixed, some displaying thin, spindly trunks, while others are thicker and more robust. The canopy above is lush, filtering sunlight through varying shades of green leaves, casting dappled light and creating a play of light and shadow on the forest floor below.\n\nNo discernible path or human presence is evident, emphasizing the natural, untouched feel of the scene. The sun, possibly at a midday position, illuminates the upper portions of the trees and leaves, enhancing the vibrancy of the greens and creating a stark contrast with the darker areas below.\n\nThe composition focuses on the vertical rise of the trees, using their natural lines to draw the eye upward towards the light filtering through the canopy. This vertical perspective emphasizes the height and density of the forest. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility and the untouched beauty of a natural forest environment.","title":"Forest in oneida county","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["554425","555118","555120","546947","549234","542725","558082","554393","545488","555116","558012","554990","554394","547643","555051","555114"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","canopy","filter","midday","undergrowth","tree","leave","vibrancy","upward","density"]}
