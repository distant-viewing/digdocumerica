{"path":"555430.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man attentively reading documents in a dimly lit, vintage-looking room. The central figure is seated near a window draped with heavy patterned curtains in shades of red and gold, through which soft natural light diffuses into the room.\n\nThe man, presumably focused on his work, holds a magnifying glass over what appears to be a sheet of paper, suggesting that he is either examining fine details or struggling with small print. His other hand is holding another piece of paper. Strewn across the wooden table in front of him are more papers and documents, indicating a serious or scholarly activity, possibly research or study.\n\nTo his right, an old-fashioned oil lamp with a clear glass chimney and a shiny metal base provides additional light, enhancing the atmospheric, almost timeless quality of the setting. The room conveys a sense of history or academia, underlined by the dark, rich colors and the traditional decor. The overall ambiance is one of quiet concentration and historical pursuit.","title":"Oregon Governor Tom McCall used a kerosene lamp in his office to read mail as a method to get the public's attention regarding the seriousness of the energy crisis in the Pacific Northwest.","placename":"Salem (Or.)","location":"Salem, Oregon","nn1":["552647","556250","548252","547353","552619","542690","547366","545471","557765","546572","555532","548458","555417","553030","551897","547427"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["paper","room","document","pursuit","print","glass","decor","gold","sheet","curtain"]}
