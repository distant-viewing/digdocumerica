{"path":"554651.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a vibrant autumn landscape, likely taken from someone flying in a light aircraft, as indicated by the partial view of the aircraft's wing structure visible at the top of the frame. The landscape below is characterized by a series of rolling hills densely covered with trees that display a brilliant array of fall colors ranging from deep reds and oranges to lighter yellows and greens. \n\nThere are two prominent bodies of water visible in the scene, reflecting the blue sky above. These could be lakes or large ponds, surrounded by trees and contributing a serene blue contrast to the warm autumn hues. \n\nTowards the right-hand side of the image, there's a small community nestled among the trees on the shore of the larger lake. This area includes several houses, some roads, and likely some small boats docked near the water's edge, suggesting a peaceful residential or vacation area. The setting overall speaks to a tranquil, natural environment possibly popular for retreats and outdoor activities like hiking and boating. The background is dominated by the hills filled with a thick canopy of trees, giving a sense of seclusion and natural wilderness.","title":"The lower end of Long Lake, in the fall, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554714","554723","554712","554713","554648","554758","554711","554757","554649","554653","554756","557127","558061","554761","554636","554637"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["aircraft","vacation","lake","retreat","boating","hiking","seclusion","wing","hill","tree"]}
