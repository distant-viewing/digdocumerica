{"path":"547888.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction, likely caused by a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado. The foreground is cluttered with debris, including pieces of wood, panels, and miscellaneous materials scattered chaotically. A prominent object in the foreground is a large white door lying flat on the ground, displaying three recessed panels and traces of worn, peeled paint.\n\nFurther into the scene, a black car is visible, partially dismantled or damaged, and heavily covered with dust and debris. It appears abandoned and serves as a poignant reminder of the force of destruction. Around the car, the ground is littered with more debris, including bits of metal, wood, and other unidentifiable objects. In the background, the landscape is flat and desolate, with no visible intact structures, only more scattered debris and bare trees.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber, reflecting the aftermath of a severe destructive event, emphasizing themes of loss and abandonment. The color scheme is washed out, with muted earth tones dominating, enhancing the sense of desolation.","title":"Trash from construction near the community of Broad Channel in Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553470","544797","544464","554302","544463","553556","544458","544583","557993","547868","547130","547079","544468","553863","554536","547927"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["destruction","debris","panel","dismantle","loss","wood","reminder","trace","disaster","wash"]}
