{"path":"547392.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an indoor photograph showing two elderly women engaged in a conversation. The woman on the left has her back to the camera and is seen only partially; she wears a plaid shirt with light blue, dark blue, and white colors. Her hair is styled in a short, curly manner typical of older women.\n\nThe other woman, facing the camera, is visible from the side and has a concerned expression. She wears a blue blouse with a corsage of white flowers pinned near her left shoulder. Her eyeglasses have thick frames, and her gray hair is also styled in a short, curly manner. An elaborate necklace with dark colored beads and earrings can be seen accessorizing her outfit. She appears to be speaking, possibly in a moment of explaining something important or expressing an opinion.\n\nThe background is dimly lit but hints at a social gathering setting with at least one other individual, a woman, visible in the far right of the photograph. She is wearing a light blue garment and seems to be watching or listening to the main subjects. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting and expressions suggest a sincere, possibly poignant moment of communication among elderly individuals in a social setting.","title":"Ladies club meeting at the Seward Civic Center","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547379","547358","551337","557175","553484","556176","557177","552962","557143","548482","558335","551817","557910","551334","551436","546855"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["woman","manner","eyeglass","earring","necklace","garment","hair","communication","camera","expression"]}
