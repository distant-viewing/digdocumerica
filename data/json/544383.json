{"path":"544383.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape featuring a large body of water and rugged terrains. In the foreground, there is a glimpse of dark silhouetted land on the left side of the image, suggesting a viewpoint from a higher elevation, perhaps a hill or cliff overlooking the scene.\n\nThe focus then shifts to a harbor at the middle distance, where numerous white boats are densely docked at jetties extending into the water. The boats are brightly lit, likely by the sunlight, contrasting sharply against the darker blue of the water.\n\nFurther in the background, striking geological formations dominate the scene. These formations are a series of cliffs and hills with distinct layers and erosions, showcasing a variety of earthy colors, primarily hues of red, orange, and pale white. The texture of these rocky formations suggests a desert-like environment, possibly indicating a location known for its arid conditions and unique rock strata.\n\nAbove the landscape, the sky is partly cloudy with some areas brightly highlighted and others more subdued, offering a dynamic and dramatic overhead view that adds a sense of impending weather change or the progression of the day.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the tranquility of a boat-filled harbor with the majestic and rugged beauty of the desert cliffs, capturing a moment of natural and human-made harmony.","title":"Arizona--near Page","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["542907","542877","548247","544170","543059","543046","544142","542872","552921","545277","545026","555694","545081","552222","543402","544125"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["cliff","harbor","formation","boat","desert","stratum","impend","harmony","jetty","shift"]}
