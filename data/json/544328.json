{"path":"544328.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape, featuring a large factory complex by the waterside. In the foreground, there is a body of vivid blue water, possibly a lake or coastal area, which contributes a natural element contrasting with the industrial activity.\n\nBehind the water, on a thin strip of land, there are two individuals who appear to be engaged in a leisurely activity, possibly walking or observing the scenery. Despite the industrial background, their presence adds a human element to the scene, suggesting interaction or coexistence with the industrial environment.\n\nDominating the middle and background are multiple large industrial structures with several tall chimneys emitting plumes of smoke or steam into the sky. The factory structures are dense with metallic frameworks, pipes, and other industrial apparatus. The smoke disperses into the sky, merging with the clouds, which adds a dynamic element to the sky, indicating ongoing industrial processes.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image is somewhat muted with hints of blue and gray, prevalent in both the sky and the water, creating a somewhat melancholic but realistic industrial scene. The image captures the juxtaposition of industrial development with natural and human elements.","title":"Four corners power plant","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["548070","552194","547696","551576","552179","552210","546080","551156","545996","552246","548068","554630","550868","550344","547084","546073"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["factory","waterside","smoke","disperse","apparatus","element","emitte","strip","coexistence","merge"]}
