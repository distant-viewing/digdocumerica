{"path":"547031.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a pebble-covered beach with the ocean in the background. The sea is a significant part of this image, characterized by small, gentle waves and a vast, open water area under a clear blue sky.\n\nDominating the foreground, an unusual object—a tractor—is partially submerged in shallow seawater. This tractor, facing the ocean, is involved in what seems to be either a beach reclamation project, coastal management work, or possibly even a fishing activity, although the exact purpose isn't clear from the image alone. The tractor is captured in motion, with water splashing around its wheels as it displaces the shallow wave fronts.\n\nThere is a person visible on the tractor, sitting and controlling the machinery, suggesting human activity related to work rather than leisure. The person wears attire typical for operating heavy machinery or possibly for protection against the elements. No other people are visible in the scene, emphasizing the solitary nature of this task.\n\nThe beach is layered with small pebbles rather than fine sand, hinting at the geographical characteristics of this particular coastline. There are no significant landscape features or other structures visible in the background; only the open, expansive sea fills the horizon, suggesting a remote or less developed coastal location. The lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the tranquil and somewhat industrious mood of the setting. Overall, this photograph offers a narrative of human interaction with the natural marine environment, captured in a moment of mechanical intervention.","title":"A bulldozer piles Boulders in an attempt to prevent lake shore erosion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547151","547041","547186","544976","547167","547177","547117","547926","547939","545086","543113","543209","548808","545204","545077","545081"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["tractor","pebble","beach","reclamation","ocean","wave","sea","machinery","protection","characteristic"]}
