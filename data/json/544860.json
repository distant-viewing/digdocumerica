{"path":"544860.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph portrays a serene and picturesque forest landscape. The composition of the image emphasizes a winding dirt road that cuts through a dense array of tall coniferous trees, primarily pines, with their dark and rugged textures. The road itself, covered with gravel, meanders gently through the scene, leading the viewer's eye towards a distant point where patches of sunlight illuminate the tops of the trees in the background, creating a contrast with the deeper, shadowy foreground.\n\nOn the sides of the road, the ground shows scattered rocks, and small grasses spotting the edges, blending with the wild, natural terrain. The treesâ€™ foliage is lush and green, suggesting that the photo was taken during a time of year when the forest is in full bloom, perhaps late spring or summer. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be morning or late afternoon, as the light seems soft and not too harsh, casting gentle shadows and giving the forest a calm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a hill or a gentle slope, on which more evenly spaced trees stand, their leaves catching the light in a way that makes them appear almost glowing compared to the darker foreground. The sky, visible only through a small clearing at the top of the trees, appears bright and possibly clear, hinting at good weather, contributing to the overall tranquil and refreshing mood of the scene.","title":"Forest road near West Dolores River","placename":"West Dolores River (Colo.)","location":"West Dolores River, Colorado","nn1":["545262","554394","554720","553464","557011","547659","556976","542849","550567","555217","558082","555119","542950","548025","550602","554393"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","road","tree","pine","bloom","year","top","clearing","gravel","calm"]}
