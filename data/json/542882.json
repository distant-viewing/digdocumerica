{"path":"542882.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a sweeping aerial view of a landscape predominantly characterized by natural elements. The central feature of the image is a sizable body of water that reflects the sunlight, creating a bright, shimmering effect on its surface. Surrounding the water on one side is a large, sandy or silty area that gives way to dense forests. These forests, consisting mainly of tall coniferous trees, cover much of the visible terrain and extend to the edges of the image.\n\nThe terrain slopes upward from the water body into the forest, indicating the presence of a hillside or mountainous region. The color contrast between the dark green of the trees and the lighter colors of the sandy shore and sparkling water creates a stunning natural tableau. There are no visible buildings, people, or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched and remote nature of the landscape. The photograph captures a sense of tranquility and the vast scale of the natural environment.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555695","552141","556931","556906","556930","556926","550579","555702","555705","550601","556928","550541","554652","555698","554527","548178"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forest","tableau","water","hillside","terrain","way","slope","body","shore","effect"]}
