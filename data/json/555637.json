{"path":"555637.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape centered around a body of water, possibly a lake or reservoir. Prominently featured in the center of the image is a solitary, leafless tree partially submerged in the water, suggesting a high water level or flooding. The tree stands bare, with its branches sprawling outward, creating a stark contrast against the water's smooth surface.\n\nIn the foreground, other smaller green shrubs or bushes are partially visible, hinting at the edge of the body of water where the photo might have been taken from. In the middle ground, directly across the lake, there's a rocky dirt bank, sloping gently down towards the water.\n\nThe background is dominated by a densely wooded hill that rises steeply from the opposite shore of the water. The hill is covered with a variety of trees, most of which are lush and green, indicative of a vibrant, healthy forest environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo is calm and tranquil, with the natural elements creating a balanced scene that captures the tranquility of an untouched water-side landscape. The colors are vibrant, with rich greens and blues predominating, and the natural lighting suggests that the photograph was taken on a bright day, casting soft shadows and enhancing the peacefulness of the setting.","title":"Strip mined land in Muskingham County near Chandlersville, Ohio.
