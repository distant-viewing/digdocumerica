{"path":"554377.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a car show, possibly from the 1970s based on the style of the cars and fashion of the people. The image is mostly taken up by two cars: the foreground features a dark-colored sedan with reflective surfaces and chrome details, and a young child, wearing a captain-style hat, leaning out of the driverâ€™s side window. The child appears engaged and perhaps excited by the surroundings.\n\nIn the background, there is a light yellow sports car, which stands in contrast with the dark sedan in the foreground. Several adults are milling around this car, examining it and conversing. The environment suggests an indoor venue, marked by a carpeted floor and a structured, colorful backdrop with alternating red and black vertical stripes. The mood of the event appears casual yet lively, with people dressed in varied styles of the time, including jackets and casual shirts.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a vibrant, nostalgic quality, reflecting an era of distinct automotive design and fashion trends. It captures the curiosity and excitement typically found at car shows, especially as seen through the eyes of a young child.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York coliseum at Columbus circle in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554390","554372","554389","554373","554381","557016","552412","554376","554387","555475","556538","557709","554375","554392","552788","552792"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","child","sedan","fashion","trend","alternate","style","excitement","venue","chrome"]}
