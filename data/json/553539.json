{"path":"553539.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor urban scene with a young person walking past a dilapidated two-story building. The building has a rough stucco exterior painted in a muted gray-blue and accented with stark white around the windows and the base. Each of the visible side windows is differently boarded or closed-off, suggesting abandonment or disrepair.\n\nThe foreground shows grassy, uneven terrain with patches of dirt and some scattered debris, enhancing the sense of neglect. A significant feature of the building is its prominent metal gate, featuring a mesh pattern with a solid, faded frame that is slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of a darkened interior staircase.\n\nThe individual walking by the building is dressed in casual attire, seemingly in mid-stride, and looks to be heading purposefully in a direction tangential to the building's front, without paying any attention to it. The time appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the subdued lighting and blue tint that envelops the scene, casting a cool and somewhat somber atmosphere over the setting.","title":"Residents of mulky square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side, face large scale displacement by a new interstate highway (i-635), many houses have been demolished, many others stand empty, for the people who remain, life goes on with little change, billy watkins, one of nine children of a biscuit worker's family, passes a run-down apartment building on his way home, the tenants have gone, the building is closed","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553537","556164","553824","550129","553549","553506","555952","555897","550253","553476","546423","552757","547515","552724","555902","552763"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["stucco","pay","building","envelop","off","darken","mesh","gate","subdued","staircase"]}
