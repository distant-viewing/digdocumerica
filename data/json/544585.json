{"path":"544585.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a wetland scene, possibly of a swamp or marsh. The foreground features clusters of broad-leaved aquatic plants, some with water droplets on their surfaces, reflecting their moist environment. The water surface is visible among the plants, indicating this area is submerged or partially flooded.\n\nThe mid and background are densely populated with a variety of trees, predominantly slender trunks that rise vertically with minimal branching, some with flared bases typical of cypress trees. These trees are covered in places with hanging moss, adding a textured, draped appearance that is characteristic of humid, swampy environments.\n\nThe sky appears to be overcast, providing diffused lighting that enhances the lush, green hues of the vegetation and dark, reflective water. This setting could be indicative of ecosystems found in regions like the southeastern United States or similar climatic zones. The overall atmosphere is rich, moody, and serene, typical of undisturbed natural wetland habitats.","title":"Along Loop Road","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544593","544589","546059","544595","544549","546181","544541","547532","544602","546205","550785","553856","545033","550783","544515","554717"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","swamp","basis","marsh","droplet","plant","moss","habitat","ecosystem","zone"]}
