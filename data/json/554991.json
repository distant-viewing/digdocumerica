{"path":"554991.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene, primarily a view of a forest floor covered in small green plants with star-shaped leaves and what appears to be dense, mossy vegetation. The lighting is dim, suggesting that the area is either shadowed by canopy or taken during a low-light time of day. The palette is predominantly shades of green and dark earth tones, giving it a lush and serene feel.\n\nThe entire frame is filled with the natural ground cover, showing little to no sky or horizon, which creates an intimate, close-up view of the undergrowth. The focus is on the texture and the variety of the plant life, with small patches of soil, fallen leaves, and sticks visible among the plants and moss. The composition lacks human elements, focusing solely on the tranquility and detail of the forest ecosystem.","title":"Hemlock seedlings on a moss covered nurse log in a dense forest of western red cedar, Douglas fir and hemlock on green mountain, in Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555054","554993","555026","555040","554980","555183","554554","554972","555043","555191","543542","554975","554961","554425","545271","550536"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","mossy","undergrowth","star","leave","forest","stick","moss","ecosystem","lack"]}
