{"path":"555051.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, densely wooded forest scene. Tall, straight trees, likely redwoods or similar large species, dominate the landscape, with their dark trunks standing prominently against the lighter background. The forest floor is lush with vibrant green ferns that spread extensively across the foreground, adding a delicate texture to the composition.\n\nFiltered sunlight streams through the canopy, creating beams of light that pierce the shadows and illuminate patches of the woodland floor and ferns with a soft glow. This interplay of light and shadow adds depth and a mystical quality to the scene.\n\nThe background, slightly obscured by the mist or light haze, enhances the sense of depth and the vastness of the forest. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and untouched, suggesting a remote or preserved natural area where the forest remains in its primeval state.","title":"Western sword/fern ground cover in a climax forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554965","554990","554425","554393","555118","555028","542745","554966","554394","555120","550791","542725","542845","555116","542931","542753"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["fern","forest","redwood","floor","specie","depth","stream","mist","beam","haze"]}
