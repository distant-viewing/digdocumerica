{"path":"546037.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an industrial area. The foreground is dominated by two large cylindrical storage tanks positioned side by side. The tank on the left is painted in a pale pink hue and has a significant shadow cast upon it, accentuating its cylindrical shape. There is a warning label with the text “DANGER DIESEL OIL” visible near the bottom of the pink tank. The adjacent tank is painted yellow and only partially visible on the right side of the frame.\n\nThe photo's depth is extended by a narrow gravel pathway running alongside the tanks, leading to an industrial setting in the background. Walking down this path are two individuals, distant and small in scale compared to the dominating presence of the tanks. The scene also includes a glimpse of various industrial structures and machinery, further outlined against a clear sky. Notably, a tall, metal tower structure, possibly a crane, rises in the background, and a smaller water tower can also be seen far in the distance.\n\nThe lighting and vibrant colors such as the blue sky, pink and yellow tanks, and metallic structures contribute to a vivid yet stark industrial ambiance. The contrast between the industrial equipment and the clear, unobstructed sky suggests a juxtaposition of nature and human-made environments.","title":"\"Industrial color psychology\" is experimented with on fuel storage tanks at the Avondale shipyard.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["542587","557386","546108","556402","549975","545273","546058","546062","542705","542987","546201","547505","546064","550917","548437","551987"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tank","tower","warning","label","gravel","pathway","side","crane","text","bottom"]}
