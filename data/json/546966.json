{"path":"546966.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph presents an outdoor scene focusing on a warning sign mounted on a vertical post in the foreground. The warning sign is rectangular, painted in yellow, and displays black bold text that reads:\n\n\"WARNING\nPROHIBITED AREA\nGATHERING OF OYSTERS,\nCLAMS, MUSSELS\nPROHIBITED BY LAW\nS.C.STATE BOARD OF HEALTH\"\n\nBehind the sign, slightly out of focus is a natural aquatic and forested backdrop. There is a body of water that appears calm, with a boat speeding by, creating a trail of white foam in its wake. The lake or river is surrounded by dense green foliage. Overall, the setting seems to be a protected natural area, possibly a water body near a forest or a reserved park. The image captures a serene environmental setting, emphasizing the importance of law enforcement in natural conservation areas.","title":"A cost of development","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["553749","543168","548063","554567","544228","548836","544971","550664","553859","547992","557474","543420","545248","548846","547854","550223"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","prohibit","enforcement","law","oyster","sign","importance","forest","wake","conservation"]}
