{"path":"551063.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a group of seven people, possibly a family or friends, sitting on the steps in front of a two-story building with faded and peeling white clapboard siding. The architecture gives the impression of an older, possibly commercial building with signage that reads \"FILM\" and \"CIGARS\", suggesting it might house a shop related to photography and/or tobacco. The building features a dark-colored door flanked by two large windows that are partially visible.\n\nThe group consists of six women and one young girl. The adults are variously seated on metal folding chairs or directly on the concrete steps, while the very young girl, clad in a red dress, stands to the side. Most members of the group are engaged in conversation, appearing relaxed and comfortable in each otherâ€™s company. One woman is holding a food container, suggesting they might be sharing a meal or snacks.\n\nThe scene is unstaged, with a candid, slice-of-life quality. The atmosphere is informal and communal, indicative of a warm, sunny day encouraging social interaction outdoors. The background is mostly obscured, but another building is partially visible behind the main scene. In the foreground, a portion of a vintage car in a teal blue color is seen parked next to the curb, seemingly from the 1960s or 1970s, adding to the historical ambiance of the photo.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a nostalgic feeling, capturing a moment of ordinary life and community interaction, likely in a small town or urban neighborhood setting from a past decade.","title":"Coffee klatsch on laundromat steps in cedar grove","placename":"Charleston (W.
