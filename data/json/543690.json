{"path":"543690.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene occurring in a rugged livestock pen area under a bright blue sky with scattered fluffy white clouds. A man, dressed in work attire with a grey shirt, dark gloves, and a wide-brimmed hat, appears to be actively engaged in handling a young goat. The man, showing a focused expression, lifts or moves the goat, which has predominantly white fur with dark patches around its neck and a dark stripe along its back.\n\nThe background features an extensive wooden fencing structure, indicative of large, well-used livestock handling facilities. There are numerous other goats visible in the vicinity, mostly congregated in groups, some near what looks like a feeding area constructed from similar wooden materials. The ground throughout the scene is a compacted, dusty soil, common in animal husbandry environments.\n\nThis scene effectively illustrates aspects of farm life and animal management, potentially during activities such as sorting or relocating livestock. The rural setting, the active interaction between the man and the goat, and the infrastructure designed for animal handling all combine to suggest a moment captured during daily farm operations.","title":"Ranch hand hoists calf for bRanding","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["548952","554880","548959","554883","552569","547326","554949","544391","547396","554916","554894","543686","554881","552568","554950","552573"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["goat","livestock","animal","farm","lift","fencing","pen","fur","glove","handling"]}
