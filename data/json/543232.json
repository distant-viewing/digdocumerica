{"path":"543232.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man engaged in the activity of fishing at a seaside location. The man, with grey hair and wearing a black jacket and blue jeans, is seated on a wooden dock. He is attentively holding a dramatically bent fishing rod, indicating that he is in the process of catching a fish. The rod is tipped towards the water where a small fish can be seen hanging from the fishing line just above the surface.\n\nAdjacent to the man is a beige bucket placed on the ground, partially filled, possibly with water or catch, emphasizing his successful fishing efforts. The dock appears rustic with visible aging and wear.\n\nIn the background, a calm sea dotted with several boats stretches out. Some of the boats are anchored and stationary, while others seem modest in size. A distant shoreline with low-rise buildings, likely a small coastal town or harbor facility, is visible. The sky above is clear and blue, suggesting good weather conditions ideal for outdoor activities like fishing.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a peaceful fishing scene, combining elements of leisure and the beauty of a calm maritime setting.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543484","550297","543231","548138","552291","550851","543076","554522","547884","554520","550666","554523","551024","552320","552026","544256"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","fish","catch","dock","seaside","boat","maritime","tip","anchor"]}
