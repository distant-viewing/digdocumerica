{"path":"550474.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph illustrates a close-up view of a rugged rock surface with intriguing textures and variations in color. Dominating the frame is a large, irregularly shaped boulder or rock fragment that displays a complex amalgamation of earthy tones and mineral deposits.\n\nThe rock's hue varies across its surface, with deep grays and blacks comprising the primary coloration. Sprinkled throughout are patches of a rusty orange or red material, likely iron oxide or a similar mineral, which contrast starkly against the darker tones of the stone. Additionally, small speckles of lichen or moss in vibrant green and yellow tones are spread unevenly across the rock, introducing organic life and color into the mineral texture.\n\nThe rock itself is jagged and raw, suggesting it may have been freshly broken or is naturally erosion-resistant. The composition is tightly focused on the rock's structure, with light striking the surface at angles that highlight the rock's rough, multifaceted texture and the interplay of light and shadow contributes to a sense of depth and ruggedness.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures an interesting geological subject in great detail, emphasizing the natural beauty and complexity of rock formations through color, texture, and composition. There is little to no background detail discernible, focusing the viewer's complete attention on the geological specimen.","title":"Small rock formation in Atigun Gorge, 4 miles east of pipeline crossing, showing mineral crystals and brightly colored lichens.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554410","555182","544907","545589","543151","552546","552890","550483","543421","544815","545558","550475","552444","543149","553582","550476"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","mineral","texture","specimen","speckle","lichen","tone","surface","deposit","iron"]}
