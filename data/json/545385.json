{"path":"545385.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in an urban setting with a focus on a vintage white bus. The bus is parked on a paved road, prominently displaying \"SIXTH AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH.\" Text on the bus lists various locations it serves, suggesting it's used for community transport.\n\nIn the foreground, three people are pictured. A woman on the right side of the frame is walking towards the bus, dressed in a white patterned outfit with red shoes, carrying a purse. She appears to be in motion, captured from the back. A man in the center stands facing the bus, possibly waiting to board; he is dressed casually. Another person is entering the bus and only partially visible; we see them from the back.\n\nThe background consists of residential buildings, likely apartments, characterized by their brick construction and relatively plain design. There are also some trees and a partially visible car. The sky is overcast, contributing to a somber ambiance, and the road reflects signs of recent rain through puddles and wet patches.\n\nOverall, the scene communicates a slice of everyday life, likely from a mid-20th-century American context, tied to a community or church-related activity.","title":"Sixth Avenue Baptist Church provides bus to get voters of Black community to the polls on primary election day.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545370","546605","547195","547814","546655","556742","556744","546668","546666","549891","549685","546735","549921","546604","553796","556809"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","back","purse","list","community","puddle","apartment","communicate","enter","church"]}
