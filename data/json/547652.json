{"path":"547652.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a desolate landscape undergoing significant alteration, possibly for development purposes. The ground in the foreground is uneven and strewn with debris, including bits of wood, scraps, and dirt tracks indicative of heavy vehicle movement. Several pale rocks are scattered about, and tire tracks crisscross the soil, highlighting recent activity.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are three structures which appear to be prefabricated homes or modular buildings, characterized by their flat roofs and simple, boxy shapes. These homes are presumably newly installed as part of a development project. The homes are spaced apart, with no visible landscaping or vegetation around them, emphasizing the raw, undeveloped state of the area.\n\nThe background shows a line of bare deciduous trees, suggesting the photograph was taken in a season when trees are dormant. Beyond the trees, the sky is clear and bright blue, indicating fair weather, which contrasts starkly with the barren and disrupted earth in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a transition phase in land use from natural or previously undeveloped state to a structured residential setting. The environment gives a sense of isolation and unfinished development, waiting for further construction and landscaping that would make it more habitable and aesthetically pleasing.","title":"Housing development at west greenwich center","placename":"Warwick (R.I.)","location":"Warwick, Rhode Island","nn1":["547664","554547","547863","555812","553130","543112","544118","544812","555629","552004","547523","556456","547914","544816","554548","553938"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["landscaping","hom","development","state","track","phase","undergo","install","strew","alteration"]}
