{"path":"545014.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene at a shoreline, likely illustrating an environmental issue such as pollution. The main body of the image is a large expanse of water shown with a deep purple tint, contrasting starkly with a typical water body's natural blue or green colors. This unusual color may indicate the presence of pollutants.\n\nThe foreground of the image showcases the shoreline, composed of small, dark rocky fragments that appear rugged and uneven. The line where the water meets the shore is clearly defined, marked by small waves lapping against the rocks, highlighting a tangible texture contrast between the wet, shimmering water and the dull, rough stones.\n\nIn the midground, the water extends toward the horizon, gently rippling under what seems to be a calm weather condition. The background features a distant shoreline with sparse vegetation visible, emphasizing a relatively flat landscape. The sky above is clear and expansive, suggesting a serene, albeit quietly disturbing scene due to the water's unnatural hue. \n\nOverall, the composition and the elements within this photograph subtly underscore environmental concerns, providing a powerful visual statement on water pollution. The quiet simplicity of the scene belies the likely problematic underlying cause of the waterâ€™s discoloration.","title":"Foul-smelling sulphite liquor spills into the ocean from settling pond at the menasha pulp mill","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["550734","544804","550723","544580","545904","552080","550368","555626","547524","547602","547493","543302","545168","555848","544175","552192"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["shoreline","water","lapping","pollution","rippl","statement","discoloration","pollutant","disturb","tint"]}
