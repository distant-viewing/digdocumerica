{"path":"549487.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a tall futuristic tower against a dark, cloudy sky background. The tower is viewed from a low angle, emphasizing its impressive height. At the top of the tower, there is a saucer-shaped structure encircled by a rim that features decorative bright lights extending outward like sunbeams, giving the object an illuminated, crown-like appearance. The main shaft of the tower is smooth and cylindrical, with what appears to be vertical strips or ridges running its length. It is lit in such a way that parts are brightly illuminated while others fade into shadow, highlighting its round form against the darker background. No people or other objects are visible in this scene, focusing the attention purely on the architectural feature and its dramatic lighting.","title":"The Skylon Observatory at the Ontario International Center at Niagara Falls.
