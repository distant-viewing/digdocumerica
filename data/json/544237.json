{"path":"544237.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a large boat, specifically a barge, on a body of water, possibly a river. The barge, painted predominantly in red and white, has multiple large tanks or silos on its deck, which are also painted red. It includes structural details such as piping and control stations on the upper deck, possibly for monitoring or managing the contents of the tanks.\n\nThe name \"HALLIBURTON 203\" is visible on the barge's side, indicating company ownership and possibly its numbering in a fleet. The barge appears to be a specialized vessel, likely used for industrial or commercial purposes related to the transport of liquids or gases in bulk.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by lush greenery, possibly a wetland or riverside vegetation, which suggests the photograph might have been taken in a natural, possibly ecologically sensitive area. The sky is bright and clear, indicating good weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the industrial profile of the barge against the natural environment surrounding it, emphasizing the interaction or intrusion of human-made structures in natural landscapes.","title":"Oil company vessel in marsh between Dulac and Cocodrie located on wetlands (south of Houma.)","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548200","544271","550912","544643","550951","548187","551565","548186","546938","550952","549802","548201","546830","550960","552208","546836"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["barge","deck","ownership","tank","intrusion","piping","liquid","company","riverside","silo"]}
