{"path":"544711.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water, glowing prominently with vibrant shades of red and orange. The water reflects the colors of the sunset, creating a rippled, shimmering surface that dominates the foreground of the image. The reflections create patterns that resemble liquid gold against the darker parts of the water.\n\nIn the center and upper parts of the image, the sky is visible and appears to be filled with a dense texture, possibly clouds, bathed in a deep red glow from the sun. This intensity of color suggests that the sun is low on the horizon, either setting or just having set.\n\nTowards the middle of the composition, a darker, undefined line suggests a distant shoreline or a horizon separating the water from the sky. There are also hints of vegetation or thin reeds emerging from the water’s edge, slightly disturbing the water’s surface around them and adding a touch of detail to the otherwise smooth expanse.\n\nThe scene radiates a peaceful and somewhat mystical quality, where the primary focus is on the interplay of light and color, textures of the sky and water, and the natural calm of a twilight scene. No people or human-made objects are visible; the photograph captures purely natural elements in a tranquil state.","title":"Sunset over the Leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552294","557447","547731","557497","552277","544707","554404","543144","554759","550296","542618","552335","543415","551206","543880","543143"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["water","sunset","sun","gold","reed","intensity","horizon","calm","twilight","texture"]}
