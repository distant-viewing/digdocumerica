{"path":"545023.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a silhouette of a sign placed prominently in the foreground, with text that reads \"Welcome to Weyerhaeuser NEXT MILL TOUR\" and a directional arrow pointing to the left labeled \"PARKING.\" The background exhibits a partially cloudy sky with a bright sunlight piercing through, casting an overall dim light across the scene. Emanating from the horizon line behind buildings, which includes a structure with a discernible cupola or small dome, are billows of dark smoke, suggesting an industrial setting, possibly a mill as referenced on the sign. The atmosphere is slightly hazy, likely due to the smoke, contributing to a somewhat obscured and muted backdrop. Visible in the far right, there is a partial view of a car, further establishing the setting in a parking area near the industrial facility. The overall composition balances elements of industry, environmental impact, and the daily functioning of this location.","title":"Weyerhauser pulp mill entrance","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546236","552037","551033","552212","547014","550173","542942","542997","557383","549967","557374","557412","550340","550722","548193","552211"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["parking","pointing","smoke","arrow","dome","mill","sign","industry","text","silhouette"]}
