{"path":"546309.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene of multiple hands engaging in scientific or environmental fieldwork on a boat. In the center of the image, there's a transparent cylindrical container, perhaps a sample collection tube, which is being held vertically and manipulated by several hands. Within this container, there’s a small fish specimen alongside a water sample. The hands, likely from at least three different people, are conducting a procedure or experiment involving the fish.\n\nThe hands of these individuals show varied characteristics; one wears a watch, another bears a distinctive bracelet, suggesting they are possibly researchers or environmental scientists. The background shows a blurry glimpse of water, indicative that this activity is taking place on a boat or near a body of water, possibly for the purpose of marine or freshwater research.\n\nTwo red plastic caps and a part of the boat’s blue and white edge are visible in the lower part of the image, providing more context to the setting and the equipment involved in this exercise. The presence of these components supports the inference that this is a structured, methodical activity focused on the study or observation of aquatic life.","title":"Epa gulf coast water supply research laboratory, Dauphin Island.
