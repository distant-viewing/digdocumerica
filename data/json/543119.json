{"path":"543119.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene twilight scene over a calm body of water, likely a sea or bay, featuring multiple boats scattered across the reflective surface. The skyline is dominated by a gradient of colors ranging from deep purple at the top to a warm orange near the horizon, suggesting a sunset or sunrise. The boats are varied in size and type, mostly small to medium sized, likely fishing or leisure vessels, appearing as dark silhouettes against the lighter backdrop of the water.\n\nThe water itself is smooth, indicating either a very still day or a sheltered location, and it mirrors the colors of the sky beautifully, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The horizon is flat, broken only by the faint outline of a landform in the distance and a few lights visible, possibly from buildings or other structures, which suggest human habitation nearby, yet not overly intrusive into the natural landscape. The overall composition of the image emphasizes peace and the natural beauty of the marine environment during a quiet moment of the day.","title":"The waterfront at sunset","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["550039","548247","552293","551214","545026","543143","543613","547110","547234","552311","545015","550758","543411","544661","543133","545096"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["landform","boat","peace","sunrise","bay","horizon","habitation","purple","gradient","twilight"]}
