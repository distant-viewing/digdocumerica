{"path":"555653.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic road extending towards a massive, snow-covered mountain. The mountain, dominating the background, is a prominent feature with its rugged, icy peaks contrasting sharply against a clear blue sky. On either side of the road, there are lines of tall, thin pine trees and other smaller shrubbery typical of a mountainous landscape. To the left of the road, an unusual arrangement of tall wooden poles, resembling an old or abandoned structure, extends parallel to the roadway. The road itself, winding gently through the scene, is being traveled by two vehicles—a car and a truck—that are moving towards the viewer. The overall composition of the image, with the road leading directly towards the mountain, creates a dramatic sense of depth and emphasizes the grand scale of the natural environment surrounding the built elements.","title":"View east along glen highway toward mount drum (elevation 12,002 feet) and intersection of road and trans-Alaska pipeline.  The 48-inch diameter pipeline will cross the roadway between the two vehicles.  The exact point is marked by a pair of wooden stakes along the right shoulder.
