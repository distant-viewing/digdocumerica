{"path":"546163.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a lone deer standing in a natural setting dense with vegetation. The deer, an adult with a visible set of small, velvety antlers, exhibits a summer coat patterned with white spots, typical of a fallow deer. Its tawny brown body is sleek, indicating the deer is healthy.\n\nThe animal is positioned slightly off-center to the left side of the frame, appearing to be in motion as it turns its head to the right, giving a profile view of its features including the elongated face and alert ears. Its gaze is directed towards something outside of the frame, suggesting curiosity or alertness.\n\nSurrounding the deer, the environment is lush and vibrant, dominated by various shades of green and yellow. A multitude of flowering plants and dense foliage envelop the area, hinting that the photo was taken in late spring or summer when plant life is at its peak.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph suggests early morning or late afternoon, evidenced by the soft, diffused sunlight enhancing the textures and colors of the deer's coat and the surrounding flora. There is no human activity or any artificial structures visible, reinforcing the feel of a tranquil, natural habitat. The focus is sharp on the deer and slightly softer on the background, skillfully drawing attention to the animal while still giving a sense of the dense, wild environment in which it resides.","title":"Wild deer","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["544916","546159","554621","545902","543279","542778","552339","558368","544623","550802","543369","550804","545898","550803","544114","543839"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","coat","summer","animal","dense","alertness","patterne","antler","flowering","ear"]}
