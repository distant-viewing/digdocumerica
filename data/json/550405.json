{"path":"550405.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial image capturing a complex landscape that likely involves water management or aquaculture. The image prominently features large areas divided into numerous rectangular and irregularly shaped pools or enclosures, many of which contain water varying in color from light blue to dark brown. Some of the sections are dry, showing muddy or vegetated surfaces, suggesting they are shallow basins designed to hold water temporarily.\n\nA network of pathways or narrow land strips separates the pools, providing access and serving as boundaries. The arrangement hints at a well-organized, large-scale activity, possibly related to fish farming or salt harvesting.\n\nNear the top and bottom of the photograph are larger bodies of water with natural, irregular shores, contrasting with the geometric shapes of the man-made pools. The larger water bodies might be natural lakes or lagoons interfacing with human intervention areas.\n\nThe terrain is mostly flat, and the overall color palette ranges from earthy browns, greens, and beige to various shades of blue and gray, indicating mixed usage of land and water. There are no visible buildings, machinery, or people, suggesting the photograph focuses purely on landscape and industrial layout.\n\nThe texture of the photograph is grainy, and the perspective indicates high altitudeâ€”likely taken from a plane or a drone, emphasizing the scale and the patterned complexity of the landscape.","title":"Patterned ground, a result of massive ice formations, and a small stream draining northward from galbraith lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["548640","543697","552991","548635","548631","542530","550638","548600","547725","555684","555863","555880","547724","555860","554053","544572"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pool","lagoon","water","aquaculture","interface","harvesting","enclosure","basin","salt","plane"]}
