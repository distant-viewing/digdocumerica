{"path":"552329.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"In the photograph, a man stands holding a large fish prominently displayed in front of the camera. The man appears to be middle-aged and is wearing dark outdoor clothing suitable for a wet environment, including a waterproof jacket and gloves. The fish, which looks to be a large salmon, dominates the foreground with its silver, speckled body and sleek shape.\n\nThe man is outdoors beside a river or lake, evidenced by the body of water and wet sand visible in the background. Behind him, a dense forest of tall trees, which appear to be conifers, lines the riverbank, stretching up a hillside. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or temperate climate, possibly in a northern geographic region.\n\nOverall, the composition centers around the man and his catch, set against the natural backdrop which suggests an active outdoor scene, likely from a fishing trip. The gloominess of the sky and the rugged outdoor wear of the man add to the wild, natural feel of the image.","title":"Winter steelhead trout fishing on the skagit river.
