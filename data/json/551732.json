{"path":"551732.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph features a group of three young people interacting with a cow in an outdoor setting. The setting appears to be a lush park with abundant green grass and a variety of mature trees in the background, suggesting a peaceful, natural environment possibly during spring or summer.\n\nThe cow is large, predominantly black with a white belly and face, and it stands on a wooden platform. One person, wearing a white blouse and dark pants, is positioned at the head of the cow, gently touching its head. Another individual, dressed in a yellow t-shirt and red pants, is standing in the center and seems to be either petting the cow or adjusting something on its head. The third person, wearing a patterned shirt and flared pants, stands to the right of the cow, holding a long stick with a decorative element at the top, which includes a skull and crossbones flag and other colorful decorations.\n\nThe group appears to be engaged in a calm and friendly manner with the cow, suggesting a moment of leisure or participation in an outdoor activity or event that involves animals. The wooden fence in the background and the absence of any urban structures give a sense of a rural or park setting, conducive to such interactions.","title":"On dairy day in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, some of the children saw a cow for the first time in their lives.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554949","553271","554950","549200","552669","552668","548960","553107","552569","548959","554917","554948","548993","544488","552665","554560"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cow","head","pant","park","participation","stick","group","person","decoration","t"]}
