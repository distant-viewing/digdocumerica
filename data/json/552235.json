{"path":"552235.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening scene by a lakeside where a man and two young children are interacting with ducks in the water. The setting sun casts soft light across the scene, illuminating the small waves in the water and providing a silhouette effect to the numerous boats docked in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, a man stands on the left side, dressed casually in a short-sleeved shirt, blue shorts, and white socks, looking on as he perhaps throws food or stones into the water. Next to him are two young children, each wearing shorts and T-shirts; one in yellow, the other in white. They are actively engaged, reaching towards the water, likely feeding or attempting to touch the ducks that are swimming nearby.\n\nThe background features a dense array of sailboats and other small boats moored at a marina, lined up neatly and surrounded by a row of trees. The peacefulness of the setting is underscored by the natural scenery and the recreational context suggested by the presence of the marina.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its blend of human activity, wildlife interaction, and tranquil boating elements, paints a picture of a leisurely, family-oriented moment by the water.","title":"Feeding the ducks on lake Washington.
