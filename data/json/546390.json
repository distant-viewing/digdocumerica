{"path":"546390.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling agricultural or industrial scene, likely focused on sugarcane processing. In the foreground, there's a dirt road that leads towards an industrial complex. On the right side of the image, a tractor is visible, towing a large yellow trailer loaded with sugarcane. The driver sits atop the tractor, dressed in light-colored attire, managing the vehicle beneath a clear blue sky.\n\nOn the left side, there are several workers walking beside heaps of harvested sugarcane that are piled on red wheeled baskets, apparently moving towards or away from the processing plant. These workers are dressed in casual work clothes, suitable for labor-intensive tasks.\n\nIn the background, the industrial plant itself prominently features a large structure with metal frameworks and conveyor systems. There is a white smokestack emitting a dense plume of dark smoke that disperses into the sky, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. The setup indicates the processing of the harvested sugarcane.\n\nAdding a tropical touch to this industrial setting, there are a couple of tall palm trees in the background, contrasting with the busy, man-made environment. The overall composition illustrates a typical day at a sugarcane processing facility, highlighting the interaction between industrial operations and agricultural production.","title":"Sugar refinery.
