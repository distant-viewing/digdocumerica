{"path":"547077.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of significant flooding around a residential area. A small, white single-story house with a reddish roof is visible; it has two visible windows and a red and white striped awning over one of the windows, suggesting a small porch or entry area. The house is surrounded by water, indicating a flood situation. In the flooded yard, a picnic table with attached benches and two green lawn chairs are partially submerged in the water, emphasizing the depth of the flooding.\n\nIn the foreground, a traditional mailbox on a post is also partially submerged, standing out against the water as a focal point in the image. To the left and in the background, more of the area can be seen flooded, including what appears to be another building or a storage shed, also affected by the water.\n\nThe background includes bare trees and a power line, suggesting either a late fall or early spring setting based on the lack of foliage. The sky is overcast, casting a soft light over the scene, which underscores the somber and disruptive nature of a flood event like this. The mood conveyed is one of quiet disruption, portraying the impact of natural disasters on residential life.","title":"Flooding of Lake Michigan in Zion--the result of a severe storm","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552436","552857","547036","552843","552825","552824","547212","548300","552852","552850","552848","552849","547266","547079","552845","552854"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["flood","flooding","mailbox","entry","awning","house","picnic","disruption","disaster","situation"]}
