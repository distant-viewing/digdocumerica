{"path":"543860.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"In this photograph, there is a young child, possibly a boy, standing on a weathered wooden deck in front of an old, weathered house. The house features peeling white paint and a partially open door, showing darkness inside. The child is wearing only a diaper and sneakers, and is intently focused on a large baby bottle that he is holding with both hands, suggesting he is drinking or about to drink from it. The child's posture is relaxed yet concentrated, standing with slightly bent knees.\n\nThe environment around the child appears slightly neglected, with overgrown grass and unkempt boards lying around. The faded, rugged texture of the house juxtaposed with the innocent engagement of the child provides a poignant contrast, perhaps hinting at themes of childhood, nurturing, and living conditions. The natural lighting in the image suggests it could be midday or early afternoon, casting soft shadows and giving a warm, muted tone to the colors in the photograph.","title":"Migrant baby in front of two room shack, where three families (approximately 20 people) live","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["552960","553868","544215","544372","556138","556524","553495","544207","553553","556294","543688","548837","553523","543677","545539","553496"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","drink","house","baby","sneaker","childhood","concentrate","knee","relax","midday"]}
