{"path":"551436.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures an intimate and casual scene of two young women engaged in a discussion or shared activity. Both women appear focused on a small object that one of them is holding, which is a rectangular item, possibly a pamphlet or a booklet.\n\nThe woman on the left wears what seems to be a light red or pink striped shirt, paired with a maroon or dark red skirt. Her hair is blonde and styled in a casual manner. She holds the pamphlet with both hands, examining it closely.\n\nThe woman on the right is dressed in a light blouse decorated with a pattern, possibly floral or paisley, and blue jeans. She wears round glasses and her hair is also blonde, and pulled back away from her face. She leans slightly towards the other woman, looking at the pamphlet with a look of interest or enquiry.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurred crowd of people, suggesting a busy public space, possible in an urban environment. A fountain or sculpted feature can be observed directly behind them, contributing to the sense that this moment is taking place in a pedestrian-friendly area such as a square or a street with public art.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of casual, everyday interaction, captured in a candid manner in a public setting. The focus is on the interaction and engagement between the two women, providing a glimpse into a moment of their lives.","title":"Sculptured water fountain and reflecting pool on Nicollet Mall provide a pleasant backdrop for a noonday chat.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553164","554909","551472","552962","547358","551433","557175","544318","551813","556176","547379","551482","551466","549678","553541","553167"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["pamphlet","woman","manner","maroon","sculpt","hair","square","fountain","art","discussion"]}
