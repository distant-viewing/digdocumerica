{"path":"547331.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a woman engaged in the act of either entering or exiting a car parked on a city street. The woman is wearing a red plaid jacket over a yellow and red floral skirt. Her hairstyle appears to be short and practical. A chalkboard sign is prominently placed in the foreground of the image, detailing an event for a raffle associated with \"Mrs. Jaycees Wonder Bread Day\" scheduled for \"Tues., May 8th\" at the \"Wonder Bread Store.\" The sign encourages viewers to \"Buy your tickets NOW!!\"\n\nThe scene occurs on a sunny day, given the bright sunlight illuminating the details in the scene, such as the glint of the car and the crisp shadows on the ground. The atmosphere captures a regular day with an undercurrent of community activity, represented by the promotional sign for the local event. The background includes another parked car and typical cityscape elements yet remains slightly out of focus, placing the emphasis on the action and objects in the foreground.","title":"Sign in front of Jefferson County courthouse in Fairbury","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["556711","556715","556726","546849","545321","555944","556730","556723","549881","551937","556742","556725","549876","557908","549686","547174"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["glint","car","ticket","event","sign","act","hairstyle","skirt","woman","emphasis"]}
