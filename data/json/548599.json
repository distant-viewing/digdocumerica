{"path":"548599.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a snowy landscape featuring a large water treatment facility or series of retention ponds. The area is segmented into various shaped enclosures, many of which contain either dark blue or green water, contrasting with the predominantly white, snow-covered surroundings. Various roads or pathways seem to run around and between the different enclosures and some equipment or structures are visible, possibly related to the operation or maintenance of the facility. There is evidence of active work as seen by tracks in the snow and a vehicle of some kind in the lower central part of the image. The background is relatively flat and extends into the horizon with a sparse, wintery landscape, suggesting that this facility is located in a large, open area not heavily populated. The sky is overcast, further muting the colors of the scene.","title":"Aerial view of the Marco Island land development, on the southwestern coast of Florida.
