Both appear to be in mid-movement, truly enjoying themselves and the dance.\n\nBehind the central dancing couple, other participants are visible. They too are engaged in dancing and interacting with each other. The tent creates a lively and enclosed atmosphere, enhancing the communal joy of the scene. The image exudes a sense of motion and happiness, capturing a moment of celebration and social enjoyment. The backdrop, lit with natural light diffusing through the fabric of the tent, creates an inviting and warm setting for the gathering.","title":"Participants enjoying the \"hat dance\" at the fifth annual Oktoberfest at Helen. During the dance to polka music, couples attempt to place a hat on another dancer's head. The music stops periodically, and whichever couple is caught with one of its partners wearing the hat, they must leave the dance floor. The last couple on the floor wins a beer and knockwurst dinner for two. The celebration was begun in 1971 after the town's business district was Renovated with an alpine theme.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557789","558285","557787","558286","547334","557791","547403","553241","557792","547317","547371","558284","551019","547383","547386","547274"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["tent","dancing","happiness","dance","celebration","participant","joy","fabric","enjoyment","blouse"]}
