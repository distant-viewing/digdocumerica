{"path":"557654.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph presents a vibrant street scene, presumably shot in a town resembling elements of European architectural style. The focus is on a picturesque building with white-tan walls, adorned with decorative black metalwork, such as brackets and rails, and a contrasting dark green archway. The architecture incorporates faux-exposed wooden beams and a steep red, overhanging roof that displays a European coat of arms and the words \"House of Tyrol.\"\n\nAdding charm to the scene, the building features an extensive mural of a waterfall, labeled \"Anna Ruby Falls,\" capturing a naturalistic and serene scene on its wall. Nearby, a burst of color is introduced by overflowing flower boxes hung beneath windows, enhancing the already quaint and inviting atmosphere.\n\nActivity in the photograph centers on a group of four people, likely tourists or shoppers, walking towards an entrance marked \"Welcome Over 60\" suggesting a focused appeal to senior visitors. The people, all appearing engaged and moving purposefully, contribute a dynamic human element to the scene. They seem dressed in casual attire typical of the late 20th-century styles, with trousers and lightweight tops.\n\nThe overall composition and elements captured in this photograph suggest a tailored, tourist-friendly environment designed to evoke a quaint, European village atmosphere, inviting passersby to explore the shops and attractions it offers. The colors, architecture, and human activity all combine to create a lively and appealing street scene.","title":"Tourists pass the House of Tyrol on the main street of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Painting on the wall at the top left depicts Anna Ruby Falls, a favorite attraction outside of town. The town has experienced a surge of tourism and commercial growth by using a Bavarian Alpine theme in the business district. A state development plan cautions that a balance is needed between commercial development, public interest and cultural values to keep the village from becoming a tourist trap.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557656","557663","551790","557806","554458","550115","557804","557662","550107","549681","551786","543360","557803","557725","551116","551788"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["tourist","metalwork","mural","shopper","bracket","tan","passersby","burst","archway","village"]}
