{"path":"549305.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene with an industrial vibe. The primary foreground features a multitude of weathered wooden pilings protruding from the water, suggesting the remains of old docks or pier structures. These pilings vary in height and create a rugged, textured pattern on the water's surface. Beyond this, the mid-ground displays a more active maritime setup, showing a barge equipped with a large crane. This crane is erect and appears to be in operation. Adjacent to this barge is another smaller vessel.\n\nThe background of the scene depicts a panoramic view of a busy port or harbor. Numerous other cranes and industrial buildings are visible, stretching along the distant waterfront. The skyline is sparse, with few notable structures, emphasizing the expanse of the industrial area. The sky above is predominantly clear with some scattered clouds, suggesting a fair weather day. The overall composition is a blend of man-made industrial elements and natural water bodies, presenting a typical industrial port environment with a focus on shipping, construction, or maintenance activities.","title":"Rotting pier timbers in the Hudson River near the World Trade Center, in Westside Lower Manhattan.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547585","547019","547577","552015","547113","555796","546934","547572","551954","555807","550910","551980","552013","549300","551577","545147"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["piling","crane","barge","port","multitude","shipping","harbor","protrude","remain","pier"]}
