{"path":"551537.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil fishing scene featuring two individuals in a canoe on a calm river. The person in the front of the canoe, wearing a yellow tank top and a green trucker hat, is actively fishing, holding a bent fishing rod that suggests a catch on the line. The focus and effort are visible as this individual leans slightly forward, gripping the rod. Beside them is a paddle resting across the canoe, indicating a pause in rowing.\n\nThe second individual, seated in the rear of the canoe, appears younger and wears a bright orange shirt and a green baseball cap. This person is also engaged in fishing, handling a smaller fishing rod with both hands. There's a look of concentration or perhaps anticipation of catching a fish.\n\nThe canoe is olive green and floats near the lush riverbank, surrounded by rich greenery that dapples the scene with shadows and light, suggesting sunny weather. The peaceful environment encapsulates a typical fishing adventure, away from the busier pace of everyday life.\n\nThe background of the river is obscured by dense foliage, imbuing the scene with a sense of seclusion and intimacy with nature. Overall, the atmosphere is one of leisurely enjoyment and involvement in the activity at hand.","title":"Fishing near the city waterworks at mile 859 (u.s.
