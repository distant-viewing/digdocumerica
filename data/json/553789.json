{"path":"553789.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, prominent building illuminated by sunlight against a darker, clouded background, creating a striking contrast. The building, likely a skyscraper, has a unique architectural feature on top that resembles a saucer or a circular platform, which distinguishes its silhouette. Its numerous windows reflect the bright sunlight, giving the facade a glowing effect.\n\nIn the foreground, partially shadowed, is a busy marina filled with various boats and yachts, some with visible names. This foreground scene appears slightly darker, suggesting it could be under the shadow of another object or simply a result of the time of day and lighting conditions. The natural lighting indicates that the photo might have been taken during early morning or late afternoon, a typical time for such contrasting lighting.\n\nThe overall composition of the image focuses on the contrast between the man-made structures and the natural environment, emphasizing the interplay between light and shadow. The background is quite minimal, just the silhouette of hills or mountains and a cloudy sky, which helps in drawing attention primarily to the illuminated building and the maritime area in front.","title":"Ala Moana office building glows in the afternoon sun.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["552265","547147","556189","553788","553745","553679","553790","546203","549099","551455","552268","550007","550915","550754","552261","553678"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["yacht","silhouette","result","marina","time","sunlight","skyscraper","lighting","name","platform"]}
