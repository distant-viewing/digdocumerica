{"path":"546813.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast parking lot densely packed with a large number of cars displaying a colorful assortment of predominantly vintage models, suggesting an era around the 1970s or 1980s. The vehicles are primarily sedans and station wagons with a few hatchbacks interspersed. The color palette of the cars ranges widely with shades of yellow, red, brown, white, and blue, among others.\n\nThis bird's-eye view allows for an extensive overview of the lot, showcasing an orderly arrangement of cars parked in angled rows, maximizing space usage. Despite the large number of vehicles, there are no visible people, suggesting either an off-peak moment or a focus purely on vehicular storage. The background of the image is minimal, concentrating the viewerâ€™s attention on the multitude of cars and their systematic distribution across the parking surface. There are no distinct buildings, trees, or other notable features in the immediate vicinity visible in the photo, emphasizing the theme of automotive abundance.","title":"New cars ready for shipment out of dundalk marine terminal, a Maryland port authority facility","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546879","554349","553303","556721","547826","542635","546685","547480","553896","546900","548432","547686","547954","556722","556773","549696"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","parking","number","maximize","car","off","abundance","overview","distribution","multitude"]}
