{"path":"545072.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a tree with a network of dark branches highlighted by sunlight. The light casts a vivid contrast on the branches, emphasizing their intricate formations and the textures of the bark. Some parts of the branches are covered in green moss, which adds a touch of color against the dark, shadowed backdrop of additional foliage. The limbs of the tree stretch diagonally across the frame, creating a dynamic and almost abstract composition. The background is deeply shaded, primarily black, which enhances the visibility and dramatic effect of the highlighted branches. There are no people or man-made objects visible in the scene; it showcases natural elements and the interplay of light and shadow in a dense, wooded environment.","title":"Port Orford Beach","placename":"Port Orford (Or.)","location":"Port Orford, Oregon","nn1":["554954","547634","542958","543488","548687","548709","554740","550792","554998","554985","554961","554974","554994","554979","542932","548686"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["branch","limb","bark","moss","network","visibility","interplay","formation","touch","effect"]}
