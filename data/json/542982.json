{"path":"542982.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a water treatment facility. In the foreground, there is a large circular water basin filled with still water that reflects the objects and structures surrounding it, creating a mirror-like surface. A man is standing on a narrow walkway that circles around the basin. He is dressed in a button-up shirt and slacks, and appears to be observing the facility.\n\nIn the middle ground, mechanical structures, possibly part of the water treatment process, extend into the basin. These include a metal arm with paddles or rakes that likely function to move or process the water or sediment. The walkway where the man stands is equipped with metal railings, providing safety and demarcation from the edge of the water.\n\nIn the background, small buildings and other infrastructure related to the facility can be seen. These structures maintain an industrial aesthetic with straightforward, functional architecture.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes symmetry and reflection, with the water's surface acting as a central element that divides the scene horizontally. The calmness of the water contrasts with the industrial setting, and the presence of the man adds a human element to the otherwise mechanical and structured environment. The lighting in the photograph suggests that it might be taken during the day under clear skies, given the brightness and clarity of the image.","title":"Sewage treatment plant.
