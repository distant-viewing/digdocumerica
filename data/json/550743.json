{"path":"550743.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a large hydroelectric dam in operation. The dam is constructed with multiple concrete sluiceways, each releasing a heavy flow of water. The water cascades down the spillways, creating turbulent white foam as it crashes into the river below. The dam has a robust, industrial architecture, featuring a tall secondary building with brick facades and white decorative elements around the windows, which suggest its utility or control room functions.\n\nThe structure is equipped with various metal catwalks and railings, where several small figures, likely workers, can be seen walking or standing, likely involved in monitoring or managing the dam's operations. Overhead, a network of wires and poles adds to the sense of industrial activity and complexity.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features partly cloudy skies and what appears to be a lush, green forest in the background, indicating that the dam is situated in a relatively remote, natural setting. The overall scene illustrates a powerful interaction between human engineering and the natural environment, highlighting the scale and energy of the water being controlled and utilized.","title":"Gulf Island Dam on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550701","550654","543978","548024","548008","547215","548003","553372","548920","553654","548007","549004","548150","548938","548936","548016"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","spillway","operation","standing","foam","engineering","function","complexity","energy","wire"]}
