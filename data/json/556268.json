{"path":"556268.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a person in dark lighting. The person is wearing a large blue cap with a flat brim, which is tilted slightly upward on their head, exposing a white band that encircles the base of the cap. The cap's front seems to be adorned with some motif or button, though details are difficult to discern due in part to the shadows.\n\nThe focus of the image is predominantly on the person's facial features, highlighting part of their face, primarily the nose and lips which are well-defined under the dim lighting. The individual appears contemplative or serious, with their gaze directed downward out of the frame. The lighting casts deep shadows over their face, enhancing the contours and expression in a dramatic way.\n\nThe background is underexposed and indistinct, helping to direct the viewer's attention primarily to the subject. From what is visible, it suggests a dark, possibly nighttime setting which adds to the introspective and moody atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Black student welders work in a machine shop course taught at the Chicago Opportunities Industrialization Center in the heart of the Cabrini-Green housing project on Chicago's Near North Side. Other courses in auto repair, drafting, and clerical work also are offered. The state funds the Chicago program, which is a part of a national organization founded in 1964 to provide free job training and placement for men and women in poverty areas. A police record is necessary to qualify for the program.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553710","548218","554340","556516","552103","547028","556443","547282","557035","554048","547338","554915","553115","556147","548236","556318"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["cap","person","brim","lip","face","nose","nighttime","motif","portrait","band"]}
