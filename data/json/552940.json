{"path":"552940.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and nostalgic scene of a child at a pebbly lakeshore. The child appears to be a young, small-statured individual, dressed in a striped red-and-white t-shirt, dark shorts, and sturdy dark shoes. Wearing a light-colored cap, the child is squatting down to closely inspect or interact with the water.\n\nThe setting is a natural, pebble-lined beach leading into a body of water that shows the slight ripples of waves touching the shore. The background shows the water extending horizontally across with diffused colors and a blurred impression in the distance, possibly due to mist or spray. The lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, offering a soft, ambient glow that enhances the calm atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe focus is on the child whose actions seem explorative, symbolizing innocence and curiosity, characteristic of young children engaging with nature. The clarity of the child against the more muted background emphasizes the human element within the vastness of the natural landscape. This setting and activity together depict a peaceful moment of discovery and connection with the environment.","title":"(from the documerica-1 exhibition.
