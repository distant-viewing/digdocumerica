{"path":"554284.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This image captures a vivid winter scene focused on a bustling parking lot, framed against a dramatic backdrop of rugged, snow-covered mountains under a clear blue sky. The foreground is dominated by a variety of parked cars, covered in snow, suggesting recent snowfall. The vehicles range from sedans to station wagons, in an array of colors, including red, white, and blue, filling the parking area densely.\n\nIn the middle ground, several contemporary buildings with white exteriors and flat roofs are visible. These buildings might be residential units or commercial lodges, common in mountainous resort areas. The architecture is simple with clean lines, appearing modern against the more timeless natural setting in the distance.\n\nThe striking mountain range in the background is the most visually arresting element of the photograph. The mountains are steep and sharply defined with peaks that glisten under the sunlight, emphasizing their snow-capped surfaces. Pine trees dot the landscape around the buildings, giving a touch of green to the predominantly white and blue color scheme of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph contrasts human activity and infrastructural development with the serene, overpowering presence of the natural environment, suggesting a popular mountain resort area bustling with visitors.","title":"Condominiums at the base of the mountain in Vail village","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["557340","554214","554213","552607","543638","554249","554291","554236","543755","544901","554281","554279","555653","544936","554253","550408"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["resort","snow","mountain","parking","lodge","snowfall","bustle","range","glisten","wagon"]}
