{"path":"545831.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a mining operation in a large-scale outdoor environment. The image captures an aerial view showing several pieces of heavy machinery engaged in the extraction of materials from the earth. The focal point of the image is a large red crane equipped with a bucket, situated centrally and directly engaged in mining activities, likely extracting coal or a similar material given the dark hue of the exposed earth.\n\nAround this central crane, there are several large dump trucks visible, their bodies elevated to offload materials. These trucks are predominantly white and red, contrasting sharply against the dark, coal-covered ground. The trucks are of significant size, typical for industrial mining operations, designed to transport heavy loads.\n\nThe background shows a stark, carved landscape, indicating the extensive excavation that has occurred, creating walls of earth that mark the boundary of the current mining pit. The earth itself shows layers of sedimentation with darker layers at the bottom and lighter soil at the top, suggesting geological histories and the potential depth of the mining operation.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its high vantage point, emphasizes the scale and depth of the mining activities, highlighting human engineering's impact on natural landscapes. The machinery, vast open space, and the earth's sculpted terrain tell a story of industrial endeavor and environmental alteration. The overall scene is devoid of vegetation and somewhat stark, focusing solely on the mechanics and scope of the mining operation.","title":"Big brown coal mining operation","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["545883","545887","554828","549171","555606","544134","549245","552418","544099","554770","554826","552416","544107","553049","544100","554765"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","earth","operation","coal","truck","material","crane","sculpt","mechanic","scope"]}
