{"path":"544109.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene set against a rugged mountain backdrop under a dusky or possibly stormy sky. In the foreground, a large crane dominates the right half of the image, its silhouette outlined by a bright backlight, possibly from the sun or another intense light source. The crane is of significant size and is equipped with truss structures, indicative of heavy-duty operations, often seen in mining or large-scale construction sites.\n\nThe crane is actively engaged, as evidenced by the visible cable lines extending from its boom. Attached to these lines on the far right is a large bucket or container, apparently being moved or lowered. The halo of light and dust around the crane adds a dynamic and somewhat ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nThe rough terrain in the foreground is strewn with rocks and debris, typical of a mining or construction site. The background shows jagged mountain peaks, contributing to the sense of a harsh, remote environment. These mountains, partly shrouded in mist or low clouds, enhance the moody and possibly foreboding ambiance of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the imposing man-made structure of the crane against the natural ruggedness of the mountainous landscape, highlighted by the dramatic lighting conditions and the activities suggestive of industrial efforts in challenging geographic conditions.","title":"Strip mining on Indian burial grounds by Peabody Coal Co.","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["553027","544378","544127","545655","550874","554545","547223","545648","544157","547615","544131","550907","545641","545660","555269","545649"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["crane","mining","mountain","halo","backlight","site","construction","boom","ruggedness","half"]}
