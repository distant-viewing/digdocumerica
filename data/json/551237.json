{"path":"551237.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with several distinct elements apparent. Most prominently, two motorcycle officers are seen in motion along a curving road. Both officers are dressed in standard uniform that includes helmets, and are riding what appear to be black, well-equipped police motorcycles. In the scene, one motorcyclist leads and the other follows closely, both bending slightly with the curve of the road, indicating a moderate speed.\n\nIn addition to the motorcyclists, a solitary pedestrian is visible, located on the left side of the photograph, standing at the edge of the high riverside retaining wall. This person appears casual, leaning slightly forward over the barrier as if peering at something.\n\nVisible beyond the road and the ledge where the pedestrian stands, there is a river on the right half of the image. On this river, a small boat with four occupants is noticeable. The boat, seeming rather small and simple, is manned by these individuals who are seated in a row, enjoying the water.\n\nThe backdrop and immediate surroundings include classic street lamps and the architecture of the riverside walk, illustrating an urban setting possibly within a park or a similarly recreational zone. The entire photography exudes a tranquil riverside atmosphere juxtaposed with the dynamic activity of the motorcyclists. The lighting suggests it is either late morning or early afternoon, under clear sky conditions.","title":"Motorcycling--another way to get to the lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554354","548890","544844","551382","558232","544840","548690","546645","545134","548691","548301","556206","546634","554876","553955","548525"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["riverside","motorcycle","officer","pedestrian","road","pee","retain","occupant","addition","police"]}
