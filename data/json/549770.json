{"path":"549770.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, yellow dump truck inside a large industrial building, likely a warehouse or a garage. The truck's dump bed is lifted, indicating it is either offloading or demonstrating its mechanism. The vehicle appears slightly worn, with dirt and possible rust visible on its surface, emphasizing its use in a heavy-duty environment.\n\nThe environment is dimly lit, with natural light streaming through large windows high on the wall, creating an ambient, somewhat underexposed scene. The walls and roof of the building are constructed of aged wooden beams and metal sheets, characteristic of industrial constructions from mid-20th century.\n\nThe floor appears wet or oily, reflective of some areas, which suggests recent use or activity. There are no visible people in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the mechanical and architectural elements. The photograph captures a sense of stillness while hinting at the dynamic activities typically associated with such machinery.","title":"Truck at the 91st street marine transfer station empties garbage into barge for trip down the east river to the Staten Island landfill dumping site","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542538","557389","547922","550270","543896","547232","555817","557385","544061","557845","543173","555557","549948","544169","549202","544161"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["dump","streaming","truck","wall","sheet","mechanism","garage","demonstrate","duty","bed"]}
