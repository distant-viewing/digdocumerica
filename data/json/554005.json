{"path":"554005.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two crabs on a dark, rocky substrate, likely near or in a marine environment given the typical habitat of crabs. The crab on the left has a rich, vivid pattern with dark red and closely spaced white speckles covering its body and claws, suggesting it might be a type of decorated crab. Its overall form appears robust, with large pincers and a sturdy carapace. The crab on the right is drastically different in appearance, predominantly white or very pale, possibly indicating a molting phase or a natural color variation. This crab also shows large pincers and a substantial carapace but with less visible patterning compared to the left one.\n\nThe setting is dimly lit and focuses primarily on these two crabs, emphasizing their contrasting colors and textures against the dark background. The image captures a natural interaction or moment in the lives of these marine creatures, possibly on a rocky shore or a crevice where such crabs might forage or seek shelter. The composition centers the crabs in the frame, allowing detailed observation of their physical characteristics and the environmental context they are in.","title":"Crabs","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["552285","544509","543909","543912","545182","553913","546214","555365","545089","545175","544264","543264","545092","543751","555060","552284"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["crab","claw","seek","phase","creature","crevice","speckle","sturdy","shelter","observation"]}
