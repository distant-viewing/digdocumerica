{"path":"543596.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The image displays a close-up of vibrant yellow flowers, likely a group of blooming wildflowers. Each flower consists of thin, elongated petals radiating outward from a richly textured, central cluster of smaller florets and pollen-bearing parts. These core elements are prominent and might suggest the flowers are from the daisy or sunflower family, characterized by their composite flower heads.\n\nThe flowers, arranged in clusters, are attached to green stems with small green leaves, some of which are visible in the background. The foliage's coarse texture contrasts with the smooth and more delicate petals.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph is uniformly dark, enhancing the sharpness and vivid colors of the flowers, thus focusing all attention on them. This dark background highlights the flowers' bright yellow and golden hues, creating a striking visual effect. The lighting seems natural, possibly sunlight, enhancing the natural beauty and detailed structure of the flowers.\n\nOverall, the composition and selective focus on the flowers against a dark backdrop emphasize their natural beauty and draw the viewerâ€™s attention directly to the intricate details and colors of the blossoms.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["545699","547642","549230","544875","552503","545718","557167","548027","543197","544443","555186","545291","555189","550781","554574","544938"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","petal","core","cluster","daisy","sharpness","blossom","attention","close","wildflower"]}
