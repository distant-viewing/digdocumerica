{"path":"543140.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a serene and striking sunset scene captured from between two dark silhouetted rocky formations. These formations frame the shot and lead the viewerâ€™s eye towards a body of water in the center. The water reflects a gradient of colors from the sunset, ranging from deep blues at the top to vibrant oranges and yellows near the horizon. In the water, small rocks or islets are visible; they are also silhouetted against the mirrored surface of the water.\n\nThe horizon is clear, showcasing a gentle transition from the water to the sky, and the upper part of the sky displays a deepening blue as night approaches. The overall mood is peaceful and contemplative, emphasized by the natural symmetry and the quiet beauty of the twilight colors. The absence of any human activity or artificial elements in the scene underscores the tranquility and natural beauty of the setting.","title":"Sunset behind tufa \"towers\", porous rock formations created by the heavy saline content of Mono Lake","placename":"Lee Vining (Calif.)","location":"Lee Vining, California","nn1":["550646","552891","547731","554404","553989","552335","554759","543064","557497","544711","557447","550296","543062","545752","548909","552294"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","islet","formation","symmetry","water","approach","blue","night","horizon","absence"]}
