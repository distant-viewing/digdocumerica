{"path":"545718.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene featuring a cluster of yellow flowers thriving among rugged rocks. The flowers have eight thin petals each and bright yellow centers, accompanied by slender, spiky green leaves, providing a striking contrast to their environment. They appear to be growing out of a crevice amid large, dark red terracotta-colored rocks that have jagged, uneven surfaces.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, dyed in deep, reddish tones that might suggest either the rocky surfaces are wet or it is a shadowed area, giving the scene a rich, textured backdrop. The lighting highlights the flowers, making their yellow color pop against the darker, muted background colors.\n\nWith no human activity or man-made objects visible, the image communicates a sense of rugged natural beauty, focusing solely on the resilience and delicate appearance of the flowers in a harsh rock environment.","title":"Groundsel","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544894","544451","544443","543201","545723","544875","545727","543596","544938","545562","545722","545703","549228","555186","544890","547642"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","rock","pop","crevice","petal","resilience","surface","cluster","leave","appearance"]}
