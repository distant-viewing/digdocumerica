{"path":"548406.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image captures a striking aerial view of a large urban park surrounded by a densely populated city. The central feature of the park is a large, rectangular body of water, possibly a man-made reservoir, which reflects the sky and contributes to the overall natural aesthetic in the midst of urban development. Surrounding this water body are lush green areas with curvilinear patterns that signify landscapes designed for recreational use, such as walking paths or areas for leisure activities.\n\nBeyond the park's boundaries, the urban environment is densely packed with high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers that shape the city's iconic skyline. The architectural landscape features a multitude of varying designs and heights, providing a composite image of a vibrant, bustling metropolis. \n\nThe photograph captures the city on what appears to be a slightly overcast day, with the sky a muted tone that casts soft lighting over the entire scene. This ambient light accentuates the contrast between the natural green hues of the park and the darker, more varied colors of the urban buildings. The perspective from which the photo is taken offers a comprehensive view over the central part of the city, showcasing both its architectural achievements and its dedication to preserving green spaces amidst urban sprawl.","title":"Central park looking south toward lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548394","548395","553672","557271","551767","550165","548334","549480","550075","547707","547784","553469","557273","550052","557257","553328"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","park","metropolis","achievement","dedication","reservoir","multitude","preserve","midst","signify"]}
