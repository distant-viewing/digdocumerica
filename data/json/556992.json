{"path":"556992.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric outdoor scene set in a marshy or wetland area. The focus is on two individuals, who appear to be engaged in an activity, possibly duck hunting or nature watching, as they stand amongst tall, wild grasses and reeds. The pair are positioned midway through the image, slightly offset to the left, and are dressed in outdoor attire that blends with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe setting is rich with natural textures and tones. The grass is tall and has a golden hue, suggesting it might be late summer or early fall. There's a strip of water running through the grass, reflecting the light and adding a dynamic contrast to the dense vegetation.\n\nThe background features sparse trees and a slightly overcast sky, giving the impression of a remote, tranquil location. The composition benefits from the interplay of light and shadow, particularly the way light filters through the trees on the right, creating patterns on the water and ground.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a serene, almost secluded atmosphere, possibly early in the morning or late in the afternoon, based on the quality of the light and the long shadows.","title":"Woman and her two young sons pick wild watercress and watch a fall run of salmon spawn in Clear Creek, a stream which runs through the north end of Silverdale. This area is projected to receive the greatest concentration of secondary impact from the Navy's Trident submarine base. Plans are proposed to build a \"new city\" nearby to house a substantial portion of the estimated 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is complete.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550788","547547","546340","550345","547500","547604","547589","546293","553856","547544","550389","545069","549012","545991","546300","551942"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["grass","duck","hunting","filter","reed","strip","pair","wetland","fall","way"]}
