{"path":"546938.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a robust, functional scene centered on a tugboat and a barge on water, presumably a river or industrial port area. The tugboat, appearing prominently in the foreground, has a classic design with a white superstructure and a black hull. It is operating, evident by water agitation at its stern and a visible wake. The tugboat is towing a barge, which is loaded with what appears to be crushed stone or aggregate material, indicating its role in industrial transportation.\n\nThe background presents a less defined but busy industrial landscape with various structures that suggest a refinery or a factory setting. You can see multiple storage tanks, silos, and utilitarian buildings. The presence of vehicles and more equipment suggests ongoing industrial operations.\n\nThe photograph is shot on a bright, clear day, enhancing visibility and casting natural light that reflects off the water, adding a sparkle to the textured surface of the river. The composition of the photo, with water in the foreground leading to the industrial backdrop, conveys a dynamic sense of movement and work in progress at this industrial waterway.","title":"Tugboat pushes a barge in Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550901","550951","550893","549783","550892","546830","557235","551008","546836","550894","548187","548067","546845","551179","557309","550900"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","barge","refinery","superstructure","tow","crush","sparkle","shoot","progress","wake"]}
