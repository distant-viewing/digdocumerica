{"path":"546785.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted urban riverbank filled with debris and discarded objects. In the foreground, a diverse array of garbage and waste materials can be seen strewn about, including tires, rusted metal scraps, wooden planks, fragments of building materials, wires, and miscellaneous household objects. The waste extends from the foreground into the midground, implying a significant accumulation over time.\n\nIn the background, the city's skyline is visible across the river, which provides a stark contrast between the neglected state of the waterfront and the developed urban environment. Cranes and other industrial structures are located along the opposite riverbank, suggesting ongoing commercial or construction activities. The overall mood conveyed by the image is somewhat somber and reflective, calling attention to environmental neglect in urban areas. The lighting is subdued, possibly indicating either dawn or dusk, which contributes to the dramatic and impactful visual setting. The river itself appears calm, reflecting some of the city lights and colors from the sky, adding a slight gloss over the polluted waterside.","title":"Junkyard at edge of harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548357","547907","546913","550352","550946","550204","547897","550947","551531","551559","546854","547893","549817","546886","544810","552080"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["riverbank","waste","neglect","call","household","city","object","scrap","fragment","material"]}
