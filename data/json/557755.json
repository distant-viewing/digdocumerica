{"path":"557755.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, family-oriented outdoor scene, likely taken in a suburban or rural setting. In the foreground, there is a small man-made pond bordered by naturally arranged rocks and lined with various aquatic plants. The water appears clear and reflects the surrounding greenery and sky.\n\nThere are three individuals in the image, all engaging differently with the environment. At the center of the scene, a young child, possibly a girl, stands knee-deep in the pond actively playing with the water. Another child, a boy, is seen from the back sitting on the rocks at the pond's edge, seemingly watching or just enjoying the water. To the right, slightly set back near the lush greenery, an adult woman sits on a rock, observing the children play. She is casually dressed, suited for a warm day outdoors.\n\nThe background features a large, traditional two-story house with white siding and characteristic features such as a covered porch with columns, and double-hung windows. The yard surrounding the house and pond is well-landscaped with mature trees providing ample shade which casts patterned shadows across the scene. There's an overall atmosphere of peaceful residential life, possibly on a warm summer day given the lushness of the vegetation and the activities underway.","title":"GRandchildren of joseph kimsey play in the swimming pool in front of his home while their mother supervises.
