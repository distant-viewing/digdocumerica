{"path":"550679.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an outdoor scene depicting a group of elderly individuals and a variety of objects in a seemingly informal, cluttered setting. In the foreground, a woman in a cream coat and glasses is smiling and touching her face with an expression that suggests pleasant surprise or contemplation. Behind her, two women in matching yellow and black sports jackets appear engaged in conversation.\n\nIn the background to the right, two men and one woman are observed; the woman wears a light-colored coat and stands with her hands clasped in front of her. One man is dressed in a blue suit and glasses, standing upright, while the other man sits relaxed in a chair, dressed casually in a red cap and a grey sweater. He has a calm, somewhat disinterested expression.\n\nThe setting includes a red wooden siding of a building, a portion of brick wall, and various items scattered around that contribute to a cluttered look, such as a box with the Pepsi logo, some pots, and what appear to be discarded items or possibly items for sale. The arrangement of people and objects gives the photograph a casual, spontaneous feel, capturing a moment of everyday life, possibly during a community gathering or a garage sale. The overall mood is relaxed and domestic, highlighting a slice of life among an older generation in a rural or suburban setting.","title":"Pause for reflection--auction at milan, on the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["548625","557177","553202","552613","548647","546855","557175","557176","551808","557713","548588","557031","546209","557163","556532","557152"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sale","woman","item","coat","clasp","generation","glass","pot","object","garage"]}
