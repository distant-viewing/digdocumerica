{"path":"550597.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph showcases a stunning aerial view of a rugged landscape dominated by a braided river system. The river stretches across the composition with multiple channels of water cutting through the scene, creating intricate patterns on the earth's surface. The water appears silvery or white, contrasting dramatically against the dark, sediment-rich soil. \n\nThe terrain is mountainous with steep, dark-colored hills that rise sharply next to the riverbed. The surrounding area is sparsely vegetated, indicating a possibly harsh environment, with some green areas suggesting shrubbery or small trees dotting the landscape. In the background, there is a significant body of water—likely a lake—nestled among the hills, reflecting light and surrounded by more gentle terrain compared to the foreground.\n\nThe topography is a mix of dark hills with lighter tones on their ridges, and flatter areas surrounding the central water body. No human activity, structures, or animals are evident in the image, focusing purely on the natural elements. The sky is overcast, casting muted lighting across the scene, which enhances the moody, wild aspect of this remote natural area. The perspective from above provides a comprehensive view of the geological and hydrological features of this serene yet stark wilderness.","title":"View west down Phelan Creek, a major tributary of the Delta River, toward Fielding Lake.
