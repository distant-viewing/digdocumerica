{"path":"552312.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image captures a serene and picturesque scene centered around tall grass silhouettes set against an orange and gold sunset sky. The primary focus is on the long, slender blades of grass, which are highlighted from behind by the soft glow of the setting sun. These grass blades, varying in thickness and height, crisscross and overlap chaotically, creating intricate patterns.\n\nThe sky behind the grass features a gradient of warm colors ranging from deep golden hues to richer orange tones, suggesting that the sun is just below the horizon. The colors in the sky suggest it could either be early morning or late evening, typically the times when sunsets and sunrises occur. The clouds scattered in the background add texture to the scene, being softly illuminated by the sun's radiance.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and reflective, emphasizing the beauty of natural elements through minimalism and color contrast. The simplicity of the composition—focusing on nature and the interplay of light and shadows—invokes a sense of calm and appreciation for quiet moments. The alignment and the silhouette technique highlight the gracefulness of the wild grass against the dramatic backdrop of the skies, encouraging a deep connection with the natural world.","title":"Beach grasses, at sunrise, on ediz hook in the strait of juan de fuca","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557559","545069","549847","545495","557104","546154","550389","552485","545209","551370","557191","547719","557182","552504","550489","554731"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","blade","sun","sunset","thickness","encourage","alignment","appreciation","overlap","silhouette"]}
