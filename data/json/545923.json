{"path":"545923.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor natural scene focusing predominantly on a water body that exhibits patterns of partially melted ice or foam. The water's surface varying in appearance: some areas are dark, suggesting deeper or clearer water, while others are covered in white, patchy formations that seem to be either foam or thinning ice, indicating either a seasonal change or movement in the water influenced by external factors.\n\nThe foreground shows a close view of these textures in detail, highlighting the contrast between the darker aquatic areas and the brighter white patches. In the background, a line of vegetation is visible, appearing as a dense, dark silhouette against a light sky. The plants look like tall grasses or reeds, typical of wetland or lakeside environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image suggests a tranquil, natural setting possibly capturing an ecological or hydrological phenomenon, emphasizing the interplay of natural elements and textures. The lighting in the photograph appears natural, potentially from a sun low in the sky, casting an even, soft light across the scene. The mood conveyed is quiet and perhaps isolated, focusing the viewer's attention on the natural patterns and elements within the landscape.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["542526","550341","544765","550750","550389","551352","546896","554623","545008","550686","546963","543611","547905","552237","554608","554717"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["ice","foam","factor","melte","phenomenon","brighter","reed","low","lakeside","pattern"]}
