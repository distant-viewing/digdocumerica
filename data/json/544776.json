{"path":"544776.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of urban demolition. In the foreground, a large building is being actively dismantled by heavy machinery. The building appears old and elaborate, with distinctive architectural features, such as columns and ornate facades, now partially destroyed. Water is being sprayed onto the debris by a firefighter using a high-powered hose, creating a strong, diagonal jet of water across the scene.\n\nThe firefighter, wearing a helmet and uniform, is standing in the street, facing towards the debris, as he manages the hose. Behind him and to the side is a street with visible traffic signs and a few cars in the distance.\n\nOn the ground, scattered remains of the building and other rubble line the barricaded area around the demolition site. Several shops are partially visible beneath the debris, one with a sign reading \"A.J. Cutlers\" which suggests it was a jeweler or related to watches and jewelry.\n\nIn the background, contrasting with the demolition, stands a modern hotel or apartment building, stark with its clean, unscathed facade, and a large hotel logo or company emblem at the top.\n\nThe scene is bathed in natural light, indicating it is daytime, and the overall atmosphere is one of controlled destruction, with efforts being made to manage dust and debris. This juxtaposition of destruction and intact modern buildings captures a moment of transition in an urban landscape.","title":"Demolishing a building","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["551783","549914","548057","553477","550260","548093","553476","549309","557351","555805","553352","549913","551086","557350","551089","555540"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["demolition","hotel","hose","destruction","debris","facade","jewelry","building","remain","watch"]}
