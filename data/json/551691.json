{"path":"551691.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph features a lively street scene possibly at a community market or festival. The setting appears to be in an urban area with classic architecture, including ornate metal gates and building facades that show a mix of opened and shuttered windows.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several long tables covered with various items for sale, which resemble a flea market or a craft fair. The tables are laden with an array of goods including vases, dishes, figurines, books, and potentially handmade crafts. Between the colorful items on display, green plants can also be spotted, adding a touch of nature to the setup.\n\nA vibrant crowd of people of various ages, predominantly adults, populates the scene. They are dressed in a style that suggests the photograph may have been taken in the 1970s or 1980s, based on their hairstyles and clothing. Some wear pants and bright-colored tops, while others are in dresses or skirts. Their attention is mostly directed towards the items on the tables, and they appear engaged in browsing, inspecting objects, or conversing with each other. A few individuals seem to be handling the sales, indicated by their positioning behind the tables and interactions with the customers.\n\nColorful balloons and decorative pennants are visible, suspended above the crowd adding a festive flair to the scene. The overall atmosphere is bustling and social, capturing a moment of community engagement and local commerce.","title":"Sidewalks of East 35th Street blossomed with tempting displays at this June block party.
