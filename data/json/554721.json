{"path":"554721.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape under a clear blue sky. The foreground features a vast, gently sloping field with dry, golden-brown grass. A lone, traditional white house with a sloping roof is visible in the middle distance, its simplicity contrasting sharply with the natural surroundings. This house appears quaint and isolated, rooted in a setting that blends natural and human-made elements seamlessly.\n\nBehind the house, the scene is dominated by a large mountain covered in dense foliage that displays a variety of autumnal colors, from deep greens to vibrant reds and oranges, suggesting this image was taken in the fall season. This mountain rises prominently against the skyline, drawing the viewer's eye as a central element in the composition.\n\nTo the right, portions of dark green pine branches frame the image, subtly enclosing the landscape and adding depth to the composition. These branches also help to emphasize the feeling of looking into a vast, open space.\n\nOverall, the mood of the photograph is peaceful and reflective, with a strong emphasis on the beauty of natural scenery during the change of seasons. The image communicates a sense of tranquility and the timeless charm of rural life.","title":"Typical farm field in the Adirondack Forest Preserve where soils permit tilling","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554633","554401","554562","543763","557674","554722","555537","557023","554767","547288","554801","556962","544857","550311","555603","555567"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["season","branch","house","mountain","emphasis","fall","charm","change","simplicity","scenery"]}
