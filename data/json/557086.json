{"path":"557086.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a courtroom scene. In the center stands an elderly man in professional attire, consisting of a dark suit, white shirt, and a patterned tie. He is holding what appears to be papers in one hand, and is positioned slightly off-center towards the right side of the frame. The man stands in front of a large wooden bench, which has a rich, dark finish and detailing typical of courtroom furniture. This bench features a high backrest and red leather cushioning.\n\nTo the left, an American flag stands prominently next to the bench. Positioned around the room are various elements typical of a court setting, including a wooden gavel on the bench, pitchers and a glass on the desk, and a small desk flag. The background walls are painted in a muted maroon color and adorned with framed portraits of what look like former judges or important figures in black and white, enhancing the formal and historical ambiance of the setting.\n\nNotably, on the right wall hangs a calendar or chart, adding a functional element to the room. The overall lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the solemnity of the courtroom environment.","title":"An official in the Atchison County courthouse in Atchison, Kansas, stands in the building's courtroom.
