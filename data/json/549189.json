{"path":"549189.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting where a large power plant features prominently. The image shows four towering smokestacks emitting dark and heavy smoke, contrasting sharply with the lighter sky in the background. These stacks are painted in alternating bands of red and white, which make them stand out against the complex framework of gray metallic structures surrounding them. This includes various tanks, pipes, and other industrial machinery, characteristic of such facilities.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a natural scene with a body of water, likely a river, flowing from the left to the right side of the frame. The banks of the river have some green vegetation, which adds a bit of natural color to an otherwise technologically dominated scene. There are no visible people or animals in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, with clear, possibly crisp weather conditions.","title":"This 750-megawatt power plant, located on the North Platte River, is part of the massive strip-mining development planned for the Powder River region.","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549215","557306","548195","557302","550672","546808","557384","544495","550329","546141","552179","551026","547084","549190","543993","551156"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["band","river","stack","pipe","framework","bit","smokestack","animal","bank","power"]}
