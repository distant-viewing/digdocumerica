{"path":"558226.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts an office environment from what appears to be the late 20th century, judging by the style of office equipment and fashion. The setting is a large room filled with rows of desks, each equipped with a variety of old-fashioned office machines, including typewriters and early models of desktop calculators and computers.\n\nThe desks are sizable, made of dark wood, and of a robust, straightforward design typical of mid-to-late 20th century office furniture. Each desk hosts an array of papers, suggesting active use and a busy work environment. The office machinery variously includes typewriters (both manual and electric), heavy-duty calculators, and what appear to be early personal computers or word processors, indicating a period when digital technology was beginning to enter mainstream office use.\n\nThere are three people visible in the scene, all of whom appear to be female and are engaged in different work-related activities. One is seated at her desk in the foreground, organizing or reviewing documents, another is similarly engaged in the background, and a third is walking through the office, perhaps moving from one task to another.\n\nThe roomâ€™s walls are decorated with a geometric, trellis-like patterned wallpaper, and the floor is covered in a simple, lightly colored carpet. Natural light seems to be coming from windows on the left, softly illuminating the workspace.\n\nOverall, the ambiance conveys a typical busy office environment of the period, focused on paperwork and the emerging era of digital technology, capturing a transitional phase in office work dynamics.","title":"Business sequence classroom at senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have located here since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized during the 1960's with community effort.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556758","556014","548864","556668","545083","551902","556072","551897","548237","556754","555233","557682","546479","551901","558222","552377"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["office","desk","technology","room","period","paperwork","work","review","phase","century"]}
