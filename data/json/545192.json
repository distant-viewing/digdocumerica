{"path":"545192.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a grassy outdoor setting, likely in a rural or suburban area. In the foreground, a large, fresh fish, possibly a salmon, is laid out on the open trunk of a car, covered with a spread of newspapers to keep the area clean. A woman, dressed in a sleeveless white blouse with vertical stripes, is actively measuring the fish with a wooden ruler, focusing intently on her task.\n\nStanding beside the car and watching the woman is a man in a plaid shirt and dark pants. He appears to be in his middle ages and has a slightly inquisitive or perhaps admiring expression as he observes the measurement process.\n\nThe background shows characteristics typical of a tranquil, residential setting: a neatly trimmed lawn and a traditional house with a visible shingle siding and a bush subtly enrich the quiet, homely atmosphere of the scene. The overall composition captures a moment of everyday life, possibly following a successful fishing trip, highlighting a shared activity possibly between family members or friends.","title":"Fresh salmon is measured before being sold.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553095","554523","543219","551405","552323","552329","544995","545284","553081","550320","552315","545178","542731","545180","546361","554200"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","salmon","measurement","shingle","spread","friend","characteristic","newspaper","trip","member"]}
