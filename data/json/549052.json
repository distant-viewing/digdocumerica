{"path":"549052.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a man's hand holding a scientific instrument, specifically a water current meter, close to the camera lens, against the backdrop of a stretch of water and distant shoreline. The meter is made up of a black plastic casing featuring knobs and dials, and a clear, dome-shaped top possibly covering sensory equipment. The visibility of the instrument is quite focal, suggesting it is the main subject of the image.\n\nIn the background is a large body of calm water that covers the majority of the middle ground. The water is predominantly a deep blue shade, reflecting the clear sky overhead. The horizon is lined by land which features sporadic green vegetation and several structures that might be residential or small industrial facilities, hinting that this body of water might be near a civilized area. The environment seems calm with no obvious signs of significant human or animal activity, both on the water and the shore.\n\nThe setting indicates the photograph may have been taken during an environmental study or monitoring activity, given the inclusion of the specialized equipment. The focus on the meter and the serene natural backdrop combine to highlight both the importance of the activity being undertaken and the peaceful outdoor environment in which it is set.","title":"T.d.s.
