{"path":"554973.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a moody and mysterious forest scene. The central element is a large, old tree trunk with a significant burl or growth that adds texture and interest. The tree trunk, appearing somewhat weathered and dead, stands out due to its light gray color against the darker background. The burl itself is large and knotty, giving the tree a unique, almost animate character.\n\nSurrounding trees are dark and twisted, adding to the eerie atmosphere. There are skeletal branches interspersed between the trees, contributing to the sense of desolation and age. The understory is relatively sparse but includes some small bushes and leafy plants, which introduce a bit of greenery into the otherwise dim, monotone forest palette.\n\nThe overall ambiance is somber and possibly foreboding, emphasizing themes of natural decay and the wild, unchecked aspects of a mature forest. The dim lighting suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, enhancing the mysterious quality of the scene.","title":"Old growth Sitka spruce snags and burls on the Pacific coast area of the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557622","555002","554976","542749","553574","550792","558103","555081","554961","554967","555112","557601","542791","553577","542932","542570"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","trunk","tree","desolation","character","bit","growth","dawn","interest","aspect"]}
