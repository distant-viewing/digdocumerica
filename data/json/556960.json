{"path":"556960.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a rural landscape at twilight or early evening, featuring a serene ambiance accentuated by the soft, dim lighting. The scene is composed with a slightly angled asphalt road stretching diagonally from the bottom right corner into the distance, lined by utility poles and wires that follow its curvature. Alongside the road, the earthy shoulder tapers into a dirt path or secondary road leading toward farm structures.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a lush bush or small tree blooming with white flowers, casting shadows and creating a gentle contrast against the sunlit spots filtering through its leaves. This vegetation partially obscures a view of an expansive field in the middle ground, which appears to be cultivated but idle at this time, framed by low bushes and grasses turning autumnal hues.\n\nThe middle distance presents a cluster of rural farm buildings, including barns and houses, characterized by their white and red colors that stand out against the greenery. These buildings suggest a farming or agricultural community. The background offers a glimpse of forested hills under a subdued sky, hinting at the setting within a valley or a similarly sheltered environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph emits a tranquil, bucolic feel, inviting contemplation of rural life and natureâ€™s quiet moments. The composition uses the road and utility lines to draw the viewer's eye through the scene, encompassing the natural beauty and cultivated lands typical of a rural setting.","title":"Intersection of Luoto Road and Vincent Road near land occupied by naval installations.
