{"path":"554682.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of outdoor camping featuring two men engaged in activities at a campsite. The background showcases a natural setting with tall pine trees and a clear sky, suggesting a peaceful, remote location.\n\nOne of the men, who is wearing a hat and a red plaid shirt, is seated on a wooden bench and is actively cutting something with a knife, likely preparing food. The other man, dressed in a dark green plaid shirt, is bent over slightly, appearing to be tending to some equipment or objects near the entrance of a green tent.\n\nOn a rustic wooden picnic table in the foreground, there are various camping essentials visible. These include a green metal storage box, a portable gas stove, a large red fuel container, a lantern, and other small items such as a coffee pot and a cooking pot placed on the stove. There also appears to be a rifle leaning against the table.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of outdoorsmanship and self-sufficiency, typical of a rustic camping experience. The equipment and attire suggest this image might be from several decades ago, given the vintage style of the gear and the filmâ€™s color saturation and graininess.","title":"Tents and camping gear are used by big game hunters in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at moose river plains.
