{"path":"549126.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely in a mining environment. In the image, a large yellow dragline excavator labeled \"PEABODY COAL CO.\" is positioned on the right-hand side on a mound of dirt and rock. This excavator has a significant metal arm extended from which a large bucket is suspended. The bucket is in motion, spewing out a stream of dust or particles, which suggests it is either dropping off or picking up material.\n\nThe background features a barren landscape typical of an excavation site, with exposed earth and small vegetation on the fringes. The dull, overcast sky contributes to the somber and industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThis setting is likely part of a coal mining operation, given the companyâ€™s name on the excavator and the nature of the activity being performed. The overall atmosphere is one of heavy industry with a focus on the extraction and movement of earth or minerals.","title":"Peabody Coal Company strip mine, south of Colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554826","552416","549124","555644","552417","554831","555606","552418","554772","554812","544134","544099","543639","544138","544386","544135"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavator","bucket","mining","fringe","earth","particle","extraction","coal","company","mineral"]}
