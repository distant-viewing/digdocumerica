{"path":"542570.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a large fallen tree in a forest setting. The tree, with its substantial girth and length, appears aged and weathered, lying horizontally across the frame. Its roots and base are prominently displayed on the left side, where the tree has snapped, revealing a dramatic tangle of splintered wood and jagged edges. The roots are partially torn from the ground, creating a chaotic and textured mass that contrasts with the smoother surface of the trunk extending to the right.\n\nThe tree's bark is rough and partially stripped, exposing the lighter wood beneath, and a yawning hollow, likely formed by decay or the activities of forest creatures, is visible near the base. Along the length of the tree, the bark is missing in several areas, suggesting either natural decay or environmental effects over time.\n\nThe surrounding area is strewn with smaller bits of debris from the tree itself, including bark and broken branches, as well as pine needles and forest detritus. The background is densely filled with other pine trees, standing upright and largely obscured by a soft focus, emphasizing the fallen tree in the foreground. The lighting suggests an overcast day, casting a muted, soft glow across the scene, highlighting textures and enhancing the natural colors of the forest. The overall ambiance is serene yet somber, reflecting a natural occurrence within a seemingly tranquil forest environment.","title":"California--Sequoia National Park","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["542749","552551","555204","555151","555205","545966","557622","555152","558103","553577","554967","554973","557008","554997","543198","552453"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","forest","root","tree","length","decay","fall","detritus","wood","tangle"]}
