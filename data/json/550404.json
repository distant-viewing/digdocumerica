{"path":"550404.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph appears to be an aerial or satellite image of a geographical area, featuring a complex mixture of land, water, and ice. The landscape is predominantly dark in tone, suggesting it might be taken either during low light conditions or the region has a naturally dark terrain, possibly volcanic.\n\nCentral to the image are winding, river-like structures that look like they are either frozen with ice or are reflective surfaces, catching light and shining brightly against the darker surroundings. These reflective surfaces form intricate branching patterns similar to veins or a river delta, splitting and winding through the terrain.\n\nThe landscape is uneven and rugged; there are distinct patches where the texture seems rough, possibly indicating rocky or uneven terrain. Areas of lighter brown and gray suggest different soil or rock types, or possibly vegetation, though the details arenâ€™t clear enough to specify the exact nature of these patches.\n\nIn the upper left and right corners, there are bodies of water that appear to be partially frozen, with ice patches floating on the surface. The image captures the contrast between the permanently frozen areas and the transient ice in the water bodies, underlining the dynamic nature of this environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its stark contrasts and the sinuous forms of the shining paths through the terrain, gives it a mysterious and somewhat surreal quality. It emphasizes natural patterns and possibly the isolation and raw beauty of a cold, remote landscape.","title":"Patterned ground, a result of massive ice formations, and a small stream draining northward from Galbraith Lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552907","550418","552426","550410","550403","550402","550588","544721","549630","555553","550592","550498","550519","550816","550597","550637"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["ice","freeze","shine","terrain","specify","wind","patch","vein","surface","underline"]}
