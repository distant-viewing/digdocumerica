{"path":"548118.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene featuring a sailboat on a body of water during what appears to be sunset or sunrise. The mood is tranquil due to the soft lighting and the gentle movement of the water.\n\nIn the foreground, the dark, choppy waters of the lake or sea dominate the lower frame, reflecting some dim light and creating a textured surface. At the center of the image, a sailboat is making its way through the water. The boat is modest in size and is equipped with a sail that is fully deployed, showcasing a striking combination of yellow, red, white, and a hint of purple. The sail is vibrant against the mostly subdued tones of the environment.\n\nIn the background, a densely wooded area, likely a forest or a large park, lines the horizon. The trees are dark and silhouetted, yet show different layers and shades of darkness due to the play of natural light. Above the trees, the sky presents a gradient of colors, ranging from a deep blue at the top to shades of purple and hints of residual sunlight near the horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph emphasizes a peaceful outing on the water at a tranquil time of day, with the natural beauty of the water and wooded shoreline framed by a colorful sky.","title":"Twilight on the Columbia River near Vancouver","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552039","543613","552345","552038","544669","553991","553990","552293","550758","551539","547273","548117","552344","547754","544663","545900"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","purple","water","hint","outing","sunrise","darkness","horizon","shade"]}
