{"path":"555569.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This landscape photograph offers a view that captures the essence of a rural, possibly pastoral scene transitioning into an area affected by mining or industrial activity. The foreground of the image features a lush, green thicket with a variety of flora including leafy trees and possibly wildflowers adding specks of white and yellow to the verdant undergrowth. This slice of vibrant plant life provides a natural frame for the rest of the scene.\n\nMiddle-ground presents less dense vegetation, giving way to more open, undeveloped land. As we move towards the background, the scene dramatically changes to reveal undulating hills that are distinctly marked by human activity. These hills show altered topography that might suggest strip mining or large-scale excavation, evident from the patches of bare soil and exposed layers of earth in contrast shades of brown and grey. This interruption in the natural landscape is a stark testament to the impact of industrial activities.\n\nThe expansive blue sky, dotted with a few light clouds, arches over the entire scene and enhances the dichotomy between the untouched and modified landscapes. The lighting suggests this photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day, which brightens the natural colors and emphasizes the altered terrain in the distance. \n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph—transitioning from dense, natural greenery to profoundly altered land— possibly aims to draw attention to the impacts of environmental changes or industrial activities on natural landscapes.","title":"Natural vegetation of the area contrasts land which has been strip mined by coal companies off route #40","placename":"Saint Clairsville (Ohio)","location":"Saint Clairsville, Ohio","nn1":["554815","549255","555588","554804","554817","554811","555812","552994","554807","555590","545529","554816","545042","548194","555629","550573"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["change","mining","alter","interruption","testament","thicket","modify","brighten","alte","verdant"]}
