{"path":"552234.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph portrays an aerial view of a picturesque landscape where a body of water dominates the scene. In the water, several sailboats are dispersed, their white sails stark against the dark blue of the water, indicating a leisure or sporting activity. The extensive body of water appears calm, reflecting light off its surface.\n\nOn the left side of the image, connected to the mainland by a narrow bridge, lies a small peninsula or island. The island features a cluster of buildings, with distinctly visible roads lined with greenery, indicating a well-developed residential or commercial area.\n\nTo the top right corner of the photograph, the landscape transitions into a more urban environment with more densely packed buildings, including a tall structure that stands out prominently against the skyline. This part of the image shows a more residential or city environment running parallel to the shoreline.\n\nThe image captures the interface between human habitation and natural water bodies, showcasing both leisure activities and urban development. The overall feel of the photograph is serene, highlighting a balance between human activity and natural scenery.","title":"Sailboats on lake Washington along Seattle's eastern shore","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["543059","552355","550754","556966","556190","547781","556905","543305","557462","544697","544021","548638","548555","542908","557416","552269"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","sporting","leisure","interface","peninsula","water","disperse","body","sailboat","sail"]}
