{"path":"556673.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an early evening scene at a train station. Several passengers, including both men and women dressed in formal and casual attire, are waiting on the platform. The time setting seems like dusk, given the low light and the fact that the station lights are on. Some of the people are standing and chatting, while others appear to be checking the time or looking in the distance, probably watching for the approaching train, which is visible in the background with its headlights brightly shining.\n\nThe platform is outdoors, and there is a simple shelter structure above part of it where some passengers are standing. The shelter has a wooden construction with a flat roof. The tracks are prominently visible in the foreground, running parallel to the platform. Overhead, there are electrical lines for the trains, typical of a railway electrification system.\n\nThe lighting creates a slightly moody ambiance, with the natural dimming light of day coupled with artificial station lights, giving the image a somewhat cinematic feel. The approaching train adds a dynamic element to the photograph, attracting the attention of both the passengers on the platform and the viewer of the image.","title":"Passengers waiting for an Amtrak Metroliner train that will take them from a Washington, District of Columbia, suburb to New York City","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556051","555959","556670","556768","556074","555967","556855","556041","556660","556667","556778","556100","556767","555985","556827","556026"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","platform","passenger","station","shelter","light","headlight","time","railway","system"]}
