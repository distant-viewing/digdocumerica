{"path":"554759.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene sunset scene over a body of water, likely a lake. The sky is filled with dramatic clouds catching the warm colors of the sunset, ranging from deep orange to pale yellow, casting an overall orange hue over the scene. In the background, the silhouettes of mountain ranges add layers and depth to the composition, creating a tranquil and picturesque landscape.\n\nThe lake is relatively calm, with subtle ripples on the water surface reflecting the sky's vibrant colors, enhancing the overall tranquility of the scene. On the right side of the image, there's a silhouette of a tree, contributing to the natural ambiance and framing the image nicely.\n\nIn the lower right corner, near the shoreline, the silhouetted figures of several people can be seen. They seem to be standing by the waterâ€™s edge, perhaps enjoying the beauty of the sunset. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on nature and minimal human presence, suggests a peaceful, reflective moment captured at the end of the day. The varying intensities of light and shadow play a significant role in the mood and depth of the image.","title":"Sunset over Fourth Lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554404","557447","550299","543608","550646","552294","552335","557497","552277","550303","552319","554760","554397","544711","552263","545149"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["sunset","silhouette","lake","intensity","depth","role","end","ripple","orange","corner"]}
