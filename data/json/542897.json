{"path":"542897.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage railway scene predominantly featuring train components and infrastructure. In the foreground, a line of old railroad wheels is neatly arranged, their surfaces showing varying degrees of wear and rust. Each wheel-set comprises a pair of wheels attached to a central axle, suggesting they might be waiting either for restoration or disposal.\n\nInterspersed behind these wheelsets is a tall wooden fence, its vertical slats weathered and aged, some showing signs of paint wear. The fence might serve as a boundary within a train depot or as a safety barrier.\n\nBeyond the fence, part of a passenger train carriage is visible. The carriage is distinctively aged with a weathered pink and burgundy color scheme and features windows from where yellow and red interiors can be glimpsed, hinting at a vintage or possibly decommissioned train possibly from an earlier era of rail travel.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the contrast of the mechanical, rusted wheels in the foreground against the colorful yet dilapidated background, narrates a story of railway history and preservation. The lighting is bright and clear, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day, highlighting the textures and colors of the objects. Overall, the image evokes a sense of historical industriousness and nostalgia.","title":"California Western Railroad","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557944","554353","556782","543120","556783","543354","546175","547050","556040","556857","556058","553984","556331","554834","545541","557963"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["wheel","train","carriage","fence","railway","wear","industriousness","restoration","depot","slat"]}
