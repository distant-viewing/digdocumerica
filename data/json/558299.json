{"path":"558299.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Villalobos, Horacio","caption":"This photograph features a daytime scene in a residential area where a mobile home is up for sale. The image captures a tidy, sunlit view of a mobile home painted in shades of beige and cream, featuring big windows covered with white vertical blinds. The home includes a small porch on its side, accessible by a small set of steps.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a well-manicured lawn with a lamppost labeled \"889\" standing near the edge of the pathway, contributing to the sense of a well-planned residential community. Prominently displayed in front of the home is a \"For Sale\" sign, handwritten on a white board with instructions to call between specific times.\n\nA fluffy white dog is lying on the grass in the front, seemingly at ease and enjoying the day. In the background, adjacent to the home being showcased, there is a glimpse of other similar mobile homes and a red pickup truck parked to the left side of the frame.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a quiet, orderly neighborhood feeling, possibly in a dedicated mobile home park, under a clear blue sky.","title":"Mobile home in one of two Mobile home parks which was created in response to workers who arrived for jobs in the town's manufacturing plants which opened since the 1950s.
