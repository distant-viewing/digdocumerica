{"path":"542651.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene scene of a person engaged in fishing at the edge of a river during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the golden hues reflected on the water. The person, standing alone, is dressed in a red jacket and light colored pants, holding a fishing rod extended towards the water. They are on a pebble-strewn shore that gently meets the calm river. The river itself shimmers with reflections of orange and gold, indicative of the sunâ€™s low position in the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, out-of-focus branches subtly frame the scene, enhancing the sense of depth and the natural environment. The background is softly focused, drawing the eye primarily to the individual and their interaction with the tranquil waters. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and contemplative, emphasized by the solitary figure amidst the vast, quiet landscape.","title":"Fishing in pine flat dam on opening day of trout season","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["543628","555576","545968","550666","550217","554519","550665","554520","551024","543753","552314","542529","550313","553338","542509","551025"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","river","gold","strew","pebble","shimmer","person","rod","colore","orange"]}
