{"path":"545065.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a bustling scene inside a fish processing facility. Four individuals are engaged in different tasks at separate workstations.\n\nIn the foreground to the left, a woman, who is wearing a hairnet, a long-sleeve shirt, and an apron, is actively working. She seems to be focused on handling or cutting fish placed on a stainless steel table, indicating her involvement in preparing or processing the seafood.\n\nIn the middle of the photograph, partially visible, a younger individual, also in an apron but turned away from the camera, appears to be observing or learning the process. This person's face isn't visible, which gives a sense of busyness and constant movement typical in an industrial setting.\n\nOn the right, a man standing in the far back wears glasses and casual clothing with a neutral expression, observing or supervising the process. He is holding a mug, suggesting he might be taking a break or casually monitoring the operations.\n\nTo the far right, another worker, possibly a young man, is noticeable. Wearing a bandana, a t-shirt, and an apron, he is focused on processing another fish, using tools on the fish laid out in front of him. His concentrated work and attire suggest a hands-on role in the fish processing.\n\nThe background consists of whitewashed walls and large windows that let in natural light, highlighting the industrial ambiance. Various utensils and equipment, probably used for cutting and preparing the fish, are placed around the room. The general condition and style of the room suggest a practical workspace designed for efficiency. The photograph also features a pervasive diffused light, possibly indicating a bright day outside, contributing to the ambiance of industriousness and productivity.","title":"Seafood processing plant","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545064","543245","550316","545202","550320","552875","545211","552633","545198","554431","552634","558350","545206","554098","544995","544018"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["fish","apron","room","processing","workstation","industriousness","busyness","mug","seafood","productivity"]}
