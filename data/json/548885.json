{"path":"548885.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a bird perched on the branches of what appears to be a deciduous shrub or small tree, devoid of leaves, suggesting it might be either autumn or winter. The bird has a striking appearance with a black head, neck and upper chest, a bright yellow lower chest, and a light brown back. The background behind the bird is soft and blurred, likely due to the use of a shallow depth of field, and it consists of a gentle gradient of blue and warmer tones, hinting at a sky near dawn or dusk.\n\nThe light in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused quality and the angles of the shadows on the branches. No other objects or notable features are visible in the background; the focus is solely on the bird and the branches it is perched on. The overall effect is serene and minimalist, drawing attention to the bird as the main subject of the photograph.","title":"Bird in farmland bush","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544547","557628","555010","544489","547318","543595","544477","551378","554601","549115","555013","548832","553776","553777","557495","550388"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","chest","perch","branch","neck","gradient","autumn","winter","dawn","diffuse"]}
