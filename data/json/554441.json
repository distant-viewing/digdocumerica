{"path":"554441.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a Caucasian man who appears to be in his late 50s or early 60s, with a friendly expression, dressed in work attire. He is wearing a light green long-sleeve shirt, a dark green jacket, and a white hard hat with a sticker labeled \"BUNNY\" on it, suggesting a nickname or company name. The man has short light brown or gray hair and is smiling directly at the camera, showing his teeth in a genuine, warm smile.\n\nThe man is seated, with his hands resting gently on his thighs. He sports a wristwatch on his left wrist, adding a functional accessory likely used in his line of work. His attire and hard hat indicate that he may be involved in a profession that requires safety gear, such as construction or engineering.\n\nIn the background, there's a blurred view of what seems to be a debris-filled area, possibly a construction or demolition site. The area is cluttered with pieces of broken material and dirt. Trees can be seen in the further background, suggesting that the site is near a forested area.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment in the life of a worker, possibly during a break or a casual moment, in a rugged outdoor setting that emphasizes a practical and active professional environment.","title":"This big moose resident wears many hats.
