{"path":"550035.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque urban scene, likely taken in the spring given the blooming trees. It shows a row of traditional, ornate townhouses that exhibit a classical architectural style common in some historic districts. The buildings are multi-storied, with bay windows and intricate gable designs at the roofline. The facade of the buildings is dark, possibly made of brownstone, creating a contrast with the lighter colors of the blossom-filled trees.\n\nTo the right side of the picture, there's a sidewalk lined with a black iron railing that follows the edge of what appears to be a small park or garden area filled with flowering trees, predominantly white blooms, that contribute a bright, lively feel to the scene. This green space brings a touch of nature into the urban environment.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the frame, a person is walking along the sidewalk. The individual is dressed in casual clothing: a blue denim jacket and jeans, and seems to be in motion, captured mid-stride with their face not visible and heading away from the viewpoint of the camera. This adds a dynamic human element to the photograph.\n\nThe overall composition and the lighting suggest a clear day with vibrant sunlight that enhances the colors of the buildings, the greenery, and the blossoms. This creates a serene and appealing urban springtime setting.","title":"Commonwealth Avenue between Arlington and Berkeley streets","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556448","548470","550107","551629","555912","551722","551781","551778","558030","555920","555900","544808","551685","543360","550115","555889"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["blossom","sidewalk","townhouse","roofline","gable","stride","iron","bloom","district","bay"]}
