{"path":"547398.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene family scene in an outdoor setting, likely a home garden, during what appears to be late afternoon judging by the warm lighting and long shadows. The composition centers on three primary subjects in the foreground on a neatly trimmed lawn. \n\nTo the left, an older man with greying hair and glasses, wearing a gray work shirt and a branded cap, warmly interacts with a small boy seated on his lap. The boy, who appears to be a toddler, has blond hair and wears a simple red shirt. Both look comfortable and relaxed, enjoying the outdoor setting. \n\nTo the right, a woman with curly dark hair and glasses is sitting cross-legged on the grass. She wears a white t-shirt and striped pants; her posture and smile, directed towards the man and child, suggest a casual and joyful interaction. \n\nIn the background, a traditional two-story house painted in green with white trims dominates the scene. A small porch is visible where two other people, a man and a woman, can be seen standing and interacting. The overall atmosphere is familial and cozy, with trees and clear skies complementing the picturesque suburban setting.","title":"Farmer Frank Otte with his family on their farm near Grafton.
