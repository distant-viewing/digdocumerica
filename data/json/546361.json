{"path":"546361.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of two people tagging a fish, likely for research or monitoring purposes. The setting is outdoors, possibly on a boat, given the visible part of a white boat edge and water in the blurry background.\n\nIn the center of the image, a silvery fish with speckles and slightly pinkish fins is being held securely. One person, whose hands appear on the left, is wearing a silver watch and bracelets, suggesting female hands, and holds a white tag close to the fish's mouth. Another person's hands, seeming masculine, support the fish from underneath.\n\nPart of a net filled with other fish overlays the boat's edge, hinting at either a recent catch or a method for holding the fish temporarily. The focus of the image is concentrated on the activity of tagging, with key details such as the texture of the fish's scales, the wetness on its body, and the instruments (like the tag) being held, clearly visible. The light outdoor environment suggests daytime work conducted in natural light, providing a clear view of the ecological or monitoring activity taking place.","title":"These aquatic biologists from the southeast water laboratory in Athens, ga.
