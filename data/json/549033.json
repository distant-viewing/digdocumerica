{"path":"549033.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene involving cattle herding on a paved road. In the foreground, a cowboy, dressed in traditional attire including a cowboy hat and a plaid shirt, is mounted on a brown horse. He seems to be actively guiding a large herd of mixed cattle. Looking deeper into the scene, there is another cowboy visible in the background, also on a horse, participating in the herding activity.\n\nThe herd comprises various colors of cattle, mostly in shades of white, brown, and black, densely packed and occupying the breadth of the road. Further back, a green farm vehicle can be seen beyond the herd, possibly used to assist in the herding process or transport goods.\n\nThe surrounding environment features flat, open fields extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. There are utility poles lining the road, enhancing the sense of a wide, open agricultural landscape. The photo composition focuses on rural life and livestock management, depicting the cowboys' interaction with the cattle and emphasizing aspects of traditional ranching practices.","title":"Moving cattle across highway near Imperial--in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548830","548829","548828","552565","548878","553104","543776","548838","552698","543634","553110","554128","553105","553100","543779","543686"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["herd","cattle","cowboy","horse","ranching","road","breadth","livestock","participate","assist"]}
