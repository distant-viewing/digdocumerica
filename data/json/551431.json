{"path":"551431.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric night scene by a body of water, possibly a lake or river. A group of people are gathered around a large, blazing bonfire at the water's edge. The fire illuminates their figures and casts a warm glow in the surrounding darkness, while the night sky above remains pitch black except for a distant, solitary light that appears to be either a star or a distant artificial light.\n\nThe reflections on the water are particularly striking, as they mirror the intense flickers of the bonfire while the gentle ripples distort the light into shimmering patterns. The shoreline is dimly visible and appears to be composed of sand or small rocks, where the group is standing.\n\nThe group of individuals, ambiguously visible due to the low lighting and distance, seem to be engaged in casual, social activities around the fire. Shadows and the backlighting from the fire obscure detailed features, portraying them mainly in silhouette.\n\nOverall, the composition and ambiance of the photograph suggest a peaceful gathering or celebration in a secluded, natural setting, focusing on the elements of fire and water, light and darkness. The mood is one of tranquility mixed with the primitive allure of fire under the open sky.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
