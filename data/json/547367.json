{"path":"547367.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a group of men seated at a long table in a conference or meeting room setting. The focus is on a young man in the foreground, who is dressed in a red sweater over a collared shirt and is wearing a sporty jacket. He has a contemplative expression, resting his chin on his hand while looking slightly to the side, giving the impression he is deeply engaged in listening or thinking.\n\nIn the background, several older men can be seen. They display a range of expressions and attentiveness to what is likely a speaker or a discussion out of the frame. The men wear glasses and are dressed in a mix of casual and semi-formal attire, including sweaters and shirts.\n\nOn the table, there are items typical of a meeting setup such as name placards, papers, coffee cups, and plates with remnants of a meal. The placard in front of the young man reads \"Intercubs & Fellowship,\" suggesting the meeting may involve members of a club or community organization focused on camaraderie or service.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of focus and attentiveness, with a warm, somewhat muted color palette that complements the serious but informal nature of the meeting. The room's décor is simple with no visible adornments, focusing attention on the participants and their interactions.","title":"Members of the Seward Kiwanis Club hold their weekly meeting.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552616","547365","547407","546299","547368","557704","547284","555234","557152","549073","556450","552617","551853","557027","554322","557856"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["meeting","attentiveness","sweater","room","table","man","décor","club","speaker","coffee"]}
