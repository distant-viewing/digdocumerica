{"path":"546075.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene park scene framed by blurred foliage in the foreground, which adds a sense of depth and focus on the main subjects—a group of three people and a dog in the middle distance. The setting appears to be a lush, expansive park bathed in the soft, filtered light of either early morning or late afternoon, suggesting a peaceful, quiet ambiance.\n\nIn the park, there are two individuals walking together towards the left side of the frame—one wearing white and the other in a darker outfit—accompanied by a small, light-colored dog on a leash. Another person, dressed in orange, is bending over slightly while pulling a small blue wagon or cart.\n\nThe background features well-manicured grass and scattered trees that sport varying shades of green, indicating healthy vegetation, possibly in late spring or summer. The shadows suggest a bright, sunny day, but the gentle lighting implies that the sun is not at its peak intensity. These elements together create a tranquil, leisurely atmosphere typical of a day out in a public park, enjoying the outdoors and engaging in unhurried activities.","title":"Golfers on public golf course in city park","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["553043","553065","546259","551682","544808","551713","557940","551736","555947","554669","552036","552407","552722","553903","551678","549716"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["dog","park","leash","cart","manicure","wagon","accompany","intensity","pull","outdoor"]}
