{"path":"544623.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, wilderness scene featuring a deer in a dense forest. The setting appears to be in a wild area with diverse vegetation. The deer, positioned in the center foreground, is standing alone amidst a landscape of thin, scattered trees, many of which have sparse or no leaves, suggesting a possible drought or the aftermath of a fire.\n\nThe ground is covered in brown grass and small bushes, showing patches of green, indicative of survival amidst potentially harsh conditions. The trees are primarily thin and tall, though a few are fallen or bent, contributing to a sense of wild, unmanaged growth and natural disorder.\n\nThe lighting in the image is bright, likely indicating daytime, which highlights the deer against the earth tones of the forest floor. The overall feel of the photograph is one of isolation and the quiet resilience of nature amidst challenging environmental conditions.","title":"White tail deer in Big Cypress Swamp","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558368","543279","545902","552339","542778","546163","544916","544114","544571","543369","545898","554621","542955","542963","546088","551367"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","drought","survival","disorder","forest","aftermath","daytime","resilience","condition","fire"]}
