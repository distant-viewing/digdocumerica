{"path":"543492.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant coastal scene, likely on a sunny day given the bright lighting and deep blue sky. Two individuals, possibly in a leisure or exploration activity, occupy the forefront of the image. They are standing on rugged and uneven rock formations by the seaside. These rock formations appear jagged and weathered, typical of a rocky shoreline exposed to waves and wind. \n\nThe person on the left, wearing a light blue sleeveless shirt and darker shorts, is bent over, seemingly examining or interacting with something on the rocks. This individualâ€™s posture suggests intense focus and curiosity. The person on the right, wearing a striped t-shirt and similarly dark shorts, is also looking downward at the rocks underfoot, echoing the investigative posture of the first individual.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is a dominant force, with white-capped waves crashing against more of the rocky outcrops that litter the shoreline. The sea's dynamic motion adds a lively yet serene atmosphere to the scene, contrasting with the stillness of the figures.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights the interaction of humans with the natural rugged beauty of a coastal environment, emphasizing exploration and perhaps the study of marine life or tidal pools found among the rocks.","title":"California -- Carmel beach","placename":"Carmel (Calif.)","location":"Carmel, California","nn1":["543139","543204","553775","543389","543289","543248","542976","543309","553773","543310","553772","545086","545122","546378","543047","545095"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","exploration","short","shoreline","wave","posture","formation","seaside","individual","outcrop"]}
