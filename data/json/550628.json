{"path":"550628.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and moody mountain landscape. The image shows a vast mountain range with peaks and ridges, part of which is obscured by low-hanging, heavy clouds suggesting an overcast or stormy environment. The foreground presents a steep, shadowed hillside, likely due to the angle of sunlight. This hillside transitions into lighter colored slopes which appear smoother and are covered in a blanket of green, likely vegetation such as grass or low shrubs, common in alpine areas.\n\nVarious ridges in the middle distance climb progressively higher, their surfaces marked by dark and light patches which indicate a mix of vegetation and bare rock or possibly patches of snow that have survived seasonal melting. The highest peaks in the photograph pierce into the clouds, emphasizing their height and the rugged terrain. The clouds themselves envelop the tops of the mountains, casting some in shadow while partially revealing others, and adding a dynamic contrast between darkness and light.\n\nColor tones in the photograph are cool, with predominant blues and greens, contributing to the overall somber and majestic feel of the scene. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible, amplifying the sense of remote, untouched wilderness. This landscape conveys a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of nature in a high-altitude environment.","title":"Peaks of the chugach range dominate steep-sided valleys that have been scored by ice and water","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550645","543831","550408","550502","550610","542520","550521","550415","550505","550422","543023","550591","550421","550504","552695","550609"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["hillside","ridge","mountain","peak","cloud","survive","pierce","overcast","amplify","envelop"]}
