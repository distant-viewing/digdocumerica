{"path":"547036.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a distressing flood scene where a two-story house is partially submerged in turbulent floodwaters. The house, which appears to be a conventional dwelling with a peaked roof and shingled exterior, is situated beside a lake or river. The siding is a mix of gray and teal hues, and there are multiple windows facing the onlooker. The house is angled such that one side faces directly towards the viewer while the other side aligns more towards the right of the frame. \n\nTo the right of the house, there's prominent debris including branches and wooden planks, suggesting destruction or disarray possibly brought on by the waters. Some structures that look like dilapidated fences or parts of another building are also visible, submerged and scattered by the flow of the water. \n\nIn the foreground, the choppy, muddy brown waters are actively splashing against the houseâ€™s foundation which implies ongoing flooding. The surrounding environment seems to have few other buildings or trees, which could be indicative of a rural or less densely populated area. The natural light and the quality of the image suggest it might have been taken during daylight, potentially in the early morning or late afternoon given the softness of the lighting.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a dramatic and possibly devastating situation due to flooding, impacting the residential structure and the surrounding area severely.","title":"Aftermath of severe storm in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552436","552857","547077","552852","552843","548300","552824","552850","547212","552825","547266","547079","547085","547119","547258","552848"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["house","flooding","floodwater","dwelling","teal","foundation","softness","disarray","onlooker","flood"]}
