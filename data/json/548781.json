{"path":"548781.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph displaying a unique waterfront residential development. The development features houses built on multiple small islands, each island connected by water canals forming an intricate network resembling the shape of a fingerprint or a set of branched paths. Each island is slightly different in shape but systematically laid out to maximize waterfront space for each property. \n\nThe islands appear to be surrounded by a sandy or gravel substrate, which distinguishes them from the lush, dark green wetland areas in the background. Some islands have a partially completed look, with construction materials visible and incomplete house structures. Others have fully constructed homes with varied roofing colors and are surrounded by manicured lawns.\n\nOn the northern boundary of the image, there is a roadway parallel to a darker-colored canal, possibly indicating a higher traffic area or a main road providing access to the development. Adjoining this road, traditional suburban homes can be seen, contrasting with the more isolated and unique island properties. \n\nThe larger environmental setting includes expanses of green wetland and open water, hinting at a coastal or riverine location. This development contrasts sharply with the natural surroundings, emphasizing human-modified residential planning within a broader ecological landscape.","title":"Ocean Reef Club at North Key Largo","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548780","544568","544562","548636","544604","548779","553062","548638","544558","557422","557451","553693","544600","548784","547636","551198"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","development","canal","property","wetland","waterfront","adjoin","home","maximize","modify"]}
