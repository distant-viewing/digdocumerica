{"path":"552510.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"In this photograph, we see an old weathered window framed by cracked and chipped white paint on wooden siding. The window contains multiple panes; most of the glass panes appear broken or shattered, leaving jagged pieces clinging to the frame. Within the window, mechanical or electrical equipment can be glimpsed, including what looks like meters or gauges and wires, suggesting the window might belong to some utility or service room, possibly abandoned or out of use.\n\nThe entire scene gives off a sense of neglect and decay, accentuated by the dripping streaks and the stained and peeling layers of paint on the wooden panels surrounding the window. The atmosphere evoked is one of desolation and the passage of time, highlighting elements of urban decay or disuse.","title":"Weigh station and general store in Sheldon Grove.
