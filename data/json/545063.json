{"path":"545063.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a collection of various fish, probably recently caught, piled together in a container or a section of a boat. The fish have a slightly glossy texture, suggesting they are still fresh but might be covered with some moisture or a bit of slime, which is common in freshly caught fish. Several fish are prominently visible on top, with a mix of sizes and species, indicating a diverse catch.\n\nThe fish are mostly gray and silver, with some showing darker patches, and others have visible reddish wounds or bloodstains, likely from the capture process. Their eyes are dull, and their mouths are slightly open, which is typical when fish are no longer alive.\n\nThe background is dark and barely discernible, focusing the viewer’s attention entirely on the fish. There’s no clear indication of the surrounding environment apart from the dark enclosure, which could be either part of a boat or a storage bin. The lighting is direct, casting some shadows and emphasizing the textures of the fish scales and their slightly contorted forms as they lay stacked against and upon each other.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or other objects in the image, reinforcing the idea that the primary focus of the photograph is the depiction of the fish haul. The angle and framing suggest the photo might have been taken from above, looking down into the area where the fish are kept.","title":"Seafood at processing plant","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["546792","544987","542892","547848","546784","544995","547704","545075","546846","554093","554095","543189","555560","554098","545161","547551"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","catch","haul","idea","bin","enclosure","indication","boat","silver","moisture"]}
