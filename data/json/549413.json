{"path":"549413.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene featuring a traditional sailboat with a red sail on open water. The boat is primarily black and red, and it is manned by at least three individuals. The crew appears to include one person managing the helm and two others assisting or enjoying the ride near the bow. The weather seems calm, with light ripples on the surface of the blue water, and the sky is slightly hazy, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nAttached to the sailboat is a small red and black dinghy, floating alongside. The boat's sail is large, nearly filling the frame vertically. The sail has a combination of a rich, red hue and some faded areas, showing some wear. \n\nIn the background, beyond the expansive body of water, an elegant building or series of buildings with classical architectural features is visible, suggesting the boat might be near a city or historic area popular for sailing and tourism.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on leisurely sailing and the serene setting, evokes a sense of peacefulness and recreation. The photographer seems to have taken this shot from another boat, given the angle and proximity to the water level.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548524","549411","544669","544667","549415","549410","552345","552343","549403","549412","547456","551541","548508","543305","548513","549386"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["sail","boat","sailing","sailboat","tourism","photographer","crew","ride","bow","peacefulness"]}
