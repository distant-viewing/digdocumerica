{"path":"553494.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"In the photograph, a young boy stands in the foreground, featuring an expressive but solemn facial expression. He has short, combed-forward, light brown hair and is wearing a short-sleeve shirt with a floral or paisley pattern that appears somewhat dirty. The setting appears to be outdoor, with a focus on a wooden fence behind the boy that has been aged and weathered, showing signs of peeling paint and neglect; graffiti in black spray paint is visible on several of the fence slats.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests a time around dusk, as the natural light is fading which adds a moody, slightly underexposed quality to the colors and details. The background beyond the fence is blurred but seems to be lush, possibly a garden or a wooded area, contributing to the sense of an outdoor, possibly suburban setting. Overall, the composition conveys a sense of loneliness or contemplation, highlighted by the boy's expression and the somewhat dilapidated surroundings.","title":"The Watkins of Mulky Square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison Street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for I-635.
