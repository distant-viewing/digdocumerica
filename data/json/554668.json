{"path":"554668.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil natural scene in an autumn setting. The composition centers around a large, sturdy tree trunk on the right with thick branches extending towards the left, densely covered in leaves that vary in shades of bright and golden yellow, typical of fall foliage. Under the shadow of the tree, there's the silhouette of a woman leaning against the trunk, her features obscured due to the backlighting with a majority of the lighting on her hair and outline, evoking a sense of mystery and tranquility.\n\nBehind her, the ground spreads out into a grassy meadow or field, speckled with various shades of green, yellow, and brown, suggesting fallen leaves or drying grass. This extends towards the background where a line of forest can be seen, and beyond it, a mountain partially obscured by mist or haze and bathed in a soft, diffused light, adding depth and a peaceful ambiance to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene and contemplative, enhanced by the natural beauty of the autumn colors and the gentle hint of the coming winter in the air suggested by the mountainous background. The lighting, primarily ambient with a focus on natural sunlight filtered through autumn leaves, highlights the seasonal beauty and the quiet moment captured in this image.","title":"Girl leans against a sugar maple (acer sacharum) in yellow fall foliage, in a field near Lake Placid, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554735","554715","557159","557127","554637","554739","558105","554737","554718","552599","554099","546090","557165","547546","556473","551365"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["autumn","trunk","leave","fall","backlighting","centers","meadow","majority","speckle","mystery"]}
