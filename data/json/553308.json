{"path":"553308.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of an older man engaged in an activity involving balloons. He is dressed in a gray work shirt with a pair of suspenders and a unique green beret adorned with what appears to be a silver insignia. His expression is focused and slightly furrowed, perhaps indicating concentration or care in handling the balloons.\n\nHe holds several balloons in his hands, which are opaque and come in varied sizes and soft colors such as white and pale blue. The setting includes undefined figures in the background, blurred, contributing to a sense of depth and context in a possibly busy outdoor environment, suggesting this could be a public event or market.\n\nThe man wears a badge, suggesting he might be part of an organization or functioning in an official capacity at this event. The overall mood conveyed by his attire and the setting hints at a festive, community-oriented occasion. His intricate interaction with the balloons, possibly preparing or arranging them, makes this scene lively and heartwarming.","title":"Old man holding balloons on Women's Suffrage Day at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551483","556217","552652","557718","549569","556216","557719","551511","553090","548252","551688","552359","551689","557798","548299","558324"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["balloon","insignia","furrow","suspender","capacity","event","occasion","organization","badge","market"]}
