{"path":"544587.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction in a natural outdoor setting. In the foreground, numerous broken bricks and tiles are scattered haphazardly across the ground. Colors of bricks vary, including shades of red, brown, gray, and subtle hints of blue.\n\nDominating the central part of the image is a large, fallen tree or thick limb lying across the scattered debris, suggesting recent forceful damage, possibly from a storm or other natural disaster. The treeâ€™s light-colored bark contrasts with the darker, richer colors of the bricks.\n\nEnvironmental details include the grassy ground, which is largely covered by bricks but visibly lush around the edges. In the background, several intact trees with dense, green foliage indicate that this location is in a wooded area or a place with significant tree coverage.\n\nLight plays a significant role in enhancing the image's mood; scattered sunlight filtering through the leaves casts mottled shadows over the scene, adding texture and a somber mood to the photograph. The sky above, barely visible through the tree canopy, appears bright and clear, hinting at calm weather following the disruptive event captured in the image.","title":"River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["545966","544468","545254","557008","557573","544466","544467","554437","544583","555086","553556","545264","555207","557993","542570","554548"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["brick","limb","tree","coverage","tile","disaster","destruction","storm","damage","bark"]}
