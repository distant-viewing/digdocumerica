{"path":"546906.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a historical military or commemorative setting, featuring large artillery cannons positioned prominently in the foreground of the image. There are three cannons, arranged in a semi-circular pattern, each mounted on a dark platform surrounded by brickwork and green, neatly trimmed grass. They appear to be coastal defense guns, possibly from the World War II era.\n\nThe view is from an elevated angle, overlooking a tranquil body of water that reflects a clear blue sky. Across the water, there are industrial structures visible along the far shore, including large buildings, smokestacks emitting smoke, and cranes, suggesting this might be a port area. The distant horizon also features several masts of docked ships, adding to the industrial feel of the scene opposite the historical display.\n\nThe area around the cannons is well-maintained, with pathways of red brick leading up to and around the artillery setting. The overall aesthetic contrasts the serene natural beauty with the historical military installation and the busy industrial backdrop, transporting the viewer to a space where history and modern development coexist.","title":"Looking to Clinton Marine Terminal from Fort McHenry","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["558276","546790","546772","558277","546814","558275","558273","558274","558272","556946","555788","544657","555729","549703","543155","552000"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["gun","brickwork","mast","installation","port","history","ship","display","pathway","smokestack"]}
