{"path":"545918.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a high-altitude view of a coastal landscape. The scene captures several elements that together create a dynamically textured terrain.\n\nCentrally, we see a winding river or estuary that flows into a larger body of water, likely a sea or bay. The water shimmers due to the reflection of the light, suggesting the photograph was taken at a time when the sun is bright, possibly during the late morning or early afternoon.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the water is predominantly green and brown, indicating a mix of vegetative and earthen surfaces. On the left side of the image, the coastline curves gently, following the contour of the bay, and appears to be dotted with beaches.\n\nProminently, a network of roads or pathways intricately weaves through the terrain. The roads curve and loop around, creating an interesting pattern against the natural elements of the scene. Several roundabouts or traffic circles can be seen along these roads, enhancing the sense of design and infrastructure amidst the natural scenery.\n\nAltogether, the composition provides a broad, sweeping view of a coastal area where water and land interact dynamically, connected by the structured elements of a developed road system. The atmosphere is serene and untouched, despite the presence of human-made roads, suggesting a balance between nature and infrastructure.","title":"Rock beach","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["543435","543427","545104","554156","548629","547508","554170","552922","552192","554022","548143","556982","543015","557453","549504","554057"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["roads","bay","loop","estuary","curve","structured","circle","infrastructure","weave","shimmer"]}
