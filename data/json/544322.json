{"path":"544322.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This image captures a classroom scene, presumably during a music lesson or class discussion. The classroom appears somewhat cluttered and dimly lit, with natural light entering through an open door at the far end. The teacher, a man, stands at the front left corner of the classroom by the blackboard covered in chalk writings, interacting with the students.\n\nSituated around the classroom are elementary school-aged children, likely around eight to ten students visible; they are seated variedly, some facing the teacher, others turned sideways, engaging attentively in the ongoing activity. The students are a mix of genders and are dressed casually.\n\nThe classroom's furnishing includes traditional school chairs and pupil desks, a majority of which are overturned and placed atop the desks, suggesting either the end of the day or the preparation for an activity requiring more space. Educational and motivational posters adorn the walls, alongside alphabet borders running near the ceiling, and an analog clock is placed high on the wall.\n\nA cart with an old computer monitor and other electronic equipment is noticeable in the background, indicating the era likely before the widespread use of modern digital devices in classrooms. Overhead, fluorescent light fixtures provide additional illumination to the space.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the scene is lively and educational, with a focus on arts or music, underscored by the presence of musical scores or papers held by some students. The room arrangement and materials suggest a multi-functional space used for various types of learning activities.","title":"Training class for HavaSupai teachers in reading and language instruction methods","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["548243","558212","558214","544798","543919","543920","546548","554838","558210","552590","548227","544314","546556","553911","552592","558410"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["classroom","student","teacher","music","desk","school","end","space","monitor","furnishing"]}
