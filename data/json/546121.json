{"path":"546121.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark and somewhat desolate scene, capturing a number of tall, dead trees standing upright in a flat landscape. The trees are barren, devoid of leaves, and many of the branches are broken or missing. The trunks and branches have a bleached appearance suggesting they have been dead for some time and exposed to the elements.\n\nThe ground around these trees is sand-colored, flat, and appears to be devoid of vegetation, indicating an arid or possibly polluted environment. In the foreground, there is a gully or trench that reveals darker earth, which contrasts with the lighter colored surface soil, and suggests some form of erosion or land alteration.\n\nIn the distance beyond the trees, there is a line of thicker vegetation or possibly a forest, indicating that this area might be an exception within a larger, more alive landscape. The sky above is a dull purple-pink hue, suggesting the photograph might have been taken during twilight or under unique lighting conditions that cast an eerie glow over the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of solitude and environmental decline, possibly highlighting issues such as deforestation, drought, or industrial impact.","title":"Dead trees near the holding ponds of Olin-Mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546065","543843","543718","545747","555088","543722","544019","544241","553572","542863","548587","552551","555136","555002","544751","547661"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["gully","bleach","drought","deforestation","branch","trench","decline","alteration","miss","tree"]}
