{"path":"548889.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat nostalgic streetscape, likely from the mid-to-late 20th century, depicting elements typical of American roadways of that era.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several prominent street signs including one that is large and reads \"Shoppers Paradise,\" alongside two smaller signs; the nearest reads \"US Post Office Station.\" These signs, mounted on tall poles, suggest a commercial area facilitating shopping and services.\n\nThe middle distance shows a sparse collection of older model cars, primarily of 1960s and 1970s make, parked or moving along the road. The styles of the vehicles include sedans and coupes, and they contribute to the historical feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is less distinct but includes utility poles stretching into the distance alongside the road. There is also a large, complex structure that could be an old water tower or a similar utility installation, further enhancing the vintage American landscape vibe.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is slightly hazy, possibly due to the time of day or atmospheric conditions like smog, which was more prevalent in certain eras. This gives the image a muted palette, reinforcing the sense of looking back in time. The composition captures a slice of daily life, perhaps in a suburban or semi-urban part of the U.S., showcasing the intersection of transportation, commerce, and infrastructure.","title":"Las Vegas shopping center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["555584","545216","549113","557155","545614","552602","550093","558028","555438","549224","557655","542586","547651","556709","545618","547369"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["streetscape","utility","coupe","pole","era","sign","read","shopping","commerce","installation"]}
