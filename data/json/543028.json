{"path":"543028.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an atmospheric scene centered on an arched window set in a pale yellow wooden wall of a building, possibly a traditional house judging from the architectural details. The window itself has a dark, muted teal trim and is composed of six panes, with a grid-like structure dividing them. Above the window, you can notice decorative woodwork painted in matching colors, adding an elegant, vintage touch to the building's fa√ßade.\n\nMost strikingly, a person's face is faintly visible through one of the lower panes of the window. The individual appears to be peering out, their features subtly obscured and shadowed due to the reflection or dark tint of the window glass. This adds a sense of mystery or intrigue to the image.\n\nThe ambiance is slightly eerie, perhaps due to the subdued lighting and the obscured, almost ghostly appearance of the person inside. The overall mood is quiet and pensive, with a vintage feel conveyed through the color tones and architectural style. The framing of the shot, tightly focused on the window and part of the surrounding wall, draws attention directly to the interplay of architecture and the human element within.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548232","542802","557846","552745","553554","548072","552535","552530","544437","555295","544410","556276","558025","546546","553479","543348"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["window","pane","woodwork","intrigue","judging","teal","notice","peer","wall","obscure"]}
