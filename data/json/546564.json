{"path":"546564.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and contemplative setting within what appears to be an art gallery or museum. The main subject of the photo is a woman seated alone on a long, narrow, red cushioned bench. She is positioned near the center of the room and is engrossed in reading a magazine or catalog. Her attire consists of a red top and black pants, which subtly complement the deep tones of the bench on which she's seated.\n\nThe architectural environment around her features dark, textured brick walls that contribute to a somewhat muted and introspective ambiance. The ceiling above is outfitted with multiple rows of simple round lights that illuminate the space gently and evenly. The flooring is a light beige or gray color that contrasts softly with the dark walls and complements the lighting.\n\nIn the background, small artworks or photographs can be seen mounted on the walls, spaced widely apart, inviting quiet contemplation. The overall composition of the photograph—with its focus on solitude, the act of reading, and the spacious, dimly lit surroundings—evokes a sense of calm and cultural engagement.","title":"Inside rogers memorial library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546554","546558","553535","546474","546500","546479","546560","546478","556048","553534","553156","546526","556070","545373","553763","556776"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["bench","complement","wall","museum","magazine","flooring","artwork","engross","reading","seat"]}
