{"path":"542561.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an action scene set in a stream surrounded by a verdant environment. The main focus is on a person standing in the middle of the shallow stream. This individual, wearing a light shirt, darker pants, and fishing waders, holds a circular sieve-like tool, often used in gold panning or similar activities. They are actively lifting this sieve from the water, generating a dynamic splash that forms an arching curtain of water droplets illuminated by sunlight.\n\nThe background is lush with dense greenery including bushes and tall trees, indicating a serene, natural setting. The light filtering through the leaves and reflecting off the water suggests that it is either morning or late afternoon, creating a calm and pleasant atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition blends elements of human activity and the natural environment, captured in a moment of motion and interaction with the stream. The clarity and detail of the flowing water and vegetation paint a vibrant scene of outdoor exploration or resource gathering.","title":"Stocking fish and fishing in Merced River.","placename":"Merced County (Calif.)","location":"Merced County, California","nn1":["552271","549012","545386","553332","551408","542529","552976","544347","550209","542744","542509","553070","545212","545882","554520","554519"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["stream","gold","droplet","curtain","resource","water","splash","clarity","exploration","tool"]}
