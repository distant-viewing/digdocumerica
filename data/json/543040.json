{"path":"543040.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph portrays a scenic, pastoral setting. In the foreground, a woman and a child, closely interacting, share a tender moment in a sunlit verdant field. The woman, wearing a long-sleeved red top and blue jeans, is bending forward slightly towards the child, who appears to be in pink pants and a light-colored top. Both have long hair, with the light illuminating the outlines of their forms, which enhances the warmth of the scene.\n\nTo their right, a small black dog stands attentively, facing the woman and child. The dog seems to be part of this intimate grouping, adding a sense of domesticity and companionship.\n\nThe background is dominated by a broad, open grassy landscape stretching far into the horizon under a clear sky. Just off to the right, partially framing the scene, is a large, isolated tree, which adds an element of rugged natural beauty to the composition. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as the sun's rays cast a soft, diffused light over the scene. The overall mood is peaceful and bucolic, suggesting a moment of leisure or casual interaction in a natural setting.","title":"Prime hill land has been selected for intensive housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif.)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["547398","543863","551027","543678","554532","554921","551934","554559","553543","554497","549200","554932","553496","549716","556356","543780"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["dog","child","woman","grouping","ray","companionship","warmth","share","top","diffuse"]}
