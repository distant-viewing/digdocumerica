{"path":"544595.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, yet hauntingly beautiful swamp scene, likely characteristic of those found in the southeastern United States, such as in Florida or Louisiana. A still, dark water body reflects the dense and diverse swamp vegetation vividly. Several mature trees, possibly cypress, dominate the scene, characterized by their buttressed trunks and thick limbs. These trees are draped extensively with Spanish moss, which hangs down in long, curtain-like strands, adding a ghostly aura to the setting.\n\nThe undergrowth is lush, with various species of smaller plants and bushes partially submerged in the swamp water. The flora includes ferns and other marsh-adapted species, some bearing leaves that glisten with moisture, suggesting a humid environment. No animals or people are visible, which emphasizes the untouched, natural state of the swamp. The light appears soft and diffused, possibly due to an overcast sky, which enhances the greens and grays in the vegetation. This setting conveys a tranquil, though somewhat mysterious atmosphere, typical of swamp landscapes.","title":"Loop Road area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544549","546181","546059","544585","544545","544589","544593","544241","550789","544602","546057","554717","550788","546205","547604","550345"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["swamp","specie","strand","limb","aura","fern","undergrowth","curtain","moisture","flora"]}
