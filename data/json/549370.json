{"path":"549370.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a man standing in the foreground with the sculpture of \"The Thinker\" by Auguste Rodin visible in the background. The man is wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and a patterned tie, and he is sporting dark-rimmed glasses. He appears professionally dressed and is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression.\n\nBehind him, \"The Thinker\" statue is partially silhouetted and elevated, positioned on a plinth. The statue is captured from the side, showcasing the muscular depiction of the figure deep in contemplation, with his chin resting on his hand and his elbow on his knee.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph appears to be natural, likely outdoor light, given the visible foliage which softly blurs into the background. This provides a contrasting yet harmonious backdrop to the clarity and detail seen in the man's portrait in the foreground. Overall, the composition of the photo balances the human subject with the art, linking the man's intellectual demeanor to the philosophical pose of \"The Thinker.\"","title":"Dr.  Ing.
