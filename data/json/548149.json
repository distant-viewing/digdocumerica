{"path":"548149.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a serene landscape scene viewed from behind a blurred foreground of tall, swaying grass. The focus is on a scenic background featuring a hilly terrain that gently slopes towards the sea. The sea is visible as a broad expanse of calm blue water that stretches across the horizon.\n\nNestled within the landscape are a few sparse structures, suggesting a rural or less densely populated area. Most prominent among these structures is a small, possibly wooden, pointed structure that closely resembles a traditional steeple or a small chapel. This structure is centrally located in the image and gives a quaint, perhaps religious, characteristic to the setting.\n\nThe land around the structures appears arid or semi-arid, with patches of greenery and cultivated areas indicating some form of agriculture or gardening. There are various shrubs and trees scattered around, adding to the rural feel of the scene. The overall composition is tranquil, highlighting nature and simplicity with a touch of human influence through the buildings and cultivated land. The soft, natural lighting suggests that the photo was taken during the day under clear skies, enhancing the calm and peaceful ambiance of the landscape.","title":"Biggs junction on the Columbia River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["555567","549142","546455","547440","557519","549146","557087","549249","555603","554085","546463","557023","554035","554801","545040","557749"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["cultivate","sea","sway","steeple","structure","gardening","land","agriculture","influence","simplicity"]}
