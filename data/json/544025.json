{"path":"544025.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image captures a scenic view of a large recreational area around a serene lake. The landscape is mostly arid with rocky, barren hills surrounding the lake, dotted sparsely with small shrubs and desert vegetation. The foreground shows a rugged terrain with dry bushes and sparse greenery.\n\nThe lake itself is a significant feature, being vast and extending into the distance, bordered by hills. Its surface reflects a deep blue color, possibly indicating clear skies above, although the colors are somewhat muted, suggesting this could be a vintage photograph.\n\nActivities around the lake include boating and likely other water recreation, as indicated by the presence of various boats on the water and a densely populated marina to one side. The marina area, visible to the left side of the photo, is busy with numerous cars parked close to the waterfront, suggesting a popular outing spot. A smaller grouping of boats is seen towards the middle of the lake, engaging in recreational activities.\n\nThe overall setting is peaceful yet lively with recreational activities, set against a backdrop of a rugged, natural landscape. The clear skies and the bright sunlight suggest a warm day, ideal for outdoor activities. This setting is perhaps indicative of a popular vacation or day-trip destination, encompassing both the serenity of natural scenery and the enjoyment of active leisure.","title":"Lake pleasant","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544006","544002","548002","552915","543579","546856","558233","551207","548963","554485","552222","553440","548989","543998","555386","551219"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","marina","boat","grouping","vacation","encompass","destination","serenity","trip","recreation"]}
