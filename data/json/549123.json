{"path":"549123.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a diverse natural landscape viewed from an elevated vantage point. The foreground is dominated by a yucca plant, identifiable by its sharp, spear-like leaves and a tall, narrow spike adorned with a vertical arrangement of bulbous, white flowers. This plant is indicative of semi-arid to arid environments, suggesting a dry, possibly mountainous region.\n\nTowards the middle ground, there's a winding dirt road that curves through the landscape, bordered by a sparse distribution of conifer trees. The earth along this road shows varying shades of brown and red, implying soil rich in minerals and possibly affected by erosion processes.\n\nIn the background, the terrain expands into rolling hills covered with patches of greenery and more conifers. The sight is expansive and open under a bright blue sky, populated with fluffy, white clouds. The overall appearance of the landscape is of a rugged, natural area, likely removed from urban settings and showing minimal signs of human impact beyond the dirt road cutting through. The photograph suggests an atmosphere of peacefulness and natural beauty, typical of protected or less frequently traversed wild areas.","title":"Stripped land signals the start of operations by the Westmoreland Coal Company in Sarpy Basin.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["545717","552549","549225","545724","544879","544887","549183","544429","550477","544016","550439","543665","545723","545575","549132","549150"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["road","dirt","distribution","sight","conifer","peacefulness","plant","mineral","vantage","erosion"]}
