{"path":"545137.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural scene featuring a rustic, old wooden shack standing near the edge of a calm body of water, likely a pond or lake. The shack appears weathered, with a patchy red roof and walls that have faded to a dull, reddish-brown hue. Adjacent to the main structure is a smaller building or extension, characterized by similar rustic wood siding and a darker roof.\n\nDirectly in front of the shack, there is a wooden post protruding from the water, adding an element of dilapidation to the scene. Vegetation, such as shrubs and grasses, surrounds the buildings and encroaches on the water's edge, indicating a somewhat untended wildness to the area.\n\nThe water itself is a striking feature, mirroring the buildings and the sky above, creating a perfect reflection that enhances the tranquility and symmetry of the scene. This body of water likely plays a role in the life and function of the buildings, possibly related to fishing or small-scale aquaculture.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains layered in shades of blue create a dramatic backdrop, suggesting a remote location. The sky is clear with a subtle gradation of late afternoon or early morning light, which casts a warm glow over the entire landscape, emphasizing the peaceful and timeless atmosphere of the rural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its reflections, natural surroundings, and the charming decay of the buildings, evokes a sense of quiet isolation and pastoral beauty.","title":"Boathouse on svenson isle","placename":"Columbia River","location":"Columbia River","nn1":["554438","551111","554788","554084","550357","554401","544567","551076","554696","550778","545005","545233","546149","555577","548034","548030"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["shack","aquaculture","wildness","building","extension","reflection","encroach","gradation","symmetry","water"]}
