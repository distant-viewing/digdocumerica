{"path":"544921.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged natural landscape, predominantly displaying a rocky terrain. In the foreground, there is a single, small pine tree centrally positioned. This tree exhibits notable characteristics such as a gnarled trunk and sparse foliage, suggesting it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It casts a sharp shadow on the ground, indicative of bright daylight conditions.\n\nThe background is composed of layered rock formations, suggesting a canyon or mountainous area. These rock layers appear horizontally stratified and have a relatively smooth surface, interspersed with crevices and some vegetation like small shrubs or bushes peeking out from the rocks. The color palette of the rocks ranges from deep brown to gray, contrasting with the brighter, warm tones of the foreground rocky surface and the green of the tree.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interplay between the resilience of the lone tree against the vast and enduring rock formations, conveying a sense of isolation and the stark beauty of nature in a desert-like environment.","title":"Colorado--Pagosa Springs","placename":"Pagosa Springs (Colo.)","location":"Pagosa Springs, Colorado","nn1":["544926","555573","545724","543722","543718","545754","544440","545534","546157","549151","543658","552551","543635","544341","544887","543843"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","gnarl","endure","layer","crevice","conditions","adapt","brighter","canyon"]}
