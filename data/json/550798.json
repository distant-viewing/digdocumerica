{"path":"550798.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a large open dumpsite cluttered with various types of waste. Among the visible debris are overturned and damaged furniture pieces such as wooden frames of what could be beds or tables, and a large, prominent red piece with degraded white letters that appears to be part of a dismantled sign or structure. Scattered throughout the landfill are numerous garbage bags, some of which are opened revealing their contents. Mixed amid the waste are smaller items including paper, plastic items, metal cans, and glass bottles.\n\nIn the background, a sparse line of thin trees and a fence are visible, indicating the boundary of the dump. Despite the greenery in the background, the foreground is dominated by refuse, showing no signs of vegetation and depicting a stark contrast between the natural environment and the polluted site. The lack of human presence and activity in the photograph focuses the viewer's attention on the environmental impact of such waste management practices. The overall scene conveys a sense of abandonment and neglect, highlighting issues related to waste disposal and environmental degradation.","title":"Town of Enterprize dump, in Oneida County--on banks of Wisconsin River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550801","557307","544823","549750","547983","554541","551245","553433","551242","552446","549936","551247","546246","546761","550702","544637"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","dumpsite","piece","item","dump","refuse","landfill","disposal","furniture","practice"]}
