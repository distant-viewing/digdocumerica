{"path":"549301.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph features two tall, imposing skyscrapers standing side by side against a clear sky with some scattered clouds. The buildings are very large and rectangular, stretching upwards seamlessly into the sky. They dominate the image, presenting a powerful architectural presence. Their shiny, reflective surfaces appear to be made of glass or metal, which glisten under the sunlight. The skyscrapers have very few distinct features, with an almost flat and smooth facade, emphasizing their modern design. Between the buildings, a bit of blue sky and white clouds are visible, hinting at a sunny day. No ground or street level activity is visible, as the perspective emphasizes the towering nature of the buildings. The photo captures these architectural giants from a low angle, looking upwards, which enhances their grand scale and the sense of they towering over the viewer.","title":"Towers of the world trade center in lower Manhattan seen from west street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555278","550116","555275","548387","549302","552395","552363","549317","548408","545885","551455","549971","553328","555274","548386","552394"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["skyscraper","tower","glisten","cloud","impose","bit","building","facade","level","angle"]}
