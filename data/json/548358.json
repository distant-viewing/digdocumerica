{"path":"548358.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a bustling urban environment, vividly capturing the dynamics of city infrastructure amidst dense buildings. The central focus is a large freeway interchange, featuring multiple lanes and sweeping curves which facilitate the flow of numerous cars. Linking these roads are ramps and junctions choreographed complexly, helping guide traffic through and around this network.\n\nOn the upper left side of the image, there is a notable building with an interesting, white, tent-like structure top, suggesting it might be an architectural focal point such as a civic center or sporting complex. Surrounded by rectangular high-rise buildings that dominate the area immediately adjacent to it, possibly indicating a downtown or central business district.\n\nThe area is tightly packed with residential and commercial buildings, characterized by their flat roofs and similar heights, creating a somewhat monotonous urban texture. The buildings are predominantly of older architectural styles, as evidenced by their exterior details and small, closely spaced windows.\n\nTo the right, the residential pattern changes to a series of row houses, which appear to have gabled roofs, distinguishing them from the more block-like structures of the central area. These homes align neatly, bordering the thoroughfares, denoting a different, possibly more residential neighborhood.\n\nInterspersed in the cityscape, there are patches of green, presumably small parks or communal areas providing a visual relief from the dense urban environment. Additionally, the traffic, captured dynamically, flows along the multiple lanes of the freeway, illustrating the city's bustling activity. The complexity of the road system and the density of the built environment underscore the urban planning and infrastructure typical of a densely populated city. Such an image is useful in studying urban development, transportation systems, and architectural diversity.","title":"Manhattan entrance to the george Washington bridge bridge crosses Hudson River to New Jersey","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553001","555743","553015","553838","546678","547764","546617","549476","544634","547765","546616","548363","546726","547755","549478","546707"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["freeway","lane","city","system","traffic","junction","relief","interchange","flow","building"]}
