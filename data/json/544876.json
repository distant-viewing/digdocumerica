{"path":"544876.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a close view of white wildflowers in a natural setting. The flowers are mostly clustered in bunches, each bloom displaying a large number of narrow white petals and a yellow center resembling daisies. The plants are flourishing in a soil-based environment that appears dry and somewhat rocky. In the background, other vegetation, mostly consisting of dark and light green shrubs and possibly some thorny branches, subtly contrasts the vibrant white flowers. The sunlight seems to be shining brightly on the flora, highlighting the delicate features of the flowers against the darker, shadowed background of leaves and branches. The overall atmosphere conveys a vibrant yet serene natural landscape.","title":"Hovenweep national monument","placename":"Utah Junction (Colo.)","location":"Utah Junction, Colorado","nn1":["547642","550781","549230","543197","544875","553368","554576","554575","545695","545720","545726","557098","555106","545291","544443","555186"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","flourish","shin","branch","wildflowers","shadowed","petal","bloom","flora","resembl"]}
