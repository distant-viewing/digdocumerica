{"path":"545295.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decay in a seemingly abandoned or neglected town. In the foreground, there is a destroyed and rusty vehicle, possibly a truck, filled with debris and miscellaneous discarded objects. The truck is heavily damaged, with the cab part crumpled, windows shattered, and parts of the body and chassis visibly rusted or worn out.\n\nIn the middle ground, directly behind the truck, stands an old brick building prominently featuring an advertisement for \"Bull Durham Tobacco.\" The advertisement is painted in a vintage style, with large letters and the depiction of a bull. The building itself appears weathered but structurally intact, with its facade showing signs of aging and exposure to elements.\n\nIn the background, other dilapidated and partially collapsed brick buildings can be seen, suggesting the area might have been industrial or commercial. These structures are in various states of disrepair, with visible debris and structural damage.\n\nSurrounding the urban scene are hills or mountains, somewhat barren with sparse vegetation, possibly indicating a location in a more rural or isolated setting. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber and forsaken mood of the image. The entire scene conveys a sense of abandonment and historic neglect, possibly indicative of a town that has seen better days and is now forgotten.","title":"Deserted truck","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["552997","546816","547587","554561","546051","556330","550264","544060","552673","543354","547470","550279","556313","544720","549785","547927"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["truck","advertisement","damage","town","shatter","neglect","brick","crumple","forget","cab"]}
