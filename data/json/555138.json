{"path":"555138.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural forested landscape with a focus on dense vegetation. In the foreground, a large pile of tangled, dry branches and brush dominates the view. This accumulation of deadwood suggests recent forestry activities such as clearing or clean-up. Beyond this pile, the terrain slopes downward and gives way to a lush expanse of tall, dark green coniferous trees.\n\nThe background reveals a steep mountain slope that forms part of a dramatic valley. The mountain is partially covered with pine trees, and its barren, rocky surface is also visible, indicating erosion or a lack of soil fertility suitable for dense vegetation. This stark contrast in vegetation highlights the varying ecological zones within the area.\n\nThe sky is not visible in the image, focusing viewer attention entirely on the natural elements and topographical features of this forested landscape. The lighting suggests daylight conditions with sufficient sunlight enhancing the vividness of the greenery and the textures of the wood and rock surfaces.","title":"Precommercially thinned Douglas fir in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
