{"path":"546469.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts an architectural structure with a distinctive design, characterized by multiple steep, triangular roof sections, resembling a series of pyramids or sharp peaks. These roofs are covered in reddish-brown tiles that match the walls of the building. The structure also features an intriguing element: a circular opening or window through one of the peaks, adding visual interest and symmetry. \n\nThe building is substantial in size, with lower extensions spreading outward that incorporate large, rectangular windows, indicating it's likely a public or institutional building. Around the building, there is a well-manicured lawn, suggesting the setting is cared for professionally.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, a person is visible walking on the path that hugs the building, providing a sense of scale and human element to the scene. The sky behind the structure is clear and bright, indicating that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, assisting in highlighting the vibrant colors of the architecture and its environment. The setting appears peaceful and serene, chiefly emphasizing the modernistic and geometric architecture.","title":"First Baptist Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546473","546468","546464","546472","546484","546481","555318","546506","548650","546480","546456","556628","556623","550677","555294","558162"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["peak","pyramid","building","incorporate","extension","hug","symmetry","architecture","tile","manicure"]}
