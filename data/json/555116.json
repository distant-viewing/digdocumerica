{"path":"555116.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene woodland scene predominantly featuring lush, dense forest. In the foreground, a large coniferous tree with a rough, dark bark stands prominently, stretching vertically across the frame. Surrounding this main tree, various other types of trees, including both coniferous and deciduous species, add to the thick greenery, displaying varied tones of green and hints of light yellow-green, which could suggest a change in season.\n\nThe background shows a more open wooded area with a gentle slope that leads up to what appears to be a ridge or a hilltop. The light seems to be slightly dim, possibly due to overcast weather or the density of the forest canopy filtering the sunlight.\n\nThere are no human activities or visible paths, and the natural landscape takes center stage, suggesting a remote, tranquil environment likely far from urban areas. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of calmness and the natural beauty of an undisturbed forest.","title":"Mixed stand of Douglas fir and hemlock, and deciduous trees in olympic national timberland, Washington.
