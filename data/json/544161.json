{"path":"544161.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid industrial scene involving heavy machinery and a worker. In the foreground, we see a worker wearing a safety helmet, which has some stickers and signs of wear, indicating a rugged environment. The worker’s face is turned away from the camera, looking towards a large truck. He is holding what appears to be a walkie-talkie, suggesting he is either coordinating with others or managing operations.\n\nThe central focus of the photograph is a massive, robust truck, painted in solid colors with visible signs of use such as dirt and grime, indicating it is actively used in a heavy-duty working environment. This truck is equipped with large, heavy tires and a staircase leading to the driver’s cabin, emphasizing its large scale. Behind the first truck, there is another similar truck, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is subtle, featuring a clear blue sky with minimal clouds, suggesting it’s a dry, possibly arid environment. There is a black smoke trail visible in the air, possibly emitted from the operations of the trucks or other machinery out of the frame, pointing to the industrial nature of the activity being carried out.\n\nOn the ground, various industrial elements such as metal parts and possibly oily patches can be seen, which adds to the overall gritty and busy workplace atmosphere. Additionally, there's a structure that seems to be a side of a metallic container or segment of machinery with visible rust and usage marks, indicating an environment that is utilitarian and functional.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment in an industrial operation focusing on heavy machinery and personnel, surrounded by an environment tailored for rugged and heavy-duty tasks.","title":"Coal haulers and Navajo workman at the Peabody Coal Company","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["555866","556866","556893","557385","542538","555561","544169","544048","546915","556518","544160","542539","547922","556320","555636","556391"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["truck","machinery","worker","duty","operation","grime","workplace","personnel","sticker","staircase"]}
