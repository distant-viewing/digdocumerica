{"path":"555101.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and abstract natural scene, possibly looking up from the base of a canyon or crevice. Two primary elements dominate the image, which are large, weathered logs or tree trunks. These are positioned diagonally across the frame, leading the viewer's eye upward towards a small sliver of sky.\n\nThe texture of the logs is prominently featured; they have rough, deeply grooved surfaces that speak to significant aging and exposure to the elements. The patterns on the wood suggest that they have been worn smooth in some areas, likely by water or wind erosion.\n\nThe sky, visible at the top of the frame, adds a bit of light to the otherwise dark and moody scene. There is a faint hint of a rainbow or a light flare, adding a touch of color to the dark blue and grey tones that dominate the image.\n\nThere are no people or man-made objects visible; the focus is entirely on the natural forms and the interplay of light and shadow. The composition lends a sense of verticality and might evoke feelings of being small or enclosed by nature. The overall mood is one of awe or contemplation, inspired by the power and timelessness of natural processes.","title":"Snags in a clear-cut area of the satsop river drainage system in olympic national timberland, Washington.
