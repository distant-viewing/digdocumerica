There are also cartoonish characters such as a mountie figure representing Canada and other whimsical faces.\n\nThe stickers are vibrant and colorful, each containing distinct illustrations or symbols such as state outlines, landmarks, or state flags. This collection of stickers is set against the backdrop of the curved, yellow-framed rear side window of a vintage car, serving both as a decorative element and a whimsical showcase of travel memorabilia or souvenirs from different locations across North America. The overall impression is playful and nostalgic, evoking a sense of travel and regional pride.","title":"Side window of a well-traveled volkswagon","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554231","557148","546193","553288","557922","555477","545335","554366","547494","547269","554364","555462","543878","555893","543856","546177"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["sticker","state","symbol","represent","travel","crab","illustration","pride","map","characteristic"]}
