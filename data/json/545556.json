{"path":"545556.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The image captures a close-up of a chipmunk standing on a dusty, reddish-brown terrain. The chipmunk appears alert and is facing towards the camera, with its two front paws positioned closely together on the ground. It has distinctive fur patterns with rich brown and gray colors, highlighted by the natural sunlight. There are also striking white stripes running down its back, along with white and black markings around its eyes that enhance its inquisitive look.\n\nIts bushy tail, which is characteristic of chipmunks, is partially visible and raised in the air behind it, casting a shadow on the ground that adds depth to the image. The background is blurred but seems to consist of a similarly dusty and dry environment, suggesting that this scene takes place outdoors in a natural, possibly arid habitat. The focus and details like the texture of the fur and the grains of sand are sharply captured, emphasizing the wildlife theme of the photograph.","title":"Chipmunk at campground of Dead Horse Point State Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545560","557615","545564","550468","550472","555668","542629","543265","550469","554597","554599","550470","545549","542630","550430","554621"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","dusty","alert","tail","marking","strike","patterns","wildlife","habitat","raise"]}
