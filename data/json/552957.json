{"path":"552957.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Heyman, Ken","caption":"This photograph features a young girl standing next to a washing line filled with white tank tops hanging neatly in a row. The girl is wearing a sleeveless, red and white striped dress with a white collar, and she appears to be deep in thought, with one hand touching her face as she looks off into the distance. The background shows the exterior of a weather-worn wooden structure, possibly a barn or rural house, which adds a rustic charm to the scene. The overall composition uses a natural, subdued light that suggests this scene was captured either in the early morning or late evening, adding a sense of calm and introspection to the mood of the image. The alignment of the tank tops generates a repetitive visual element that contrasts with the singular, thoughtful presence of the girl, creating a dynamic yet harmonious balance in the photograph.","title":"Martin-pena area of puerto Rico.
