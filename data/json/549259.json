{"path":"549259.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a rural setting, likely a farm. The main subject is a man crouching beside a red and white tractor, indicated to be a \"650\" model by the emblem on its front. The man, appearing focused and actively engaged in his task, is wearing a cowboy hat, a plaid shirt, and denim jeans, which suggests he might be a farmer or a worker related to agricultural activities.\n\nHe is pointing to something on the ground, possibly inspecting the soil or a specific spot on the field, which appears to be recently worked, judging from the scattered dry straw and the texture of the soil. His posture and the direction of his gaze emphasize his attention and possibly concern or curiosity about the condition of the field.\n\nThe setting is expansive, with a wide horizon showing a vast, open landscape typical of farmland. The background features a clear sky with few fluffy clouds, suggesting a pleasant, sunny day. This open, airy environment underscores the agricultural theme and provides a sense of the rural atmosphere. This context, combined with the individual's attire and actions, strongly portrays a moment in the daily life of someone working in agriculture.","title":"The John Redding ranch in Sarpy Basin is threatened by strip-mining activities of the Westmoreland Coal Company.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554203","544250","547734","549036","549051","549042","548876","555619","544371","554204","555528","552677","544888","553665","557521","548874"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["soil","farmer","farmland","emblem","tractor","straw","field","agriculture","gaze","curiosity"]}
