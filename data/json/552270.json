{"path":"552270.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, flooded riverside or lakeside scene. The foreground prominently features an asphalt surface that is mostly submerged under water, creating a slick, reflective sheen. Scattered across this watery surface are various debris and leaves, adding texture and a sense of untidiness often seen after flooding. \n\nIn the middle ground, a row of boat houses is visible. These structures have sloped roofs and are built on floating platforms, allowing them to rest directly atop the calm water. They appear uniform in construction but vary slightly in color, with shades of blue, green, and white dominating. The reflections of these boathouses create a mirror image effect on the water, emphasizing the stillness of the scene.\n\nBeyond the boathouses and extending towards the background, there are faint silhouettes of bare masts from boats and other slender, vertical structures, hinting at more nautical activity out of view. The sky, although not prominently visible, suggests a bright, clear day.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph work together to create a calm yet slightly disordered snapshot of life on the water, particularly in an area affected by flooding.","title":"Oil sludge floats on water at yacht basin.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548034","545008","544567","547965","545005","548030","552128","545197","551066","550324","555570","544266","552853","557255","551221","542908"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boathouse","flooding","dominating","boat","sheen","asphalt","mast","lakeside","riverside","mirror"]}
