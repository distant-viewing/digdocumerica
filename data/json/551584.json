{"path":"551584.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a unique urban landscape dominated by a large, white building wall covered with painted musical scores. The scores include detailed musical notations and fill almost the entirety of the visible wall. The scene is an open, paved lot, which seems to be used casually by pedestrians and parked cars.\n\nThere are four figures in the photograph. In the forefront, a man, likely middle-aged based on posture, is seen walking across the parking lot directly towards the camera. He is dressed in light colored pants and a dark shirt. A second person, wearing dark clothing, appears to be crossing the lot in a direction perpendicular to the man. Farther off, another person is standing by a parked car, which appears to be an older model, and another individual is seen near the corner of the building.\n\nIn the background, beyond the high-rise building adorned with music, you can glimpse the side and rear of another brick building, giving a hint of the dense urban setting. The blue sky above the landscape suggests a clear day. Overall, this depiction looks like a blend of everyday city life occurring in the shadow of a remarkable and creative artistic endeavor on the wall, juxtaposing the routine with the extraordinary.","title":"Music store has painted a symphonic score on building wall facing parking lot.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553201","553247","551770","549317","545380","555902","550118","553537","551493","556231","546539","546443","548476","546506","552757","542579"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["lot","wall","entirety","music","routine","rear","endeavor","person","depiction","car"]}
