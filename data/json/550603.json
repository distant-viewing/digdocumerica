{"path":"550603.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dense and lush forest landscape during what appears to be the early autumn season. The scene is dominated by tall trees, showing a variety of colors ranging from deep greens to vibrant yellows, indicating a change in the seasons. The trees in the foreground, possibly birches or aspens, have leaves that have turned a golden yellow, contrasting sharply with the darker, evergreen conifers in the background. These evergreens, which look to be a type of spruce or fir, add a layer of depth and color contrast, towering over the lighter colored deciduous trees.\n\nThe composition is a vertical snapshot that encapsulates the variety of tree species and the terrain's natural undulation. The area looks wild and untouched, with no visible signs of human activity or development, suggesting a remote or protected natural area. The forest appears to be on a gentle slope, as evidenced by the lineup of trees, which gives a layered effect to the photograph.\n\nThe quality of light in the image suggests it might be taken during late afternoon, with the sunlight subtly enhancing the yellow hues of the deciduous trees, giving the scene a warm, inviting glow. Overall, the photograph evokes a sense of tranquility and the serene beauty of an autumnal forest in a temperate climate.","title":"Aspen, birch and spruce are characteristic of this region","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["554728","554739","554718","554715","554735","557821","550602","555217","557127","557159","555133","554738","557822","554425","546090","555216"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","season","tree","evergreens","lineup","birch","fir","undulation","warm","layer"]}
