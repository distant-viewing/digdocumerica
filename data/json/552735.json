{"path":"552735.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a dense and expansive cemetery. The cemetery consists of numerous white tombstones, tightly spaced and aligned in neat rows that cover the entire visible landscape. Each tombstone appears similar in shape and size, creating a visually repetitive texture across the area.\n\nBeyond the boundaries of the cemetery, residential areas can be seen. These areas feature houses with various architectural designs, surrounded by trees and typical suburban landscaping. The contrast between the crowded, monochromatic cemetery and the colorful, dispersed residential homes is striking.\n\nThe overall composition presents a juxtaposition between the serenity and uniformity of the cemetery versus the vibrant and varied living areas, possibly stirring a reflection on themes of life and mortality. The image, due to its vantage point, offers a broad perspective, emphasizing the vastness and orderly arrangement of the cemetery.","title":"Philadelphia suburb and cemetery","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557184","550364","546147","554792","550731","552017","554790","548239","547420","544267","557942","545322","554824","547417","547801","557089"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["cemetery","tombstone","uniformity","landscaping","serenity","living","boundary","vantage","arrangement","vastness"]}
