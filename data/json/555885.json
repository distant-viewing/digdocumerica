{"path":"555885.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast, arid landscape, primarily dominated by a barren, rocky terrain that extends towards the horizon. The ground is covered with uneven, rough textures, likely volcanic rock or dried lava, displaying variations in color from dark brown to black. There are patches of sparse vegetation scattered across the rocky surface, which add a touch of green to the otherwise monochromatic scene. \n\nIn the background, the landscape gradually transitions into a flatter, smoother area, which appears to be a dry lakebed or salt flat, distinguished by its lighter, beige coloration. This lighter area starkly contrasts with the darker, rugged foreground. The horizon is clear, showcasing a broad, open sky that has a faint gradient from a light blue at the top, suggesting a calm, clear day.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the desolation and expansive nature of the terrain, likely highlighting geographic or geological features significant to the area. The absence of any human presence or modern structures reinforces the remote and untouched character of the scene.","title":"Disposal site after some 1,200,000 gallons of liquid sludge which had been treated and then spread out and mixed with earth this was to be monitored for a year under an agreement between epa and Utah state university.
