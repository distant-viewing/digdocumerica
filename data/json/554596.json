{"path":"554596.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape featuring a close-up of a large, dark boulder on the right side of the image with foliage in the foreground. A younger, smaller plant with bright green leaves is illuminated by sunlight, creating a vibrant contrast against the dark shadow cast by the boulder. The leaves appear delicate and are almost translucent in the light.\n\nIn the background, the outlines of distant hills or mountains can be seen under a soft, hazy sky that suggests either early morning or late afternoon light. The colors in the background are muted, mainly blues and grays, which enhance the depth of the landscape and provide a calm, tranquil atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground around the plant and rock is covered in what appears to be dry, wiry grass and small patches of other low-ground cover, indicating a rugged terrain. The overall composition of the image focuses on the interplay of light and shadow, with an emphasis on the natural beauty and quiet solitude of this mountainous scene.","title":"Dwarf paper birch (Betula papyrifera), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544440","544435","547635","558083","554572","545724","555592","555589","553135","549228","552900","545703","552445","549151","544887","544392"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boulder","leave","plant","close","emphasis","up","gray","light","outline","interplay"]}
