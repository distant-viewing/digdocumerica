{"path":"548249.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque marine scene. In the foreground, a weathered wooden dock is visible, featuring several loosely arranged planks and ropes, adding a rustic charm to the image. Positioned slightly off-center in the middle of the image is a man paddling a small canoe. He wears a cap and is actively using an oar, moving the canoe through the calm water.\n\nThe middle ground of the image showcases several boats moored in the harbor. These boats vary in size, from small to larger fishing vessels, painted in predominantly white hues with details in red and black. The boats are tranquil on the water, reflecting gently in the smooth surface of the harbor.\n\nIn the background, a charming village provides a quaint backdrop. This village features various buildings, including houses and possibly small local businesses, with architecture typical of a coastal town. Notable among the structures is a steeple, perhaps part of a church, rising above the rest, accompanied by trees that intersperse the buildings.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful, evoking a sense of quiet daily life in a coastal community. The composition, with its clear foreground, middle ground, and background, draws the viewer's eye through the scene, while the soft lighting, likely of either early morning or late afternoon, enhances the mood of tranquility.","title":"Rockport lobsterman paddles out to his boat to begin day's work.","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["542877","542907","542872","548235","546998","542876","542905","542903","548247","543358","542910","547556","547965","554101","544266","548763"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["village","canoe","harbor","boat","oar","steeple","paddle","accompany","church","moor"]}
