{"path":"557637.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"In the photograph, a young person and a medium-sized dog are featured sitting together on a concrete step just outside a doorway. The scene is framed against a portion of a building's exterior, providing a simple white stucco and doorway background. The door behind them has a metal screen, framed by plainly painted white door jambs.\n\nThe person, appearing to be a young male, is dressed casually in a loose-fitting dark sweater and knee-length shorts with vertical stripes. He is wearing lace-up boots. His expression is calm, and he has short black hair, decorated with a hairband and complemented by a necklace. The youth is seated in a semi-crouching position, with one hand gently placed on the dog.\n\nThe dog, showing relaxed and friendly demeanor, has a tan coat and perked ears. He is looking directly towards the camera, his mouth slightly open, as if he is mid-pant, suggesting a warm climate or recent activity. One of the dog's paws gently rests over the young person's leg, indicating familiarity and ease around him.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of companionship and simplicity, evoking a sense of serenity and everyday life. The composition focuses on the relationship and bond between the dog and the young person, highlighted within the urban setting indicated by the style and materials of the building.","title":"Boy with his dog in Galveston, Texas. This is one of a series of 21 black and white photographs. They document the environments remaining from the 19th century in terms of architecture, commerce, and lifestyles. The pictures also compare the contemporary city, showing displacement of the unique by the ordinary, and noting current urban problems. The pictures show a region and its uniqueness in people and architecture in East Texas, which is still a part of the South.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554126","556421","556549","555929","553089","543780","553481","554951","556171","558189","551123","556529","553546","542874","543031","547106"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["dog","doorway","person","stucco","bond","familiarity","door","ease","lace","screen"]}
