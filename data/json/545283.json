{"path":"545283.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a natural landscape viewed from a shadowed foreground through leafy silhouettes to a brightly lit, clear-cut area on a forested hillside. In the forefront, the scene is framed by the edges of tree leaves and branches, creating a natural vignette around the central vista. The leafy fringes are dark, suggesting that the picture is taken from a concealed, shaded spot, possibly under the canopy of a forest.\n\nIn the middle ground, to the left, there is a rustic wooden fence running parallel to the viewer’s line of sight. This fence appears to be made of rough wooden poles supported by thinner diagonal bracing poles. Beyond the fence, lush green bushes and smaller trees densely populate the area, increasing the depth and wild character of the scene.\n\nThe central and most striking feature of the image is the clear-cut swath on the hillside across the middle of the view. This area presents a stark contrast to the surrounding dense greenery, with its bare earth and scattered remnants of felled trees—a visual testament to logging or similar forestry activity. The light brown and somewhat barren terrain of this cleared section sharply divides the otherwise rich, verdant forest landscape.\n\nIn the immediate background, the hill slopes upward, densely covered by conifer trees until it reaches the crest, where the tree line meets a clear, light blue sky. The overall lighting suggests it might be late morning or afternoon, given the bright illumination on the clear-cut hillside and the clear sky.\n\nThis photograph, with its combined elements of lush forest, human-altered landscape, and rustic fence, illustrates the interplay between natural beauty and human impact within a woodland environment.","title":"A clear-cut and burned-over hillside.
