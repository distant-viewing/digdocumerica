{"path":"544196.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a young boy swimming in a body of murky water, possibly a river or a lake. He is positioned halfway in the water, with his head, shoulders, and part of his back visible above the surface. The boy's expression is calm, and he is gazing off to the side, not directly at the camera.\n\nThe water has a brownish hue and there are gentle ripples around him indicating mild water movement. The shore, visible in the foreground, is muddy and appears soft and wet, with a few small stones scattered about. The background of the water body shows similar texture and color, suggesting it's a relatively still water environment.\n\nOverall, the lighting is natural, likely outdoor daylight, casting visible but soft shadows and highlights on the boy's skin and the water's surface. The picture evokes a serene, though somewhat solitary, mood of a child engaging with a simple, natural activity. The overall composition focuses on the boy, with ample space around him that emphasizes his interaction with the water and the peacefulness of the setting.","title":"Lake Pontchartrain has been declared polluted - but it does not deter young swimmers.","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["553430","545539","548835","543689","544218","551022","549103","548837","548842","553429","551160","550830","544347","544303","544351","548844"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","water","peacefulness","skin","swim","shoulder","gaze","daylight","surface","ripple"]}
