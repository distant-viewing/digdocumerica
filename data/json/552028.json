{"path":"552028.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling marina scene, densely packed with various types of boats. Many of these vessels are cabin cruisers, suggesting a location popular for leisure boating rather than commercial fishing. The boats appear neatly organized in rows, tied securely to the floating docks that crisscross the water.\n\nEach boat features different designs and sizes, mostly covered with canvas canopies or permanent roof structures, likely to protect against weather elements. The hues of the boats are mostly white, with accents of blue, brown, and red on some. You can also see different boat names displayed prominently on the stern of a few vessels.\n\nThe only visible person in the image is standing dockside near the center, dressed casually, possibly engaging in maintenance or preparing for a voyage. The scene suggests a clear day as the water is calm and reflects a bit of the surrounding light and objects.\n\nAround and between the boats, the water surface is visible, showing reflections of masts and other upper parts of the boats. This crowded yet orderly arrangement indicates a popular marina, optimized for space but well maintained, offering a glimpse into the leisurely nautical life.","title":"Marina on the niagara river provides recreation but is also a source of pollution in the form of oils and wastes","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552027","542912","542871","546853","546877","548078","542650","557450","548075","546388","548547","548969","542902","546935","545155","548543"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","vessel","cruiser","optimize","stern","canvas","mast","crisscross","accent"]}
