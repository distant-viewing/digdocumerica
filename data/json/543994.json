{"path":"543994.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a lake surrounded by hilly terrain. The image mainly showcases several sailing boats and motorboats on the water, engaging in recreational activities. The focal points are the sailboats which have striking striped sails, primarily in white and blue colors. The largest sailboat in the foreground has a noticeable sail number \"1451.\" Each sailboat appears to be in motion, possibly racing or casually maneuvering through the water.\n\nIn addition to the sailboats, there are motorboats visible in the scene. Some can be seen pulling smaller boats or floating alongside other sailboats, suggesting a collaborative or supportive role perhaps in a racing or training context. On the lower left side of the image, a group of individuals can be observed on a small strip of land or makeshift jetty extending into the lake, engaged in activities possibly related to launching or retrieving a boat.\n\nThe background features a tranquil, natural landscape with rolling hills. These hills give a serene backdrop to the lake, emphasizing the leisurely and peaceful aspect of the environment. The water's surface is textured, indicating a gentle breeze which would be ideal for sailing. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the boats and the scenic natural surroundings, paints a picture of an active yet relaxing day at the lake, enjoyed by enthusiasts of water sports and nature alike.","title":"Arizona--Lake Pleasant Dam","placename":"Pleasant, Lake (Ariz.)","location":"Pleasant, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["544021","543936","548555","547781","547757","547754","552355","548204","548058","544669","543945","549425","549082","543941","548513","557416"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","lake","motorboat","boat","sail","training","racing","enthusiast","jetty","addition"]}
