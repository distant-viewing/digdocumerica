{"path":"555671.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling, picturesque landscape with no people visible. The setting features rolling hills that are covered in lush green vegetation, indicative of a highland or mountainous area. Small patches of the terrain have darker, exposed soil and rocks. The topography is uneven with some areas more elevated, showing gentle slopes and ridges.\n\nIn the foreground, the vegetation is thicker, displaying varieties of shrubs and possibly small plants that create a dense green carpet. Gradually, the landscape opens up to reveal boulders and scattered rocks interspersed among the greenery as the terrain rolls into the distance.\n\nThe horizon is defined by the rising and falling contours of the hills under a wide sky. The sky is light with scattered clouds, suggesting a fair weather day with plenty of sunlight illuminating the landscape, enhancing the vividness of the natural colors.\n\nOverall, the composition and natural lighting of the image provide a sense of open, tranquil wilderness, inviting exploration or simply appreciation from afar. The scene conveys a quiet and untouched natural environment, typical of remote, scenic highlands.","title":"The pipeline's crest at thomson pass, looking south towards the crest of the ridgeline.
