{"path":"544032.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph presents a welcome sign for Phoenix, situated along a dusty, unpaved road set in a sparse desert landscape. The sign reads \"Welcome to PHOENIX Population 620,000\" and features a logo with a bird, possibly a phoenix, below this text. A smaller sign underneath requests drivers to \"Please Drive Carefully,\" attributed to the Traffic Engineering Department.\n\nThe road itself is composed of loose, sandy material and appears scarcely traveled, with tire tracks visible heading into the distance. Power lines run parallel to the road on the left, suggesting some infrastructure despite the otherwise barren surroundings. The background shows a wide, open sky with few clouds and some distant mountains, enhancing the sense of a remote, arid environment.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a rustic, somewhat desolate entry into a large city, contrasting the significant population with the rural access point depicted in the image.","title":"Approaching Phoenix","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544023","544182","544017","549067","544043","544136","553017","545620","549163","553723","553124","545824","548887","544145","544400","544024"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["attribute","population","road","entry","sign","welcome","drive","driver","tire","bird"]}
