{"path":"557641.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential street scene, showcasing a large, traditional two-story house with features characteristic of Southern architecture, possibly from the late 19th or early 20th century. The house has a symmetrical front facade with a central entryway framed by sidelights and transom windows, flanked by sash windows. A spacious front porch with columns and a balcony above serves as a notable feature of the house. The house's siding is clapboard, and it has a pitched roof with dormer windows.\n\nIn front of the house, there's a large, mature tree, which appears to be an oak, suggesting a setting in a region like the Southern United States. The tree’s roots are exposed and extensive, indicating its age and the possible soil erosion or landscaping changes around it.\n\nThe scene includes several people depicted in various activities, enhancing the residential, communal feel. On the left, near a parked car (which also appears to be from the mid-20th century), a man stands leaning against the car, seemingly engaged in conversation or waiting. Nearby on the cleared ground under the tree, another individual sits passively by a log, suggesting a moment of rest perhaps after doing some yard work.\n\nOn the house’s porch, a child sits on the steps, while another person stands near the porch railing, contributing to the casual, everyday life atmosphere of the setting.\n\nTwo more individuals are shown on the sidewalk; one is leaning against the tree, and another sits on the curb, both positioned as if they are taking a break or simply enjoying a quiet moment outside.\n\nThe general atmosphere evoked by the image is one of a laid-back, close-knit community. The residential setting, combined with the presence and activities of multiple people, paints a picture of a typical day in a quiet neighborhood, possibly from a bygone era given the vintage of the car and the style of the clothing worn by the people. The overall tone is tranquil and somewhat nostalgic, with the architecture and the mature landscaping hinting at the history and established nature of the neighborhood.","title":"Houses and trees in the Fifth Ward of Houston, Texas. This is one of a series of 21 black and white photographs. They document the environments remaining from the 19th century in terms of architecture, commerce and lifestyles. The pictures also compare the contemporary city showing displacement of the unique by the ordinary and noting current urban problems. The pictures show a region and its uniqueness in people and architecture in East Texas which is still a part of the South.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557286","557094","551109","558110","546441","550120","551119","558155","550121","553550","550125","555905","546439","557638","557076","550117"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","porch","landscaping","sit","neighborhood","oak","19th","lean","car","window"]}
