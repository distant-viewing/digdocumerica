{"path":"549468.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of Niagara Falls, showcasing both the American Falls and the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, separated by Goat Island. The American side of the falls, to the left in the image, features a clear view of the cascading water and the adjacent development, including buildings, roads, and parking areas. Goat Island, lush and tree-covered, divides the two falls and leads into the larger, more curved Horseshoe Falls on the right, which partially belong to Canada.\n\nIn the background, the urban landscape of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is visible with its more dense development including taller buildings and a noticeable large, dome-shaped structure, likely a venue or public area. The river below the falls is tumultuous and frothy, continuing downstream beyond the image frame. The vivid greenery surrounding the waterfalls contrasts with the urban development and highlights the natural beauty and power of the falls. The photograph provides a comprehensive view of this significant natural landmark and the surrounding human impact and infrastructure.","title":"American Niagara Falls seen from the air.
