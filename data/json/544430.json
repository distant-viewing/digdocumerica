{"path":"544430.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph features a striking contrast between industrial activity and natural landscape. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a dry, arid landscape with sparse vegetation. A child, wearing a striped outfit, is observing a small herd of goats grazing in the field. The childâ€™s presence adds a human element, portraying a moment of interaction between a young individual and nature.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's a body of water, likely a man-made reservoir, that reflects a turquoise blue hue against the arid surroundings.\n\nBeyond the water, the background is dominated by an industrial complex. Several large structures, possibly factories or processing plants, are visible, characterized by their metallic frameworks and several large chimneys releasing plumes of smoke into the sky. The industrial setting suggests a stark contrast to the peaceful, nature-oriented scene in the foreground, highlighting themes of environmental impact and the encroachment of industrial development into natural landscapes.\n\nThis juxtaposition creates a powerful narrative about the coexistence of industry and nature, as well as the environmental tensions that may arise from such proximities.","title":"Separated here only by a narrow strip of water, the Four Corners Power Plant and a Navajo sheep herder represent two worlds.","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553842","544039","545013","550995","545989","545988","545112","551519","546073","548194","549220","546398","550899","550857","546056","543009"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["goat","herd","reservoir","child","encroachment","tension","nature","coexistence","proximity","plume"]}
