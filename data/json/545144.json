{"path":"545144.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showing a rural landscape with multiple features. At the center and bottom of the image, there are sections of a winding river with visible sandy banks, likely indicating low water levels. Adjacent to the river are large open areas that appear to be under some form of excavation or clearing, with piles of soil or sand and open bare land.\n\nTowards the left and bottom of the photograph, a road curves around, bordered by cultivated fields or pastureland that are deep green in color, possibly indicating agricultural activity. Several small structures, which might be residential or farm buildings, are visible alongside the road. These buildings are equipped with what look like driveways and are surrounded by vegetation and smaller fields or gardens.\n\nIn the background, dense forests stretch across the top half of the image, signaling a heavily wooded area surrounding the clearing and river. The overall setting suggests a mix of agricultural, residential, and possibly industrial (related to excavation or sand mining) activities taking place in a rural or semi-rural environment.\n\nThe photo is taken from a high vantage point and shouts in natural light, likely during the day given the shadows and illumination of the landscape. The quality and style suggest it might be a relatively older photograph, noticeable from the film grain and color saturation which gives it a dated feel.","title":"Small lumber mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543767","556964","553668","550392","549260","550623","548943","550393","550534","547227","556981","542730","547995","544607","544438","550540"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["clearing","excavation","sand","bottom","river","driveway","grain","field","saturation","half"]}
