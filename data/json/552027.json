{"path":"552027.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy marina filled with numerous boats. The boats, which are densely packed along the docks, vary in size, design, and color, but primarily seem to be small to medium-sized pleasure boats, many having white coverings or tops. Some of the boats have blue or gray canvases sheltering their decks.\n\nThe marina consists of rows of wooden docks that stretch between the moored boats. Each dock appears to have utilities such as power hookups, and there are many ropes seen tying the boats to the docks.\n\nIn the background, there are various industrial structures including warehouse-like buildings. There's a cluttered appearance due to the assortment of boats and the backdrop of industrial infrastructure, suggesting this may be a working or commercial marina, possibly near a city or industrial area.\n\nOverall, the scene is bustling with maritime activity, though no people are visible, conveying the focus solely on the boats and marine environment. The photograph captures a dynamic yet static snapshot of nautical life, emphasizing the density and variety of boats within this particular marina setting.","title":"Marina on the Niagara River provides recreation but is also a source of pollution in the form of oils and wastes.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552028","542871","542912","548075","546877","542650","548078","546853","548547","548969","557450","548543","542902","556191","546388","545155"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","dock","covering","canvas","pleasure","shelter","assortment","moor","warehouse"]}
