{"path":"553157.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman walking outdoors during daytime. She is featured in profile view, taking a step forward. The subject has long, flowing hair and is dressed in a casual, 1970s-inspired outfit consisting of a light-colored denim jacket and dark blue flared jeans. She is wearing simple, tan shoes. Her right hand is raised to her face, and she appears to be either biting her nails or touching her lips thoughtfully.\n\nThe setting is an urban area, indicated by the concrete structures around her. She is walking along a concrete path bordered by a low, solid concrete wall. Behind her, there is a backdrop of dense, lush green foliage which contrasts with a distant dark-colored building, partially visible through the trees. The lighting is natural, casting soft shadows and highlighting her figure and the texture of the concrete structures around her. The photograph has a candid, spontaneous quality, capturing a moment of everyday life with a distinct vintage feel.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: on the overhead walkway","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["554270","557039","553156","557114","549916","553191","544747","549888","556765","553165","551448","551824","551821","552401","551723","546493"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["lip","daytime","denim","shoe","step","outfit","jean","1970","subject","path"]}
