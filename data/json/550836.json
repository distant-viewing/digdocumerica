{"path":"550836.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, somewhat moody scene set along a roadside next to a body of water. In the foreground and to the left, a detailed view of a sturdy bridge railing leads the eye through the image. This railing, composed of bold, squared balusters topped with a rounded handrail, bears a repetition that draws attention. Reflections and portions of the railing can be seen in the calm water to the right, adding a touch of shimmer and depth to the scene.\n\nTwo children are stationed on the bridge. The closer child, standing upright and facing towards the road, is peering intently over the railing, perhaps at something in the water or on the opposite shore. This child is wearing a horizontally striped t-shirt with multiple colors and shorts, a casual and typical outfit for a warm day outside. A second child, partially obscured and further down the bridge, is engaged in a similar activity, looking out over the railing.\n\nThe road next to the children stretches back into the distance, bordered by lush greenery on both sides, hinting at a rural or less urbanized area. The eye follows the road as it disappears into a vanishing point, shrouded by the haze of the distance and the canopy of trees overhead, which injects a sense of tranquility and isolation into the composition. The overall atmosphere is quiet and contemplative, emphasized by the natural lighting and the deep shadows cast across the bridge and the road.","title":"Dirt road crosses the Fox River in rural stretch of its course toward Lake Winnebago.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544542","558005","557969","555730","543087","553914","558015","557096","544302","552064","551527","547669","548064","552846","557970","552598"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["railing","child","bridge","road","repetition","shimmer","handrail","eye","roadside","t"]}
