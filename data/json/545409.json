{"path":"545409.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of an elderly man wearing a nasal cannula, which is a device used to deliver supplemental oxygen or increased airflow to a patient in need of respiratory help. The man has a bald head and expressive features, with deep-set eyes and noticeable wrinkles, indicating advanced age. His expression is serious, and he is looking directly at the camera, making the viewer engage directly with his gaze.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a large green oxygen tank, suggesting that the man requires constant medical support for his breathing. The background is a warm, earthy color, contrasting with the pale blue shirt the man is wearing, which has a soft collar.\n\nThe composition of the photo draws attention primarily to the man's face, highlighting his expression and the medical apparatus assisting him. The proximity of the camera conveys a sense of intimacy and the personal struggle of the subject.","title":"Mr. Robert B.
