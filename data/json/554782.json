{"path":"554782.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic scene centered around a large, weathered barn. The barn, which is the main focal point, appears aged with its wood siding showing signs of wear and discoloration typical of long exposure to the elements. Its traditional gambrel roof, characteristic of many barns, dominates the upper portion of the image.\n\nIn front of the barn, there is a dirt road that curves slightly as it leads away from the viewer, adding a sense of depth and inviting one to imagine where it might lead. This road is bordered by overgrown grasses and bushes, suggesting that the area is not frequently maintained.\n\nTo the left of the barn, a utility pole and thin wire lines are visible, intersecting the natural and man-made elements; this introduces a layer of the modern influence on this otherwise timeless rural setting. Trees with bare branches suggest that the photo was taken in late fall or winter. The background features a clear blue sky and hints of a field or open land under a soft, natural light, contributing to the tranquil and somewhat neglected atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a sense of quietude and abandonment, with a strong emphasis on the textures and forms of the natural and built environment.","title":"This barn was abandoned when the family sold out to the hanna coal company in 1972.
