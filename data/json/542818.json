{"path":"542818.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features an imposing Victorian-style mansion remarkable for its complex architectural details and vibrant colors. The structure boasts multiple stories, with a steeply pitched roof adorned with various spires and pinnacles. Prominently, the top of the mansion features a striking asymmetrical tower with a conical roof and what appears to be a clock face. The facade of the house is richly decorated with ornate wooden trim, gingerbread fretwork, scalloped shingles, and vibrantly colored panels. The multitude of windows ranges from large bay windows to smaller, intricate stained glass sections.\n\nIn front of the mansion, there is a meticulously maintained garden, characterized by symmetrically trimmed spherical shrubs and a well-manicured lawn. A central path, likely paved, leads up to the front porch of the home, passing through an ornamental gate flanked by wrought iron fences. The garden is serene, adding a touch of elegance and order to the elaborate nature of the architecture.\n\nThe environment suggests a clear, sunny day with a deep blue sky, providing a bright backdrop that contrasts sharply with the rich colors of the mansion and the lush green of the garden. This setting emphasizes the immaculate condition and fairy-tale quality of the property. There are no visible people in the image, which contributes to a tranquil and untouched atmosphere of the scene.","title":"California--Eureka","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["542816","558150","555578","548659","558159","557067","542967","557069","558152","555579","558156","557077","557071","557092","548662","548667"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["garden","elegance","order","gate","multitude","clock","shingle","spire","iron","roof"]}
