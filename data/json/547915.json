{"path":"547915.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of an assortment of broken glass pieces scattered across a sandy or gritty surface. The pieces of glass vary in color, including shades of green, brown, white, and clear. These shards are interspersed with small stones, bits of debris, and at least one visible bird feather. The feather, positioned roughly centrally in the image, is thin and light-colored, likely from a small bird. There is no specific organization to the arrangement of the materials, suggesting they were dispersed randomly. This type of scene might be found in areas where refuse or glass objects have been broken and left unattended, possibly near a beach or an abandoned lot. The ground is mostly earth-toned, enhancing the contrast of the glass pieces which stand out due to their varied hues and translucent qualities. There is no presence of people or animals in the immediate view, giving the scene a sense of abandonment and decay.","title":"Glass on sand at Breezy Point near Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548041","548045","543698","547039","547947","542974","543165","546241","544587","544583","549774","544640","547971","544468","548753","544648"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["glass","feather","piece","bird","organization","assortment","bit","lot","abandonment","arrangement"]}
