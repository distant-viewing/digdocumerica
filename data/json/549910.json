{"path":"549910.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a dock, where several activities are taking place among different groups of people. Prominent in the foreground is a person seated on a bench, apparently intently examining something, possibly a camera or a small object in his hands. To the left of this individual, a young woman in a light blue dress walks towards the foreground of the image, and there's another woman in blue jeans and yellow top, with a small bag over her shoulder, engaged in eating something. Another woman, wearing a yellow shirt and blue jeans, is slightly bent as she walks by.\n\nThe middle ground is bustling with a crowd gathered around the entrance of a large tour boat, labeled \"Circle Line\" at the top. This boat has two visible levels and an American flag is flying from a flagpole on top. The boat is docked, and many people are either waiting to board or have just disembarked.\n\nThe background shows a broad, open expanse of water, hinting at a coastal location. There's a clear sky with minimal clouds and a hint of an urban skyline can be seen in the distant background. The overall atmosphere is lively and casual, suitable for an outing or tourist expedition, with people dressed comfortably for a day out by the water. The setting and the presence of the \"Circle Line\" boat suggest this may be a popular location for sightseeing cruises.","title":"Battery park waterfront, lower Manhattan.
