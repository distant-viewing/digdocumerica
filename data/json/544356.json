{"path":"544356.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts an intimate, domestic scene inside a cozy, dimly lit kitchen. There are several children and an adult visible, engaging in various activities that convey a casual, everyday family environment.\n\nOn the left side of the image, an adult woman with black hair wearing a blue shirt is seated at a wooden table, interacting with a young child in a yellow shirt who appears to be drawing or writing on a piece of paper. The table is cluttered with various items including a coffee mug, a large white jug, some books, and other miscellaneous objects.\n\nOn the right side of the image, two young children are seen. One child, who is standing and wearing a light-colored, stained tunic, is turned away looking over the barrier of a wooden crib or playpen. Another child, partially visible inside the crib, looks up towards the other child, suggesting interaction or play between the two.\n\nThe warm and somewhat dark ambiance is accentuated by natural light coming through a window near the center, which also appears to show an exterior structure or another building close by. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of a lived-in, bustling household atmosphere, with a touch of warmth and familial bond.","title":"An above average, privately-owned home in the Navajo Nation.
