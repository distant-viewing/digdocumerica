{"path":"547007.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a man, likely middle-aged, appearing pensive or focused. He wears a red shirt with a collar, beneath which a white undershirt can be seen. He also wears a grayish cap slightly tattered at the brim. Key features such as his facial expression and the cigar in his mouth draw attention. The cigar, partly smoked, sits firmly at the corner of his lips. His gaze is not directed towards the camera, looking slightly downward instead, giving him a contemplative or introspective demeanor.\n\nThe man's skin is marked by small wrinkles and blemishes, indicating maturity and possibly an outdoor lifestyle. His facial expression combined with the prominent cigar and attire suggests a persona that has experienced a lot, potentially reflective of someone who has worked hard or spent a lot of time outdoors.\n\nThe background is blurred but one can discern a portion of a vehicle (perhaps a truck or van) in muted colors, indicating that this scene might be taking place in an industrial or work environment. The focus on the man with the softly blurred background emphasizes his presence and might evoke a sense of solitude or depth in his character. The overall composition places the man squarely in the center, making him the unmistakable subject of the image, while the depth of field and lighting draw attention to his facial features and the texture of his attire.","title":"Andrew Kidd, head of the oyster co-op in Blufton","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547028","554858","549054","555529","548251","543713","546636","556563","552103","556443","547329","557035","556478","552872","548236","548218"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["lot","maturity","brim","lip","wrinkle","man","collar","lifestyle","van","attention"]}
