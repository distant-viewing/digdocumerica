{"path":"554216.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a ski resort with a focus on a cozy food vendor styled as a vintage tram. The tram is predominantly wooden with details in black and has a sign displaying \"Hot Dogs,\" \"Popcorn\" among other items. Fresh snow rests on its roof, indicating recent snowfall.\n\nSurrounding the tram, a group of people, predominantly adults with a few children, are either queuing for food or socializing nearby. The individuals are dressed in winter gear suitable for skiing, including colorful ski jackets, pants, and some with helmets or hats.\n\nThe setting is a snowy landscape, brightly illuminated under a clear blue sky. In the background, low hills or mountains can be seen, stark and treeless at the horizon. Several other tents and flags are faintly visible in the background, suggesting a larger gathering or event taking place at the resort. The ground is thick with snow, reflecting the bright sunlight.","title":"Popcorn wagon at snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554269","554218","554237","554238","554235","554221","554273","554279","554240","554282","554277","554275","554267","554234","550017","554245"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["tram","resort","food","snow","socialize","skiing","snowfall","ski","vendor","tent"]}
