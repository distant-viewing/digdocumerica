{"path":"557858.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a car garage or automotive service shop. The image has a nostalgic feel with its slightly faded colors and the style of the cars and garage equipment suggesting it could be from the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two classic cars, one occupying the left side of the frame with its hood open, revealing the engine compartment. An adult man is bent over, peering into the engine we cannot see. He is dressed casually in a light-colored short-sleeve shirt and dark pants and appears to be a mechanic inspecting or repairing the car.\n\nThe other car is partially visible on the right side of the image. Its headlights and part of the grille are visible, but the rest is out of the frame. On the floor near this second car is a hubcap and a wrench, suggesting recent or ongoing maintenance work.\n\nIn the background, another man stands beside a large piece of machinery, possibly diagnostic or air equipment, facing away from the camera and looking at some controls. Like the first man, he also wears a casual outfit with darker tones. He seems to be another worker attending to the garage equipment.\n\nThe garage itself has green walls with a series of gauges, hoses, and other wall-mounted devices that are typical in an automotive workshop. The floor is marked with yellow and black safety stripes around a work area, which could be for vehicle alignment or another specific service.","title":"Because this motorist's car had failed the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions test a second time, a public works department employee looks under the hood to see if he can locate the problem. The owner and another employee look at the readings on the exhaust analyzer in the background at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. All Hamilton County light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be certified annually. The employee was unable to pinpoint the problem.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557885","542763","553490","557853","557906","557852","557889","557905","546632","557860","557911","557915","557864","557833","557870","557861"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","car","engine","equipment","service","floor","mechanic","alignment","grille","gauge"]}
