{"path":"545445.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph is an industrial scene capturing a facility that appears to be a steel mill or similar type of manufacturing complex. Prominent features include large buildings with dark exteriors, some showing visible wear and aging. On the left, there is a massive structure with many rectangular openings allowing light into the building, with thick, billowing smoke being emitted from several tall smokestacks, suggesting the operation of heavy machinery or furnaces inside.\n\nThe smoke varies in color, primarily hues of orange and gray, filling the upper portion of the sky and creating a dramatic and somewhat ominous atmosphere. To the right, there are multiple additional industrial buildings with peaked roofs, and these structures show signs of significant wear and weathering, painting a picture of an old, well-used facility.\n\nIn the foreground, there are railway tracks, indicating the transportation of goods or raw materials to and from the site. There are no visible people in the scene, which focuses more on the industrial environment and its operations. The overall tone of the image, enhanced by the muted lighting and clouded sky, adds a somber, gritty feel to the scene, typical of industrial areas from past decades.","title":"U.S. steel plant emits red-orange smoke 24 hours a day","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["549967","545503","550195","545434","550328","546884","542999","550982","550344","545447","557215","545507","546908","550983","545446","557375"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["wear","furnace","smoke","operation","facility","mill","aging","weathering","opening","good"]}
