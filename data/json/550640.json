{"path":"550640.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a coastal or lakeside region set in a mountainous area. The body of water, which occupies the foreground and stretches into the middle of the frame, appears large and gently curves around a narrow strip of land. A prominently visible peninsula or spit is covered in dense trees and juts into the lake.\n\nSurrounding the water are rugged mountains with sharp peaks, some of which are capped with snow. The slopes are green, indicating vegetative growth, possibly during a warmer season. Multiple small, white streaks on the mountains suggest the presence of streams or residual snow patches.\n\nOn the left side near the coast, there is a small area with visible human activity, including a few buildings and roads, suggesting a small community or settlement. The area directly around the community is somewhat cleared but still surrounded by dense natural vegetation, typical of a remote or less urbanized area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its sweeping scenery, lush greenery, and serene water, invokes a sense of natural beauty and tranquility, typical of a remote, naturally preserved location. This setting could be suitable for activities like hiking, wildlife observation, or simply as a scenic retreat.","title":"Pipeline terminal.  View south to the site of former ft.
