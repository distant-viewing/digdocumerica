{"path":"554544.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of land development or preparation in a wooded area. In the foreground, an individual, wearing a hard hat, rides atop a large yellow bulldozer with a prominent blade at the front. The bulldozer is moving on muddy, uneven terrain that exhibits deep tire tracks, suggesting recent activity. \n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a layer of mixed debris primarily consisting of mounded soil, discarded vegetation, and some scattered, unidentifiable objects, giving an impression of a clearing operation. The background features dense trees, indicative of a forested region, and the sky is overcast, lending a muted, gray tone to the overall lighting in the image.\n\nThe environment suggests active construction or large-scale land clearing, potentially for development purposes. The presence of a single worker and machinery highlights human interaction with natural landscapes in industrial or developmental contexts. The image captures a moment of transformation and the rugged nature of such operations.","title":"Bulldozer operator at big moose, dump covering trash in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545665","545652","546950","551947","543105","553619","555601","547000","556456","545950","547254","543114","543107","543760","545662","542614"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bulldozer","clearing","development","transformation","blade","land","operation","preparation","tire","ride"]}
