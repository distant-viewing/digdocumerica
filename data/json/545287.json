{"path":"545287.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two women cycling on a sun-dappled road. They are surrounded by a dense forest setting, likely during a warm season judging by the sunshine and greenery. The road is narrow and appears to be made of asphalt, curving slightly to the right in the image.\n\nThe woman on the left, numbered 13, is energetically leading and wearing a white shirt, shorts, and a safety helmet. She is pedaling enthusiastically and appears to be smiling or talking as she looks back towards the other cyclist. The second woman, following closely, is wearing a red tank top, shorts, and also a safety helmet. Both cyclists are on road bikes, each carrying a water bottle on their bike's frame, indicating they are possibly on a long ride.\n\nThere are shadows of leaves on the road, overlaid with the sharp shadows of what seems to be the tree branches, perhaps from a nearby tree or the foliage overhead. The photograph communicates a sense of motion and leisure, perhaps capturing a moment from a recreational or fitness activity in a serene natural setting. The lighting and the shadows create a lively, dynamic atmosphere.","title":"Bicyclists on San Juan Island","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552340","550084","550069","548573","555499","551303","551545","555500","553908","550689","543719","548574","545282","552892","557990","547209"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cyclist","bike","road","helmet","safety","short","woman","sunshine","shadow","asphalt"]}
