{"path":"546040.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, heavily rusted ship as the central subject, positioned quite close to the camera on the water. The visible side of the ship's hull shows significant weathering and rusting, with flaking paint and areas where the bare metal is exposed. The hull is predominantly red with patches of gray and white paint.\n\nOn the ship, there are several visible crew members involved in various activities. On the upper deck, near the ship's structure that includes a small deckhouse with a rounded roof and a chimney, there are at least three crew members. One is looking directly towards the photographer, and the others appear to be engaged in tasks possibly related to navigating or managing the ship.\n\nThe ship is equipped with ladders along its side, suggesting maintenance or operational functionality. The environment around the ship features calm, muddy waters that indicate a river or an estuary rather than open sea. Above the ship, the sky is clear and the daylight suggests it's either morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of active maritime work on a robust, albeit aging, vessel conveying a sense of rugged maritime industry. No lands or other objects are visible in the background, placing the entire focus on the ship and its immediate surroundings on the water.","title":"Oil spews from a damaged Liberian oil tanker (the Naess Mariner) after it collided with a barge on the Mississippi River.","placename":"Kenner (La.)","location":"Kenner, Louisiana","nn1":["549618","549590","552149","548201","544657","547056","552148","551581","546012","550891","546858","549591","544234","555799","549617","549365"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","crew","member","hull","paint","photographer","ladder","aging","weathering","functionality"]}
