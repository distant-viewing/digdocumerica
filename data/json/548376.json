{"path":"548376.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial area, characterized by heavy smoke emissions and architectural complexity. The most dominant features in the image are three tall, slender smokestacks, from which thick, white smoke is billowing and dispersing into the surrounding air. These smokestacks are attached to a large, light-colored building structure that appears to be an industrial plant, possibly a power-generating station or a factory. \n\nThe surrounding buildings vary in size and purpose, with some large cylindrical storage tanks and flat-roofed buildings that suggest a mix of storage and processing facilities. The area appears densely packed with industrial facilities, signifying a zone heavily dedicated to industrial or manufacturing operations.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, the rooftops of some buildings can be seen, equipped with various mechanical units, possibly for ventilation. The color palette of the environment is quite muted, with tones of beige, gray, and faded blues. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the picture is one of heavy industrial activity, possibly suggesting themes of pollution, energy production, or urban industrial landscapes.\n\nThe image, taken from a high vantage point, captures the sprawling nature of industrial activity and its environmental impact, represented by the ongoing emission of smoke into the atmosphere. There are no visible natural elements like vegetation or water bodies, intensifying the industrial feel of the scene.","title":"Consolidated Edison plant in Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544495","550981","551567","546908","548336","550329","544777","557302","548377","553891","548321","547126","550172","549710","548340","545447"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["emission","smoke","smokestack","storage","ventilation","facility","rooftop","building","production","unit"]}
