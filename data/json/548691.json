{"path":"548691.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph portrays a tranquil outdoor scene by a large body of water, likely a lake or sea. The setting is calm and serene, featuring two prominent objects and a lone individual:\n\n1. **Motorcycles**: In the foreground, on the left side of the image, there are two motorcycles parked on a gravel surface next to a grassy area. One motorcycle is red with a chrome finish, and the other is green and yellow with a black seat. Both bikes have travel gear strapped to them, suggesting they are being used for a road trip or travel adventure.\n\n2. **Person**: Seated by the shoreline, diagonally across from the motorcycles, is a person. This individual is shirtless, wearing shorts, and positioned in a relaxed, contemplative pose, appearing to be gazing at the water or possibly reading.\n\n3. **Tree**: A distinctive gnarled tree with thick branches and green leaves frames the scene. This tree leans slightly toward the water, adding a rustic charm to the landscape.\n\n4. **Background**: Beyond the tree and the seated individual, expansive calm waters stretch out, meeting the horizon under a clear sky with just a hint of clouds.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, featuring leisure and nature, hinting at a moment of rest during a journey. The composition effectively combines elements of travel, natural beauty, and a moment of human reflection, all set within a picturesque and serene water-side environment.","title":"Vacationer from Ohio relaxes near his motorcycle during sightseeing tour of the keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548690","548537","550826","545293","544260","545134","549716","543535","545038","554493","557562","558232","554876","550940","554486","549417"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["motorcycle","travel","strap","water","bike","finish","seat","journey","trip","chrome"]}
