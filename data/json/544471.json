{"path":"544471.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial site juxtaposed with natural elements. The central focus is on a complex that appears to be an industrial or manufacturing facility. Notable features within this complex include several large silos, some with conical tops, and numerous interconnected buildings of various sizes. The compound is surrounded by vast piles of a white material, likely an industrial byproduct or raw material. Multiple paths and dirt roads intersect through and around the facility, suggesting frequent vehicle activity.\n\nAdjacent to the industrial site runs a winding river, reinforcing a sharp contrast between the industrial operations and the surrounding natural landscape. The river is bordered by lush greenery, including dense clusters of trees and strips of grassland. Near the river, there is a water treatment plant distinguishable by its circular settling tanks.\n\nAlong the river, there is a visible dam-like structure, suggesting some level of water management or control associated with the site's operations. Small bridges over the river facilitate road connections from one side to the other, integrating the industrial complex with its surrounding areas. The overall scene captures the interplay between industrial development and nature from a bird's-eye perspective, highlighting the human impact on natural landscapes.","title":"Aerial view of damage caused by flooding of guadalupe river","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["550331","550856","550327","553450","550860","551192","551173","551551","542933","544569","551579","551194","551998","551202","550339","551585"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","complex","site","byproduct","compound","grassland","operation","facility","treatment","dam"]}
