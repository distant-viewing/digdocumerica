{"path":"553249.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and dynamic scene, viewed through a yellow-tinted, web-like filter that overlays the entire image, creating a dreamy and abstract feel. The setting appears to be an outdoor urban area, possibly a square or plaza, characterized by red-brick pavement. In the background, a tall, modern building with a distinct, rounded architecture and windows that reflect the bright sky can be seen, suggesting an urban environment possibly in a downtown area.\n\nSeveral people are visible, scattered throughout the image, giving an impression of a casual, social gathering or public event. The people are engaged in various activities; some are walking, while others seem to be talking or waiting. They appear relaxed and dressed in casual, contemporary clothing suitable for a warm day.\n\nThe photograph's composition is intriguing due to the interplay of the yellow web-like overlay and the clear areas of the photo. The overlay distorts and partially obscures the scene, making it somewhat challenging to discern specific details but adds an artistic and surreal quality to the image. The sunlight, filtering through this overlay, casts bright and dynamic patterns across the entire scene, enhancing the vivid and somewhat mystical ambiance. Overall, the photograph combines elements of urban life with a creative photographic technique, resulting in a unique and visually compelling image.","title":"August brings the \"D'Aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'Aug Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
