{"path":"549597.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a large, industrial ship, specifically focusing on the operation of a crane lifting scientific or oceanographic instruments from the sea. The crane, colored red, is extended over the calm, flat ocean surface. At the end of the crane, there is scientific equipment partially submerged in the water, seemingly being retrieved or deployed.\n\nThe equipment appears to be complex, possibly involving nets or cages used for collecting marine samples. Attached to the crane is a box that may be used for controlling the equipment or storing related apparatus. A cable or rope is visible, which is tethered to the equipment, ensuring its secure handling.\n\nOn the deck of the ship, you can see two individuals involved in the operation. The first person, located closer to the foreground, is actively using a hand signal or possibly manipulating a control mechanism that appears to be guiding the crane's action. This individual, dressed in casual clothing and a life vest, is attentively looking towards the equipment, ensuring it is safely managed. The second person, wearing darker clothing, is standing further back, watching the procedure.\n\nThe background features a calm sea and a hazy sky, blending together without a distinct horizon line, which adds a misty, serene atmosphere to the setting. The side of the ship visible in the image is painted red, and various maritime and safety equipment can be seen, emphasizing the functional and working nature of the ship.\n\nOverall, the image illustrates a moment of scientific or exploratory activity at sea, highlighting the interaction between human operators and machine technology in the challenging marine environment.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
