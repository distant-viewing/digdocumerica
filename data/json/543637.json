{"path":"543637.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, the primary focus is a large, weathered yellow sign that reads \"For INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LAND See GARFIELD OIL-LAND & DEVELOPMENT, INC. 719 GRAND AVE. GLENWOOD SPRINGS, COLO.\" The sign is supported by wooden posts and surrounded by pieces of scrap wood and debris on the ground, indicating a somewhat undeveloped or neglected area.\n\nThe background of the image features a desolate, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation, primarily small bushes and scrub. The hills are rocky and barren, typical of a semi-arid region. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast day.\n\nThere is a dirt road that runs parallel and close to the sign, though no vehicles or people are visible in the image. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a remote, undeveloped region, possibly being advertised for oil and land development purposes. The setting appears quiet and uninhabited, emphasizing the isolation and undeveloped nature of the land.","title":"Land development advertising in Rocky Mountains","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543641","545824","544136","549039","544845","547648","544245","558053","544023","549129","543724","543914","557546","544017","545827","555858"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["land","scrub","sign","region","scrap","advertise","information","oil","post","bush"]}
