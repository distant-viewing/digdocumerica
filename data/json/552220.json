{"path":"552220.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque lakeside scene during sunset. In the foreground, three small children are playing at the water's edge. Two of them, one squatting and the other standing, are positioned on the left side of the frame facing the water, while the third child stands on the right, looking towards the others. Their silhouettes are dark against the reflective glitter of the water, suggesting it's either early morning or late evening due to the low light levels.\n\nThe lake itself is calm but sparkling with reflections of the sunset, adding a golden sheen to the water. Several ducks are swimming peacefully nearby, with one duck close to the children, enhancing the feeling of harmony with nature. In the background, flying birds are visible, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil water scene. \n\nThe background features a silhouette of a treeline and a slightly illuminated sky, indicating the sun is just below the horizon. The general ambiance is peaceful and idyllic, characterized by the natural beauty of the water, wildlife, and the interaction of the children with their surroundings.","title":"Peaceful co-existence.
