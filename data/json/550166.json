{"path":"550166.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a striking juxtaposition between domestic life and industrial activity. On the left side of the photograph, part of a white house with classic architectural details, including a columned porch, is visible. In the foreground, a tidy white picket fence frames a small garden pathway leading to the house. The garden appears well-maintained with a variety of plants and flowers blooming.\n\nA person, possibly a woman given the attire, is standing on the path and seems to be looking or gesturing towards the plants. The woman is wearing a light-colored, possibly white dress that reaches just below her knees, complementing the serene domestic setting.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features a large industrial complex with multiple smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke. The factory buildings are large and adorned with various pipes and structures typical of heavy industry facilities.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo cleverly contrasts the peaceful, personal sphere of home and garden life with the imposing, somewhat ominous presence of industrial operations. The environmental implications of proximity between residential areas and heavy industries, such as pollution and lifestyle disruption, are subtly suggested by this contrast.","title":"Mrs. Walton paints her house and fence white despite the smoke from neighboring Republic Steel.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551075","551151","551152","551145","551074","551146","556584","551072","545388","557300","543013","557303","542935","543159","550187","545437"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["garden","industry","sphere","picket","implication","house","disruption","lifestyle","plant","knee"]}
