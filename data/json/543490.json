{"path":"543490.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet, serene moment in a dense redwood forest. The image highlights two individuals—appearing to be a man and a woman—walking along a shaded forest path. Both individuals are dressed in clothing suitable for cooler weather; the woman wears a coat that reaches past her knees, while the man is clad in what seems to be a sweater and trousers. Their casual, unhurried posture suggests a leisurely stroll.\n\nThe towering redwood trees dominate the composition, illustrating their immense size compared to the human figures. The trees' thick, reddish-brown trunks rise high above, with their coarse bark textures clearly visible. Sparse sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting light spots on the path and subtly illuminating the understory filled with an assortment of ferns and smaller bushes.\n\nA constructed wooden rail fence lines one side of the dirt path, indicating that this is a maintained trail, likely within a protected park or natural area. This fence adds a human-made element to the otherwise natural scene, guiding visitors and protecting the vegetation.\n\nOverall, the composition and the lush greenery encapsulate a peaceful ambiance, typical of a forest sanctuary, offering visitors a chance to immerse themselves in nature and enjoy the tranquility of the outdoors.","title":"California -- Colwell Redwood State Park","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543446","543447","553373","542922","555051","542845","547045","554966","543445","554720","542750","554968","553464","545512","554990","557940"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["redwood","path","protect","visitor","forest","fence","stroll","immerse","fern","knee"]}
