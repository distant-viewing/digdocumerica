{"path":"552522.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and rustic scene featuring a weathered wooden shed and a vibrant display of tall hollyhocks. The shed has a textured wooden surface, painted in faded gray, showing signs of wear and age. Its roof, covered in shingles, also appears old and weathered, adding to the rustic charm of the scene.\n\nIn front of the shed, there is a lush patch of hollyhocks, which stand out with their tall stalks topped with pink flowers. These plants seem healthy and well-grown, contrasting nicely with the worn wooden background. Surrounding the base of the hollyhocks are various green leaves, and the garden itself looks somewhat overgrown, suggesting a natural, untended look.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the plants in the foreground and the shed in the background, creates a layered effect, giving depth to the scene. The overall mood is serene and picturesque, evoking a sense of peaceful country life. The natural light and shadows suggest this was taken during a bright day, albeit with soft lighting, possibly due to cloud cover or the time of day. The scene is void of any human activity, focusing entirely on the interplay of nature and human-made structures.","title":"Barn in Detroit","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["544997","555577","551104","543198","555632","551076","557768","545041","556961","558102","545137","558101","554562","551111","557674","552515"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["shed","stalk","country","shingle","plant","charm","garden","cover","display","base"]}
