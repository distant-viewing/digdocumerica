{"path":"545696.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking landscape, likely in a desert region characterized by rugged terrain. In the foreground, a large flat rock surface anchors the scene, populated with small, hardy bushes that suggest a harsh, arid climate. A person is seated on a rock, partially shielded from the sun by a small tree, overlooking the expansive view.\n\nIn the middle distance, a prominent rock formation resembling a tower stands out; its steep, vertical sides and flat top are typical of a butte, shaped by erosion. This geological feature dominates the view, providing a stark contrast against the more subdued layers of rock formations that extend far into the background.\n\nThe distant landscape unfolds in layers of rock strata, carved into intricate patterns and shapes by natural forces over millennia. The color palette is a rich combination of earth tones—reds, browns, and ochres—that mirror the natural mineral contents of the rocks.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright but possibly hot day. Clouds provide a soft cover, casting light shadows and contributing to the overall dynamic and vivid appearance of the scene. The openness of the landscape conveys a sense of solitude and the grand scale of nature's artistry.","title":"Looking down on the \"gooseneck\" of the Colorado river from dead horse point","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["543838","544745","545804","545775","545771","544429","543846","545789","545761","544376","545300","544392","545799","545800","545805","545783"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","butte","artistry","millennium","stratum","formation","shield","layer","unfold","shape"]}
