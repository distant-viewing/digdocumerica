{"path":"546632.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a scene in a garage where two men are engaged in mechanical work on a car. The photograph’s setting is dimly lit, with the majority of light focusing on the open hood area of the car and the people working.\n\nThe car's hood is open wide, and we see the engine compartment where both individuals are involved in either repairing or maintaining the vehicle’s engine. The man on the right is leaned over deeply into the engine bay, and he has a cigarette in his mouth, creating a very traditional or classic mechanic look. His clothing, a dark jumpsuit, suggests practical workwear. The second man, on the left and partly obscured by the open hood, is wearing a light blue shirt and also appears to be wearing work attire. His posture and the direction of his hands suggest he is actively working on the engine or possibly assisting the other in his task.\n\nIn the background, the interior of the garage is visible but in shadow, creating a contrast that highlights the workspace and the men working. The area looks utilitarian with concrete walls and minimal embellishments, focusing purely on function rather than form.\n\nAbove the car, there is a hanging light which provides illumination to the area where the men are working, casting dynamic shadows and adding to the gritty, work-oriented atmosphere of the scene. The ambiance reflects a typical mechanic’s environment – functional, a bit grimy, and focused on the task at hand.","title":"Mechanics at work at \"call carl,\" computerized center","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["557911","553490","557372","557858","557870","557852","557860","557915","542763","557914","557853","557371","557861","557925","557916","557906"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["engine","work","hood","mechanic","garage","car","man","jumpsuit","workwear","embellishment"]}
