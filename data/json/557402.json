{"path":"557402.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense moment in an industrial setting, likely a steel mill or foundry. The central focus of the image is a large vessel tipping molten metal, which is brightly glowing orange and yellow, into a mold or another container. Immense heat emanates from the molten metal, illuminating the scene. Sparks and small particles of the hot metal fly through the air in a vivid spray that adds a dynamic feel to the image.\n\nThe background is dark, making the glowing metal stand out sharply. It appears to be nighttime or in a dimly lit indoor environment that amplifies the dramatic effect of the molten metal's glow. There are minimal details in the background due to the low light, but some industrial structures or equipment can be faintly seen.\n\nThe composition uses the contrast between the dark surroundings and the bright, fiery metal to focus the viewer's attention on the action of pouring the molten material. This photograph likely aims to capture the raw power and danger inherent in metalworking industries.","title":"\"fugitive smoke\" escapes through the top of the building during a casting operation at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant total plant emissions for the metallurgical furnaces and the powerhouse were reduced 97.7 percent from 1967.
