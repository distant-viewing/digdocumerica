{"path":"543944.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a cheerful moment at an outdoor watery setting, featuring a small group of young adults engaged in leisure activities by the water's edge on a sunny day.\n\nThe composition includes two boats stationed on the water adjacent to a dilapidated wooden dock. On the left, a dark-hulled speedboat with a windshield and white interior is titled 'Twister II'. Another boat of similar size but with white and tan hues is positioned slightly further in the water. The setting appears lively with the water in the background indicating a river or a lake.\n\nThe dock where the activities are focused is connected to the land by a narrow, worn-out wooden plank bridge. There are some personal items like a bag and clothing scattered near the edge of the plank, suggesting preparation or return from a boat ride.\n\nOn the dock, six individuals, likely in their 20s or 30s, are seen. Most of them are wearing swimwear indicating they are engaging in water-related activities. A diverse range of clothing styles can be seen including bikinis and shorts. Three of them are on the first boat, smiling and conversing, while others stand or move around the dock area. One individual appears to be carrying a camera, capturing the moments, while another is jestingly posing, enhancing the vibrant and casual atmosphere of the group’s outing. \n\nThe overall mood is joyful and relaxed, characteristic of a leisure day spent among friends by the water, enjoying the sun and each other’s company.","title":"The Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543943","544185","552945","550838","554611","551310","549408","550228","547879","549939","551255","550029","544122","544204","548054","554177"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["dock","boat","plank","30","water","speedboat","leisure","clothing","bikini","windshield"]}
