{"path":"549979.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a bustling urban cityscape. The image captures a dense cluster of buildings that vary in architecture, seemingly indicating different periods of construction and diverse functions ranging from commercial to possibly residential.\n\nDominating the composition are multiple high-rise structures with flat roofs; many are sheathed in reflective glass, giving them a modern appearance. Amidst these taller buildings, there are also older, shorter buildings with flat or sloped roofs, characterized by darker, more worn facades that suggest a rich historical context.\n\nThe city layout features a major intersection prominently in the foreground, showing a complex network of roads bustling with a multitude of vehicles. The roads are arranged in a way that allows for substantial vehicular traffic, evident from their wide and multilane construction. Surrounding the roads are various smaller streets teeming with more cars, indicating a typical busy day in the city.\n\nThe surrounding environment is relatively flat, suggesting that the city may be situated on a plain. There are no visible natural features such as rivers or mountains within the close vicinity of the central urban area, emphasizing the city's dense urban character.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is somewhat hazy, possibly due to smog or mist, which slightly obscures the buildings in the distance and lends a somewhat muted palette to the cityscape. This aerial perspective not only highlights the city's economic vitality and architectural diversity but also hints at the environmental challenges it might face.","title":"Center City, Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549476","552394","548364","551510","555743","548392","547210","548318","551509","549477","548425","548424","548417","553001","551506","553673"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","cityscape","multilane","vitality","road","plain","smog","construction","multitude","building"]}
