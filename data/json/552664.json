{"path":"552664.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a livestock auction or similar rural setting. The central figure is a middle-aged man wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, glasses, and holding a microphone and a corded loudspeaker, suggesting he is narrating or coordinating the event. He is dressed in a red vest over a light blue long-sleeve shirt and seems to be speaking into the microphone. His attire and the microphone indicate a role of authority or presentation at the event.\n\nIn front of him, partially visible and blurred due to the focus on the speaker, is a young child leading a brown and white calf, which highlights the agricultural or livestock context of the scene. The background features various individuals, including adults and children, who appear to be spectators or participants of the event. They are standing under a covered structure with a metal roof supported by steel beams, typical of rural or agricultural settings designed to shelter spectators and participants from the elements.\n\nThe setting is sandy underfoot, common in arenas used for livestock handling, adding to the rustic, outdoor nature of the event. The casual and engaged postures of the background figures suggest a community event with active participation and interest from attendees. Overall, the photograph encapsulates a moment of rural community activity focused on livestock management and presentation.","title":"Garfield County Fair.
