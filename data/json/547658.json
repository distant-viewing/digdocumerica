{"path":"547658.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph portrays a rustic rural scene likely captured during the daytime. It features an old house with a steep pitched roof on the left, appearing slightly weathered and constructed from materials that look dark in the image, possibly due to the lighting or the material's natural color. There are bare trees positioned around the house, suggesting it might be set in an area with a temperate climate.\n\nIn the background to the right, there's a clearer view of a farm including several buildings such as barns or storage structures, which also carry an aged, utilitarian appearance. These buildings are substantial in size, indicating that they may be used for significant farming or storage operations. Adjacent to these, we see a silo, enhancing the agricultural vibe of the scenery. \n\nThe foreground is dominated by a stretch of grass, which leads to a dirt path or a small road that carves through the landscape, connecting the buildings and disappearing into the horizon. Telephone poles along the road add a subtle touch of human presence and modernity to the otherwise pastoral and possibly isolated setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and the elements within suggest a serene, somewhat nostalgic atmosphere, possibly illustrating a longstanding farming area lived in and used over generations.","title":"Abandoned farm overlooking Rhode Island sound","placename":"Narragansett (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett, Rhode Island","nn1":["555635","557154","554767","555611","558110","555577","555609","551333","550704","558101","542801","554822","557746","556961","556963","557946"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["farming","pastoral","modernity","storage","disappear","generation","telephone","house","material","live"]}
