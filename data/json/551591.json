{"path":"551591.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph shows four transparent vials lined up with the leftmost vial being held in a person's hand. All the vials have black caps and contain plants or specimens submerged in a clear solution, possibly for scientific examination or preservation. The arrangement of the vials and the hand presents a silhouette effect against a brightly lit, plain background which appears to be uniformly illuminated.\n\nThe hand is shown in silhouette form and is positioning the first vial for better visibility or examination. Each vial seems to contain similar matter â€” plant-like specimens which might be leaves, seeds, or possible aquatic plants given their appearance and the way they are suspended in the liquid. The vials are of equal size and standing vertically, which suggests a setup for comparative analysis or cataloging in a scientific or educational context. The background is smooth and does not have any distinct features, emphasizing the subject matter in the foreground effectively.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory: 30 day growth of Jordanella.
