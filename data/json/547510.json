{"path":"547510.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and somewhat somber wetland scene. The primary focus is on a small, rectangular boat partially submerged in the still, dark water. The boat appears aged and neglected, with a slightly rusted or weathered interior visible above the waterline. Surrounding the boat is a dense growth of tall reeds or water plants, extending far into the background and covering most of the frame. The water surface, visible at the lower forefront and around the boat, reflects the grey sky above, enhancing the overall gloomy ambiance. There are no visible people or animals, which contributes to the sense of desolation and quiet. The horizon is indistinct, blending the water and the sky seamlessly, with a hint of a haze that mutes the colors to shades of blue and grey. Overall, the photograph conveys a feeling of abandonment and tranquility.","title":"Middletown has been dumping into an area bordering a salt marsh and the ocean.
