{"path":"550207.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a body of water, which appears to be a pond or a small lake. The surface of the water is mostly calm but has some ripples. A significant feature in the image is a series of dark cylindrical objects, likely boom barriers or floating logs, which are lain out across the water to possibly contain debris or pollution. These objects are interconnected and partly submerged, creating a barrier within the water.\n\nThe water itself is somewhat murky and has patches of what appears to be algae or water plants, along with floating debris including small twigs and leaves. The lighting is subdued, suggesting that the image might have been taken during late afternoon or on a cloudy day. The reflection of vertical structures, possibly trees or poles, is visible on the water's surface, adding a repetitive geometric pattern that contrasts with the natural randomness of the floating debris and algae.\n\nThe composition focuses on the interaction between these human-made objects and the natural water environment, possibly highlighting themes of environmental management or pollution control. The mood conveyed by the image is somewhat somber due to the dim lighting and the color tones, which are dominantly dark greens and browns.","title":"Boom contains oil and debris on Big Creek","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552054","550368","547541","552046","549641","547677","550812","550834","555547","551604","546905","555784","547668","542582","552158","552127"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["float","alga","water","barrier","debris","pollution","boom","twig","objects","object"]}
