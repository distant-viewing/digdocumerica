{"path":"544574.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and sprawling field densely populated with wildflowers, predominantly in shades of yellow, pink, and red. The flowers, likely varieties of daisies or Gaillardia, have prominent central disks surrounded by colorful petals, and they dominate the lower and middle portions of the image, showing a lush, natural carpet extending across the terrain.\n\nThe background features a large tree majestically set against a mellow sky, creating a focal point above the colorful flowerbed. The silhouette of the tree, substantial and sprawling, adds a gentle contrast to the softness of the flowers below. Other smaller trees and foliage are visible but less distinct behind the main tree.\n\nAdditionally, the field rises gently upward, running parallel to a faintly visible fence on the right that marks the boundary of the wildflower habitat. Overhead, the sky appears slightly overcast, which suggests a diffuse lighting that saturates the colors of the flowers, enhancing their visual impact.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of vibrant natural beauty with a tranquil rural setting, creating a peaceful, picturesque scene.","title":"Field of flowers.","placename":"Inks Lake (Tex.)","location":"Inks Lake, Texas","nn1":["545847","553076","550781","544443","542645","557098","545723","552503","544938","544439","542641","542704","549230","543206","542642","557099"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","wildflower","flowerbed","daisy","carpet","softness","petal","field","tree","boundary"]}
