{"path":"549216.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene centered around a single windmill standing prominently in a vast, open landscape. The windmill, which is of a traditional design, features a long vertical structure with a series of supporting beams, topped with a multi-blade rotor. It is positioned at the crest of a gentle hill, emphasizing its isolation and the sparse, undeveloped nature of the area.\n\nThe landscape around the windmill consists of rolling grassy fields that extend into the distance, uninterrupted by any visible paths, trees, or buildings, suggesting a sparsely populated or agricultural area. The grass has a natural, slightly golden hue, possibly indicating late summer or early fall.\n\nThe sky above is vast and dramatic, filled with heavy, textured clouds that suggest an overcast day. The clouds are various shades of gray and white, which could indicate impending weather changes. The overall lighting in the scene is soft and diffuse, with no strong shadows, contributing to a calm and serene atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of tranquil isolation and the enduring presence of nature, highlighted by the solitary figure of the windmill against the expansive sky and plain.","title":"Windmill on a ranch in the Powder River Basin.
