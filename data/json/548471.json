{"path":"548471.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a series of elegant townhouses, showcasing a close-up of the architectural designs of their facades. The focus is on the aligned, protruding structures of what appears to be a row of attached homes. The repeated architectural features include darkly painted wood constructions with highlights of lighter tones on the detailing of columns, railings, and decorative moldings.\n\nThe townhouses each have ornate doorways that are shaded by small overhangs often supported by columns. Each entry has steps leading up to it, suggesting these are multi-level residences. The most eye-catching features are the rounded column tops and finely detailed cornices along the roof and above the windows and doors, which exhibit classic architectural aesthetics, possibly of Victorian or Edwardian style.\n\nThe perspective is slightly angled, allowing viewers to see the depth and alignment of the buildings along the street. The coloring in the photograph suggests it might have been taken during bright daylight, enhancing the contrast between the dark paint of the wood and the highlights from the sunlight. There's a hint of green foliage at the edge of the frame, indicating these townhouses might be in an urban area with some greenery, adding a touch of softness to the otherwise stark architectural lines.","title":"Well kept three-family homes on neptune road.
