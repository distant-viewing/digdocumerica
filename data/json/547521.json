{"path":"547521.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted wetland area. The water is murky and scattered with a range of detritus, including discarded items like a tire, various plastic and foam containers, papers, other smaller pieces of random refuse, and partially submerged reeds and plants. The background shows a dense growth of tall, dark green reeds extending to the horizon under a pale sky, suggesting an otherwise natural and possibly expansive marshland setting suffering from significant pollution. The overall mood of the scene is somewhat desolate and reflects a negative human impact on a natural environment.","title":"Middletown dump spills over into salt marsh creek","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547520","547512","547517","547516","547844","550812","551440","551441","544647","546838","547907","547590","550352","547524","552811","550800"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["reed","detritus","marshland","refuse","foam","plastic","tire","wetland","growth","discard"]}
