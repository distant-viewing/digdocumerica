{"path":"547676.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and poignant scene at a beach. There are three children near the water's edge. On the left side of the image, one child wearing a dark jacket and jeans is kneeling down, appearing to be digging or playing in the sand. Centered in the picture, another child in a dark checkered jacket and pants is standing and seems to be looking out at the ocean waves. To the right, there's a child with blonde hair wearing a horizontally striped red and white sweater and blue jeans, also kneeling. \n\nThe beach itself is sandy with a scattering of darker wet patches, indicating recent waves or high tide. The ocean is visible with gentle foamy waves approaching the shore, contributing to a serene atmosphere. The sky above the sea is overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its soft, muted colors and casual beach attire of the subjects, evokes a sense of calmness and the simple pleasures of childhood exploration and companionship.","title":"Beach at middletown","placename":"Narragansett Bay (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island","nn1":["552341","543225","543493","547009","557511","543499","549105","555892","557507","550229","550241","552279","550233","555402","547727","554499"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","beach","knee","wave","waves","jeans","scattering","digge","pleasure","foamy"]}
