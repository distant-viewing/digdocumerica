{"path":"543302.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat somber and polluted water scene. The surface of the water is covered with various items and natural elements.\n\nForeground:\n- The water has a deep blue color, appearing dark and possibly oily or murky.\n- Floating on the water surface are various items suggesting pollution or discarded garbage. There are at least two visible tin cansâ€”one with a vaguely identifiable white label and another partially rusted. Both cans are half-submerged in the water.\n- A white plastic or styrofoam plate is also floating on the water. It is mostly submerged and takes on a slight curve, morphing with the water's surface texture.\n\nNatural Elements:\n- Among the human-made items, natural debris like leaves from water plants is visible. The leaves are partially submerged and span across the image, adding a touch of natural life amidst the pollution.\n- The water and floating objects cast reflections and shadows, creating a play of light and textures that may evoke a sense of neglect or decay in a natural setting.\n\nBackground:\n- The photograph focuses entirely on the surface of the water, leaving the specifics of a farther background indistinguishable. This tight focus creates a sense of immersion into the scene, emphasizing the impact of pollution on natural water bodies.\n\nOverall Composition:\n- The image has a balanced composition of man-made and natural elements, portrayed in a state of coexistence yet striking contrast, highlighting environmental concerns. The color palette is mainly dark with hints of white and rust, conveying a potential narrative of environmental degradation.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["550812","555848","552054","546838","555784","550807","544175","552080","547537","546920","550352","547524","550734","544804","552811","546944"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["water","float","submerge","pollution","can","item","rust","surface","leave","immersion"]}
