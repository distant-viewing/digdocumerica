{"path":"544505.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a young bird, possibly a pelican chick, situated in a nest. The bird, with its mouth slightly open, directs its gaze upwards. It features a fluffy texture with predominantly pale feathers, which are somewhat sparse, revealing patches of skin underneath. Its neck extends elegantly upwards while its beak is thin and pointed, typical of a bird dependent on its parents for feeding.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, giving a sense of openness and a natural setting. In the immediate vicinity of the chick, there are sparse twigs that form the structure of the nest, with a few green leaves suggesting that the nest is located in a tree or a bush. The primary focus is on the bird, which fills most of the frame, emphasizing its youthful features and plumage. The photograph brilliantly uses natural lighting to highlight the textures and delicate details of the chick's feathers.","title":"Baby egret in nest.","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544501","544513","548497","553876","548505","548490","544489","548493","544547","555010","544222","545214","544477","557614","548885","557628"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","feather","parent","beak","plumage","twig","openness","neck","skin","mouth"]}
