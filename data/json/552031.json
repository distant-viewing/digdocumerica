{"path":"552031.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph portrays an urban construction site or development area. The foreground shows a partially dug or disrupted ground filled with dirt piles and some scattered wood debris. There's an informative sign positioned prominently in the center, which appears to be providing details about the development work or agency involved, though the text is not clearly visible due to the resolution.\n\nThe background features a variety of urban architecture which includes a mix of residential and commercial buildings. There are several trees scattered throughout the area, including a large one prominently on the left side of the image. Further back, there are a couple of church spires, which suggests the presence of religious institutions nearby.\n\nTo the left, a paved road is visible with a car parked on the side, indicating this zone is adjacent to active public roads. The setting is lit by what seems to be a clear evening sky, casting a tranquil glow over the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a sense of ongoing urban development or renovation, characterized by the juxtaposition of construction in the foreground against a background of established community infrastructure.","title":"Rainbow Center urban renewal project consists of 87 acres of land for community and public development.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["544812","549665","547931","547833","547829","546988","551632","549913","547652","557479","549912","557419","555583","547240","553886","543591"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["development","institution","renovation","construction","spire","church","one","road","couple","zone"]}
