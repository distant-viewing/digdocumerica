{"path":"555898.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures a gritty urban scene looking towards the frame of a large bridge in the background, which appears to be the Manhattan Bridge in New York City. The viewer's perspective is from within a narrow street flanked on either side by tall, dark industrial buildings which have multiple closed bay doors and a few windows.\n\nThe road itself is wet, suggesting recent rain, and is littered with small pieces of debris and puddles. There are several vehicles parked and moving along the street, typical of an older era, possibly the 1970s or 1980s considering their design. Notably, a delivery truck is parked on the right side, with its logo partially visible. The overall atmosphere is slightly bleak, underscored by the overcast sky and absence of vibrant colors, mostly cast in shades of gray and blue.\n\nA few street lamps and signs (including one readable sign that says \"Jay St.\") are visible, providing a sense of the area possibly being a lower-traffic industrial or warehouse district. There's a faint glimpse of the cityscape in the distant background through the bridge's structure, adding a bit of depth and context to the urban environment depicted.","title":"Manhattan Bridge tower in Brooklyn, New York City, framed through nearby buildings. Brooklyn remains one of America's best surviving examples of a 19th century city. The project shows the great bridges that connect Brooklyn and Manhattan, the traffic streets, and need and use for living space and beauty. Some of the best American architecture survives in her \"worst\" neighborhoods that aren't demolished.","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["557278","549878","555933","555782","549832","554310","549861","547651","555734","547580","546744","550012","549887","548375","548410","550022"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["street","bridge","delivery","1980","puddle","district","bay","rain","warehouse","absence"]}
