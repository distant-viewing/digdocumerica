{"path":"545663.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a middle-aged man engaged in an activity by a water source surrounded by a polluted environment. The man is wearing a green jacket, a white safety helmet, and is seen kneeling on a raft made from blue and red drums tied together. He appears focused on an object or task in his hands, though it's not clearly visible what he is holding.\n\nThe scene around him is littered heavily with debris, including pieces of wood, branches, and various other discarded items that pollute the landscape. The ground is muddy and wet, suggesting recent rains or proximity to the water body. His expression and body language suggest concentration or concern.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat grim, highlighting environmental pollution or perhaps a cleanup effort. The setting seems to be in a natural yet severely impacted area, possibly near a river or floodplain where debris has accumulated. This portrayal might be part of a larger narrative about environmental conservation, pollution, or industrial impact on nature.","title":"EPA man checks log boom for leakage of oil and debris following a massive oil spill into the San Juan River. Origin of the spill was a burst pipeline, 200 miles upstream. Made chiefly of telephone poles, the boom held the oil in check until flood conditions caused it to overflow into Lake Powell. Clean-up operations, involving crews from pipeline company, Army, Coast Guard, and other agencies were supervised by EPA.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["555867","552085","557243","554535","553650","546892","555868","551226","545032","550962","546885","550812","552127","555852","550205","544810"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","raft","accumulate","language","drum","impact","kneel","debris","portrayal","conservation"]}
