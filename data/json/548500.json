{"path":"548500.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures an urban street scene taken from the perspective of a sidewalk beside a residential area. In the immediate foreground, a street sign prominently labeled \"NEPTUNE RD\" is attached to a lamppost on the right side of the frame, indicating the location. This street name suggests the setting might be near a coastal or water-related area.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, the corner of a multi-storied building that appears to be a typical urban residential structure can be seen. The building features a bay window structure on its corner and a facade composed of what looks like light-colored siding or similar material.\n\nThe center and background of the scene show a view down the sidewalk that runs parallel to the street on which several cars are parked. Notable is the vintage styling of these cars, which suggests the photograph may have been taken several decades ago. The cars exhibit design features characteristic of mid-20th-century American automobiles, such as distinct tail fins and chrome detailing.\n\nFurther in the distance, a large construction or industrial-like structure is visible, which contrasts with the residential foreground of the image. There also appears to be some overcast weather going on, given the overall gray tone of the sky and a slight wetness on the street, which might have recently experienced rain.\n\nReflective puddles on the street add a slightly glossy element to the ashen road surface, enhancing the dreary atmospheric tone of the image. There are no visible people in the scene, which imparts a somewhat deserted or tranquil feel to the urban environment captured in this photograph.","title":"Airlines food services building under construction near wood island station","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548489","548477","557155","556681","556709","549287","556707","549829","552933","550319","550053","548238","549785","557278","549832","553550"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","cars","sidewalk","corner","wetness","fins","lamppost","styling","impart","tail"]}
