{"path":"547219.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures an urban riverside scene. In the foreground, there is a muddy river with a soft rippling surface, possibly due to a gentle flow or breeze. On the riverside, there is a man standing adjacent to a concrete structure, which looks to be a walkway or a small dock that leads to a rounded tunnel opening under a larger structure. The river's edge has some built-up sections made of concrete, and there's some debris or driftwood visible near the water's edge.\n\nBeyond the riverside, there’s a grassy park area lined with young trees and a few scattered benches. A modern, multi-story building dominates the background, characterized by long balconies and wide windows, suggesting it could be a residential or office building.\n\nOverall, the setting is peaceful with elements of both natural and built environments, providing a snapshot of day-to-day life in this urban area. The presence of the man by the water’s edge adds a human element to the scene, while the architectural structures and natural elements frame his activity within an urban context.","title":"The Georgetown gap, through which raw sewage flows into the Potomac.
