{"path":"556397.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene inside a mine. The setting is dark and enclosed, illuminated primarily by artificial lights which cast stark shadows and highlights around the space.\n\nIn the foreground, a miner is visible working. The miner, wearing a protective helmet with a headlamp, is operating a large, rugged piece of machinery, which appears to be a continuous miner or similar mining equipment used to cut coal from the seam. The miner is seated, focusing on the controls of the machine with his back towards the camera, suggesting a deep engagement in his task.\n\nThe environment is characterized by rough, uneven textures, especially noticeable on the low, rocky ceiling of the mine. There are signs of moisture or dampness, as the surfaces have a shiny, wet look, likely due to the conditions within the mine. Additionally, the space is confined, possibly indicating a tunnel or a passageway. Safety beams or supports are visible, reinforcing the tunnel structure against collapse.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the harsh and challenging conditions inside the mine, emphasizing the difficult and hazardous nature of the work being conducted.","title":"Man operating a continuous miner in Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia. Note the water spraying in front of the machine to keep coal dust particles out of the air. Lime or rock dust also is used to control the airborne particle problem. The continuous miner passes the coal back to a shuttle car which takes it out of the tunnel for transport by conveyor out of the mine.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556396","556511","556360","556358","556510","556365","556357","556359","556364","556319","556366","543743","543775","556367","556513","556363"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["miner","mine","tunnel","collapse","dampness","headlamp","coal","moisture","highlight","space"]}
