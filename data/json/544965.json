{"path":"544965.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a woman actively engaged in an outdoor industrial or farming task. She is focused on pouring a yellow liquid from a narrow-spouted yellow plastic container into a large, rectangular water tank. The tank appears to be made of metal with glass or transparent plastic sides, through which numerous eels (or similar aquatic animals) can be seen swimming in cloudy water.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeve button-up shirt and her hair is styled in a short, curly manner typical of the 1980s or 1990s, which suggests the possible era of the photograph. She wears a serious expression, indicative of concentration on her task.\n\nIn the background, blurred foliage and a white structure with a horizontal stripe can be observed, suggesting that the activity is taking place outdoors in a rural or semi-rural setting. The setting is utilitarian and functional, with the focus clearly on the task being performed rather than the aesthetics of the surroundings. The old, weathered look of the tank and wooden structure around it points to a longstanding use of the equipment in a working environment.","title":"Jellyfish, and their ability to fluoresce, is the research engaging this graduate student at the marine biology laboratory of the University of Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551405","551596","546335","543810","546343","545206","544957","546316","543804","552272","553650","545202","545211","549600","549078","553657"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["tank","task","plastic","1980","liquid","button","manner","woman","farming","concentration"]}
