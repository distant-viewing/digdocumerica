{"path":"555303.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene focused on a large skylight. The skylight, with its multiple panes held together by a solid frame, is located at the top of the image, and the daylight coming through it brightens a distinctive area of the photo. The structure appears geometric and architectural, hinting at a modern design possibly in an institutional or residential setting.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a shadowy figure of a person standing and looking upward towards the skylight. The person, whose details are obscured by the shadow, lends a human element to the otherwise architectural focus of the image. Their presence adds a contemplative or introspective dimension to the scene.\n\nThe interior surrounding the person and the skylight is shrouded in darkness, emphasizing the contrast between the illuminated and shaded areas. The overall composition plays with light and shadow, creating a dramatic effect and drawing the viewer's attention primarily to the interaction of the person with the light streaming through the skylight. The background and other elements remain nondescript, further highlighting the central elements of the skylight and the figure.","title":"A skylid, a louvered skylight that opens and closes automatically, and requires no external power source.
