{"path":"554333.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a panel discussion taking place in an auditorium, probably focusing on an academic, business, or political topic given the formal setting. In the image, five individuals are positioned on a stage before an audience. \n\nOn the left side of the stage, four panelists sit behind a long table, each with a name plaque and a microphone, suggesting they have speaking roles. One panelist appears to be speaking or is about to speak, as indicated by his gesture towards his microphone and his attentive posture. These panelists are dressed in business attire, contributing to the formal vibe of the event.\n\nOn the right, a single individual stands at a podium, equipped with its own microphone and a prominent emblem, likely representing the organization hosting the event. This person, dressed in a contrasting red garment, is addressing the room, indicated by his open posture and engagement with the audience or his fellow panelists.\n\nThe audience, with its backs to the camera, fills the auditorium, attentively facing the stage. Most audience members appear as silhouettes due to the lighting, emphasizing the focal point of the stage and the speakers.\n\nThe overall composition uses interior lighting that highlights the stage area, with the rest of the room in relative shadow. The backdrop behind the panelists and the speaker is simple and uncluttered, with a couple of architectural features like inset panels or wall sections adding some texture to the scene. This setup focuses attention on the speakers and the discussion taking place.","title":"Citizens meeting on transportation, a forum on \"Strategies for Clean Air\" proposed by the New York City EPA","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557703","556451","554342","543924","552618","543925","557027","546550","557704","554337","544314","556694","554322","557038","545547","547284"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["audience","stage","speaker","microphone","speak","discussion","panel","business","room","topic"]}
