{"path":"546328.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a man intensely focused on his work at a laboratory bench. He is using a pair of tweezers and a small brush to carefully handle or examine a delicate object on the workspace in front of him, possibly sampling or assembling small scientific components.\n\nThe man appears to be middle-aged and is wearing glasses with a thin frame. He is dressed in a light pink lab coat over a white shirt, indicative of a scientific or medical profession. Accompanying his professional attire is a wristwatch, suggesting an attention to detail and time.\n\nOn the table in front of him, various other tools and objects are visible, including what looks like a pen, a red tube (possibly another instrument or container), and a round dish that may hold samples or tools. To the left side of the image, there is a part of a microscope or another optical device with a large circular opening and multiple eyepieces, emphasizing the scientific or technical nature of the man's work.\n\nThe background is generally indistinct, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the man and his precise task. He is lit in such a way that highlights his actions and facial expressions, adding to the seriousness and concentration evident in his demeanor. The overall composition and set-up suggest a moment of critical examination or intricate manipulation in a scientific or lab environment.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Dr. John Couch, pathobiologist, works at an electron microscope.
