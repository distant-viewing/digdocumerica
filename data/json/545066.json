{"path":"545066.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a large, rectangular, green waterfront house located directly on the edge of a lake or river. The house has a dark green or black roof, and features many white-framed windows along its side. A small, attached section of the home appears to have a green roof, matching the siding of the main structure. A white picket fence runs along one edge of the house, near a wooden dock that projects into the water.\n\nAdjacent to the main house there is a small, green outbuilding, which might be used as a shed or boathouse. Near this building, a small, grey motorboat is tethered to another section of the dock. The immediate surroundings of the house are densely wooded, with tall trees providing a lush green background which suggests a secluded, natural environment.\n\nOverall, the image projects a serene, rustic setting, likely intended for leisure or vacation purposes, given its placement and design optimized for waterfront living.","title":"Washington--waunna","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545067","551526","552986","552987","542711","545896","552232","547248","542908","550749","544567","543529","554438","557669","554696","543526"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["house","project","boathouse","optimize","tether","dock","picket","vacation","outbuilding","liive"]}
