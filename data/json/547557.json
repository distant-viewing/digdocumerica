{"path":"547557.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a maritime scene featuring two individuals in a small boat on a vast expanse of water, likely an ocean or large lake. The image captures a peaceful, quiet moment of aquatic labor, likely related to fishing or marine work. The water is deep blue, hinting at the photograph possibly being taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon.\n\nThe boat, somewhat centrally located in the frame, is a basic, small, and round-hulled vessel, appearing sturdy and utilitarian. Equipped with oars, it contains two individuals. Both are wearing yellow gear—probably waterproof—suitable for marine conditions. They appear to be busy, one possibly steering the boat while the other seems engaged with the equipment or handling materials related to their task.\n\nIn the water surrounding the boat, various objects float, including a prominent red buoy near the boat and several smaller white buoys aligned in a seemingly systematic order, possibly indicating a fishing net or a marked area. The background is quite minimalistic, showcasing the vast, uninterrupted horizon of the water, subtly blending into a clear sky. This simplicity emphasizes the subjects and their ongoing activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is straightforward yet evocative, capturing a slice of marine life and the interaction of humans with their aquatic environment. It also subtly suggests themes of livelihood, sustenance, and perhaps isolation in the vast marine backdrop.","title":"Fishermen check leader of trap nets they have set at the mouth of the Sakonnet River.
