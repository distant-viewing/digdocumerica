{"path":"545407.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly African American man lying on his side on what looks to be a hospital bed. He appears to be in a state of rest or possibly unconscious, as his eyes are closed and there is a nasal cannula in place, suggesting he is receiving supplemental oxygen. The pillow and bed are covered in light blue linens, adding a calm, clinical feel to the scene.\n\nThe gentleman's head rests on the pillow, highlighting his features such as his gray hair and the visible signs of aging skin. There is a distinct peace in his expression, and his face is prominent in the frame, conveying a sense of vulnerability and human frailty.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a stamp-like print on the pillowcase featuring what appears to be a caduceus (a traditional symbol of medicine) encircled with text, contributing to the environment's medical or hospital context. The image captures a personal and poignant moment within a clinical setting, evoking themes of care, aging, and possibly illness.","title":"Ex-coal miner is now a black lung victim","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545408","545412","553035","558338","556459","545420","545552","545409","545416","545399","554849","543906","545486","544232","553034","552871"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["pillow","hospital","bed","gentleman","vulnerability","print","peace","symbol","care","aging"]}
