{"path":"546963.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene dominated by a calm body of water, possibly a river or a lake, reflecting the surrounding lush foliage and trees. The foreground of the image is slightly shadowed, showing an overhanging branch from the upper left, partially framing the scene. This adds a natural border that draws the viewerâ€™s eye towards the center and beyond.\n\nThe trees surrounding the water are dense and diverse, with various types of foliage that are rich in color and texture. Particularly striking is a knotted, twisting tree on the right-hand side, whose branches extend over the water, adding a dynamic and slightly wild feel to the tranquil setting. Its reflection in the water is sharp and almost perfectly symmetrical, creating a visual doubling effect that enhances the photo's depth.\n\nThe water itself is remarkably still, mirroring the sky, trees, and branches with clarity. This stillness gives the scene a reflective, almost meditative quality. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the light seems soft and diffuse, enhancing the muted and earthy tones of greens and grays.\n\nNo human activity is visible, emphasizing a sense of solitude and untouched natural beauty. The overall composition, with its reflections, natural framing, and the interplay of light and shadow, creates a peaceful and somewhat introspective atmosphere. This scene invites contemplation and appreciation of the quiet and less disturbed aspects of nature.","title":"A quiet stream at sun-up on John's Island","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550845","554753","554527","550844","543611","553410","554623","557254","551352","554616","550389","554603","554608","545008","542844","554526"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["branch","reflection","appreciation","water","foliage","tree","border","framing","clarity","stillness"]}
