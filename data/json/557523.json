{"path":"557523.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastline from a high vantage point. It features a panoramic view of a sweeping seaside where a curving sandy beach borders the calm blue sea. To the left of the frame, nestled among greenery, are a few buildings that seem to be residential homes. One prominent white-roofed house at the forefront stands out; it is a modern structure with large windows, presumably to capitalize on the ocean views.\n\nIn the middle distance, a long pier extends into the sea, drawing the eye along its lengthy structure. The coast is backed by lush hills dotted with vegetation and few buildings, indicating a lightly populated area. The hills roll back into more rugged terrain, suggesting a transitioning landscape that might include agricultural landâ€”the hints of which are visible as distinct patches in the far background.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is rendered a bit hazy, possibly due to mist or fog, typical of coastal regions, which gently obscures some of the distant details. This gives the scene a somewhat serene and quiet character. The colors are muted with dominant blues, greens, and whites, reflecting the natural beauty of the coastal environment.","title":"Looking down from the santa monica mountains towards highway u.s.  #1 in the distance near Malibu, California, on the northern edge of Los Angeles","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543362","543337","545110","545222","543300","543427","545226","557466","553995","557453","554057","543361","557429","545106","554081","545124"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["capitalize","nest","sea","render","populated","curving","seaside","coast","whites","hill"]}
