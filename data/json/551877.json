{"path":"551877.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is an urban scene, likely taken on a rainy day given the wet streets and gloomy skies. It features a busy street intersection with multiple trams and a car in motion, highlighted by a blur that suggests movement. The trams are blue and white and appear to be a prominent mode of transportation, given their multiple tracks and the number occupying the frame.\n\nProminently in the background, there are various European style buildings, with different businesses occupying the ground floors, displaying signage such as \"Dacher,\" \"Presse,\" and \"Fassaden.\" The architecture here appears Baroque influenced with ornamental facades and rounded windows. Advertising and flags are also visible, adding color to the grey day. \n\nThe photo captures a glimpse of everyday life in a European city, possibly from the mid to late 20th century, evidenced by the design and style of the trams and the car's model. Pedestrians can be seen in the distance under umbrellas, adding life and scale to this busy urban snapshot. The inclusion of billboards and modern advertisements contrasts with the historical feel of the architecture, depicting a blend of old and new elements typical of many European cities.","title":"Munich's trolleys are quiet and efficient.
