{"path":"549055.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a rural scene with a toll bridge. The bridge, identified as \"Cibola Toll Bridge,\" has a load limit sign at the beginning, stating \"Load Limit 25 Tons.\" The bridge itself appears somewhat rudimentary, constructed with planks laid across its surface, adding a makeshift aura to the scene. At the near end of the bridge, there's another prominent sign warning that the bridge has a 2 mph speed limit for both autos and trucks.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, there are two stop signs. One stop sign has an additional sign attached that reads \"NOT A THRU ROAD TO BRAWLEY ELCENTRO OR YUMA GO BACK TO HI WAY.\" This implies that the bridge does not lead to major nearby destinations and seems to serve local or restricted traffic.\n\nTo the left side of the bridge, there is a small, single-story building that might serve as an office or a checkpoint for the toll. This building has a slightly dilapidated appearance, with exposed wooden paneling and a few windows. It's situated immediately next to the roadway, reinforcing its potential function related to the toll operation.\n\nThe setting is quite barren and flat, with a long, straight road leading towards and away from the bridge, bordered by utility poles. The landscape is dusty and sparse, typical of a desert or arid region. Further attesting to the rural, somewhat isolated character of the area, no vehicles or people are visible in the scene, adding a sense of quietude and stillness.","title":"Cirola toll bridge crosses the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["550986","545141","548341","544292","549010","552709","548401","544245","544304","558015","546139","549861","546724","553663","546859","552846"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["bridge","limit","stop","sign","load","beginning","auto","warn","serve","paneling"]}
