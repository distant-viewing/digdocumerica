{"path":"553496.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a domestic, intimate moment among family members, taken in a shady outdoor setting, likely on a porch or similar area. The primary focus is on a young child, who is being held by a woman whose back is to the camera, revealing a tattoo on her shoulder. The child, appearing curious and slightly apprehensive, has a light complexion and large, expressive eyes, and is dressed in a patterned shirt with a buttoned-up collar.\n\nIn the background, another woman is seated, smiling gently towards the child and the woman holding them (the person's head is slightly blurry due to a focusing on the child). Beside her, another woman also partially smiles, adding to the overall serene and casual atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe environment suggests a homely, family-oriented setting with lush vegetation subtly visible in the soft-focus background. The lighting is natural, casting soft shadows and highlights that enrich the moment's candid and tender nature.","title":"The watkins of mulky square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for i-635.
