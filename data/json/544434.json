The focal point is a fawn lying in a bed of straw and grass, likely seeking refuge or rest. The fawn has a coat peppered with white spots, which helps in camouflaging within the natural surroundings. Overhead, branches from bushes or small trees laden with small red berries hang, adding vibrant color and detail to the scene. The ground is covered in a mixture of grass, pine needles, and other organic debris, typical of a forest floor. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, highlighted by the natural light filtering through the foliage and casting dappled shadows over the scene. This image captures a moment of peaceful coexistence within nature, emphasizing the quiet beauty of a forest habitat.","title":"Central Texas--near Lake Travis","placename":"Travis, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Travis, Lake, Texas","nn1":["550803","551367","550802","543279","543839","550804","544916","543851","558368","552339","542778","544623","546163","543369","545902","544114"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["forest","filtering","overhead","straw","needle","grass","coexistence","bed","rest","mixture"]}
