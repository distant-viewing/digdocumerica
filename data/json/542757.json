{"path":"542757.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows three men engaged in an interaction in an outdoor setting, likely an industrial or working area. Two of the men are dressed in light-colored police uniforms, featuring dark peaked caps and badges visible on their shirts. The uniforms are complemented by dark belts and shoes. The older of the two is on the right and appears to be observing the situation intently with a serious expression, his hands clasped together in front of him.\n\nThe younger policeman on the left is standing facing towards the other two, with a profile view presented. He seems to be listening or speaking to the third man, who is dressed casually compared to the uniformed officers. This man, in the center of the image, is wearing a plain white t-shirt and is leaning forward over a flat surface where documents or some form of paperwork are visible. He appears to be signing or writing something on the paper, indicated by the way he is holding a pen and his focused attention.\n\nThe backdrop is a bit unclear but includes part of a heavy duty vehicle or machinery, suggesting an industrial environment. The setting and the attire of the characters suggest some kind of official or formal interaction, possibly related to work or a legal matter being addressed or recorded.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is natural, with shadows and highlights indicating bright outdoor conditions. The focus and depth of field emphasize the three men, making the background details less pronounced. The overall atmosphere is one of serious, professional engagement.","title":"Air pollution control department officers, mel schreckengost and dick fehrenback, issuing citation","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["556847","557867","557868","546657","542759","557727","557856","555287","557838","546680","542758","544969","546637","542546","542756","546633"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["uniform","man","paperwork","clasp","peaked","pronounce","record","matter","address","officer"]}
