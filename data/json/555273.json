{"path":"555273.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a towering industrial structure, specifically a large cargo crane at a port. The crane is viewed from a low angle, emphasizing its impressive height and solid construction. The crane consists of a sturdy metal framework painted in a dark color, which contrasts with the light blue sky in the background.\n\nThe photograph is taken while looking directly up at the crane, highlighting its vertical elements and the intricate network of beams that support its architecture. At the top of the crane, several cargo containers are suspended, with the branding \"ACL\" visible on them, indicating the company associated. These containers appear to be in the process of being lifted or moved.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph focuses on the geometric shapes formed by the crane's architecture, creating a visually striking image that also reflects the industrial nature of the environment. The backdrop of the sky provides a clean, uncluttered background that allows the details of the crane to stand out vividly.","title":"Machinery used to load cargo onto ships at the port of Newark, New Jersey","placename":"New Jersey","location":"New Jersey","nn1":["555285","555269","555284","550874","547615","547223","555283","544157","550907","544127","548559","544109","545655","555261","553027","549800"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["crane","cargo","container","branding","architecture","suspend","company","port","lift","framework"]}
