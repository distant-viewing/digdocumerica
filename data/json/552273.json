{"path":"552273.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"In the photograph, we see a man engaging with numerous fish inside a boat. The man, possibly in his twenties or thirties, has a focused expression as he works with the fish. He has long, dark hair tied back and wears a short-sleeved, striped, crew-neck shirt which is slightly soiled, indicating he has been at work for a while. He also has a strap evident over his right shoulder, hinting at a bag or a piece of equipment not visible in the frame.\n\nThe boat is filled with a significant number of fish, many likely freshly caught, evidenced by their glistening appearance and the foaming water around them. The fishes are primarily silver in color, perhaps salmon or a similar species, and they cover the bottom of the boat densely, filling the space with their bulk.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests this activity is taking place in a calm river or a lake, with quiet and still water reflecting a cloudy sky. Trees densely lining the shoreline in the background suggest a remote or natural setting, emphasizing the likelihood of this being a fishing activity in a natural habitat.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph conveys a moment of daily work, possibly in a commercial fishing operation, with a focus on the man and his interaction with the fish, set against a tranquil natural backdrop.","title":"Terry Bigford removes fresh-killed salmon from chill tank at the Domsea aquacultural site, Manchester.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["544256","552298","554200","546301","545093","545306","545185","549334","545211","547551","552323","545178","547563","545206","551396","545198"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","boat","fishing","salmon","thirty","twenty","strap","crew","work","neck"]}
