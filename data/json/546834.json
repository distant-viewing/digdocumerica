{"path":"546834.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of two tugboats aiding a large, red-hulled ship. The tugboats, labeled \"Cape Cod\" and \"Kings Point,\" are both vivid green with markings on their decks; \"Cape Cod\" has an image of a lighthouse and a ship, while \"Kings Point\" displays an eagle. Both boats have visible equipment and structures such as small cranes, cabins, and safety railing surrounding the deck.\n\nThe larger ship, only partially visible with its expansive red hull and a small segment of its deck, dominates the scene from the background. It appears to be quite massive compared to the tugboats. The ship's deck is cluttered with various items, possibly cargo or machinery, and a few structures that could be part of the shipâ€™s equipment.\n\nThe water around the boats is disturbed, likely from the movement of the tugboats working alongside the ship.\n\nIn the distant background, a calm river or harbor setting is visible, scattered with other maritime structures, possibly docks or cargo handling areas. There are also distant shorelines, which are too far to discern details clearly.\n\nThe quality of the image and its vivid colors lend a vintage feel to the photograph, suggesting it may have been taken several decades ago.","title":"Towing the newly launched tanker, \"Chevron Hawaii\", to its berth","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546845","546832","550896","546751","551990","546909","557815","550892","546938","550872","546804","550043","550895","550893","550894","545073"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","tugboat","deck","hull","cargo","lighthouse","disturb","boat","equipment","aid"]}
