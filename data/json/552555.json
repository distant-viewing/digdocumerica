{"path":"552555.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a pastoral scene, capturing a flock of sheep grazing in a lush, green meadow. The image is set during daylight with bright sunshine highlighting the vibrant green of the grass. The sheep, varying slightly in shades of white and grey, are dispersed throughout the field, some standing and others bent to graze. The meadow is surrounded by a backdrop of gentle hills, covered in a dense shrubbery or small forest. The sky above is not visible in the photo, focusing attention more closely on the landscape and the animals. The composition conveys a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, typical of a rural or wilderness area managed for livestock grazing.","title":"Sheep and cattle ranching is the chief occupation of the Piceance Basin.
