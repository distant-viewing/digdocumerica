{"path":"558283.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a young man playing a concertina. The man appears focused on his instrument, which he holds with both hands, extended slightly as it is played. He has light-colored hair and is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt. \n\nThe concertina is detailed and ornate, featuring intricate silver embellishments and what appears to be pearl-like buttons. The bellows of the instrument are expanded, suggesting he is in the midst of playing.\n\nThe background is softly blurred and indistinct, allowing the viewerâ€™s attention to remain focused on the musician and his concertina. It gives a hint of an indoor setting with soft, diffused lighting that contributes to the overall warm ambiance of the scene.","title":"Accordionist in a polka band at the Gibbon Ballroom at Gibbon, Minnesota, 20 miles north of New Ulm. It was headquarters for Gibbon Polka Days, four days of dancing to both German and Polish polkas. The event attracted dancers from throughout the upper midwestern states. Polka dancing is an old New Ulm tradition which has regained popularity with young and old after a decline in the 1950's and 60's. More than 26 polka-waltz bands have formed and worked out of New Ulm since the 1930's.","placename":"Gibbon (Minn.)","location":"Gibbon, Minnesota","nn1":["557788","558359","558263","558213","558358","548607","548606","558387","558224","548262","558357","548560","558282","553152","558354","558334"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["instrument","playing","embellishment","musician","midst","button","man","hair","ambiance","hint"]}
