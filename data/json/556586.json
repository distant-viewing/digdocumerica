{"path":"556586.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a serene rural scene during either sunrise or sunset, as suggested by the soft lighting and long shadows. Two rustic barns, made of wood with weathered textures, are the focal points. The barn on the left is larger with dark, vertical planking and a shiny, metal gabled roof; it connects to a smaller, enclosed structure that is slightly dilapidated. The barn on the right shows horizontal wooden slats and features an opening that allows sunlight to pass through, creating a bright rectangle of light on the ground, which contrasts with the overall shadowed foreground.\n\nThe setting is a pastoral landscape with a rolling hill in the background, covered mostly in grass, indicating it might be used for grazing or left fallow. A few leafless trees punctuate the landscape, emphasizing the rural and possibly autumnal setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a horse with a reddish-brown coat and blonde mane is grazing or standing on a patch of green grass, adding life to the otherwise still scene. There is a pile of wood or debris near the horse, suggesting ongoing or recent activity, possibly related to farming or maintenance of the property. The atmosphere is quiet and reflective, typical of a secluded, countryside setting.","title":"Early morning light enriches a bucolic scene at Claypool Hill, near Richlands, Virginia, about a dozen miles from the coal mines.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["542805","556963","547128","552537","556958","555577","557991","554161","550019","555571","552562","547309","554782","549194","552462","557186"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","horse","mane","slat","wood","countryside","grass","opening","sunrise","farming"]}
