{"path":"553905.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a red warning sign prominently displayed in the foreground that reads \"DANGER PESTICIDE CONTAINER DISPOSAL SITE IMPERIAL COUNTY KEEP OUT.\" The sign has white lettering and a white border and is attached to a wire barrier, suggesting it is guarding a hazardous area.\n\nBehind the sign, a landscape is visible, showing a large open area with dry, barren terrain. There is a long ditch or trench that stretches into the distance, filled with debris including scattered pesticide containers and other litter. The terrain is arid and sparse with no visible vegetation, which indicates that the location might be in a desert or a similarly dry region. The background under a bright blue sky also shows flat, expansive fields stretching to the horizon with minimal or no vegetation, reaffirming the arid environment.\n\nThe scene conveys a sense of warning and isolation, underscored by the danger sign and the lack of human presence in the contaminated or hazardous waste area. This composition not only reflects environmental neglect but also highlights concerns related to public health and safety in disposing of toxic materials.","title":"Special precautions must be taken for disposing of hazardous materials, as in this area near El Centro in the Imperial Valley (from the sites exhibition.
