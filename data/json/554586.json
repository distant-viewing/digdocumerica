{"path":"554586.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a single flower, likely a type of wild orchid or similar bloom. The flower is characterized primarily by its white, delicate petals that spread broadly outwards. In stark contrast, the center of the flower features a dark, elongated structure topped with a yellowish tip, emanating from the center and upwards. This structure is flanked by dark, downward-sweeping lines that add a dramatic flair to the flower's appearance.\n\nThe petals themselves are relatively smooth, and the flower has a symmetrical appearance, with the central structure acting as a natural divider. Leafy green foliage cradles the flower from below, their broad forms blurred slightly, which suggests that the focus is strictly on the flower. The background of the image is dark and indistinct, providing an excellent contrast that highlights the purity and vulnerability of the white petals.\n\nOverall, the composition exquisitely uses depth of field to isolate the flower, making it the focal point, and creating a portrait-like effect that underscores its pristine beauty amidst a dark, enveloping background. The image predominantly communicates themes of delicacy and contrast.","title":"White Violet in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["543623","555035","553368","545695","555034","550464","554581","549230","544875","554840","553361","551368","545706","554580","557487","555189"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","dark","flair","vulnerability","elongate","emanat","pristine","tip","appearance"]}
