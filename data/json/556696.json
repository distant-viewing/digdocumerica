{"path":"556696.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene, presumably in a subway or train station setting where individuals are engaging with two sets of parallel escalators. The general setting has an industrial aesthetic, highlighted by metal beams and riveted structures overhead, lending the scene a slightly dated, mid-20th-century feel.\n\nThe escalators are framed by two metallic walls, and signs hang in the center gap between the escalators, stating safety instructions or rules such as \"DO NOT SIT ON ESCALATOR HAND RAIL OR STEPS\" and \"DO NOT REST UMBRELLAS OR CANES ON ESCALATOR STEPS\". These precautionary signs combined with the utilitarian design suggest a focus on functionality and safety in a public transit environment.\n\nThe photo captures numerous individuals utilizing the escalators; some are ascending while others descend. People appear in various attire, indicating a diverse mix of ages and lifestyles typical of a bustling urban setting. Men are primarily seen in suits or coats, and headwear like hats, signaling a likely cooler weather setting or simply fashion norms of an earlier era. Women are visible in coats, and one person is notably handling a suitcase, indicating travel or commuting activity.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts bright highlights on the escalator steps and on some of the individuals, creating a contrasting look with the darker surroundings, emphasizing the motion and directional flow of human traffic within the space. This ambience adds a dynamic element to the composition, capturing the everyday yet essential rhythm of city life.","title":"Subway passengers ride escalators from New York City Transit Authority trains to the surface on their way to work. There has been a decrease in ridership since 1960. At that time the subway handled 2.2 million people a day, which was 51 percent of the work force. In 1970 the number had decreased to 2.1 million per day and 47 percent of the work force. The system is of crucial importance to the city but the voters have refused to okay more improvements or a fare increase.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551884","551880","549904","551885","556820","556697","551881","549670","551882","551879","553209","551886","549643","551890","556815","551893"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["coat","safety","rule","suitcase","rhythm","instruction","subway","individual","gap","lifestyle"]}
