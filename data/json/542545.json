{"path":"542545.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial setting with a striking, dynamic composition. The scene is dominated by large, robust machinery, specifically part of a factory or processing plant. A dominant feature of the image is a large tower-like structure with pipes and cylindrical containers, which portray a sense of massive scale and heavy industry.\n\nThe colors are bold, with the deep blues of the sky contrasting sharply against the metallic grays and earthy tones of the machinery. Two large vertical pipes command attention; one pipe appears smooth and metallic, while the other shows signs of deterioration with rust and peeling paint. Wisps of smoke or steam emanate from parts of the equipment, adding a dynamic, working quality to the scene.\n\nThere is also a sense of depth provided by the angular composition, where parts of the machinery overlap and provide a perspective looking up towards the sky. Several smaller details, like protective railings, light fixtures, and additional mechanisms, suggest this is a complex operation site, possibly related to energy production or heavy manufacturing.\n\nOverall, the image offers a vivid depiction of industrial might, combining elements of scale, function, and a bit of the harsh aesthetics characteristic of heavy industry environments.","title":"Steam emission is estimated to consist of 85 percent sand dust at this asphalt batch plant.","placename":"San Joaquin River (Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin River, California","nn1":["557387","552190","542591","545992","546757","557305","542705","546122","550168","543258","550982","542999","556501","557231","547060","546108"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["pipe","machinery","industry","might","command","deterioration","overlap","scale","emanate","fixture"]}
