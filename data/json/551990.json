{"path":"551990.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene, likely taken from an aerial viewpoint. It prominently features a large cargo ship in the water, viewed partially from the side and is in motion as evident from the water being displaced at its bow. Positioned in front of the cargo ship, slightly to the left, is a tugboat, also in motion, identifiable by a small wake trailing behind it and creating a swirling pattern in the water beside it.\n\nThe surrounding body of water appears calm, and in the distance stretch shoreline and docks. Sparse vegetation and small structures faintly line the distant shore, suggesting industrial or underdeveloped land usage. Above the shoreline, a sparse area can be seen, possibly indicating this region is not densely populated or integrated with urban development.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph seems to be taken from a significant height, providing a broad and encompassing view of the maritime activity, highlighting logistical or shipping operations in a waterfront setting. The light and color tones of the image suggest it might be a bit dated, with a color palette leaning towards marina blues, earthy browns, and faded greens, providing a sense of the time when the photograph might have been taken.","title":"Mobile oil tanker and tug boat on Arthur Kill--the waterway between New Jersey and Staten Island which is the site of a huge petrochemical manufacturing complex","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548201","545830","555810","545845","551991","547061","546751","555800","549892","544657","550906","548127","552020","551599","544234","555721"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["cargo","ship","shoreline","motion","tugboat","marina","shipping","take","usage","bow"]}
