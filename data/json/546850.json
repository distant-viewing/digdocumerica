{"path":"546850.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a shipping dock, depicted under overcast skies. In the foreground, a man is walking towards the camera. He is dressed in protective work attire comprising a yellow raincoat and trousers, with a dark-colored helmet, also wearing gloves. His attire and demeanor suggest he may be a worker at the dock.\n\nFurther back, another worker is visible; he is wearing a gray jacket and a helmet and appears to be engaged in a task. He is handling some equipment on the ground, possibly related to the ship's operations or maintenance tasks.\n\nThe background features a large ship with the name \"AMERICAN YORK\" visible in reversed lettering indicating the photograph is taken from a quayside looking at the port side of the vessel. The overcast atmosphere and wet ground suggest it might be a rainy day, which would justify the use of raincoats by the dock workers.\n\nVarious elements typical to a port environment, like metal structures (possibly cranes or loading equipment), ropes, and technical apparatus, are scattered around the scene, adding to the industrial feel of the photograph. The overall mood is one of typical dockside activity, characterized by busy manpower and the largeness of maritime operations.","title":"Docking the \"American Lynx\" at the Dundalk Marine Terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546860","546841","546917","552148","547065","546016","548125","546796","547474","548127","547694","546804","546876","546881","545147","546861"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["raincoat","dock","worker","port","helmet","ship","task","operation","shipping","equipment"]}
