{"path":"554847.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph is a close-up shot focusing on the hands and lap of an older man. He holds a silver beer can, labeled with what appears to be a vintage design, in his right hand. His hands and arms are rugged and sun-tanned, showcasing visible veins and signs of physical labor, including some dirt and minor wounds. On his left hand, he wears a metal band watch with a stretched, silver metal bracelet. He appears to be wearing a light-colored, sleeveless undershirt, and there are bits of grass or straw visible in the background suggesting an outdoor, possibly rural setting. The tight focus on the can and hands draws attention to the act of holding the beverage, suggesting a moment of rest or relaxation.","title":"Hands of a Leakey, Texas, resident holding a can of beer, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553053","558268","545974","548998","543705","553482","550805","553519","553054","547330","547313","555529","558313","556614","552105","549054"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["hand","bracelet","watch","vein","beer","beverage","lap","act","straw","band"]}
