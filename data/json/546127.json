{"path":"546127.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor cooking scene at a campsite or informal gathering. The main focus is a large, makeshift grill constructed with a metal grate placed over an open fire. Several large chunks of meat, appearing to be steaks and possibly other cuts, are being cooked on the grill. There are also large stones placed at the edges of the grill to retain heat or support the grate.\n\nThere are a few people standing around the grill, all partially cut off by the photo's framing. To the left, we see someone in a jacket and jeans holding a red-and-white container, possibly a seasoning or a drink. On the right side, another individual is holding a can, which might be a beverage. Everyone appears engaged in casual, social interaction centered around the cooking activity.\n\nThe background shows a somewhat barren outdoor setting with a dirt ground scattered with small rocks and debris. There is an off-road vehicle partially visible on the left side, suggesting a rugged, outdoor locale. The overall setting gives a sense of a communal, relaxed atmosphere where food and company are shared.","title":"Deer hunters prepare their evening meal at the permanent camp they have constructed near wild deer feeding places.
