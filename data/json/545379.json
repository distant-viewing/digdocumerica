{"path":"545379.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph portrays four young individuals standing closely together outdoors in what appears to be a rural or impoverished setting. They are possibly siblings or close friends, and they exhibit a range of expressions from serious to slightly smiling.\n\nOn the left, a child is wearing a light green striped shirt, dark trousers, and exhibits a neutral to mild expression. Next is a person in a faded floral print shirt, looking directly into the camera with a serious expression. The third individual from the left is wearing a slightly oversized white knit vest over a light shirt, also looking seriously towards the camera. The fourth child stands partly behind the others, wearing a mustard-yellow shirt with the left sleeve dramatically torn, displaying a somber expression.\n\nThe background consists of a dilapidated building structure with exposed wooden parts and peeling paint, emphasizing a rustic or neglected environment. There's a dirt road or clearing, with scattered small rocks and patches of sunlight filtering through the surrounding trees.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of unity among the group within a tough, perhaps economically challenged, environment. The lighting, with spots of sunlight, highlights the subjects' faces and brings warmth to the scene, contrasting with the hardship implied by their surroundings and facial expressions.","title":"Neighborhood kids","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545509","545436","552958","556135","551129","553511","551032","552760","545383","551130","543440","544312","547146","553510","556496","556437"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["expression","shirt","hardship","unity","mustard","print","child","friend","camera","vest"]}
