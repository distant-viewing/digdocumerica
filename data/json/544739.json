{"path":"544739.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four people in a lush, green outdoor setting, likely a forest or a bushy mountain area under clear blue skies. The scene is vibrant with natural light and dense vegetation, including many small, green-leafed bushes.\n\nIn the foreground, two young individuals, a boy and a girl, are navigating through the bushes. The boy is wearing a red shirt and a silver helmet, and the girl next to him has long blonde hair, is dressed in a black long-sleeve shirt, and also wears a silver helmet. They both appear to be engaged in a playful activity, possibly exploring or hiking.\n\nBehind them, a bit further up the slope, are two more individuals. One woman, in a white blouse and dark pants, is watching over the children. Next to her, partially obscured by the lush greenery, another individual in a yellow shirt and a hat is visible. The attire of all individuals suggests a casual outdoor activity, potentially a family outing or a guided educational trek.\n\nThe background shows the rising terrain of the hill or mountain they are on, emphasizing the adventurous and steep nature of their surroundings. The overall composition of the photograph focuses on the interaction between the subjects and their rugged, beautiful environment, providing a sense of connection, exploration, and outdoor enjoyment.","title":"Alta Youth Conservation Corps working on trail in Big Cottonwood Canyon","placename":"Alta (Utah)","location":"Alta, Utah","nn1":["543233","543234","553357","557005","553370","543238","557985","554672","554662","553376","543455","554072","545512","543441","558078","552033"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["helmet","girl","boy","individual","bush","shirt","mountain","hiking","outing","enjoyment"]}
