{"path":"548316.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and industrial scene under a heavy overcast sky. A broad expanse of barren land stretches across the foreground, characterized by patches of mud and sparse vegetation. A straight dirt road cuts through the terrain, leading the viewer's eye towards a distant industrial skyline. On the right side of the image, a prominent factory or plant emits dark smoke from its tall chimney, marking a stark contrast against the gray, cloud-filled sky. The background features a wide river or body of water, and on the far side, there are more industrial structures with several large, cylindrical storage tanks. The overall mood of the photograph is somewhat somber, emphasizing themes of industry and possibly environmental impact. The color palette is mainly composed of muted blues, grays, and earth tones, adding to the sense of gloom and overcast weather.","title":"Fresh Kills landfill area on Staten Island.
