{"path":"548251.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of an elderly man who appears to be engaged directly with the viewer. The man is tipping his dark cap with his left hand, a gesture that suggests a polite greeting or an adjustment of his hat. He has fair skin and his face shows signs of age, including wrinkles and visible expressions lines. His eyes are partially obscured under the brim of the hat, but they appear to be looking towards the camera with an expression that could be interpreted as friendly or contemplative.\n\nHe is wearing a dark woolen sweater under a plaid collared shirt that peeks out at the neckline, adding a touch of color to his attire. In his mouth, he holds a pipe, adding a classic, perhaps vintage characteristic to his persona.\n\nThe background of the photo is softly out of focus, directing all attention to the man. The tones of the image are muted with a true-to-life palette, emphasizing the authenticity and unposed nature of the photograph. The manâ€™s facial features and the details of his clothing texture are sharply in focus, capturing the essence of his character and mood at that moment. Overall, the photograph portrays a moment of everyday life, possibly suggesting themes of aging, simplicity, and a relaxed demeanor.","title":"A Rockport citizen bids good morning with a tip of his hat.","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["547179","556478","548226","554858","548236","548218","547028","547282","554857","548224","552103","556563","553605","552871","549054","547007"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["neckline","adjustment","authenticity","interpret","wrinkle","man","mute","hat","tip","characteristic"]}
