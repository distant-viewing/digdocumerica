{"path":"554107.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a vibrant red anthurium flower, commonly known as the flamingo flower. The flower has a characteristic large, glossy spathe that curves outward and has a waxy texture. The spathe is heart-shaped with a spike-like spadix protruding from the center, which is densely covered in tiny white, pink-tipped florets that look textured and slightly bumpy.\n\nThe background of the image is dark and somewhat blurred, showcasing only hints of green from other plants, enhancing the focus on the bright and shiny red of the anthurium. The lighting on the flower creates a soft reflection on the spatheâ€™s surface and enhances the subtle vein patterns across its form. This effect contributes to the flower's vibrant and exotic appeal, making it the focal point of the composition with its striking color contrast against the darker, less distinct background.","title":"At Hawaiian greenhouse, inc, near pahoa, anthuriums grow under a sun screen.
