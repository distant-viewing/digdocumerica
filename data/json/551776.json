{"path":"551776.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene scene likely captured in an urban park. It showcases a view of a calm, reflective pond bordered by a paved path. The foreground features leafy branches that partially frame the top part of the image, adding a natural canopy to the scene. The color tones suggest that it might be either early spring or autumn, as the leaves show a slight hint of seasonal change.\n\nIn the distance, you can observe a backdrop of towering high-rise buildings, indicating that this park is situated in the middle of a bustling city. The architectural styles of the buildings vary, suggesting a mix of historical and more modern developments. This juxtaposition of city life and natural tranquility presents a common urban park scene where nature and urbanity converge.\n\nOn the path beside the pond, a small group of people can be seen walking and interacting. One person in a red jacket seems to be in a dynamic pose, perhaps pointing at something in the distance or gesturing while talking, which adds a sense of life and activity to the peaceful surroundings.\n\nThis setting could be a popular place for city dwellers to enjoy a break from the urban environment, offering a peaceful retreat with views of nature and water, all under the watchful eyes of the city's skyscrapers. The overall composition of the photograph is balanced with natural elements in the foreground and the urban environment in the background, connected by human presence in the mid-ground.","title":"Couple stroll by Central Park pool","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547784","550052","549986","550051","558094","544808","549815","550075","547099","549516","547251","557257","551767","550298","550074","550752"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["city","pond","dweller","park","path","retreat","converge","talk","skyscraper","gesture"]}
