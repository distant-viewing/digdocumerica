{"path":"553815.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a riverboat at twilight, creating a moody and picturesque scene. The boat is illuminated distinctively, highlighting its multi-level structure with strings of lights that outline its shape against the dimming sky. Lights are brightly visible on both the top tier and along the side decks.\n\nThe riverboat emits smoke from two stacks, suggesting that it is powered by steam. The smoke is dark and wafts above the boat, contrasting with the fading light of the sky in the background. The boat's stern is brilliantly lit, and the light reflections shimmer on the rippling water surface, adding a gentle glow to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the natural gradient of the twilight sky merges from a deeper blue to shades of black, hinting at the encroaching night. The combination of the lit-up boat, the reflective water, and the tranquil sky creates a serene and almost ethereal atmosphere.\n\nThere are no visible people or other objects in the fore- or backgrounds, which places the entire focus on the boat and its interaction with the light and water around it.","title":"The \"Belle of Louisville\" on the Ohio river.
