{"path":"555615.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor domestic scene dominated by a large green lawn. On the left, there is a two-story, white-clapboard house featuring a covered porch and visible wear on its exterior, contributing to a rustic charm. In front of the house, obscuring part of the view, are densely planted flowering bushes or shrubs.\n\nPositioned on the right side of the image is a barn or shed, painted in dark red with hints of wear, closely matching the rural aesthetic of the house. Between the house and the shed, a man is engaged in mowing the lawn with a push lawn mower. The man appears focused on his task, and his presence adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting.\n\nIn the background, the scene shifts to a slightly industrial look with a visible crane and some other structures, possibly construction equipment or storage containers, suggesting ongoing developments or construction in the area beyond the immediate domestic setting.\n\nThe scene is framed under a bright, clear sky and the overall lighting suggests a sunny day, casting shadows and enhancing the vivid greens of the grass and the darker tones of the vegetation and buildings. The image balances elements of rural home life with hints of industrial activity in the distance, offering a snapshot of daily life and ongoing changes in a rural community.","title":"Many people in southeastern Ohio are never far away from the sight of strip mining.
