{"path":"554337.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting, likely a lecture hall or theater, where a woman is giving a presentation or speech at a podium. The overall ambiance is dimly lit, contributing to a focused and somewhat dramatic atmosphere. The woman is dressed elegantly in a red jacket, and she appears to be reading from papers or notes on the podium.\n\nThe background is heavily shadowed but includes architectural features such as large columns or walls that rise towards a ceiling punctuated with several recessed lights. These lights emit a soft glow that adds a low level of ambient light to the scene. On the right side of the image, a striking beam of light, which refracts into a spectrum of colors much like a prism effect, cuts diagonally across the composition. This light beam originates outside the frame and its source is not visible, adding a layer of visual interest and a slightly mysterious or theatrical element to the scene.\n\nThe focus of the photo is on the woman at the podium, illuminated by an unseen light source that highlights her and her immediate surroundings, making her the most prominent element in the photograph. Her presence and activity suggest an event such as a lecture, reading, or formal presentation.","title":"Citizens meeting on transportation, a forum on \"Strategies for Clean Air\" proposed by the New York City EPA","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554343","554344","554342","557703","546550","554333","556451","543924","546558","554345","554386","556694","543925","544318","546580","557038"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["presentation","source","beam","spectrum","speech","woman","theater","hall","reading","note"]}
