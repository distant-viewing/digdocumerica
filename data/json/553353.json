{"path":"553353.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site by a river. The foreground prominently features a construction framework, which consists of wooden planks supporting a concrete mold with exposed rebar, preparing for a concrete pour which will possibly form part of a foundation or a wall structure. This structure appears to be in the early stages of construction.\n\nThe middle ground shows a cleared pathway or road running parallel to the riverbank. This dirt path is devoid of vegetation and stretches alongside the river, hinting at recent excavation or landscaping work, potentially for the construction project or for general riverbank maintenance.\n\nThe river itself is calm and flows gently through the scene, and is situated immediately adjacent to the construction and the path, adding a scenic yet industrial contrast to the image.\n\nIn the background, trees with budding leaves suggest that the photograph was taken in spring. Further away, the opposite bank of the river is lined with dense trees, and some built structures can be slightly seen through the foliage, possibly indicating a residential area or more industrial structures nearby.\n\nThe sky is slightly overcast, casting a soft natural light that evenly illuminates the scene, which gives the photograph a somewhat muted tone. The overall setting indicates an urban or semi-urban area where riverbank stabilization or development is in progress.","title":"The epa water quality office and the New Hampshire water supply and pollution control commission together are assisting the construction of water pollution control facilities at Nashua","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["545858","553379","553392","553380","556940","553375","544282","553932","548361","553352","549912","557728","547829","546403","547996","553453"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["construction","river","riverbank","mold","rebar","path","foundation","pour","bud","landscaping"]}
