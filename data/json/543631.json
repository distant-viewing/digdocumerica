{"path":"543631.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image captures a lively outdoor scene where several people are enjoying a meal by a lake. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the photograph:\n\n1. **People**: The photograph shows a group of people of different ages, likely a family or group of friends gathered at a lakeside. There is a young woman on the left, standing and holding out a white plate of food, possibly offering it to others. She has blonde hair and wears a black t-shirt with striped pants. There are two men standing in the center and right of the image. Both men are older; one is in a striped shirt holding a drink and a burger, and the other is in a white shirt holding a plate of food delicately. A young toddler sits at the bottom left of the photo, engrossed in a plastic container. Another very small child stands near the center, seemingly being helped or watched by an adult, who is carrying a drink and a paper plate.\n\n2. **Activities**: The group appears to be engaging in a casual picnic or barbecue, each busy eating or handling food, with a relaxed and leisurely vibe typical of an outdoor gathering. The toddler seems particularly absorbed in playing with or eating from the container.\n\n3. **Objects**: On the ground around the people, various typical picnic items can be seen, including paper plates, plastic containers, a white cooler box, and some bags that potentially hold extra supplies or food items. There is also a brown glass bottle near one of the standing men.\n\n4. **Background**: The setting is picturesque, situated by a calm lake surrounded by evergreen trees. The reflections of the trees can be seen in the water, indicating it is likely late afternoon given the lighting and shadow patterns.\n\n5. **Composition**: The lighting in this photograph highlights the left side and some centrally located subjects, with some shadows falling across the scene. The balance of light and dark adds a vibrant quality to the image, emphasizing the serene yet spirited nature of a family gathering by the lake. There is a natural framing provided by the trees, focusing the attention on the group and their interaction.\n\nThis image provides a nostalgic glimpse into family and social gatherings, highlighted by the beautiful natural scenery and the simplicity of enjoying a meal outdoors.","title":"Picnicing on lake tahoe shore","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543609","545738","550026","556298","543892","545267","549444","557488","548568","545228","558188","551276","557664","547756","552032","550827"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["plate","food","family","toddler","picnic","container","meal","group","drink","lake"]}
