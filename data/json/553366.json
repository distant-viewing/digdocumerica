{"path":"553366.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a plant with several blossoming flowers. The plant showcases a cluster of oval-shaped leaves that are deep green, emanating from a central stem. The focal point of the image are the flowers themselves, which appear tender and soft. They are mostly closed or semi-open buds, colored a gentle pink with a hint of purple. Each bud has a smooth texture and displays delicate intricate details, hinting towards a species that might be part of the orchid family or a related group.\n\nThe flowers are gathered tightly around the top of the stem and are at various stages of blooming. Tiny petals starting to peel back from some of the blooms suggest they are just beginning to open. The background of the image is blurred and nondescriptive, in shades of dark green and rust, which helps in accentuating the sharpness and colors of the flowers in the foreground. This technique places the entire focus on the delicate structure and colors of the plant. The lighting is soft and natural, conveying a sense of tranquility and the fresh ambiance of a natural setting, possibly hinting at an outdoor location in a garden or wild environment. There's a subtle interplay of shadows and highlights across the surfaces of leaves and petals that enhances the depth and texture of the scene.","title":"One of the many kinds of wild flowers growing on the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of pepperell","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["554595","557500","547613","554587","542970","554843","554576","550462","553588","544875","543597","557167","545695","553361","554115","557618"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","bud","petal","stem","plant","blooming","sharpness","tender","green","begin"]}
