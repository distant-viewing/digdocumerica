{"path":"545712.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures three vibrant pink cactus flowers in full bloom. The flowers are set against a soft focus background primarily made up of earthy tones. Each flower features numerous delicate pink petals surrounding dense clusters of bright yellow stamens which form the central focus. Additionally, a network of long, slender, and sharp white cactus spines radiates outward from around the flowers, adding a contrasting texture to the soft petals. The visual appeal is enhanced by the natural light that seems to spotlight the flowers, highlighting their colors against the subdued brown and reddish hues of the ground in the background. The perspective and depth of field focus chiefly on the intricate details of the flowers and their immediate surroundings, blurring out the rest.","title":"Fishhook cactus blossoms","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544877","544891","544582","544885","545722","554844","545709","554843","545727","554595","557545","555370","543597","545309","553366","557500"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","cactus","petal","spine","stamen","spotlight","radiate","appeal","bloom","network"]}
