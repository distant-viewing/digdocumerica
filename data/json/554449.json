{"path":"554449.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene likely from a parade or public event. In the foreground, there is a group of young girls dressed in black leotards and white socks, joyfully participating in a baton twirling activity. They seem to be in motion, some looking focused on their performance while others appear jubilant, their hair bouncing as they move.\n\nBehind the group of girls, adult spectators and participants of the event are visible. Notably, there are several men in uniform, suggesting a formal or ceremonial contextâ€”possibly police or military officers. There is also a woman walking alongside the baton twirlers, who seems to be managing or directing them.\n\nThe background shows parked cars lining the area, indicating that this event is taking place in a large outdoor parking lot or similar open space. A variety of cars from what looks like the 1960s or 1970s can be seen, adding a historical context to the image. The overall environment and attire suggest that this might be a community event in a suburban or rural setting, possibly during a national holiday given the presence of uniforms and a ceremonial feel.","title":"Young majorettes run to join Memorial Day parade at inlet near the Fulton Chain Lakes.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["552656","547022","554451","554450","556283","556278","553237","552653","556279","549577","546995","557709","556284","556277","553267","551019"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["event","girl","uniform","context","holiday","sock","officer","police","parade","participate"]}
