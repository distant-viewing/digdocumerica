{"path":"554781.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph is of the corner of a weathered wooden building. The building features vertical wooden siding that is worn and aged, showcasing a variety of tones from dark gray to lighter brown, suggesting exposure to elements over time.\n\nOn the side of the building, there are two signs. In the upper half, a round, blue sign with a white cross and text displays the identity of the building as a Methodist Church, noting that it welcomes everyone every Sunday at 11 am. Below this, on the lower half closer to the corner, there is a rectangular, white \"FOR SALE\" sign with black text.\n\nAdjacent to the building's edge, a metal post supports a street sign marking it as street number 9, with two signs pointing in perpendicular directions, though the other road name is obscured from view. The background of the scene includes a glimpse of another building and a vintage car, hinting at a small-town street setting. The atmosphere implies a peaceful, somewhat deserted or quiet locale, possibly capturing a moment from a past era given the style of the car and the overall mood of the photograph.","title":"As the population moves from stripped areas in southeastern Ohio, some towns are slowly abandoned.
