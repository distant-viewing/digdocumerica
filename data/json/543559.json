The image shows a group of discarded tires lying haphazardly on the forest floor. The setting is a pine forest with tall trees and dense foliage in the background, indicating a remote or less frequented area. The ground is covered with a mix of soil, pine needles and small pine cones. No human presence or animals are visible in the scene, highlighting the abandonment of the waste. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with shadows casting diagonally across the scene, adding a calm yet somber tone to the image. This photograph likely serves to emphasize the negative impact of human waste on natural environments, urging viewers to consider the consequences of such pollution.","title":"Berkeley marine area","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["547517","551440","557973","547846","544640","546838","556942","551247","546878","544648","544644","544652","542531","546913","550352","545029"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["pine","forest","waste","pollution","consequence","frequent","cone","consider","needle","tire"]}
