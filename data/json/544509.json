{"path":"544509.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant tidal mudflat teeming with life. The focal point of the image is a group of small, colorful crabs, predominantly red and orange, scattered across the scene. These crabs vary slightly in size and are seen engaging with their environment, some partially buried, while others are perched on top of the mud, shells, or amidst seaweed.\n\nThe environment shown is a wet, muddy surface dotted with an assortment of sea debris including small shells, stones, and patches of green seaweed. The texture of the mudflat appears gritty and uneven, suggesting a natural and organic ecosystem. The composition is rich in natural colorsâ€”from the browns of the wet mud to the greens of the seaweed and the striking reds of the crabs.\n\nLight plays across the surface creating subtle reflections and accentuating the textures of the mudflat and its inhabitants. The natural lighting suggests it might be daytime, possibly when the tide is low, exposing this bustling microhabitat. The overall scene captures a moment of dynamic stillness in a marine environment, emphasizing biodiversity and the beauty of an often overlooked ecosystem.","title":"Small crabs in water near Chokoloskee Rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545092","554005","552285","543909","545183","542869","547504","545095","546214","552145","543183","552147","544687","546308","544264","544620"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["mudflat","crab","seaweed","shell","mud","ecosystem","inhabitant","bury","teem","biodiversity"]}
