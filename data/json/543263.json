{"path":"543263.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a coastal landscape, notable for its rugged, rocky terrain that forms a cove embracing a small stretch of beach. The landscape is predominantly covered with sparse, low vegetation, mainly bushes and possibly small trees primarily clustered along the curves of the terrain.\n\nThe rocky hillsides extend downwards towards a sandy shore where a large colony of penguins can be seen gathered, dotting the beach in a somewhat clustered formation, which suggests that this area may serve as a breeding or resting ground for these birds. \n\nIn the background, beyond the cove, the ocean is visible, showing a calm, serene blue that contrasts with the dry, earthy tones of the rocky shores. There are a few white specks on the ocean’s surface around the cove, which could be small waves or possibly even more wildlife. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the intersection of rocky, arid wildlife habitat with the vast, tranquil ocean—a natural habitat likely centered around the life patterns of the penguin colony. The image captures a remote, natural environment where wildlife and the natural landscape are predominant elements, unaffected by human activity.","title":"Birds and dunes","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555137","543297","543289","545122","552910","543299","543291","548604","553775","543204","543309","543250","543295","554102","543090","543300"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cove","wildlife","ocean","habitat","beach","shore","embrace","speck","intersection","hillside"]}
