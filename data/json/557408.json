{"path":"557408.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban scene featuring two elderly individuals engaged in separate activities outside their homes. The setting is a tree-lined street with a row of residential houses.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a man crouched down near the sidewalk. He is dressed in a checkered shirt, dark pants, and a hat. He seems to be fixing or examining something near the ground at the corner of a chain link fence that encloses one of the properties.\n\nIn the middle ground, another individual, who appears to be a woman based on the hairstyle and attire, is seen from behind, walking away from the camera along a pathway that runs adjacent to the fence. She is dressed in a light-colored blouse and dark trousers.\n\nThe houses in the scene are typical of American suburban architecture from the mid-20th century, featuring siding, front porches, and well-maintained lawns. One of the houses has a porch with what looks like chairs and possibly other outdoor furniture, suggesting a space used for relaxation and viewing the street.\n\nIn the background, lush greenery can be seen behind the houses, indicating that this neighborhood might be near a wooded area or park. The overall ambiance is peaceful, reflecting a quiet residential area possibly during the daytime as indicated by the bright lighting and shadows present.","title":"Man working on his fence and well-tended yard in Boomer near the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. The houses were built when the plant opened in the mid-1930's and rented to employees who later bought them at bargain prices. Many people still work for the company, and others are retired. Total plant emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975, from 113,252 to 2,649 tons annually. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
