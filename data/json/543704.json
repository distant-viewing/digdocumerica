{"path":"543704.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of an older person's hand holding a lit cigarette between the index and middle fingers. The fingers are deeply wrinkled and the nails appear slightly unkempt, suggesting age and perhaps a rugged life. The skin shows signs of aging and wear, with prominent veins and creases visible. The person's cuff, visible on the wrist, is made of a grey material, possibly denim or a heavy cotton, and it shows a hint of fray, adding to the worn and aged appearance of the individual.\n\nThe cigarette itself, likely a manufactured one as indicated by the clean, even roll and a filter visible at the bottom, is partly burnt with ash at the tip. This suggests it's been lit recently. The background is uniformly dark, focusing all the attention on the hand and the cigarette. The lighting highlights the details of the hand’s anatomy and the texture of the skin, creating a striking contrast against the dark background. The composition is such that it draws the viewer's attention directly to the subject’s action of smoking, emphasizing the tactile interaction of the fingers with the cigarette.","title":"Hands of uranium miner at rest","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553054","555529","553482","547007","548458","554912","556428","554858","549054","553505","544202","547329","547313","547028","544232","545974"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cigarette","finger","skin","tactile","hand","smoking","ash","cuff","wrist","vein"]}
