{"path":"551170.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a river scene. In the center of the river, there are two barges being towed by tugboats. The first barge appears to be carrying multiple shipping containers or cargo, while the second is divided into several sections, possibly carrying different types of cargo or materials.\n\nThe river bends around a densely packed urban area with a variety of buildings, likely industrial based on the visible structures and storage tanks. On the left riverbank, close to the barges, there's a large facility that includes several large, elongated buildings and some smaller structures, complemented by what seems to be a loading dock or pier extending into the river. This setup suggests a significant amount of industrial activity, possibly related to manufacturing or processing.\n\nOn the right side of the river, there is a more open space with trees and vegetation, creating a natural contrast to the industrial left bank. The upper right side of the photo shows a bridge crossing the river, connecting the urban and more vegetated areas.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a busy industrial riverfront scene with a clear display of river-based transport logistics in an urban setting.","title":"A coal tow going downstream passes a chemical tow going upstream at South Charleston on the Kanawha River.","placename":"Charleston (W.
