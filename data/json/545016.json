{"path":"545016.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a blend of outdoor signage and a life-sized dinosaur replica in a landscaped environment. On the left side of the photograph, thereâ€™s a prominent vertical sign, predominantly in dark blue, which displays a variety of text in white font. The content of the sign includes phrases such as \"Prehistoric Gardens,\" \"Nature's Replicas of Historic and Other Displayed Animals,\" and \"Oregon's Rain Forest - An Educational Exhibit Recommended by LIFE, Parents Magazine, Popular Mechanics, and Sunset among many other Nationally-Known Publications.\"\n\nTo the right of the sign, positioned on a paved area, stands a sizable dinosaur replica. The dinosaur, which appears to represent a Tyrannosaurus Rex based on its shape and form, is painted in black and yellow. Its posture suggests movement with one leg forward, mouth open, and tail extending backward, adding a sense of dynamism to the display.\n\nThe background is less distinct but seems to include a mix of well-maintained bushes and possibly trees, hinting at a meticulously cared-for park or garden setting. The scene also features what looks like a road or driveway extending behind the dinosaur, on which a dark-colored car is parked, adding a contemporary layer to the otherwise prehistoric and naturalistic theme of the foreground. Overall, the photograph illustrates an interesting juxtaposition between historical replicas and educational promotion in a natural setting.","title":"\"Oregon's Rain Forest\" park","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["554457","543504","544845","545221","544897","545955","555439","549113","543094","554103","554185","554456","546187","548174","545109","543095"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["promotion","dynamism","font","phrase","sign","driveway","dark","tail","mouth","content"]}
