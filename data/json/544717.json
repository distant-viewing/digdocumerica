{"path":"544717.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph illustrates a diverse industrial and recreational scene by the waterfront. In the foreground, a sailboat is captured in motion on the water; its sail is predominantly white with a large, slightly obscured sail number \"7296\" visible at the top. The hull of the boat is red, and it is manned by at least one individual wearing a yellow outfit, skillfully navigating the water.\n\nIntriguingly juxtaposed against this leisure scene is an industrial backdrop featuring a shipyard or dock area. Large, towering structures dominate the background – including cranes, metal scaffolding, and various buildings associated with ship construction or maintenance. These structures appear somewhat aged, with signs of rust and wear, indicating heavy usage and an industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe water on which the sailboat glides shimmers with reflections of light, suggesting either a setting sun or favorable weather conditions that enhance the vividness of the scene. To the right, extending out into the water, are several long, narrow piers or docks, possibly used for mooring boats or as part of the industrial facility’s infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the serene and leisurely activity of sailing with the rugged, utilitarian nature of the industrial environment, captured under a sky dotted with fluffy clouds that add a dynamic texture to the upper part of the image.","title":"Sailing for the starting line in Oakland harbor races","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552347","557483","549432","544665","544667","544669","556190","557425","549413","543305","548117","550754","548513","552010","547452","548524"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","dock","mooring","shipyard","scaffolding","boat","towere","usage","sailing"]}
