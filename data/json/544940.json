{"path":"544940.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a serene natural landscape scene. In the foreground, there is a meandering river, filled with clear water and flanked by grassy banks scattered with rocks and occasional fallen tree logs. A few trees stand isolated in the scene, their thin trunks slightly swaying or bent.\n\nMoving upwards, the mid-ground showcases a field of vibrant green grass, suggesting the freshness of spring or early summer. There is a visible fence splitting the green meadow, hinting at property demarcation or managed land.\n\nBeyond the meadow, dense forests covering rolling hills stretch into the distance. The trees on these hills show variations in color, ranging from deep greens of evergreens to brownish hues of leafless or budding deciduous trees, indicating the photograph might have been taken in late spring.\n\nThe background is dominated by striking snow-capped mountain peaks under a bright blue sky. The mountains, with their rugged, angular shapes, contrast sharply against the softer forms of the hills and the flat meadows, providing a majestic and dramatic backdrop to the lush greens and flowing water in the foreground.\n\nThis vividly captures the essence of a mountainous landscape transitioning from the cold of winter to the warmth of spring, emphasizing the richness and diversity of natural environments.","title":"Mt.
