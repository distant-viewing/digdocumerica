{"path":"543979.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This image captures an outdoor scene focused on a young girl interacting with a series of large, spherical objects, which appear to be some form of tanks or buoys, painted in a matte grey color. The girl, wearing a light-colored top with blue patterns and yellow trousers, is bending over and appears to be examining or playing with one of these spheres. She has blonde hair that falls over her shoulders.\n\nThe background reveals a rural setting with a wide, open field that is bordered by trees. The grass is somewhat overgrown and patches of different colors in the field suggest it might be late summer. Several similar grey spheres are arranged in a line receding into the background, suggesting a storage or staging area of some sort.\n\nThe lighting appears natural, indicative of an overcast day, casting soft diffuse light on the scene with no harsh shadows. The image generally conveys a sense of quiet and calm, focusing on a moment of childish curiosity in a rustic environment.","title":"Tennessee--near Nashville","placename":"Nashville (Tenn.)","location":"Nashville, Tennessee","nn1":["543875","543655","543466","543457","548119","552957","543740","546897","543468","544143","544200","552961","549674","548965","547727","556541"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sphere","girl","grey","reced","buoy","shoulders","field","curiosity","sort","diffuse"]}
