{"path":"544836.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a striking natural landscape under a vast sky, where different elements come together to create a serene and picturesque scene. The main focus of the image is a vivid rainbow arching beautifully in the sky. One end of the rainbow seems to touch down near a cluster of small buildings located at the base of a gently sloping hill. These structures, possibly farm buildings or a rural home, are modest and painted white, contrasting with the lush greenery surrounding them.\n\nThe expanse in front of these buildings is covered by a vast grassy field, suggesting a rural or pastoral setting. The vegetation appears fresh and vibrant, indicating it might be spring or early summer. On the right side, a smaller group of buildings or possibly barns and animal pens can be observed, reinforcing the rural farming atmosphere.\n\nThe hill itself is quite large and barren towards the top, lacking significant vegetation but contributing to the sweeping grandeur of the scene. Above the landscape, the sky is overcast with hints of blue peeking through, suggesting either a recent rainfall or impending change in weather, which could explain the appearance of the rainbow.\n\nAdding to the overall calmness and isolated feel of the photograph, there's a notable absence of visible people or modern technological elements, reinforcing the timelessness and tranquility of the scene. A solitary bird can be seen flying in the sky near the rainbow, adding a sense of scale and life to the otherwise still and quiet setting.","title":"Colorado--South Park","placename":"South Park (Colo. : Flat)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553854","543129","543123","550584","543124","550438","543130","549142","550390","554801","549256","552483","545040","555603","557674","549157"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["rainbow","reinforce","timelessness","pen","explain","peek","building","rainfall","calmness","hill"]}
