{"path":"542819.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape heavily influenced by deforestation or fire, showing a stark and somewhat desolate scene. The foreground is dominated by the charred remains of several large, fallen tree logs. These logs are burned to varying degrees and scattered across a rugged terrain consisting of ash, debris, and small rocks.\n\nThe terrain slopes upwards from the foreground towards a hill in the background. Sparse vegetation can be seen in the distance, incorporating a few standing, yet thin, trees that look like they have survived some form of environmental distress. The sky is clear and vibrant, contributing a stark contrast to the dark ground covered with remains of the forest.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of recent destruction or recovery from a catastrophic event such as a wildfire, with the focus on the burned logs making a powerful statement about the impact of such events on natural environments. The image evokes a somber reflection on environmental degradation and resilience.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["555202","555088","555094","542598","555113","553565","555162","553626","555159","545264","555136","555089","553571","553572","555150","553561"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["remain","log","ash","distress","wildfire","statement","recovery","deforestation","event","degree"]}
