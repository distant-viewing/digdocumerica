{"path":"549302.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph features the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, taken from a low angle that emphasizes their height. The two skyscrapers dominate the image, standing parallel to each other against a backdrop of a light blue sky with some white clouds. The buildings have a sleek, modern design with narrow windows that create a grid-like pattern across their facades.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s an urban setting that appears to be a construction or redevelopment area with various materials like logs and wooden planks spread across the ground. A few people are visible sitting and standing among the materials, possibly workers or passersby taking a break. The area immediately surrounding the towers seems to be less developed or under construction, contrasting with the completed and polished appearance of the skyscrapers.\n\nThe scene captures a moment of everyday life juxtaposed with architectural grandeur, highlighting the scale and impact of the towers within their urban environment.","title":"Towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan seen from West Street.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555275","555274","547691","548409","548387","549918","549915","549301","549914","555278","549764","550116","549317","549768","548319","548408"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["skyscraper","passersby","tower","construction","complete","material","plank","grandeur","grid","height"]}
