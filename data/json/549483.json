{"path":"549483.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a panoramic view of a waterfront area with multiple features. The scene includes a broad expanse of blue water, which appears to be a river, that dominates the foreground. On the left side of the image, there are long, narrow pathways and piers extending into the water, and a small moving boat is visible, creating a foamy wake behind it.\n\nOn the right-hand side, the photograph shows substantial man-made developments; these are primarily located on a large landmass creating a division between two bodies of water. There are small pockets of sandy beaches along the coastlines, and further inland, a variety of buildings and structures can be seen, consisting of both industrial and recreational facilities. There are paved pathways, grassy areas, a few trees, and parking lots visible as well.\n\nToward the top of the image, the river appears to split into two sections. On the far right, another body of water leads into an urban area densely packed with houses and tree-lined streets, visible at the edge of the frame. The region suggests a harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and water-based activities, illustrating a bustling yet organized waterfront community.","title":"Point where the Buffalo river discharges into lake erie at the mouth of the niagara river.
