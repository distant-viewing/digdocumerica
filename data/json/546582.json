{"path":"546582.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial or bird-eye view overlooking an urban area leading up to a large river. At the top of the image, the river extends horizontally across the frame, bending slightly towards the right. Below the river, a bridge spans its width, with another smaller bridge visible further down. The river banks are populated with lush greenery and smaller water tributaries can be seen joining the main river.\n\nCloser to the bottom of the image, an urban landscape marked by various buildings takes precedence. A prominent building with a bright orange roof stands out due to its color and its central positioning amid the more uniform gray and brown rooftops. This building is encircled by neatly arranged streets, smaller buildings, and patches of greenery, indicating a well-planned city area. Several notable pathways and minor parks are discernible, which add a structured green space to the urban environment.\n\nThe composition is framed by the backdrop of a slightly cloudy sky with hues of blue and occasional streaks of pink from the clouds, suggesting either early morning or later afternoon lighting. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of how the urban setting integrates with the natural landscape along the river.","title":"Looking south, White House to Potomac River","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546706","551188","546669","547263","548407","556949","546673","550548","557421","548317","551189","553213","556951","551178","547253","546694"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["river","bridge","streak","width","positioning","pink","rooftop","building","greenery","bird"]}
