{"path":"543175.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a rugged coastal scene characterized by a steep, rocky cliffside meeting a narrow strip of beach. The cliff is composed of variously colored earth tones — shades of brown, grey, and some reddish hues — and appears to consist of large boulders and smaller rocky debris, suggesting recent landslides or natural erosion.\n\nAt the foot of this cliff, jutting onto the black pebbly beach and partly into the surf of an ocean or sea, there's a noticeably out-of-place wreck of an old boat. The boat is small, appearing somewhat battered, with visible damage to its structure and peeling paintwork mainly in red and white. Its position indicates it may have been washed ashore or abandoned, now serving as a stark contrast to the natural environment around it.\n\nThe ocean adjacent to this spectacle is visible at the edge of the photo, showing gentle waves lapping against the shore. The waters are dark, possibly indicating depth or simply reflecting the overcast or shadowed lighting conditions of the scene. No people or other human activities are visible in this desolate, somewhat dramatic natural landscape, emphasizing a sense of isolation and the relentless natural processes at work in coastal environments.","title":"Abandoned car","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543057","553771","545132","543061","554004","543291","553775","543053","545125","557469","543309","545122","543295","543306","547118","543249"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","landslide","beach","surf","spectacle","meeting","boat","boulder","foot"]}
