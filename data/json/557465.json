{"path":"557465.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid aerial view where natural and human-made elements converge along a coastal landscape. On the left side of the image, the deep blue ocean is noticeable with white-capped waves rhythmically approaching the sandy shoreline. Parallel to the beach, a busy highway cuts through the scene, filled with numerous vehicles indicating a moment of busy traffic flow.\n\nThe highway is closely bordered on its other side by a steep cliff face, showing layers of earth and small areas of vegetation which give way to a series of rolling mountains that fill the background. These mountains, bathed in shades of brown and green under bright sunlight, add a rugged texture to the landscape, contrasting sharply with the organized linearity of the highway and the natural curves of the waves.\n\nThe composition of this photograph masterfully captures the juxtaposition between natural beauty and engineered efficiency, showcasing how human activities are woven into the natural environment. The dramatic perspective emphasizes the vastness and the dynamic interactions between land, sea, and human presence in this coastal region.","title":"Coastline, which is south of Los Angeles","placename":"San Clemente (Calif.)","location":"San Clemente, California","nn1":["543435","548143","557482","553774","554156","557453","545104","543427","545918","553778","554064","554170","557532","554157","543433","543429"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["highway","wave","engineere","efficiency","mountains","approach","rolling","bath","cliff","fill"]}
