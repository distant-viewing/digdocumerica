{"path":"542692.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image displays two potted plants placed side-by-side on a surface with a snowy background. Each plant is partially supported by a wooden stake, which has black tape wrapped around the top.\n\nThe plant on the left appears somewhat wilted, with several leaves showing significant drooping and discoloration, possibly indicating poor health or water stress. In contrast, the plant on the right looks healthier, exhibiting upright and vibrant green leaves.\n\nBoth pots are black and round, filled with soil, and appear to be of similar size. The overall condition of the plants makes them a study in contrast, possibly being used to represent different treatments or conditions in an experimental setting for plant growth or health. The snow in the background suggests that the photo was taken in a cold environment or during the winter season, adding an element of harsh conditions to the image's context.","title":"Smog-damaged and \"clean\" plants shown together at the statewide air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542694","542693","542685","542689","557323","552111","555371","557197","555359","553361","544731","542573","542610","554575","555548","555884"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","health","condition","tape","stake","stress","discoloration","pot","treatment","leave"]}
