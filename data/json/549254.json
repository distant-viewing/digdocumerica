{"path":"549254.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a young child engaged in an outdoor activity. The child, who appears to be a boy with short blond hair, is squatting low to the ground, closely examining or interacting with a patch of vegetation. He is wearing a long-sleeve, yellow sweater and blue pants.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor environment with varied vegetation. The child is focused on a specific area where green shoots or young plants are growing in rows, suggesting a garden or a cultivated plot. The ground looks somewhat muddy and is interspersed with grass. Towards the background, there is more lush greenery, possibly a grassy field, and a hint of unfocused natural landscape.\n\nThe photo captures a moment of curiosity or discovery, emphasizing a child's interaction with nature. The lighting suggests it might be a sunny day due to the brightness and shadows visible on the ground and the child's sweater. The composition focuses closely on the boy and the immediate surroundings, blurring out the distant background to concentrate on the child's activity and the immediate environment.","title":"Rial Redding is the third generation of Reddings on this land, which is now threatened by the strip-mining plans of the Westmoreland Coal Company.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["543871","551763","551765","542768","548119","555398","552035","552591","543688","558108","545307","543740","552942","553507","545539","543476"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["child","sweater","boy","discovery","plot","ground","curiosity","brightness","garden","vegetation"]}
