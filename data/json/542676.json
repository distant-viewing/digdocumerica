{"path":"542676.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking, layered view of a mountainous area enveloped in soft, hazy light. The terrain is dominated by a series of mountain ridges, each progressively fading into a lighter tone of blue and purple, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The mist between the layers adds a mystical quality and a gentle gradient from the foreground to the background.\n\nIn the foreground at the bottom left, parts of the terrain are visible and slightly darker compared to the misty mountains. The ridge-lines are jagged and provide a textured contrast to the smoothness of the fog. Just above the horizon, there is an orange glow that suggests either a sunrise or sunset, contributing to the serene and tranquil mood of the scene.\n\nThe sky above the mountain peaks is a gradient of light blue, showing early or late daylight. The overall composition and color palette of pale blues, purples, and hints of pink and orange create a peaceful, almost otherworldly landscape. The image appears to have been taken from a high vantage point, possibly from another mountain or from an aircraft.\n\nAdditionally, the photograph exhibits some signs of age or wear, as seen in the visible scratches and spots on the image, which adds a vintage, timeless feel to the scene.","title":"Smog, San Gabriel Mountains","placename":"East Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"East Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544070","546764","542923","554634","557558","542681","552695","555378","555131","553825","543023","554962","542848","554402","554398","546749"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","ridge","purple","gradient","orange","smoothness","scratch","blue","pink","aircraft"]}
