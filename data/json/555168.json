{"path":"555168.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures two men involved in a task within a warehouse or industrial setting. They are standing between large, cylindrical paper rolls. The rolls are immense, towering over the men, and are stacked in rows across what appears to be a spacious storage area or factory floor.\n\nThe two men, both wearing work clothes, seem to be engaging in a manual labor activity involving one of the paper rolls. One man is pressing against the roll with both hands, possibly trying to rotate or move it, while the other man is supporting the action by holding onto the other side, gesturing as if guiding or stabilizing the roll. Their expressions and postures suggest concerted effort and cooperation in handling the large object.\n\nIt's an indoor setting, as indicated by walls visible in the dim, ambient lighting which seems to be natural light possibly filtering through windows not visible in the image. The surrounding area is gray and unadorned, focusing attention on the two men and their task.\n\nThe paper rolls are marked with various labels and numbers, hinting at their industrial purpose or contents, which might be related to printing or packaging. This environment is typical of manufacturing or bulk storage facilities where such materials are commonly handled.","title":"Rolls of finished newsprint at macmillan-bloedel, ltd., in the frasher river valley, british Columbia, canada.
