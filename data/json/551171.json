{"path":"551171.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an industrial facility located next to a body of water. The left side of the image features a highway, suggesting proximity to a developed area. The facility layout includes several key elements:\n\n1. **Circular Structures**: There are multiple circular tanks or basins, divided into sections. The arrangement and appearance imply that these might be used for processing, possibly as part of a water treatment process or for chemical separation.\n\n2. **Rectangular Tanks**: On the right side of the image, there are rows of rectangular tanks or pools, further suggesting the facility's involvement in extensive fluid handling and processing.\n\n3. **Buildings**: Among the tanks and structures, there are several buildings, likely housing control rooms, machinery, and administrative functions. These buildings appear functional with little to no decorative detail.\n\n4. **Vehicular Access and Roads**: There are roads within the facility, allowing for vehicular movement between the different parts of the industrial compound.\n\n5. **Vegetation and Landscape**: Surrounding the facility and in between some of the tanks, patches of grass and small areas of trees can be seen, possibly serving as buffers or for environmental compliance.\n\n6. **Water Body**: The presence of a water body adjacent to the facility underlines its potential need for large quantities of water, either as a resource for processing or as a receptacle for treated waters.\n\n7. **Infrastructure Connectivity**: To the north of the facility, there is a prominent highway, indicating good connectivity to major transportation networks, essential for industrial operations that may involve significant logistics.\n\nThe photograph shows no visible emissions or significant pollution, suggesting that the operations might be enclosed or controlled to limit environmental impact. The overall impression is of a well-maintained and operationally complex facility possibly engaged in activities such as water treatment, waste processing, or chemical manufacturing.","title":"South Charleston's waste treatment plant on the Kanawha River built with the help of the Union Carbide Chemicals Company.","placename":"Charleston (W.
