{"path":"547342.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a charming scene at a barbershop. Visible through a window pane is a man, possibly the barber, peeking out from below. He is an older Caucasian male wearing glasses and a plaid shirt. Above him, painted on the glass window in white lettering, reads \"BENTLEY BARBER SHOP.\"\n\nIn front of the window hangs a sign that adds a quaint touch to the photograph. The sign, displayed on a string, reads \"OUT WIIL BE BACK AT\" with a movable clock face where the hands can be adjusted to show the return time, though in this instance, the hands are not visible. Below the clock, it further reads, \"Please Call Again.\"\n\nReflected in the window glass, a partial view of the street and buildings opposite the shop can be glimpsed, giving a slight sense of the barbershopâ€™s surroundings. The photograph has a nostalgic feel, capturing a moment of everyday life in a community setting.","title":"Bentley barber shop in diller.
