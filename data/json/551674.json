{"path":"551674.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor concert scene during twilight. The setting is an urban park, framed by towering skyscrapers illuminated with numerous lights, suggesting this is a major city center, possibly New York City due to the density and style of the buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, a large crowd of spectators is gathered, with many people standing or seated, watching a performance. Their attention is focused on a large, well-lit stage housing multiple performers and musical equipment. The stage is set up with scaffolding, lighting rigs, and large speakers, indicating a significant public or festival event.\n\nThe stage features a banner that reads \"Chase Music Festival,\" which presumably is the name of the event being held. The density of the crowd and their casual attire suggest a relaxed, communal atmosphere typical of a music festival.\n\nAs natural light fades, artificial lighting from the stage brightly illuminates the performers, making them a focal point against the more dimly lit audience and the brightly lit skyline in the background. The skyscrapers serve as a dramatic backdrop, their windows glowing like a grid of lights providing a strong contrast to the darkening sky.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, from its vibrant city backdrop to the energetic crowd and the focal point of the brightly lit stage, captures a dynamic urban event filled with music and community engagement.","title":"The schaefer bandstand in central park on a clear june evening.
