{"path":"558033.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting with a few focal elements. At the forefront, three individuals are standing by a pathway. They appear to be engaged in a friendly interaction or conversation, gesturing with their hands as they talk. Their attire is casual, consisting mainly of jeans and t-shirts.\n\nThe pathway where they stand is gravel-covered, leading up towards and around a building that is prominent in the scene. This building appears to be a single-story structure with a red tile roof and an exterior embellished with climbing greenery, predominantly ivy, which adds a rustic charm to its fa√ßade.\n\nThe building's architecture suggests a functional, possibly residential or communal purpose, adorned with a wall-mounted lantern and visible windows and doors. The construction materials include brick and wood, enhancing its rural aesthetic.\n\nTrees with early autumn foliage flank the building, suggesting the season might be either late summer or early fall based on the leaf coloration. The sky above is partly cloudy with generous amounts of blue showing through, suggesting a bright, pleasant day.\n\nOn the periphery, to the far right, a sign is partly visible with the word \"Biological\" discernible, indicating that the location could be related to a biological facility or reserve, educational center, or similar establishment, possibly enhancing the natural or ecological significance of the site.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines elements of nature, architecture, and human interaction within a tranquil environment that likely serves some educational or conservation purpose.","title":"This structure was once a bank in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.  Now it houses a store, living accommodations and a glass blowing shop in the rear.  The village has many period structures which are of interest to visitors.
