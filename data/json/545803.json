{"path":"545803.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a rocky, desert landscape featuring various geological formations. Dominating the scene are numerous rock hoodoos, which are tall, thin spires of rock that protrude from the base of an arid drainage basin or badland. These formations are clustered together and differ in height, creating a dramatic and textured terrain.\n\nThe colors vary from deep reds to lighter shades of orange and white, typical of sedimentary rock formations found in arid regions. The texture of the rocks appears rugged and uneven. In the background, the landscape stretches into the distance, filled with similar rock formations and flat expanses interspersed throughout.\n\nThe terrain is mostly barren, with little to no visible vegetation, emphasizing the dry and harsh environment of the area. The lighting suggests the photograph was taken late in the day, as evidenced by the long shadows cast by the hoodoos and the warm hues of the rocks illuminated by the low sun.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is broad and all-encompassing, providing a vast perspective over this unique and striking geological landscape. The image highlights the natural beauty and the intricate details of the rock formations sculpted by geological processes over millennia.","title":"Chesler Park in the Needles area of the Canyonlands.
