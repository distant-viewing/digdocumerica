{"path":"557552.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a panoramic view of a sprawling suburban area, likely taken from a higher vantage point on a hillside. The foreground prominently features lush greenery, likely a mix of shrubs and trees, which blankets the rolling hills. Just beyond the immediate vegetation, the landscape opens up to reveal a developed residential area.\n\nThe residential area consists of numerous houses with what appears to be tiled roofs, possibly indicating a Mediterranean architectural style, typical in certain regions. These homes are relatively evenly spaced, each with a small plot of land. The roads within the neighborhood are winding and appear to be designed to follow the natural contours of the hilly terrain.\n\nFurther back, the density of the houses decreases slightly and merges into a more open landscape interspersed with more green spaces, which might be communal areas or undeveloped plots. The region's overall development does not look overly compact, suggesting a suburban characteristic with an emphasis on spacious living conditions.\n\nIn the background, the terrain rises again into more hills, showing that the neighborhood is nestled in a valley-like area. The sky above is clear, casting bright sunlight over the area and accentuating the green and earthy tones of the landscape. The color and quality of the image suggest it might be an older photograph, possibly taken a few decades ago, judging by the saturation and grain of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene and picturesque suburban setting, harmoniously blending residential development with the natural landscape.","title":"New housing encroaches on the Santa Monica Mountains off Mulholland Drive on the western edge of Los Angeles. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557547","548011","553939","553929","558057","557454","553704","553692","548026","557427","557404","553700","557437","546399","558059","553937"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plot","neighborhood","development","region","house","grain","characteristic","saturation","hill","living"]}
