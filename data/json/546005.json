{"path":"546005.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph portrays a large industrial facility juxtaposed against a natural backdrop. In the foreground, a serene body of water reflects hints of the sky and spans horizontally across the image. The middle ground prominently features the industrial complex, consisting of several large buildings with multi-storied structures, sprawling horizontal factories, and complicated arrays of pipes and tanks. The facility emits large plumes of smoke or steam, which billow into the air and blend into the clouds above.\n\nOn the left side of the factory, there is a tall, red and white striped tower, likely used for communication or monitoring purposes. Various other minor structures and possibly storage tanks are distributed throughout the site. The factory is set against a wide-open sky filled with fluffy clouds, which dominate the upper two-thirds of the photograph. This image captures the contrast between industrial development and the surrounding natural environment, with a hint of environmental impact visible through the emissions from the factory.","title":"Freeport Sulphur Co. mine on Lake GRand Ecaille","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548195","546087","551576","550339","546141","550329","546103","550868","550694","552246","548068","551192","544735","552194","554630","552179"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","tank","distribute","facility","communication","monitoring","third","sprawl","cloud","emission"]}
