{"path":"556927.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lush, dense forest surrounding a calm body of water. In the distance, a mountain can be seen faintly against the sky, adding to the scenic, natural landscape.\n\nThe water, which reflects a pale blue shade, hosts several boats: one appears to be a larger barge or ferry, and another smaller, possibly a pleasure craft. There's also a dock or jetty visible, indicating some human activity and accessibility to this area. The shoreline around the water consists of forested areas with varying shades of green, and there is a small open patch near the water, perhaps a clearing or a small field.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is serene, marked by the isolation and natural beauty of the wilderness interspaced with minimal human intervention. The lighting in the photo is soft, suggesting either early morning or late evening, contributing to the tranquil and somewhat mystic quality of the scene.","title":"Aerial view looking southeast across the Navy's Bangor Annex and the Puget Sound basin. It is above the Hood Canal's eastern shore at Hunter's Marsh where the proposed 700-foot-long Trident submarine refitting and drydocking facility will be constructed. Mount Rainier is seen on the horizon. Addition of the Trident facilities is expected to add to population growth in the area and affect the way of life for humans and animals living nearby.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556905","556928","555728","552141","556931","555694","543579","555701","556930","552292","555693","550579","544567","556926","548178","555394"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["ferry","pleasure","jetty","accessibility","craft","intervention","barge","water","clearing","shade"]}
