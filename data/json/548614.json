{"path":"548614.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly couple sitting together on what appears to be a porch swing or outdoor bench. The man, seated on the left, is wearing a light-colored straw hat and glasses. He is dressed in a blue and white striped short-sleeve shirt and holds up a dark object (possibly a mobile phone or remote) towards the camera. The woman, seated on the right, is smiling and wearing a blue and white sleeveless outfit accessorized with a watch and earrings. Her hair is styled in a short, dark haircut, and she wears glasses.\n\nThe overall environment suggests a relaxed, sunny day in a park or a garden, evidenced by trees and a stretch of grass visible in the softly focused background. The setting radiates a serene and pleasant atmosphere, with the couple enjoying what seems to be a leisurely moment outdoors. The image captures a sense of closeness and contentment between the two individuals.","title":"Two members of the large retirement community of South Beach enjoy the sunshine and fresh air.","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["557149","551272","553202","557363","551454","551271","549708","554192","558314","548647","548620","543469","545981","552613","557113","545976"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["couple","haircut","contentment","earring","closeness","swing","watch","phone","glass","straw"]}
