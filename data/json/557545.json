{"path":"557545.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a vibrant magenta-pink flower with numerous thin, spiky petals radiating outward from its center. The center of the flower is densely packed with numerous small, yellowish stamen-like structures, which offer a stark contrast to the deep pink of the petals. The petals have a slightly jagged appearance at their tips, enhancing the vivid and textured look of the flower.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred, with only hints of dark green foliage and shadows visible, which helps to isolate the flower and draw the viewer's attention to its details and colors. The lighting appears natural, highlighting the brilliance of the flower's colors and the delicate details of its structure, creating a lively and engaging visual focus.","title":"Closeup of a flower in the Malibu Canyon area of the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County, but are threatened by development. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547815","543200","554840","554843","545691","554595","544891","550462","557500","554115","553366","544885","542970","554841","545699","555035"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","stamen","tip","pink","close","detail","up","center","look"]}
