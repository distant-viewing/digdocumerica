{"path":"554994.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a solitary, leafless tree silhouetted against a subdued background. The tree's branches are gnarled and twist upwards, stretching broadly across the frame in an erratic, almost haunting manner. The backdrop shows a soft luminosity, possibly indicative of a sun obscured by fog or clouds, contributing to the moody, atmospheric quality of the image. The light behind the tree fades from a brighter center to darker edges in a smooth gradient, accentuating the silhouette of the tree. The overall ambiance is eerie and somber, with a focus that pulls the viewer's attention to the intricate, barren branches of the tree, standing stark against the muted light. The setting appears to be devoid of any human presence or additional objects, emphasizing the starkness and isolation of the tree.","title":"Hemlock snag in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547546","557598","543722","545747","555129","551365","556473","552551","554981","549248","553579","557622","543400","543718","555071","555002"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["tree","haunt","luminosity","solitary","gnarl","twist","starkness","branch","subdued","intricate"]}
