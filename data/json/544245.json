{"path":"544245.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic, weathered wooden road stretching horizontally across the frame. It appears to have been constructed piecemeal from planks of varying sizes and conditions, many of which are weathered and some slightly misaligned, creating a somewhat uneven surface suggesting long use and minimal maintenance.\n\nTo the right of the image, prominently displayed, is a metal sign mounted on a short post, sticking out of a patch of grass. The sign is painted white with black lettering and reads: \"PRIVATE ROAD. TRAVEL AT YOUR OWN RISK. PLACID OIL COMPANY.\" This sign not only serves to indicate the private nature of the road but also warns of potential risks of traveling on such a dilapidated pathway.\n\nThe surroundings are a flat, open grassy area with sparse vegetation scattered throughout. The landscape appears quite vast and flat, characteristic of some rural or undeveloped natural areas.\n\nThe sky is clear and deeply blue, indicating fair weather and contributing to the bright lighting in the scene. The image is rich in textures, from the wooden roughness of the road to the soft greenery around it, all under the harsh light which casts deep shadows and highlights forms and textures.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of isolation and abandonment, suggesting it is a neglected part of a larger property owned by the mentioned Placid Oil Company. The warning sign adds a layer of caution and legality, emphasizing that the area might entail dangers or liabilities for those who choose to venture through it.","title":"Plank road built by the Placid Oil Company leads to a marsh in the wetlands (south of Houma.)","placename":"Houma (La.)","location":"Houma, Louisiana","nn1":["555582","544262","543104","555647","556943","552076","555628","555435","556615","548248","555858","545159","554802","545620","555597","547659"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["road","sign","caution","danger","warning","lettering","property","plank","travel","texture"]}
