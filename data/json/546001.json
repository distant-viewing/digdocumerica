{"path":"546001.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures three people engaged in fishing from a motorboat on a body of water. The person at the front of the boat is actively casting a fishing line, holding the rod high above his head, suggesting a dynamic motion, possibly casting or reacting to a fish. The other two individuals, positioned towards the middle and back of the boat, also hold fishing rods and are attending to their lines, although they are more passive compared to the first man.\n\nThey are all dressed in casual, outdoor attire suitable for fishing, with hats for sun protection. The boat is a small to medium-sized motorboat, equipped with what appears to be an outboard motor.\n\nIn the background, the setting features a waterway flanked by tall, dry grass, typical of a marsh or coastal wetland. To the right in the image, there is an industrial structure, possibly a silo or storage tank, associated with some kind of facility featuring additional smaller buildings and platforms, indicating some industrial activity near the fishing location.\n\nThe overall composition balances the tranquility of recreational fishing with an industrial backdrop, suggesting a juxtaposition between nature and human industry. The color palette hints at early morning or late afternoon light with soft, diffuse illumination and natural tones.","title":"Fishermen on lake gRande ecaille with natural gas well in background","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546079","546053","548132","554198","548164","552325","552317","549935","552313","552282","552308","548735","547555","551410","552324","542564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","motorboat","rod","boat","react","marsh","motor","attend","protection","suitable"]}
