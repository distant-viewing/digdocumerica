{"path":"557496.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an underwater image showcasing a small fish swimming near the rocky, algae-covered underwater terrain. The fish is positioned near the center-left of the image, facing towards the right. It appears to be a type of rockfish with subtle coloration, including patches of pink and grey across its body and a distinctive dark eye.\n\nThe background and surroundings are dark and mysterious, emphasizing the depths of the underwater environment. The rock formations on the right-hand side of the image are covered in textures that resemble mossy growths, varying in color from dark green to brown and yellow. These formations create a rugged landscape, giving the photograph a wild, natural feel.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the focus on the small fish against the vast and dimly lit underwater backdrop, creates a sense of isolation and the vastness of the aquatic environment. The lighting in the image highlights the fish and some parts of the rocky surface, while the rest fades into the shadowy depths, adding to the mysterious aura of an underwater ecosystem.","title":"Dead fish floats in Buena Vista Lagoon. The wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. There is concern for it because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["555556","548717","548713","548715","546779","543901","548719","543567","548716","548723","546313","548712","548718","548073","545169","548677"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","formation","mossy","aura","algae","pink","coloration","depth","rest","ecosystem"]}
