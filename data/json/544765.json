{"path":"544765.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The image depicts a natural scene, featuring a shallow body of water which appears to be a small pond or marsh area. The foreground of the image is dominated by muddy terrain with scattered stones and patches of wet, glistening algae or aquatic vegetation. There are pockets and pools of water within this muddy surface, creating an array of textures and reflected light.\n\nWater dominates the middle portion of the photograph, showing a calm surface that reflects the sky and surrounding vegetation. The far side of the water is bounded by a gently sloping bank covered with dense, greenish tufts of grass or low shrubs. The vegetation appears dry and somewhat rugged, typical of a marshy or wetland environment.\n\nThe background consists of the opposite bank, which rises more sharply and is covered with similar shrubbery and grasses. The sky isn't directly visible in the image, but the lighting suggests it is a bright, clear day.\n\nThere are no visible animals or people in the scene; the focus is solely on the natural environment and its quiet, understated beauty. The composition of the photograph, with its effective use of natural light and focus on textures, conveys a serene, untouched wilderness scene.","title":"Sewage canal just below sewage treatment plant","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["550341","545008","554776","550750","550345","543561","550786","551352","554623","545923","554717","546963","550788","554603","547544","544515"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["bank","bound","tuft","alga","vegetation","pocket","glisten","shrubbery","muddy","grass"]}
