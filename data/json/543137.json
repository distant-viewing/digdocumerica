{"path":"543137.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene, highlighted by the silhouette of a variety of unique and twisted tree forms against a vividly colored sky. The sun is positioned close to the horizon in the center of the frame, casting a warm golden light that vividly contrasts with the darker tones of the trees and the sky, which transitions from a deep orange near the sun to darker blues and purples at the edges of the image.\n\nThe trees, which are the focal point, have gnarled and twisted branches that strongly stand out as silhouettes. These trees appear to be cypress or similar coastal species, adapted to withstand harsh sea winds, judging by their bent and rugged forms.\n\nIn the background, the ocean can be seen, calm with minimal waves, stretching across the horizon beneath the sunset. This adds a tranquil and expansive feel to the image. The coastal scene suggests that the location could be a cliff or a high vantage point overlooking the sea.\n\nThe composition of the photograph utilizes the natural lines of the tree branches and the setting sun to draw the viewer's eye across the scene, creating a balanced interplay of light and shadow, natural forms, and vibrant colors, all contributing to a peaceful and picturesque sunset vista.","title":"Sunset on the coast","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543145","554731","542625","547719","543415","552335","543400","547705","554075","552338","543410","547733","542618","554074","557447","544601"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sunset","form","sun","sea","branch","silhouette","tree","vista","point","specie"]}
