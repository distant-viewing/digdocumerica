{"path":"555408.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image captures an American football game in action. The photo is taken from an elevated angle, looking down on the field. On the field, there are two teams distinguished by their uniforms. One team is wearing predominantly white uniforms with red and black detailing; they are on the offense, holding the ball. The opposing team wears dark blue uniforms with white numbers.\n\nThe play appears to be in progress, with the quarterback possibly having just passed the ball or preparing to do so. Players from both teams are arranged dynamically across the field, running or positioning for the next play. One player in white (possibly involved in a pass) is the focus of nearby defenders in blue.\n\nThe field itself has a grayish color and is marked with yellow lines. The field markings include yardage numbers and other typical gridiron markings. A referee in a striped black-and-white shirt is visible in the foreground, watching the action unfold. The background beyond the field is not visible, giving the entire scene a sense of intense and concentrated activity. \n\nOverall, the photograph encapsulates a moment of athletic endeavor, strategy, and competition typical of American football.","title":"To conserve energy, all Portland high schools had their football games rescheduled for daylight hours at the Multnomah Stadium.
