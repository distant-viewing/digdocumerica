{"path":"554415.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In this photograph, a man is engaged in the activity of cutting downed logs with a chainsaw. The setting appears to be a forested area, as tree trunks and dense foliage form the background. The focus of the image is on the man, who is wearing protective gear essential for his task: a yellow hard hat, a gray long-sleeve shirt, and gloves. He kneels on one knee on the logs, deeply focused on his task, as chips of wood fly from the saw's contact point with the log.\n\nThe logs themselves vary in size and are piled haphazardly around the man. They show signs of recent cutting, with fresh wood exposed at the ends and the sides covered in bark. The environment looks slightly moist, as seen in the dark, wet appearance of the wood and soil, suggesting recent rain or a generally damp location. The natural light and the composition of the image highlight both the intensity of the man's physical effort and the rugged outdoor environment in which he works.","title":"Lumberjack from Tupper Lake cutting logs into eight foot sections for loading.
