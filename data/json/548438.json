{"path":"548438.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This image captures a playful moment between two people in front of a multi-story house. The building, prominently displayed in the photo, has a classic architectural design featuring a multi-level structure with pale siding and detailing around the windows. It includes decorative trim and a flat roof. Several windows are visible, each outfitted with different curtains, contributing to the buildingâ€™s residential character.\n\nIn front of the building, on a grey sidewalk that complements the grey entryway steps, a man and a woman are engaging joyfully with each other. The man, wearing a plaid, long-sleeve shirt and slacks, is laughing and appears to be handing over or playfully stealing a dark coat from the woman. The woman, dressed in a black skirt and a patterned white top, is also laughing, and seems to be enjoying the interaction as she holds keys in her hand.\n\nThere's a light, possibly overcast sky casting natural light onto the scene without harsh shadows. It appears to be a relaxed, everyday moment filled with laughter and lighthearted interaction, set against the background of a charming, possibly historic, residence.","title":"Anthony bruno and daughter sandra in front of their home at 39 neptune road near Logan airport.
