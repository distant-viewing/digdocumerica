{"path":"547480.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a vast, crowded lot filled with numerous automobiles parked closely together. The cars vary in color, including shades of red, blue, white, and several hues of grey and brown, showcasing designs from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nThe setting is an industrial area, as indicated by large piles of scrap metal and debris visible in the background. Several cranes and industrial structures further emphasize this, suggesting the location might be near a port or a junkyard. Overcast skies loom above, contributing to a slightly gloomy ambiance, which contrasts with the vivid colors of the cars.\n\nThe angle of the shot is elevated, looking down onto the cars, providing a comprehensive view of the cluttered arrangement of vehicles. This perspective highlights the sheer volume of cars and the dense packing within the lot. The composition of the photograph, with its array of geometric shapes and lines formed by the cars aligned in rows, creates a patterned texture across the image.","title":"New cars, and scrap metal from old cars (in background) ready for export from Fields Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547469","546900","546879","553303","546813","547826","556721","546685","547327","542635","556790","554349","555492","547686","555491","548432"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","lot","junkyard","volume","elevate","loom","scrap","automobile","port","1960"]}
