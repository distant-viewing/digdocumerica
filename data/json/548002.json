{"path":"548002.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image captures a vibrant lakeside scene, vividly illustrating a recreational area. In the forefront, a large marina is seen with several docks and an array of white boats neatly lined in the water. Adjacent to the marina is a busy campground cluttered with numerous white vehicles and camping trailers dispersed among patches of green grass and trees. A couple of small buildings, possibly serving administrative or service functions, can be seen near the water.\n\nThe campground is framed by two large bodies of water juxtaposed against a dramatic landscape. The water's edge is defined by a slim strip of land with trees along the shores, separating the foreground water from another expansive body of water extending into the distance. This backdrop is defined by imposing cliff walls that arch around the lake, their dark rocky surfaces providing a stark contrast to the lush green grass and the shimmering blue water.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its juxtaposition of natural rugged beauty and organized recreational use, offers a picturesque view of a popular leisure destination that balances human activity with scenic tranquility.","title":"Crescent bar recreational area at Trinidad, on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544025","544006","548917","543579","553133","551259","548939","543527","544002","554485","554552","544126","552915","554683","546856","545128"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["marina","define","water","destination","disperse","camping","lakeside","trailer","grass","impose"]}
