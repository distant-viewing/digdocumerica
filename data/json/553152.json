{"path":"553152.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene focused on a young man playing an acoustic guitar. He is prominently seated on a bench or ledge, deeply engrossed in playing. He appears to be a Caucasian male with shoulder-length disheveled hair, wearing a light-colored jacket over a striped t-shirt and corduroy pants. His eyes are downcast on his guitar as he strums, indicating a moment of concentration.\n\nTo his left, another individual sits closely observing the guitar player. This person is a black male, wearing a dark denim jacket and jeans. He appears focused on the music or the guitar technique, smoking a cigarette while leaning slightly forward, his arms resting on his legs.\n\nFurther to the left, another blurry figure is seen in the background. This figure is less clearly defined but appears to be a young Caucasian male with blonde hair, facing away from the camera towards the other two, possibly another listener or a passerby.\n\nThe background is understated and slightly out of focus, emphasizing the foreground action. It suggests an urban setting with buildings and foliage, providing a neutral backdrop that contrasts with the intimacy of the musical interaction.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a casual, artistic vibe typically associated with street musicians and observers, captured in a moment of shared musical experience.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: saturday afternoon","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["558387","556474","551317","543027","558263","554283","543461","548262","556032","545103","556305","548606","551770","553890","551479","551708"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["guitar","male","play","musician","player","observer","intimacy","jacket","music","figure"]}
