{"path":"546253.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a scrapyard or a metal recycling facility under a clear, blue sky. The centerpiece of the image is a large crane hoisting a crushed red car in the air, showcasing the midway action of moving scrap metal. Another crane is visible in the background, reinforcing the industrial scale of the operations.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a heavy-duty vehicle equipped with tracks and a large exhaust, from which white smoke is billowing out, adding a dynamic element to the scene. This vehicle is carrying what appears to be several other large objects, possibly parts of machinery or vehicles, mounted on its back, situated on a flatbed trailer.\n\nThe ground is littered with various pieces of scrap metal, debris, and parts of automobiles, creating a chaotic tapestry of discarded and dismantled items. The overall atmosphere speaks to the industrial process of metal recycling, highlighting the machinery used and the vast amounts of waste materials handled at such facilities. There are no visible people in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the mechanical and industrial components of the scene.","title":"This 2,000 horse power mill shreds about 300 cars a day.
