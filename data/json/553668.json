{"path":"553668.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a diverse landscape featuring agricultural fields, water bodies, and patches of greenery. The upper portion of the image showcases extensive farmland with a pattern of various crops, possibly depicting different stages of cultivation or types of produce. There are pronounced rows and greenery, suggesting active farming.\n\nIn the central part of the image, there is a significant water body, possibly a river or a large stream, which curves and winds through the landscape. This body of water is highlighted by bright, reflective surfaces suggesting a calm flow.\n\nOn either side of the water, there are green areas dotted with trees providing a natural border to the water and fields. These trees cast long shadows, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light. South of the river, the land appears to be more arid or used for grazing, as it is less intensively green and lacks the row patterns seen in the cultivated areas.\n\nThroughout the image, there are no visible buildings or people, emphasizing the rural and undeveloped nature of the region. The entire scene creates a serene and natural rural landscape, showcasing a mix of agriculture, water, and forested areas.","title":"Irrigated lands along the Truckee River","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552858","542730","549260","547995","553661","558414","544768","556968","553817","542708","542713","553977","554027","547724","554055","547684"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["water","produce","row","farmland","cultivation","body","field","agriculture","greenery","border"]}
