{"path":"543432.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning and rugged coastal landscape, likely taken from an elevated viewpoint. The scene is dominated by a series of dramatic, verdant mountains that roll towards the sea. The mountains feature deep, undulating valleys and ridges, and their slopes are covered in dense green vegetation.\n\nIn the foreground, the coastline curves gracefully along the base of these mountains, forming a secluded beach with sandy shores partially visible. Some areas of the beach are accentuated by rocky outcrops that protrude into the sea, creating a dramatic interplay between land and water. The ocean appears calm and extends to the horizon where it meets a partly cloudy sky.\n\nThe sky above is a dynamic element of the composition, featuring patches of blue interspersed with white and gray clouds, suggesting a somewhat overcast day with moments of sunlight breaking through, casting varied lighting across the mountains and highlighting their textures and contours.\n\nThe overall impression is one of remote, untouched natural beauty, evoking a sense of tranquility and awe at the scale and majesty of the natural world.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543430","543328","543434","543090","543300","553995","543250","543374","543424","543429","545230","545934","543297","543433","554171","543051"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["mountain","beach","sea","majesty","awe","outcrop","world","ridge","viewpoint","contour"]}
