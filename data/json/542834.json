{"path":"542834.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a forested landscape showing signs of extensive logging activity. The image depicts a clear division between densely forested areas and sections where trees have been entirely removed or are sparsely distributed. The cleared patches reveal a network of dirt trails or possibly small roads used for transporting lumber, creating a stark contrast against the untouched areas.\n\nThe terrain is hilly and rugged, suggesting that this scene is likely in a mountainous region. The various elevations are visible, with shadows indicating the undulation of the landscape. The remaining trees in the logged areas are mostly stumps and scattered debris, emphasizing the scale and intensity of the logging operation.\n\nThe dense forest surrounding the logged sections contributes to a clear visual boundary between disturbed and natural environments, highlighting the impact of human intervention on the landscape. The overall composition captures the intersection of nature and industrial activity, framing the ongoing conversation about conservation and resource extraction. The color scheme consists predominantly of greens from the trees and browns and grays from the cleared and disrupted earth, conveying a natural yet altered environmental state.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545143","555085","542833","556922","542832","542835","542823","557001","555198","542827","542826","542820","555150","550354","555221","555094"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["undulation","division","lumber","section","stump","extraction","intervention","logging","scheme","conservation"]}
