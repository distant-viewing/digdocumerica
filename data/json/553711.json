{"path":"553711.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a photograph of a man dressed in festive attire. The man is wearing a white woven hat adorned with a garland of pink roses, giving it a very celebratory and floral appearance. His smile and the glint in his eyes suggest he is in a joyful moment, possibly during a celebration or a cultural festival.\n\nThe man is also wearing a white shirt and a sash or lei over one shoulder made of the same pink roses matched in his hat, intermixed with green leaves and possibly other darker flowers or decorations, which adds layers and texture to his attire.\n\nThe focus of the image is tight on the man's upper body and face, leaving the background pleasantly blurred but still discernible as bright and sunlit, suggesting an outdoor setting. This shallow depth of field concentrates attention on his vibrant expressions and the detailed floral ornamentation on his hat and sash. The photograph captures a moment of happiness and cultural expression, highlighted by the festival-like decorations.","title":"Dressed for aloha day parade during annual aloha week festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553712","553916","553760","553708","553918","556528","548226","553917","551028","549122","553915","556281","553737","542779","549080","553716"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["rose","festival","decoration","hat","glint","happiness","man","celebration","leave","concentrate"]}
