{"path":"557151.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph shows a woman involved in needlework, sitting at a table inside a room. She is concentrating on threading a needle. The woman, possibly middle-aged, wears a short-sleeved, pale yellow shirt and has dark hair styled in a simple, practical manner.\n\nThe setting appears to be a communal workshop or a crafting room, indicated by the presence of various crafting materials and personal belongings scattered around. To her left, on a table, rests a piece of pale pink fabric, potentially part of her sewing project. The background of the room is a wood-paneled wall, and in the farther distance, another person can be seen, though not in clear detail. On the nearby desks and surfaces, there are various items like a bag, containers, and paperwork, suggesting an organized yet busy workspace.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a moment of daily life revolving around craft or hobby activities, set in a comfortably informal setting.","title":"Great-gRanddaughter of Indian Chief White Cloud works on the fringe for shawls to wear at Indian pow wow at the Indian Center at White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in the northeast corner of the state.
