{"path":"555066.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This is a close-up photograph of a brown frog positioned on a branch. The frog is in sharp focus, highlighting its textured skin that appears wet, glistening under the light, presumably reflecting natural moisture or a habitat near water. Its eyes are prominent and bulging, with a golden iris and black pupil, adding a vivid contrast to its otherwise dark, mottled brown body.\n\nThe frog sits squarely facing the camera, with its limbs splayed slightly, gripping onto the wood. Its front legs are bent at an angle that suggests readiness to leap, and one can notice the delicate details of its toes and the webbing between them.\n\nThe background is out of focus, creating a blurred effect of green and dark tones. This bokeh effect suggests a natural, lush environment, possibly a forest or jungle setting, which provides a calming backdrop that contrasts with the intricate, sharp details of the frogâ€™s texture and form.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft, yet directed, likely coming from above and slightly in front of the frog, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the contours of its body. This lighting enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the frog and emphasizes its physical characteristics.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is simple yet striking, focusing entirely on the frog and using the shallow depth of field to isolate it from its surroundings, thus drawing attention to its natural features and the serene environment in which it resides.","title":"Closeup of a toad in the Queets River Valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549145","557606","544280","555197","551362","557587","551363","554602","555067","546161","555064","557585","553872","544622","550727","543778"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["limb","readiness","effect","characteristic","skin","moisture","detail","up","habitat","contour"]}
