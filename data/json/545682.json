{"path":"545682.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene, where the forefocus is on a rocky surface etched with the letters \"SW\" in large, prominent carvings. The photo seems to have been taken in a desert environment during daylight, with clear blue skies and sunny conditions. In the background, there are distinctive geological formations, including a prominent arch made of rock. The terrain is rugged and barren, typical of desert landscapes. The etched letters on the rock's surface appear deep and weathered, suggesting they have been there for a significant period of time. The ground is uneven with a rough texture, emphasizing the natural and untouched nature of the setting.","title":"Vandalism","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"Arches National Park, Utah","nn1":["545804","544401","545754","544397","544897","543421","552445","552685","545583","544376","545696","545800","545593","545789","557118","544429"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["letter","desert","etch","carving","rock","arch","daylight","period","surface","formation"]}
