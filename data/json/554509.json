{"path":"554509.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of hikers in a serene, natural setting. In the foreground, there are three individuals engaging directly with their environment. The first person, wearing a red hat and a yellowish shirt, is standing and seems to be adjusting or holding something in their hands. Next to them, two other individuals are bent over, actively packing or unpacking red backpacks and various outdoor gear that are spread out on the rock surface they are standing on.\n\nThe backdrop offers a sweeping view of a mountain range covered in lush greenery, with peaks fading into a misty, cloudy sky suggesting high altitude and perhaps early morning or late afternoon light. The overall scene is tranquil and isolated, highlighting the natural beauty and the peaceful solitude of outdoor adventure.\n\nThe entire setting is a spacious outdoors area, most likely on a large rock or an outcrop that provides a clear vantage point of the surrounding wilderness. Trees densely populate the area behind the hikers but do not encroach upon the rocky area where the group has set their equipment down. This suggests that they might be on a break from hiking, taking time to rest, regroup, or perhaps prepare for the next leg of their journey amidst the expansive and untouched natural landscape.","title":"Young men with backpacks rest at the top of Indian Falls on a major trail up Mount Marcy in New York State, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554508","554672","543371","554558","545780","543383","545700","545776","553370","554504","545710","554501","545786","554503","543510","544305"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","encroach","outcrop","backpack","rock","hiking","journey","group","isolate","outdoor"]}
