{"path":"543397.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene at the beach during what appears to be the late afternoon, given the deep contrasts and the shimmering quality of light on the water. In the image, four silhouetted figures are enjoying themselves in the sea. They are playing in the waves that gently crash around them, with their movements suggesting a sense of joy and freedom.\n\nThe composition captures these figures mostly from a side perspective. They are spaced across the middle of the frame, interacting with the incoming surf. The first figure from the left appears to be waving or splashing, with arms raised and a posture that suggests motion. Moving right, the second individual is also captured with arms uplifted, potentially in mid-motion of jumping or waving. The third person exhibits a more relaxed stance, slightly turned toward the sun. The fourth figure is distinctly positioned at the right edge, arms outstretched wide, embodying a pose of exhilaration or welcome.\n\nThe background is dominated by a vast expanse of water sparkling under the sunlight, leading up to a washed out horizon line barely discernible against the sky. The lighting creates a glittering effect on the surfaces of the water, enhancing the texture and giving the sea a silvery look. The overall mood of the scene is one of carefree, vibrant energy, emphasized by the natural backlighting which casts all the figures as dramatic silhouettes. The combination of the sea's natural beauty and the youthful exuberance of the subjects captures an idyllic moment of seaside leisure.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543458","547009","555923","553072","543395","547688","546982","543893","550930","544291","550237","544187","557507","543225","545218","554159"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["figure","arm","sea","motion","surf","backlighting","freedom","stance","joy","pose"]}
