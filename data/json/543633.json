{"path":"543633.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant golf course scene. In the foreground, a small creek or water body is partially visible, surrounded by rocky, uneven terrain with sparse grass and several small plants, suggesting a natural yet maintained environment. Just beyond the creek, the well-manicured grass of the golf course emerges, stretching across the middle of the image. There are two people visible on the golf course; one is closer to the foreground, appearing to be in motion, possibly walking towards a putting green, while the other person is further away, standing farther back on the fairway. Both individuals are dressed in typical golf attire.\n\nThe golf course itself is surrounded by tall, densely packed evergreen trees that dominate the background, emphasizing the secluded and peaceful setting. The trees rise up against a clear sky, contributing to a serene and isolated atmosphere typical of many golf courses, which are often designed to provide an escape into nature.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of nature with the cultivated aspects of a recreational golf setting. The image captures a moment of calm leisure activity, supported by a lush and expansive natural environment.","title":"Runoff from the construction of a golf course and private homes has polluted this pond.","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["554149","546959","549069","554148","554167","554492","546513","548821","552608","557512","558098","553980","545249","543262","547286","548823"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["golf","course","creek","escape","grass","aspect","nature","middle","leisure","motion"]}
