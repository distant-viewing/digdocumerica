{"path":"544462.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of significant destruction likely caused by a natural disaster such as a flood or storm. The setting shows a waterlogged area littered with debris. The foreground is dominated by a partially submerged and damaged white boat resting tilted atop large amounts of wreckage, including broken wood, metal pieces, and other materials. The background features muddy water that extends towards a stand of dense, green trees, some of which also appear to be damaged or leaning precariously as a result of the event. No people are visible in the image, highlighting the aftermath and quiet desolation following the destructive event. The lighting suggests it is a clear day, which contrasts starkly with the chaos depicted in the scene.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of guadalupe river","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["549311","552829","557993","547266","548688","548692","552853","547527","552128","552843","544463","550950","552158","548286","555870","550247"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["damage","waterlog","wreckage","event","atop","chaos","disaster","destruction","storm","result"]}
