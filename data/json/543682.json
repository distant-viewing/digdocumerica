{"path":"543682.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene featuring a child and a young lamb. The setting is a livestock pen with dark soil, surrounded by wooden fences. The sky appears clear, suggesting a sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, only the back of the child is visible, suggesting they are likely engaged in interacting with or observing the lamb. The child, whose gender is not distinguishable from this angle, is wearing a yellow striped shirt and brown pants. Shadows are cast distinctly on the ground, emphasizing the bright sunlight and creating a sharp outline of the child's figure.\n\nThe lamb, standing slightly apart in the middle ground, is facing right with its body almost profiled to the viewer. Its fleece looks clean and predominantly white, possibly indicating it is quite young.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a tranquil, pastoral moment, highlighting an interaction between a child and a lamb in a rustic setting. The focus and clarity are centered on these two figures, emphasizing their importance in this moment captured in time.","title":"Calf-bRanding day at ranch","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["544384","547326","549200","544426","554894","556605","554928","554779","544391","543678","555820","543679","557747","552568","554932","543686"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","gender","figure","pen","livestock","importance","clarity","outline","back","fence"]}
