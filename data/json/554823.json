{"path":"554823.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat eerie and isolated scene dominated by an old house perched on the edge of a steep, eroded cliff. The house, which occupies the center-top portion of the image, appears weathered and somewhat neglected. It’s a two-story structure with a front porch and several visible windows, some of which are bordered up. The siding of the house is light-colored, possibly white, contrasting with a dark roof.\n\nIn front of the house, there’s an overgrown yard with tall, wild grass or weeds, suggesting the area hasn't been maintained regularly. To the right of the scene atop the cliff, you can see a line of distinctly shaped trees and utility poles, enhancing the feeling of desolation and abandonment. The cliff itself is prominently featured in the foreground of the image. Its layers and strata are clearly visible, indicating geological erosion or excavation. The texture of the cliff is rough with shades ranging from dark browns to lighter earthen colors.\n\nAdditionally, the lighting in the photo appears dim, either due to overcast skies or the time of day, contributing to the somber and melancholic mood of the setting. The overall tone and composition of the photograph convey a sense of isolation, neglect, and the relentless impact of natural forces on human-made structures.","title":"This house stands above a stripped gorge off route 250, near Cadiz, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["554787","554799","554822","556999","555632","552491","558110","554788","549195","551963","552455","552464","557640","552494","556962","543355"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cliff","house","stratum","neglect","weed","perch","desolation","force","excavation","siding"]}
