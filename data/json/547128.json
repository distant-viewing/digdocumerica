{"path":"547128.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape during what appears to be the late afternoon, based on the warm yet soft lighting. It prominently features two barns, both painted in a vivid red that stands out against the comparatively muted natural backdrop. The barn on the left is larger, characterized by a steep roof and dark roofing, while the right one appears smaller and possesses similar features. There is also a smaller outbuilding visible between the two main barns, sharing the same red color.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a dried grass field, suggesting the season might be late fall or early winter. A white, wooden fence runs partially across the field in front of the barn on the right, enhancing the pastoral feel of the scene.\n\nThe background includes leafless trees and a clear sky, indicating it might be cold weather. The scene is devoid of any visible human activity, creating a serene, quiet atmosphere almost frozen in time. The composition of the image, with its focus on traditional architecture and open fields, evokes a sense of simplicity and rural life.","title":"Farm near Lake Michigan, below Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556963","550019","555571","556586","557991","552537","555577","547309","549194","552462","547289","558073","557183","543343","547305","554782"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","field","possess","outbuilding","roofing","dry","share","one","simplicity","winter"]}
