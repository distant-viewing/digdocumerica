{"path":"548775.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image depicts an industrial scene, likely part of a dredging or excavation operation, set in what appears to be a coastal or wetland area. In the background, a bright red crane with a long black boom is the focal point of the photograph. The crane is mounted on a larger vehicle, possibly a barge or a tracked vehicle, positioned next to a large pile of white sand or sediment. This mound is noticeably larger than the flat surroundings, suggesting recent deposition from the crane's operations.\n\nThere are several shallow water bodies in the foreground, divided by thin strips of land, indicating that this might be a wetland area with water channels or ponds created by excavation works. The land around these water bodies appears sandy and sparsely vegetated, which could be a result of the ongoing operations disrupting vegetative growth.\n\nThere are no visible people or animals in the image; the focus is purely on the machinery and the altered landscape. The lighting suggests it is daytime with clear skies due to the brightness and clarity of the scene.\n\nThe overall impression is of human intervention in a natural landscape, where industrial activities are modifying the terrain and potentially the local ecosystem. The absence of abundant vegetation and wildlife hints at a significant environmental impact.","title":"Land development near boca chica key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["544282","548774","545648","545655","555633","545887","554545","555593","547171","545883","548773","548641","545858","545888","555586","555644"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","wetland","excavation","operation","dredging","deposition","modify","disrupt","boom","land"]}
