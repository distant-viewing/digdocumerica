{"path":"547063.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photo depicts a joyful scene featuring a man and a woman. The man, who is standing, has a woman sitting on his shoulders. The woman is smiling broadly and has long, dark hair and is wearing a light-colored coat over dark clothing. The man, with a beard and long hair, is also smiling widely and appears to be laughing. He wears a dark shirt, and his hands are raised towards the woman's legs, helping to support her.\n\nThe background shows an urban environment under an overpass or a similar concrete structure. A sign that reads \"LOAD STOPPED\" is partially visible, a hint that the area is likely used for loading or unloading goods. The lighting of the photograph suggests it might be late in the day or on a cloudy day, giving a somewhat dimmed natural light.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the image is cheerful and relaxed, capturing a moment of playful connection between the two individuals. The setting and their casual attire suggest a candid, everyday life scene, possibly from a leisure stroll through an urban area.","title":"Fun in rogers park beneath the loyola elevated train station","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553171","553280","547834","552655","554900","551016","553536","545464","548438","557738","545612","550077","551859","556092","547135","549324"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","load","smile","dim","laugh","stroll","unload","overpass","hair","beard"]}
