{"path":"552723.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, sunlit scene in an outdoor setting that seems to be a park or garden area. The image is shaded by the foliage of trees, with small patches of sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating a dappled pattern on the brick paved ground.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly out of focus, are branches and leaves that hang over into the top part of the frame, giving a natural frame to the scene. In the middle of the composition, thereâ€™s a path made of red bricks that guides the eye through the photograph, suggesting a quiet and peaceful area.\n\nOn the right, a person is seated on a bench, suggesting a moment of relaxation or contemplation. The individual appears to be a male, dressed in light-colored clothing, and is in a reclined position with legs crossed, further enhancing the relaxed atmosphere of the scene. He seems to be looking away from the camera, possibly enjoying the tranquility or observing something outside the view.\n\nThe background includes lush green bushes and a low brick wall, contributing to the secluded and intimate feeling of the space. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with its interplay of light and shadow, natural elements, and the relaxed posture of the seated person, evokes a sense of calm and repose.","title":"Quiet greenness of a city park","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552722","546566","550051","551942","546450","554099","551970","547045","551682","557713","549321","547251","551922","557146","550826","546505"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["brick","leave","person","male","relaxation","calm","bench","contemplation","garden","leg"]}
