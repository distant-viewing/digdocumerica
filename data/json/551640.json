{"path":"551640.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment with two people, likely young adults, sitting beside a large, lively fountain. The water jets from the fountain shoot upwards, creating a dynamic and visually striking background that contrasts with the calm demeanor of the individuals.\n\nOn the left, there's a man wearing a plaid shirt, blue jeans, and he has curly hair. He is sitting cross-legged, intensely engrossed in reading a book, with his shoes placed neatly beside him on the ledge. Next to him, to the right, a woman with long, straight brown hair is similarly dressed in a casual style with a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and sandals. She is also sitting cross-legged and appears to be engaged in a separate activity, possibly reading or examining something in her hands.\n\nThe scene is set against an architectural backdrop with columns and windows that suggest this may be a public or institutional building. Ambient daylight suggests the photo was taken during the day. The overall atmosphere is relaxed and peaceful, with the fountain's sound likely adding to the ambiance. This setting and activity indicate a public space designed for leisure and relaxation.","title":"Lincoln Center Plaza is enclosed by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
