{"path":"547995.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a riverside landscape. The river, curving gently, is flanked on one side by lined orchards and fields, possibly indicative of cultivated farms or orchards. Neat rows are visible, suggesting organized agricultural activities, with different types of crops or trees that create a patterned texture on the landscape.\n\nOn the other side of the river, the terrain is more rugged and barren, featuring a large hill or low mountain with sparse vegetation. The coloration of the landscapes shifts from green agricultural areas to the brown and gray hues of the uncultivated hills.\n\nThe sky features a few clouds scattered across an otherwise clear blue backdrop, adding a sense of depth and openness to the scene. A few buildings or industrial structures can be seen near the agricultural plots, likely facilities supporting the farming operations. Roads meander through the scene, cutting across the fields and winding along the contours of the landscape, facilitating movement and access through this cultivated riverside region.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights a contrast between human-shaped, cultivated agriculture and the natural, more wild terrain of the hillside. It paints a comprehensive picture of human interaction with a natural landscape, showcasing both the adaptation and the untouched aspects of the environment.","title":"Fruit orchards near Chelan","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549081","542730","549260","542713","553668","553661","547227","552594","556964","550553","547724","550392","555753","545042","552560","555575"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["cultivate","riverside","adaptation","landscape","plot","coloration","field","openness","shift","hill"]}
