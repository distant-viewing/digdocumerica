{"path":"546314.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases an intriguing science or laboratory setting. The focus of the image is a close-up of a glowing, heated metal rod held by a tong. The tip of the rod emits an intense orange glow indicating it's very hot, possibly being heated for an experiment or procedure.\n\nIn the foreground, the metal rod and tong are foregrounded against a slightly out-of-focus backdrop. On the right side, there is a small petri dish-like container that appears clear, possibly made of glass or plastic.\n\nThe background features various laboratory equipment, predominantly electronic. Numerous devices with dials and readouts, possibly measuring or controlling instruments, are visible. These equipments' exact functions aren't clear but suggest a controlled, scientific setting. The color palette of the equipment is muted, with shades of beige and gray, common to many laboratory environments.\n\nThe overall lighting in the scene is subdued, with the brightest element being the glow from the heated rod, which also casts a soft light on its immediate surroundings. This selective lighting helps draw attention directly to the action of heating the rod, emphasizing the experiment or test being conducted.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph create a narrative centered on scientific research or experimentation, highlighting the process and the equipment involved.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory microbiology lab.
