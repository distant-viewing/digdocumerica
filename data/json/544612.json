{"path":"544612.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a silhouette scene captured during either sunrise or sunset. It highlights several birds perched on possible treetops. The image is shot against the light, showcasing the figures of the birds in stark, dark silhouettes against a vibrant, warm-hued background which gradients from a golden orange to deeper shades.\n\nThe tree, barely visible in detail, seems dense with foliage, offering multiple perching points for the birds. Some birds are seated while others stand, varied in their postures, suggesting natural bird activity such as resting or observing their surroundings. The overall atmosphere evokes a serene and tranquil environment typically associated with the beginnings or end of a day in a natural, undisturbed setting. This image uses the contrast between the dark figures and the light background to emphasize the forms and numbers of the birds, creating both a sense of peace and a visually striking composition.","title":"Chakoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544601","555013","544597","553875","553776","544609","548872","550382","547726","547318","544605","551378","549101","554646","554069","551379"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","beginning","treetop","silhouette","vari","shoot","figure","peace","perch","sunrise"]}
