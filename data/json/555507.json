{"path":"555507.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a large pile of freshly chopped wood, mainly consisting of logs that have been split into quarters or similar portions. The wood is stacked in a somewhat orderly fashion, with the cut sides predominantly showing, whereas the bark-covered sides form the outer walls of the pile. The top surfaces of the logs reveal freshly exposed wood, varying in shade from pale cream to darker browns, highlighting the natural texture and grain of the wood.\n\nAtop the pile, there's a cardboard sign facing the camera, prominently stating \"THIS WOOD IS SOLD\" in bold, black letters. This indicates that the wood is intended for sale and has already been purchased.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured by the pile of wood, a lush, tree-covered hill gently slopes upwards beneath a bright, clear sky. The natural setting suggests that the location is rural or semi-rural, possibly on the edge of a forest or near a woodland area.\n\nThe foreground around the base of the woodpile is littered with wood chips, small branches, and debris, typical of a wood chopping or processing area. This contributes to an overall sense of active wood management and preparation, possibly for heating or construction purposes. The sunlight casts distinct shadows and highlights across the woodpile, indicating either a sunny morning or afternoon.","title":"Winter wood was in great demand during the fuel crisis in the fall and winter of 1973-74. People were still buying it in April 1974, although the price per cord did drop.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["542596","542595","550877","552547","555454","555144","543489","543541","552203","554411","554413","543588","548155","542584","555472","553647"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["wood","pile","log","quarter","heating","chip","cardboard","grain","cream","sale"]}
