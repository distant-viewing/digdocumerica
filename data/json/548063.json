{"path":"548063.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a warning sign prominently placed in the foreground. The sign is rectangular and mounted on a single post. It has a white background with red and black lettering. The top part of the sign is highlighted in red and reads \"WARNING\" in bold uppercase letters. The rest of the sign details cautionary messages in black uppercase letters stating \"DEEP WATER,\" \"STRONG TIDES,\" \"FLOATING LOGS\" and \"AND DEBRIS.\"\n\nThe background behind the sign is a natural landscape consisting of flat terrain. There are grassy patches and wild vegetation, predominantly in tones of green and brown. The area appears to be relatively open and undeveloped, with no visible water bodies, buildings, or other structures in the immediate vicinity captured in the image. The sky is overexposed, suggesting a bright sunny day, which causes it to appear almost white. The general condition and setting evoke a sense of an isolated or less trafficked area, possibly near a water body given the warnings on the sign. There are no people or animals visible in the image.","title":"The north jetty near the mouth of the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553749","545949","553860","544227","550688","545621","550223","555385","557441","547992","548836","548248","549129","547836","554103","544220"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","sign","letter","lettering","message","vicinity","rest","post","log","animal"]}
