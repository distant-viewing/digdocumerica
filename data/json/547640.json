The buildings, which vary in size and architecture, are situated close to the sandy beachfront. Key features observed include:\n\n1. **Beach and Waterfront**: The foreground shows a sandy beach flanked by gentle ocean waves. The beach has a few visitors scattered across its span, enjoying the seaside environment.\n\n2. **Buildings**: Several structures are visible, including:\n   - A large, elongated building with a red roof positioned along the edge of the beach. It appears to be a major facility, possibly serving a commercial purpose.\n   - Directly adjacent to this is another large building with a bright red trim and red roofing.\n   - A cluster of smaller buildings, including what looks like a commercial establishment with multiple advertisements on its facade, suggesting retail or dining outlets.\n\n3. **Vehicles and Parking**: Numerous cars are parked in designated areas around the buildings, indicating the presence of visitors or regular activity in the area.\n\n4. **Surrounding Environment**:\n   - Beyond the immediate vicinity of the buildings and beach, there is a body of water, possibly a lake or river, indicating that this locale is on a peninsula or narrow strip of land.\n   - Sparse vegetation and undeveloped land surround the built-up area, giving a contrasting natural backdrop to the human-made structures.\n\n5. **Infrastructure**: There are visible signs of infrastructure like roads and parking lots, facilitating easy access and mobility for vehicles.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, taken from an elevated perspective, offers a comprehensive view of a coastal community hub, likely catering to both local residents and visitors with amenities suitable for retail and recreational activities.","title":"Development of barrier beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["555756","547629","557463","544638","543438","553671","549528","555757","551587","548628","553680","557504","553765","554143","547980","551610"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["beach","visitor","building","outlet","beachfront","mobility","span","amenity","peninsula","dining"]}
