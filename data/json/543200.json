{"path":"543200.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The image focuses on a striking pink flower spike, which seems to be the prominent subject. It's a vertical, close-up shot of the bloom with a depth of field that blurs its background. The flower has numerous dense, tubular segments with yellow tips that provide a gradient contrast from the darker pink top down to lighter shades toward the yellow tips. These tubes look like they're part of a large perennial plant, common in natural and cultivated landscapes.\n\nThe background, while out-of-focus, illustrates a soft, mellow green field setting dotted with similar pink flowers, which appear smaller and blurrier due to the focused depth of field. The composition suggests a garden or a planted field in a rural or semi-wild environment. In the middle ground, part of a traditional building or farmhouse is vaguely visible, blending naturally with the pastoral vibe of the scene.\n\nThis type of capture showcases the beauty of floral biology and brings an emphasis on nature's delicate aesthetics, possibly meant to highlight the flower's structure or its role within its ecosystem. The photo is likely taken during daylight given the natural lighting, adding to the vibrancy of the flowers and giving a serene ambience to the setting.","title":"California--point lobos reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["557545","542970","554595","554111","544934","553588","554843","553366","544875","550462","543597","557500","542969","545695","557618","557167"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","tip","field","biology","farmhouse","mean","tube","ambience","bring","vibrancy"]}
