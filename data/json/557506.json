{"path":"557506.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a large river system with meandering water channels and extensive surrounding landscapes. The central river flows from the upper left of the frame toward the lower right, with its surface reflecting light, presumably from the sun which creates a glistening effect on the water. Surrounding the river are various landforms and developments:\n\n1. **Marshy Areas:** Along the edges of the river, there are broad, flat terrains that appear to be wetlands or marshy areas. These are characterized by patches of different colors—yellows, greens, and dark browns—suggesting the presence of aquatic vegetation and possibly sediments.\n\n2. **Agricultural Fields:** To the right side of the photograph, neatly organized fields are visible, possibly used for agriculture. They create a patchwork of rectangular plots, likely indicating different crops or stages of cultivation.\n\n3. **Infrastructure:** Across the river, a structure resembling a jetty extends into the water, suggesting human activity related to transportation or industry. Roads or tracks are faintly visible, weaving through the marshes and fields.\n\n4. **Natural Vegetation:** Dense foliage and trees line certain parts of the riverbanks, offering a contrast to the cultivated fields and revealing a mix of natural and altered landscapes.\n\nThe topography and the way the light plays across various surfaces suggest an ecosystem rich in biodiversity. The overall composition of the image, with its mix of water, land, and human elements, underscores the interaction between natural environments and human interventions. The photograph, with its muted colors and expansive view, provides a comprehensive look at how land and water resources are utilized in this region.","title":"Aerial of Botaquito Lagoon, one of the last few Bodies of water of this type in the southern part of the state. It suffers from nearby freeways and developments as well as farm erosion and septic tank seePage. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and it has resulted in increased land use pressures. Coastal wetlands totaled about 125,000 acres in the early 1970's compared to some 381,000 acres in 1900.","placename":"Carlsbad (Calif.)","location":"Carlsbad, California","nn1":["550392","555753","549081","546351","547990","543697","553661","549262","547227","549260","550885","552838","543735","544760","548931","548001"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","field","biodiversity","water","jetty","patchwork","marsh","landform","cultivation","land"]}
