{"path":"552092.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photo shows an improvised hand-painted sign outdoors, with rich natural surroundings. The sign consists of two stacked sections held by a metal frame that appears repurposed from a different use, possibly from bed frames judging by their shapes and connections.\n\nThe upper section of the sign reads \"Norman's CLOSED Till Futher Notice,\" notably with \"Futher\" misspelled rather than \"Further.\" Below this, the second part of the sign states \"known as – Macy's On the Kaw.\" The background is overgrown with vegetation, predominantly green, suggesting the sign is located in an area not frequently maintained, possibly a rural or less developed region.\n\nThe backdrop of the photo reveals dense foliage and trees, with what looks like scattered debris or small structures – it’s somewhat obscured and not completely clear. The scene is well-lit, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting shadows and illuminating parts of the sign and the vegetation, creating a vivid and lively outdoor atmosphere. This setting suggests a daytime photograph captured in an environment that might be along a river or in a rustic locale, given the reference to \"the Kaw,\" which could imply a location near the Kansas River, commonly known as the Kaw.","title":"The owner of this huge junk shop on the Kansas river in bonner spring died in 1971.
