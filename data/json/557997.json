{"path":"557997.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, somewhat overgrown outdoor scene, likely taken in a woodland or forest area. The image is characterized by a lush blanket of various plants and small flowers, predominantly in shades of green interspersed with white flower blooms, which appear to be wildflowers. \n\nDominating the scene is an old, moss-covered structure made of dark, weathered stones or concrete blocks. This structure looks like a long, narrow trough or canal, which might have been used for water management, like an old aqueduct or drainage system. It spans the width of the image, creating a barrier that is now partially reclaimed by nature, indicated by the foliage covering parts of it.\n\nThe environment around this structure is thick with vegetation, including tall trees that form a canopy overhead, with sunlight filtering through to create a subdued, moody lighting in the scene. This contributes to a sense of quiet isolation and the passage of time, suggesting that this structure has been unused and uninterrupted for a substantial period. The general atmosphere evokes a feeling of tranquil decay, where nature is slowly integrating human-made elements back into the ecosystem.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal walls and bed are covered by nature north of Main Street Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913 when a disastrous flood and competition from the railroads put the waterway out of business. It is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The National Park Service is working on a master plan.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["547518","558013","557995","552101","546971","546754","551330","545008","544281","552550","551329","552255","558011","551344","557024","547011"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["trough","flower","drainage","width","canal","blanket","woodland","bloom","wildflower","structure"]}
