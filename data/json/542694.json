{"path":"542694.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features two potted plants positioned side by side, each displaying distinctive foliage. The left plant has a prominent leaf that is partially discolored with a mosaic or mottled pattern of light and dark green, suggesting a possible nutrient deficiency, disease, or genetic variegation. The leaf is broad with deep lobes and a thick central vein. This plant also shows a smaller, similarly patterned leaf and a new shoot emerging centrally.\n\nThe right plant, in comparison, has uniformly dark green leaves which appear healthier, with no visible discoloration. Like the other plant, the leaves are broad and lobed, typical of species in the squash or melon family. Both plants are situated in black plastic pots filled with soil, and appear to be young, possibly in an early stage of growth.\n\nThe background is plain and nondescript, giving no additional context or distraction from the plants themselves, thus focusing all attention on the differences and details of the plants' conditions and structures. The lighting is soft, evenly illuminating the scene without harsh shadows, enhancing the visibility of the leaf textures and colors.","title":"Smog-damaged and \"clean\" plants shown together at the statewide air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542693","542688","542689","542685","542686","542692","557539","551356","543620","555041","554575","554744","557593","555548","544731","553361"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","leaf","mottled","difference","pots","comparison","discoloration","distraction","mosaic","vein"]}
