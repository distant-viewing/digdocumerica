{"path":"543173.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or agricultural scene, highlighting the rugged aesthetics of an operational site. The primary focus is a narrow, dusty road between large metallic and wooden structures, which appear to be part of a warehouse or processing plant. The road leads towards the background and is framed by the disjointed and irregularly shaped sides of the buildings.\n\nIn the center of the image stands a truck, moving away and kicking up dust, suggesting recent activity. The truck is fairly dated and shows signs of extended use. Details such as the worn-out tires and visible dust trails contribute to the scene's rustic and busy atmosphere.\n\nThe structures on either side of the road are constructed from corrugated metal and wood, with various parts either bent, damaged, or in disrepair, indicating either ongoing use or the harshness of the operational environment. One side shows a building with its metal sheeting peeling away from the frame, which is exposed and haphazard.\n\nBackground details include a glimpse of trees and clear sky, implying that this location is either on the outskirts of a wooded area or rural in general. The sunlight streaming through and casting shadows on the ground enhances the details of the dusty road and aging structures, adding a layer of depth and texture to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment within an industrial or agricultural setting, emphasizing themes of work, decay, and the passage of time.","title":"California--Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["557389","557385","547979","548850","555875","544061","552997","542538","552673","554561","556615","552079","553662","556429","543354","557390"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["dust","road","detail","truck","harshness","use","outskirt","metal","disrepair","passage"]}
