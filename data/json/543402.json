{"path":"543402.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal environment. At the foreground, there is a rocky beach covered with clusters of dark, barnacle-encrusted rocks forming small pools of sea water. A few birds are visible, perched on these rocks, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a sailboat on calm sea waters. The sailboat, with a white hull and a pair of white sails, shows identification numbers and has a few people aboard, visible but not detailed due to the angle and distance. Its sails are fully hoisted, catching the wind as it glides through the water, suggesting a peaceful sailing day.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains or hills under a partly cloudy sky complete the composition. This distant backdrop provides a layered effect to the photograph, enhancing the depth. The sky, tinged with shades of blue and white, suggests a bright, clear day, ideal for sailing and outdoor activities.\n\nOverall, the image captures a harmony of natural elementsâ€”the ruggedness of rocky shores, the gentle motions of a sailboat, and the vast, undisturbed water and sky, all under a natural light that casts vivid colors and highlights throughout the scene.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543329","548733","549117","544667","545057","548204","542903","542877","542907","542870","552345","545900","548118","543626","543059","555694"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","sail","sea","identification","harmony","ruggedness","rock","highlight","water"]}
