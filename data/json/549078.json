{"path":"549078.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor setting centered on a water control structure such as a small dam or sluice, which appears to regulate water flow in an irrigation or drainage canal. A person, dressed in work attire including a helmet, long-sleeve shirt, and pants, stands on a robust wooden frame structure placed above a flowing water channel. The worker seems to be engaged in operating or adjusting a vertical pole or lever, likely used to control the flow of water below.\n\nThe background shows an open landscape with calm waters visible in the upper section of the canal, extending into the distance under a clear sky. The water is spilling over the edge of the concrete structure, forming a waterfall which creates a dynamic and frothy cascade. The scene captures a moment of manual labor involved in water management, emphasizing a blend of human intervention and natural elements.\n\nThe image also conveys a sense of isolation, focusing on the lone figure amidst the vastness of the landscape and the power of the moving water. The combination of elements suggests a setting that is likely rural or semi-rural, where such water control structures are common for agricultural or land management purposes.","title":"Vincent humeumptewa, a hopi indian and an employee of the irrigation district, opens the canal gates.
