{"path":"556887.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a railway maintenance scene. In the foreground, there are multiple railway tracks filled with gravel. Two individuals are visible; one on the left side is wearing a green jacket, blue jeans, and a dark helmet, and appears to be walking while carrying an orange safety helmet in his hand. The other individual, positioned on the right, is seated atop a complex, orange machinery typical for railway construction or maintenance. Heâ€™s wearing a dark overcoat, white helmet, and is actively looking at a laptop or control device, which he holds in his hands.\n\nThe machine itself is equipped with various mechanical components, hoses, and levers, covered partially by a metal roof providing some shade to the operator. In the background, the scene is bordered by trees and a clear blue sky, suggesting a bright, clear day. To the left-background, there's a glimpse of industrial or commercial white buildings, hinting at a semi-urban setting. The overall impression is of active, possibly routine, maintenance or inspection work being carried out on railway infrastructure.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, with equipment used in laying new quarter mile long sections of rail to replace the old shorter track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974, Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556861","556901","556881","556872","556860","556883","556874","556862","556890","556870","556869","556871","556875","556897","556899","556885"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","helmet","maintenance","overcoat","carry","lever","operator","hose","inspection","hand"]}
