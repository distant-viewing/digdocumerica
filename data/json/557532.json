{"path":"557532.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an expansive aerial view of a rugged and mountainous landscape, leading towards a coastal area. The foreground is dominated by a series of mountain ridges covered in thick green vegetation, showing various shades from deep green to light brown, indicating different vegetation types or possibly seasonal changes. Several winding dirt roads or trails are visible, cutting through the mountains and connecting different areas.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a visible transition from the dense mountainous terrain to a more developed region. We can see buildings clustered together, presumably a small town or settlement, nestled within the valleys of these mountains. The roads become more structured and seem to facilitate better connectivity in this part.\n\nThe background extends to a coastal line, where the land meets the sea. The coast curves gently, and the water appears calm and expansive, stretching to the horizon. The aerial perspective provides a broad view of the coastline, which is dotted with various developments that possibly include residential areas, industrial sites, or recreational beaches. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is a striking contrast between the natural, undeveloped mountain ranges in the foreground and the developing human settlements leading up to the highly developed coastal area in the background. The image captures the transition from natural landscapes to human-influenced environments, showcasing a diverse geographical and developmental spectrum.","title":"Aerial of the santa monica mountains looking south, near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553778","543434","554052","554020","546407","556919","556908","556937","543429","554091","556953","550639","557452","553945","543328","554057"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["develop","mountain","settlement","spectrum","transition","connectivity","become","coast","lead","facilitate"]}
