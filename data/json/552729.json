{"path":"552729.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a densely populated urban area, showcasing an expansive grid of streets and blocks. The area primarily features residential buildings with uniform rooftops, interspersed with some larger, possibly commercial buildings. Towards the horizon, the density of the buildings increases, and several taller high-rises are visible in the distance, suggesting the city center.\n\nThere are no visible natural landscapes or significant green spaces in the immediate vicinity, emphasizing the urban character of the area. The streets run parallel and perpendicular to each other in a very orderly fashion, creating a highly organized city layout. A main thoroughfare visibly extends from the foreground directly towards the center of the image, marking a clear, straight path through the city and leading towards the denser downtown region.\n\nThe image captures the essence of an urban environment with its tightly packed homes and the absence of significant open spaces, illustrating the typical landscape of many large cities.","title":"Row houses","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552730","549972","552728","545914","547445","552734","553673","548424","551510","551506","549476","551505","548374","551509","548425","548343"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["city","thoroughfare","downtown","rooftop","street","space","vicinity","block","density","absence"]}
