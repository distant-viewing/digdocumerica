{"path":"555680.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting dominated by a lush, mountainous landscape. A prominent feature in the picture is a cascading waterfall flowing down a steep, rocky cliff face. The waterfall starts from a point higher up on the mountainside and makes its way down in multiple stages, comprising both steep plunges and gentler cascades. The surrounding cliffs are covered with green vegetation, which suggests that the area might be moist and possibly receives a high amount of rainfall.\n\nAt the base of the cliffs, there's a two-lane road curving around the mountainside. On this road, multiple cars are visible, indicating a human presence and accessibility to this picturesque location. The road itself appears to be well-maintained, with visible markings, and provides a stark contrast to the wild and natural environment of the cliff and waterfall.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with blue visible, suggesting a moderately sunny day, favorable for traveling or sightseeing. Overall, the photograph captures the serene and majestic nature of a mountainous area, enhanced by the dynamic movement of the waterfall and complemented by human interaction through the visible road and vehicles.","title":"View north along the Lowe River into the narrowest sections of Keystone Canyon.
