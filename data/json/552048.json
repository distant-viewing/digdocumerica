{"path":"552048.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial waterfront scene featuring a red fireboat stationed in a calm river with a backdrop of urban infrastructure. To the left, the fireboat is moored alongside what appears to be a small dock, projecting a vibrant contrast to its surroundings with its red and white color scheme.\n\nThe river is spanned by a prominent red and rust-colored vertical lift bridge, which occupies the mid to right portion of the frame. This bridge, an engineering marvel with its complex trusses and towering lift tower, dominates the scene and is a clear focal point. The structure's mechanical details are highlighted in sunlight, casting small, intricate shadows on itself and creating a patterned visual texture.\n\nThe background shows an array of low-rise industrial and perhaps commercial buildings with flat roofs, rendered in muted colors that suggest a utilitarian purpose. Among them, a tall black chimney stands out, possibly indicating some type of factory or power plant.\n\nThe waters of the river reflect the blue sky and contribute to a serene, yet industrious mood. Above, the sky is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The overall composition juxtaposes human-engineered structures with the natural element of water, highlighting both functional industrial design and the urban environment's adaptation to its riverside location.","title":"Lower portion of the Buffalo river before it joins the niagara river at the north-east tip of lake erie","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["547061","555731","549303","550900","550964","549503","547064","552262","550901","551993","548375","552047","543155","557309","550214","550965"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["lift","marvel","river","bridge","tower","engineer","render","adaptation","truss","riverside"]}
