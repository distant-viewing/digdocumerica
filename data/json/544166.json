{"path":"544166.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph presents a striking image of a massive dam. The dam itself is depicted in a dramatic perspective, dominating the frame from the forefront, extending vertically down into the depths of the image. It is a huge concrete structure with a slightly curved shape, and its textured surface has vertical streaks possibly from water exposure or aging.\n\nAtop the dam, there are some facilities including what appears to be control towers or observation points. These structures are equipped with large windows, likely for overseeing operations or for surveillance.\n\nThe background of the photo showcases a wide, scenic river or reservoir view that extends towards rugged, natural terrains. The water appears calm, reflecting a greyish-blue sky filled with scattered clouds that suggest either early morning or late afternoon lighting. The surrounding landscape is characterized by reddish rocky hills and plateaus typical of arid or semi-arid environments, which add a natural grandeur to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition uses a high contrast of the man-made dam structure against the expansive natural beauty of the landscape, emphasizing the scale and impact of human engineering in such a remote environment. The photograph may evoke thoughts on the relationship between human structures and nature, and the balance or tension therein.","title":"Glen Canyon Dam","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["553828","548947","544141","544151","548013","548003","548927","549004","548012","549024","549486","548007","544150","548920","544140","548938"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["dam","surveillance","plateaus","reservoir","tension","relationship","streak","aging","balance","engineering"]}
