{"path":"544086.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a cityscape under a dramatic and overwhelming orange-reddish sky, possibly due to environmental pollution or atmospheric conditions like a sunset or haze. The sky takes up the majority of the image and has a grainy texture, with darker and lighter patches suggesting variations in intensity and concentration of whatever is affecting the coloration, such as smog or dust.\n\nThe city below is densely populated with buildings of varying heights and sizes. This area exhibits a mostly uniform appearance with flat rooftops, and several buildings are distinguishable by their slightly different shades or architectural features. The imageâ€™s foreground is somewhat darker, creating a silhouette effect against the brightly colored sky. This contrast emphasizes the surreal, almost apocalyptic atmosphere of the scene.\n\nFrom the angle and content of the photo, it appears to have been taken from an elevated viewpoint, looking out over the cityscape with a wide angle that captures both the expanse of the urban area and the vast, affected sky above it. There's a slight vignette around the edges of the photo that further focuses attention on the central parts of the image.","title":"Dust storm rises over Phoenix on labor day, 1972.
