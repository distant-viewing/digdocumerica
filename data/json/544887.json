{"path":"544887.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a striking natural landscape, possibly in a canyon or desert setting. In the foreground, a reddish plant with vivid, slender red flowers and green leaves is prominently displayed, emerging from a crack in the rocky ground. The plant casts delicate shadows upon the light-colored, textured rock surface.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a vast expanse of rugged terrain with layered rock formations that display various shades of beige, brown, and gray. These geological formations create an intricate pattern of cliffs, ledges, and crevices, indicating significant erosion over time.\n\nIn the background, the landscape continues to unfold with undulating hills and plateaus covered with sparse vegetation. The horizon showcases a slightly overcast sky with large, fluffy clouds scattered throughout, suggesting a dynamic weather pattern.\n\nOverall, the composition masterfully highlights the resilience of life in arid conditions and the majestic, weather-sculpted features of a canyon or desert environment. The juxtaposition of the delicate, blooming plant against the harsh, enduring landscape forms a vivid narrative about survival and natural beauty. The overall mood is serene, underscored by the vastness and the quiet power of nature.","title":"Upper rim, Escalante Canyon","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["545719","545724","545797","545703","549228","544879","545723","545754","545711","549018","549225","544429","554596","545789","544745","544451"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","desert","plant","survival","formation","plateaus","crack","crevice","ledge","weather"]}
