{"path":"547621.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a gritty, industrial scene at a junkyard or scrapyard. In the foreground, a stack of old cars is compacted and piled up. The vehicles, notable for their vintage designs, suggest the photo was taken several decades ago. They are stacked in a somewhat chaotic, skewed manner, emphasizing the abandonment and decay of what were once valuable assets.\n\nA large crane dominates the central part of the image. The crane, equipped with cables and hooks, is hoisting what appears to be a large, cylindrical metal container, adding dynamic movement to the otherwise still scene. The presence of additional cranes in the background suggests this is a large industrial operation focused on processing and recycling scrap material.\n\nThe atmosphere is somber under an overcast sky, with a muted color palette primarily consisting of blues and grays, enhancing the industrial and abandoned feel of the setting. The wet ground reflects some of the objects, indicating recent rain, which adds a glossy sheen to the surfaces and deepens the sense of a damp, heavy environment typical of such industrial sites.","title":"Hoisting an autoMobile for shredding into scrap metal","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["542660","547610","546172","546253","546267","553012","547611","545545","548110","554318","553011","554301","542656","555492","547625","545010"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["crane","junkyard","hook","scrapyard","sheen","scrap","manner","cable","rain","decade"]}
