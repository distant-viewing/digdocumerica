{"path":"557986.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a large, rugged quarry-like area with distinct layers of exposed rock. The dominant colors in the exposed stone are shades of grey and beige. On one side of the quarry, there is an area covered with graffiti, including large letters that are somewhat difficult to fully decipher from this angle. \n\nThe scenery includes a sparse distribution of green vegetation, mainly small bushes and trees that are visible at the edges of the rock formation. In the foreground of the image, shadows of tree foliage create a blurred frame around the central scene, adding a natural border of darkness which contrasts with the brightly lit rock surface.\n\nA singular figure, a person wearing a bright red top and dark pants, is sitting near the edge of one of the high layers. This person looks quite small in relation to the expanse of stone around them, highlighting the scale of the quarry.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its natural framing and the vivid spot of red from the person’s clothing, draws the viewer’s eye directly towards the seated individual, making them the focal point of this landscape. It's a quiet, still scene that evokes a sense of solitude and reflection amidst a stark, almost desolate environment.","title":"A young woman enjoys a moment of peace and quiet on a shelf of sandstone in Deep Lock Quarry, a part of the Akron, Ohio Metropolitan Park System. The sandstone in the quarry was used in the 19th century in canal construction and other area building projects. The park is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in the 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan areas of Akron and Cleveland. The National Park Service is working on a master plan for the area.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["545571","543838","555625","554814","543503","544341","557118","545529","545755","545753","555622","552545","555623","545759","545534","545550"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["quarry","rock","person","relation","stone","layer","distribution","beige","border","darkness"]}
