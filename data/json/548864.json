{"path":"548864.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures an indoor setting in an office-like environment, notable for its striking black and white checkered floor. In the foreground, an individual, seated at a desk, is seen from an elevated, overhead perspective. The person, whose gender isn't clearly identifiable from this angle, appears to be engaged in writing or drawing on papers, with a pen in hand.\n\nThe desk is equipped with a sizable, early-model computer or typewriter, featuring a large keyboard array. Additional papers and a small personal item, possibly a watch or small device, rest atop the table.\n\nBehind the person, the room extends into two open areas separated by a partially visible partition. A door to the side stands ajar, reflecting a subtle pink light which intriguingly contrasts the predominantly cool, bluish lighting of the setting. A peek into the adjacent section reveals another desk equipped with a chair, though it seems unoccupied at this moment.\n\nThe atmosphere exudes a somewhat dated, retro ambiance, emphasized by the type of office equipment and furnishings visible. The overall mood is somewhat solitary and focused, possibly in a research or administrative office where detailed tasks are performed. The environment appears to be quiet, suggesting either early morning hours or a late-night working scenario.","title":"Laboratory at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546486","556014","551897","558226","546479","557317","553088","546580","557695","557682","544326","546572","552377","556250","549378","546552"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","office","paper","partition","furnishing","working","equip","writing","gender","retro"]}
