{"path":"553092.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man standing in front of a roughly textured, peeling white wall. He is slightly off-center in the frame, positioned slightly to the left, facing towards the camera with a gentle, serene expression. The man has wispy white hair and a neat mustache. He is dressed in a yellow-beige striped button-down shirt and light-colored pants, and stands with his hands clasped in front of him.\n\nTo the right in the background, against the white wall, there's also a vintage Coca-Cola advertisement poster featuring an image of a Coca-Cola bottle and the words \"Drink Coca-Cola SIGN OF GOOD TASTE.\" The wall itself appears somewhat worn, with patches where the white paint has peeled off, revealing what seems to be a darker surface underneath. The ground at the bottom of the image is a dark, dirt-covered surface, enhancing the rustic look of the setting.","title":"Operator of grocery and post office at Nixon, Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["556563","546105","552871","548458","552872","556452","543701","554857","552103","547179","556483","548616","557648","544232","558332","551340"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["peel","wall","clasp","mustache","front","poster","bottle","button","advertisement","word"]}
