{"path":"543180.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The image captured here displays a young girl in an educational or experiential setting, most likely a touch pool or marine learning center. She’s standing in shallow water and examining a sea star which she holds in her hands. Her focused expression indicates interests and curiosity in her marine environment interaction.\n\nShe’s dressed casually in a plaid, short-sleeve shirt under a dark jumper, appropriate for an outdoor educational activity. There’s a name tag pinned to her jumper, reading “Sheri Swanson,” suggesting she’s either a student, a participant in a program, or being identified for a structured activity.\n\nIn the background, incomplete figures of other individuals and parts of the circular pool-like structure are visible. These details set an informal, learning-focused scenario. The outdoor setting is indicated by natural light illuminating the scene and the visible daylight reflection in the water.\n\nOverall, the photograph effectively captures a moment of educational engagement, emphasizing an interactive approach to learning about marine life.","title":"Open house at Hopkins Marine Institute (Stanford).
