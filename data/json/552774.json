{"path":"552774.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"The photograph features a group of men gathered around a white classic car, specifically focusing on its open hood to view the engine. The event appears to be an informal or semi-formal gathering, possibly for evaluating or discussing the car. Each man is dressed in business attire including suits, ties, and some are wearing glasses, indicative of a formal gathering or professional environment.\n\nThe car, identified as a \"HORNET,\" is showcased prominently in the foreground with its hood open, exposing the engine compartment. This suggests that the focus of their attention is either technological aspects or features of the car.\n\nThe setting is outdoors during daytime, in what looks like the parking area of a building with a simple modern structure, characterized by brick walls and a flat, angled roofline that extends out as a covering for the area where the men and the car are situated.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of professional interest or evaluation, with participants taking a serious interest in the technical or mechanical aspects of the automobile displayed.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
