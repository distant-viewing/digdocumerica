{"path":"549968.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting an extensive industrial complex situated beside a body of water, likely a river. The composition primarily shows the industrial facilities enveloped in a somewhat hazy or smoggy atmosphere, which gives the image a slightly obscured, dusky appearance.\n\nThe industrial complex occupies the majority of the foreground and middle ground, with numerous large buildings, some emitting smoke from their stacks, suggesting ongoing industrial processes, likely related to heavy manufacturing or processing. Noteworthy are the different reddish-brown colored basins or ponds; these might be used for waste management or storing byproducts from the plant processes.\n\nOn the right side, there's a railroad track that winds along the perimeter of the facility, highlighted by a series of parked railroad cars and junctions, indicating significant transportation or cargo activities. These tracks meander toward the distant background which is less discernible due to the haze but hints at a continuation of the industrial area.\n\nThe industrial setting is juxtaposed against natural water with minimal visible vegetation, suggesting a focus on industrial activity in this region. The environment appears dominated by the infrastructure related to industrial operations, conveying a strong sense of industrial purpose and capacity.","title":"U.S. Steel Fairless Works on Delaware River","placename":"Bucks County (Pa.)","location":"Bucks County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["555776","549508","551183","549510","551192","549495","548340","545889","550890","555774","555770","551201","549526","551177","552182","551173"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["railroad","complex","byproduct","track","junction","process","capacity","perimeter","continuation","basin"]}
