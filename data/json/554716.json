{"path":"554716.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape, likely taken in a marshy or boggy area during autumn. The composition includes:\n\n1. **Vegetation**: There are numerous trees, some of which are coniferous while others are deciduous and displaying autumn colors like yellows and browns. The ground is covered with various kinds of undergrowth, including grasses and low shrubs, indicating a rich, diverse flora typical of wetland environments.\n\n2. **Water**: Visible in the scene is a small body of water, possibly a stream or a flooded area of the marsh. It reflects some of the sunlight and vegetation above, adding a mirror-like quality to parts of the image.\n\n3. **Fallen Trees**: Key elements in the photo are several fallen trees that lie across the scene at various angles. This suggests natural decay or the aftermath of a storm, contributing to the wild and untamed feel of the landscape.\n\n4. **Background**: The background is partially obscured by the density of the trees but hints at a more open area or sky, with light pouring through. This suggests that the photograph might have been taken in a secluded yet partially open space within a larger forested or natural area.\n\n5. **Lighting and Atmosphere**: The lighting is natural, with sunlight filtering through the trees, highlighting parts of the yellow foliage and casting shadows in the undergrowth. This creates a peaceful yet slightly mysterious atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the quiet beauty of a seemingly untouched natural environment, characterized by its lush wetland ecosystem.","title":"Typical tamarack swamp at moose river plains","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554717","554715","557159","555217","546205","550345","554738","558012","557127","550602","558088","554525","546066","550536","554718","554982"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["undergrowth","autumn","fall","tree","pour","wild","marsh","angles","storm","yellow"]}
