{"path":"545703.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape, likely at dusk, given the softer lighting. In the foreground, there are vibrant clusters of wildflowers, with lush green leaves and stalks topped with dense, pinkish-purple blooms. The plants are surrounded by a mix of grass and patches of reddish soil, suggesting a somewhat arid environment.\n\nThe background features a series of rugged rock formations that rise steeply. These rocks appear to be reddish-brown in color, complementing the soil in the foreground, and their jagged shapes suggest they might be part of a mountainous or desert region. The sky behind the rocks is a soft blue, possibly tinged with the warm colors of a setting sun, though the sun itself is not visible in the frame.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo focuses on the contrast between the delicate beauty of the flowers in the foreground and the stark, enduring presence of the rock formations in the background. This scene likely depicts a peaceful moment in a natural setting, emphasizing the tranquility and beauty of an undisturbed landscape.","title":"Yucca","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545723","545797","544887","549228","555666","549225","552442","545719","544938","557098","549018","545724","544881","554596","544443","545562"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","soil","sun","stalk","bloom","wildflower","beauty","desert","dusk"]}
