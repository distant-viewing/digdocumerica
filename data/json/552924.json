{"path":"552924.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a river delta or a network of water channels, winding through a rugged landscape. The channels of water, reflecting sunlight, divide the landscape into several islands and peninsulas, creating intricate patterns of light and dark. The water bodies divide what appears to be a mixture of barren and vegetated terrain. Some areas have lush green vegetation, possibly indicating shrubs or small trees, which contrast markedly with the more barren, sandy or muddy regions that have minimal to no vegetation.\n\nThe topography is uneven and marked by numerous ridges and troughs, suggesting erosion caused by the flow of water over time. The sediment hues range from light grey to brown, interspersed with darker areas where moisture is more prevalent. The photograph captures the natural complexity and dynamic processes of a wetland ecosystem, highlighting the interplay between water and land over time. Itâ€™s a dynamic environment where water and sediment are continually reshaping the landscape.","title":"Delta of the truckee river at Pyramid Lake","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["546355","542996","544786","544772","544760","545114","548944","557506","550582","550457","543697","550392","550601","549538","550545","552908"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["channel","sediment","divide","trough","water","peninsula","topography","time","moisture","island"]}
