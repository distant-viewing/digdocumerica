{"path":"549543.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a nighttime cityscape scene with a blend of natural and urban elements. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and vibrant due to the nighttime lighting and the low-lying mist.\n\nForeground: The foreground features a curving, illuminated street with streams of headlights and taillights from vehicles, capturing a long exposure that creates streaks of white and red light. There is a grassy area with several mature trees lit by ambient city glow and street lamps. A small, possibly commercial building is visible at the bottom center of the image, illuminated by streetlights around it.\n\nMidground: A spacious park-like area spans the middle of the image, dappled with street lamps and covered in a layer of mist, giving the scene a tranquil and somewhat mysterious feel. This mist partially obscures the landscape, adding to the image's overall mood.\n\nBackground: The background is dominated by a city skyline at night, marked by two distinct towers with observation platforms illuminated by blue and red lights, resembling typical features seen in many cityscapes. Various other buildings with lit windows suggest residential and commercial spaces. The spread of city lights and the darkness of the sky indicate that the photograph was taken after sunset, presenting a contrast between the natural and man-made lighting.\n\nOverall Composition: The composition uses the contrast of moving lights against static lights to draw the eye across the image, creating a dynamic yet harmonious balance. The mist adds a layer of depth and atmosphere, softening the urban environment. The photo captures the essence of urban nightlife blended seamlessly with natural elements, giving viewers a panoramic view of a peaceful city night.","title":"Twilight view from the Rainbow Bridge toward Niagara Falls, Ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["543957","549490","555418","545913","555419","553295","555406","547051","555425","550018","548384","546684","556189","548339","549846","546575"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["mist","city","night","lamp","cityscape","street","light","streetlight","illuminate","dapple"]}
