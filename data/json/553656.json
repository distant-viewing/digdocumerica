{"path":"553656.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a young man engaged in a meticulous activity. He is situated outdoors, working at a makeshift table. The man is leaning forward, concentrating intently on cleaning or possibly repairing a small component which he holds with a tool. His attire consists of a simple white shirt, which appears slightly disheveled, indicating physical labor or long hours of work.\n\nThe setup includes several items: there is a large green bucket on the table, partially filled with water, in which a few items are submerged for soaking. Beside the bucket, there is a white plastic sieve, and a single steel or plastic ring lies on the table. To the right of the bucket, a clear plastic cup can also be seen.\n\nThe background includes a corrugated metal wall, suggesting an informal or improvised workspace. The overall environment appears utilitarian, possibly a makeshift workshop or a part of a residence adapted for work-related tasks. The ambient lighting is dim, possibly indicating evening or shaded conditions, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the man and his task. The mood captured is one of diligence and focus, typical of a craft or manual task requiring attention to detail.","title":"Ralph O'Neil, a Paiute Indian, is about to count a sample batch of cui-ui eggs at the hatchery near Sutcliffe on the western shores of Pyramid Lake.
