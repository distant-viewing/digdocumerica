{"path":"554627.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a landscape dominated by a sloped hillside with a mixture of rocky and grassy terrain. In the foreground, a dog, possibly of mixed breed and medium to large size, is captured mid-stride while traversing a rocky pathway. Its coat is predominantly tan with darker markings, and its tail is raised as it walks.\n\nThe hill slopes diagonally across the image, giving a sense of motion and rough texture due to stones and short grass. Loose stones and pebbles scattered along the hill and pathway indicate a rugged, natural setting. On the right side of the image, taller trees, likely conifers, flank the hill, contributing to a backdrop that suggests a forested, possibly mountainous area.\n\nThe sky is not clearly visible, suggesting an overcast or dusky time of day, which casts an overall muted tone across the scene. This setting appears to be in a remote or wilderness area, evoking a sense of solitude and tranquility apart from the presence of the dog, which introduces an element of life and activity in the otherwise still environment.","title":"Closeup of reseeded pile of tailings at the world's largest titanium mine owned by NL Industries at Tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
