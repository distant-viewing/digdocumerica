{"path":"552810.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene at a marketplace, likely a fish market, where a man is engaged in the activity of handling a large octopus. The man, who is on the left side of the frame, appears to be in his mid-adulthood, wearing casual clothing consisting of a striped, short-sleeve shirt and yellow pants. He is wearing sunglasses and has a slightly tilted posture as he looks at the octopus, which he is picking up from a bed of crushed ice.\n\nThe octopus is large, with its distinct head and sprawling tentacles splayed across and partially hanging over the edge of a wooden stall that contains various fish, also nestled in copious amounts of ice to keep them fresh. The background includes a glimpse of an open-air structure with a roof, suggesting this is a covered section of the market. There's a clear, sunny sky visible above the structure, indicating a bright day conducive for market activities.\n\nThe setting projects a busy, functional atmosphere typical of a fish market, where fresh seafood is displayed and sold. The manâ€™s focused interaction with the octopus positions him as either a vendor or a customer evaluating or preparing the seafood for sale. The overall composition of the photograph, filled with the vivid textures of fresh seafood and market life, creates a snapshot of everyday commerce and culinary culture.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi river reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
