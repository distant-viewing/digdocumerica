{"path":"545365.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive junkyard densely packed with damaged and dilapidated cars. The vehicles, primarily from mid-20th century models, exhibit various states of disrepair: dented bodies, shattered windshields, crumpled roofs, and faded or peeling paint are commonly visible. The array of cars is tightly squeezed together, emphasizing the sheer volume of automotive waste.\n\nThe vehicles' colors are mostly muted, with shades ranging from faded blues and whites to grays, hinting at their age and long exposure to the elements. The composition of the photograph provides a strong sense of depth and scale, with the rows of cars extending far into the backdrop where a clear sky meets a low, distant mountain range.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a feeling of abandonment and decay, reflecting the end life stage of these once-functional machines now piled in this automotive graveyard. The image is a stark representation of industrial and consumer waste.","title":"Gaede's wrecking yard","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["552999","555492","555491","553005","546268","543166","545340","552739","553006","542656","542590","545303","553004","546249","552738","547476"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["waste","car","consumer","junkyard","windshield","volume","representation","disrepair","vehicle","white"]}
