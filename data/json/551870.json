{"path":"551870.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an ornate building facade captured in what appears to be a European city street view. The architectural style is rich and intricate, reminiscent of Art Nouveau, with a prominent use of curves and decorative elements. There are multiple statues adorning the exterior of the building, along with sculpted figures that contribute to the grandeur and artistic detailing of the architecture.\n\nThe buildingâ€™s windows are large and rectangular, with some featuring stained glass or intricate designs. Notably, there is a large rounded balcony with elaborate metal railings and sculptural details that protrude from the building, adding to its ornate appearance.\n\nIn the foreground, there are street-level features that contrast with the historic aesthetic of the architecture. There is a market stall or kiosk with a red and white canopy on the left side. This stall is surrounded by flower arrangements in white bins, which add a touch of natural beauty and color to the stone-paved street. There's also a small, wheeled cart in the street, which might be used for street cleaning or maintenance.\n\nAt the time the photo was taken, the street appears wet, possibly after a rain, which creates a reflective sheen on the cobblestones, enhancing the atmosphere of the scene. The photograph captures a moment where there are no visible people actively moving around, providing a quiet, serene snapshot of the street life surrounding this architecturally striking building.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551866","557643","549681","556046","557073","551864","549659","555949","557074","552968","549676","551867","551788","550042","557635","551786"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["street","stall","cobblestone","kiosk","building","cleaning","bin","cart","architecture","sheen"]}
