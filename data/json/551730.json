{"path":"551730.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between a woman and a young child on the steps of an urban apartment building. The woman, who has long, dark hair, is kneeling next to a large decorative planter filled with various plants, helping the child participate in gardening. She is dressed in a dark, floral top and patterned trousers, while the child is wearing a light-colored cardigan and patterned pants. Both appear focused on either planting or tending to the plants, with the child holding a small yellow gardening tool.\n\nThe setting is a stone-paved landing of an apartment entryway, which is lined with multiple similar entry points. To the left, there is another pot and a bright orange bucket, possibly containing gardening supplies. The background reveals a neatly kept urban scene with well-maintained greenery and trees, a fenced-off walkway, and a street further back lined with parked cars. The lighting suggests it might be a cloudy or overcast day, which adds a soft tone to the scene.\n\nThe composition emphasizes an intimate, serene activity, blending urban living with the nurturing of nature. The architecture and the visible street elements suggest this may be in a densely populated city. The scene is likely to evoke feelings of warmth, care, and the simplicity of shared small moments.","title":"Brooklyn home owner plants her front yard flower container with the help of her young son.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551728","551623","551705","551780","551807","551701","549298","551748","551630","553219","551619","547055","551620","551104","553543","550055"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["gardening","child","apartment","entryway","landing","planting","planter","cardigan","entry","pot"]}
