{"path":"548279.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a man sitting on the deck of what appears to be a boat or a similar wooden structure. He is dressed in a work-related outfit comprising a dark green shirt (embroidered with a name, \"Alex\") and matching trousers, both of which look slightly worn and dirty, indicating physical labor. On his head, he wears a camouflage cap. His facial expressions convey a sense of weariness or contemplation as he looks directly at the camera, with his hands clasped and elbows resting on his knees.\n\nThe setting around him includes elements typical of a marine or outdoor environment. On his right side, there is a large, rustic, metal winch or piece of equipment, suggesting that the location might be used for fishing or similar activities. Also visible are some ropes and a small, white plastic container near the equipment, adding to the cluttered, utilitarian feel of the space. The background is slightly blurred, but it suggests a natural landscape, possibly a riverbank or wetland area, with hints of vegetation and open sky visible.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of pause in a manual labor setting, possibly on a fishing boat, emphasizing the rugged and solitary nature of the man's work environment.","title":"Idle oyster boat captain at Pointe a La Hache.
