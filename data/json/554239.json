{"path":"554239.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a ski lift line during winter. We see numerous skiers from a rear perspective, queued up and waiting their turn to board the lift. The skiers are dressed in typical winter gear that includes colorful ski jackets, hats, and gloves. They are holding their skis upright beside them, which are mostly pointed upwards, indicating readiness and anticipation for their turn to ski.\n\nThe setting is mountainous, with the background showing snow-covered slopes bathed under a clear blue sky, suggesting good weather conditions for skiing. The snow on the ground and the mountains in the distance is well-lit by the sunshine, enhancing the cold, crisp ambiance.\n\nThe composition of the photo, taken from the back of the line, provides a sense of being part of the line waiting to experience the slopes. The alignment of skiers and skis creates vertical lines that draw the eye towards the front of the queue and beyond it, further emphasizing the depth and the busy nature of the ski resort.","title":"Skiers waiting for the free shuttle bus that goes between the Aspen and Snowmass ski areas.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554245","554242","550004","554247","554235","554244","554254","554248","554234","554240","554292","554238","554236","554276","550017","554257"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","skier","lift","wait","winter","turn","snow","slope","line","sunshine"]}
