{"path":"556115.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene outside a building in Wenatchee, as indicated by the sign above the entrance. The architecture of the building is traditional with red brick walls, large windows, and a symmetrical, slightly enhanced facade featuring cornices and a central apex.\n\nIn the foreground, two men are standing on a brick-paved area. One man is donned in a suit and tie with a badge or pin visible on his lapel, looking off to the side somewhat pensively. He carries a satchel and stands with a relaxed, yet formal posture. The other man, positioned slightly behind, is dressed in a dark uniform and cap, likely suggesting a role connected to transportation or security. He is also looking away, holding a small item in one hand.\n\nAdjacent to the building, there is a low fence with potted flowers, adding a decorative and welcoming touch to the building's entrance. The time appears to be during the day, under overcast weather conditions, giving the colors a muted tone. The setting and attire suggest this might be an event of some significance, potentially related to the function or role of the building, but no overt activity is seen besides the quiet standing of the two men.","title":"Wenatchee, Washington, train depot.
