{"path":"552868.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, three older men are depicted on what appears to be a boat, with a vast body of water visible in the background, suggesting they are likely on a lake or sea. The sky is clear and light, indicating a sunny day. \n\nThe man on the left is wearing light blue shirt with glasses hanging around his neck, and dark trousers. He is kneeling and looks like he is engaged in a conversation or a task on the boat. \n\nThe man in the middle appears to be standing and partially turned towards the other two men. He wears a vertically striped shirt in shades of blue and cream, with dark trousers. He has a watch on his left wrist and a ring on his left ring finger.\n\nThe man on the right is sitting on the edge of the boat, wearing a patterned shirt in light colors, sunglasses, and dark trousers. He is holding a small, checked cup or container in his right hand and is smiling.\n\nAll three men seem relaxed and are possibly engaged in a leisure activity, such as fishing or simply enjoying a day out on the water. Their casual dress and the presence of a small cooler or container suggest a recreational outing among friends. The atmosphere is casual and friendly.","title":"Lake borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi river flood waters has polluted their oyster beds.
