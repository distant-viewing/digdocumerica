{"path":"551089.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a grim and chaotic scene of destruction, possibly the aftermath of an industrial accident or demolition. The foreground and background are filled with vast piles of debris that include twisted metal, broken beams, and scattered remnants of machinery and infrastructure. Amidst this, active small fires are burning, sending up tendrils of smoke, which contribute to an atmosphere of recent devastation.\n\nIn the scene, two individuals wearing hard hats are visible; they appear to be workers or rescue personnel navigating the rubble. One of them, located in the foreground, is walking towards a smoldering area and seems to be carrying a tool or equipment. The other person, further in the background, is facing away from the camera and appears to be engaged in inspecting or managing the aftermath.\n\nThe overall composition is somber, characterized by the muted colors of the debris and the gray smoke, suggesting a somber and hazardous environment. This scene likely involves emergency response or cleanup operations, underlining the impact and severity of the event that caused such destruction.","title":"Raleigh Junk Company, a large scrap metal operation on the Kanawha River at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
