{"path":"551323.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a cluttered and bustling roadside commercial scene, prominently featuring a variety of business signs. In the foreground, a sign shaped like a barrel reads \"Kandy Keg\" in stylized letters along its side. Beyond this, a dense assortment of signage competes for attention, advertising a range of products and services.\n\nKey signs include one for \"Lake Barber Shop\" with a Pepsi logo, and another offering \"T-SHIRTS & MOCCASINS,\" suggesting a mix of general merchandise and possibly tourist-oriented stores. \"Country Candies\" is advertised, playing into a possible local or rustic theme. Several other signs are partially visible, hinting at the presence of a cafe and other services.\n\nThe environment appears somewhat dated given the style of vehicles visible in the backgroundâ€”older model cars hint at the photograph not being recent. Trees and a bit of greenery can be seen, suggesting the area might be semi-rural or suburban. The overall composition of the image, with its collage of signs and busy atmosphere, evokes a sense of a local business district catering to both regulars and passersby, typical of many American towns.","title":"Sign congestion on \"the strip,\" mile long amusement area","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["554185","549113","547021","551495","553017","545154","549008","549224","549017","555438","554184","545618","543878","551494","549014","545614"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["advertise","sign","service","business","merchandise","cafe","passersby","cater","barrel","tourist"]}
