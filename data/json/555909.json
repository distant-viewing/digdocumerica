{"path":"555909.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid street scene captured from a slightly elevated perspective, looking down a narrow alleyway. Prominent in the foreground to the right side of the frame is a young man wearing a casual denim jacket with a popped collar and jeans. His attire suggests a cool or rebellious demeanor typical of youth street fashion. Close to him and partially obscured, a young woman is visible; she holds a baby wrapped in a light blanket in her arms.\n\nTo the left of the frame, another young woman stands in the alley. She wears a fitted crop top and high-waisted pants, her pose relaxed but engaging as she looks directly towards the photographer with a grin, perhaps interacting with the people in the foreground.\n\nThe background shows an urban environment characterized by older buildings with exposed brickwork, and partial views of a street where several cars are parked. The scene is set under an overcast sky, lending a slightly moody tone to the ambient lighting, which highlights the textures and the everyday nature of the setting. \n\nThe overall composition uses the perspective of the alley and the pillars on the side to guide the viewer's eye through the scene, emphasizing the interaction of the individuals and providing a slice-of-life glimpse into their urban surroundings.","title":"Latin girl holding a child on an inner city porch in Paterson New Jersey.
