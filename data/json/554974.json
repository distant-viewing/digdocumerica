{"path":"554974.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a large tree trunk, showcasing its rugged and textured bark, in shades of dark brown and gray with patches of green moss. The focus is primarily on the surface detail and pattern of the bark. Around and across the trunk are several small, thin branches, some of which are broken. These branches protrude from the trunk at various angles, adding a slightly chaotic and natural element to the composition. The image conveys a sense of the dense and possibly damp environment typical of a forest, emphasizing the organic and wild nature of the setting. The background is out of focus, allowing the tree trunk and its immediate surroundings to dominate the visual field. Overall, the photograph is a study in texture, pattern, and the quiet, understated beauty of woodland scenery.","title":"Old growth sitka spruce snags and burls on the pacific coast area of the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557616","553587","550792","551355","544662","557621","542749","545288","543488","555001","554592","555181","555188","553586","545292","550703"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","bark","damp","branch","protrude","moss","study","pattern","scenery","allow"]}
