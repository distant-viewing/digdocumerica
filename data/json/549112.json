{"path":"549112.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, a man stands outdoors under a clear blue sky. He has shoulder-length, light brown hair and is wearing a sleeveless white tank top with \"USA\" printed on it in a distressed style. He also sports heavily patched and embroidered blue jeans, which are eye-catching with their multiple patterns and colors, including designs of red, yellow, and various other shades. There's a distinct 1970s vibe to his attire, complemented by his bare feet.\n\nThe man is holding a small black dog in his left arm, and both are gazing off into the distance to the right of the frame, which gives a thoughtful, serene feel to the scene. The dog appears relaxed and comfortable in his arm.\n\nThe environment is rocky and sparse with very little vegetation, suggesting a rugged desert-like terrain. There are small stones and a few dry brushes around his feet. The simplicity of the background with its clear sky emphasizes the subject and his colorful attire. Overall, the image has a casual and somewhat nostalgic feel, capturing a moment of quiet companionship and rugged individuality in a natural setting.","title":"Hitchhiker with his dog, Tripper, on U.S. 66, U.S. 66 crosses the Colorado River at Topock.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["552938","554126","554951","553089","557112","554537","556549","557637","547148","549928","547100","543031","556529","555929","551300","553801"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["foot","dog","arm","companionship","brush","print","attire","feel","simplicity","vibe"]}
