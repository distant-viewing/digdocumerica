{"path":"542853.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an intriguing scene involving a large, truncated redwood tree trunk mounted on the bed of a dark brown Ford pickup truck. The tree trunk is very prominent and hollow, creating a natural archway almost large enough to walk through. The edges of the trunk appear jagged and weathered, indicating it might have been cut or shattered during its fall.\n\nThe Ford truck, clearly visible from the rear, is parked under the shaded part of this giant trunk, showcasing the contrast in size between man-made engineering and natural growth. The vehicle has distinctive \"Ford\" branding shown in white embossed letters on the tailgate and a particulars license plate that is slightly reflective, catching some light.\n\nIn terms of the background, the scene is set outdoors, with hints of other foliage and trees under a clear, possibly sunny sky, which suggests a forest or rural setting. The light filters through the trees, casting patches of brightness and shadow over the truck and the ground. The overall environment looks peaceful and is typical of an area rich in natural, wooded landscapes.","title":"Redwood stump","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544767","542854","542855","545930","555154","546983","542609","557116","554420","544584","548750","545504","552583","552584","543588","556429"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["trunk","truck","redwood","shatter","branding","archway","license","pickup","rear","tree"]}
