{"path":"547728.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image portrays a fire burning through a field. The foreground of the photograph is dominated by bright flames licking at dry grass and a blackened area, suggesting that the fire has already consumed part of this terrain. Above the flames, smoke, a mix of gray and faint bluish hues, rises into the sky, blurring the horizon and mingling with the clouds above.\n\nThe background reveals a flat, expansive landscape that extends under a wide sky. This area appears to be rural with minimal vegetation. A few isolated trees dot the landscape in the distance, with one more prominently visible against the horizon. There is a noticeable contrast between the dark, scorched earth where the fire has passed, and patches of untouched, golden-brown grass ahead and around the blaze.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of natural devastation, highlighting the destructive power of fire as it spreads uncontrollably over dry farmland, reshaping the quiet rural scenery into a scene of dynamic and dangerous activity. The absence of people or any firefighting efforts suggests the remoteness of the location or the initial stages of the fire outbreak.","title":"This entire field of straw, west of el centro in the imperial valley, burned off in less than half an hour.
