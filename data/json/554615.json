{"path":"554615.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, likely during a community event or public gathering. In the foreground, a young person is featured, focused on her task, wearing casual attire: a yellow and red horizontal stripe T-shirt, white shorts, and dark shoes. This individual is holding a camera in one hand and a plastic bag possibly containing other belongings in another, suggesting they are either enjoying the festivities or documenting the event. \n\nBeside this person, there's a striking, whimsical trash bin designed to resemble a clown's face, adding a playful element to the scene. The trash bin has a red hat-like top and a wide, smiling visage, indicating the cheerful nature of the event.\n\nIn the background, other attendees can be seen, including a woman in a white dress carrying a purse, and a group of other individuals in various casual summer clothing, standing and conversing, which contributes to the lively atmosphere. There are visible parked cars and lush greenery in the distance against a backdrop of a typical residential neighborhood, with hills and houses partially obscured by foliage. This setting suggests the event is being held in a small town or suburban area. The overall ambiance is casual and festive, characteristic of a local community gathering.","title":"Clown-topped garbage can is used at an ice cream stand in Inlet, to encourage its use and cut down on litter, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558295","551689","549579","558294","545929","551688","553251","553275","551808","551699","546770","553234","553287","555947","550076","551011"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["bin","event","trash","gathering","festivity","purse","belonging","community","attendee","standing"]}
