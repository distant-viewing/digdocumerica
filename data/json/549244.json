{"path":"549244.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural geological formation with a rugged terrain. It appears to be a volcanic or mountainous area. The image shows a narrow channel or crevice filled with what seems to be muddy water; the color of the water varies from dark brown to a murkier greenish hue. The edges of this water channel are bordered by rock formations that are dark in color, likely volcanic rock, with various textures and speckles of different colors such as light gray and hints of orange, suggesting mineral deposits or weathering effects.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and harsh, consisting of sharp, jagged rocks and boulders. The bottom of the channel where the water collects is slightly smoother, potentially from sediment accumulation. There's no visible vegetation or life, indicating a possibly arid or barren environment typical of high-altitude volcanic landscapes.\n\nThe overall composition is a vertical aerial or high-angle view into the crevice, focusing on the interplay between the rugged rock textures and the serpentine water path within. The image gives a strong sense of isolation and the inhospitable nature of the environment.","title":"Acme coal mine","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["555626","550492","550395","543977","552424","550414","545795","550481","544748","543721","551231","543976","545636","553420","545656","552421"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["channel","crevice","rock","formation","water","deposit","speckle","collect","boulder","accumulation"]}
