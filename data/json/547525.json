{"path":"547525.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily littered natural area, primarily featuring water and shoreline. The scene is strewn with various pieces of trash and discarded items, creating an overall impression of environmental neglect or pollution.\n\nThe foreground prominently features an abandoned, overturned wooden drawer lying in shallow water, with its contents spilling out into the murky liquid. Around this central object, numerous other pieces of debris are visible, including plastic water bottles, pieces of broken foam, and miscellaneous litter scattered across the wet ground and partially submerged.\n\nThe middle ground shows more scattered trash and leads up to a dense collection of reeds or tall grasses, emphasizing the natural setting. The bank on the right side is littered with more garbage and rocks, displaying a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human waste.\n\nThe background is less detailed, containing further dense vegetation, which might indicate that the location is a wetland or marshy area. The lighting in the photograph is natural, suggesting it was taken during daytime under clear skies, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the vibrant colors of the natural environment versus the stark, human-made waste.\n\nThis environmental scene conveys a strong message about pollution in natural habitats, highlighting the impact of human activities on natural ecosystems.","title":"Middletown dump meets the salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["550352","551440","550687","550812","552080","556419","551441","547520","550800","547513","547524","552089","555228","552811","551247","547516"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["piece","trash","waste","pollution","liquid","litter","reed","foam","garbage","bottle"]}
