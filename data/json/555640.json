{"path":"555640.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, rustic store that seems to be closed or abandoned. The store is housed in a wooden structure with peeling red paint and is surrounded by lush greenery. Two large windows are visible. One displays various signs advertising \"Tobacco, Candy, and Auto Accessories,\" while the other mentions \"Groceries, Hardware.\" An old, faded advertisement for \"Pleasant Moments Cigarettes\" hangs on the wood siding next to the left window.\n\nThe front porch of the store is wooden, slightly raised, and shows signs of wear and neglect, including missing planks and visible debris. Under the windows, there are weathered wooden boards leaning against the building, and some litter or leftover items can be seen through the slightly open door.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, a weathered wooden mailbox on a post is prominently featured, labeled with \"Rural Route\" information, specifying \"Box 175, Clarksville.\" A bush has grown around and partially obscures this mailbox.\n\nA dense overgrowth of bushes and grass suggests that the area hasn't been tended to in a while, adding to the feel of a deserted or rarely visited location. The store gives an impression of past community activity now forgotten, evoked by the rustic, nostalgic setting and the presence of everyday products signage.","title":"Abandoned country store in area which has been strip mined by coal companies near Chandlersville, in southeastern Ohio","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["555377","552518","556368","546973","552454","556330","552517","547805","552513","550279","554707","547808","554036","555509","543342","552528"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","mailbox","specify","overgrowth","window","forget","visit","mention","tend","miss"]}
