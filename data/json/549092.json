{"path":"549092.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two young girls outdoors on a breezy day, as indicated by their hair being blown about. One girl is wearing a yellow long-sleeved shirt and has her hair partially controlled by a yellow hair clip, while the other girl is dressed in a furry black and white jacket. Both girls have a joyous, playful expression on their faces.\n\nThey are holding a duck together, each grasping different parts of the bird. The duck appears calm, with its wings slightly spread. The background is softly focused, showing a natural, earthy environment with a hint of green and brown, suggesting an open field or a rural area. The lighting is bright, presumably natural sunlight, enhancing the vividness of the scene. \n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of youthful adventure and enjoyment in a natural setting.","title":"Second grade school girls from Calipatria clutch pintail ducks.
