{"path":"552985.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring a large sign for \"The Crystal Tower,\" which advertises \"Exclusive Luxury Condominiums for the Discriminate Buyer.\" The sign details amenities such as a recreation room, swimming pool, and private beach, and mentions that 2-3 bedroom homes are for sale. A phone number and an apartment number for inquiries are also provided on the sign.\n\nTo the left of the sign, partially visible, is a white car with its door open. A woman is standing next to the car, dressed in a red vest over a white shirt, with dark sunglasses and her hair styled under a hat. She appears to be either entering or exiting the vehicle, looking slightly towards her right at something outside the frame of the photograph.\n\nThe sign and the woman are against a background consisting of a stone-built structure, possibly part of the condominium building advertised. The photograph is taken under bright sunlight with distinct shadows cast across the sign, likely from a nearby structure or natural element out of frame. The overall composition gives a sense of a promotional or real estate-related activity, capturing a moment in a sunny, residential parking area.","title":"Condominium boom.
