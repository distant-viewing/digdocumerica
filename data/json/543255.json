{"path":"543255.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking coastal scene featuring a wide sandy beach that stretches along the foot of a lush, rolling landscape. The beach is empty except for a single figure walking near the shoreline, carrying what appears to be a surfboard. This individual adds a human element to the vastness of the landscape.\n\nTo the right of the image, the coast is adorned with vibrant wildflowers in full bloom, painting the scene with strokes of yellow, pink, and green against the sandy beach. These flowers are clustered densely along the slope leading up to the cliffs, enhancing the natural beauty of the scene.\n\nThe waves of the ocean gently roll onto the shore, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. In the background, the coastline curves gracefully, bordered by hills and mountains that ascend from the beach. These mountains exhibit a mix of green and brown hues, suggesting a rugged terrain rich in vegetation.\n\nThe sky above is clear and blue, contributing to the overall clarity and vividness of the image. Itâ€™s a scene that evokes a sense of peace and natural splendor, perfect for contemplation or a quiet, solitary walk along the beach.","title":"Wild flowers provide a backdrop","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547592","546953","543287","545106","547697","551554","545280","547596","543090","555400","543300","543066","543055","547612","547607","543069"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","surfboard","walk","coast","peace","mountain","foot","bloom","vividness","wildflower"]}
