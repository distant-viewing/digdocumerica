{"path":"548688.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of considerable disarray and destruction, likely on a dilapidated wooden dock or a similar waterfront location. The composition is dense with debris and discarded objects, creating a chaotic and cluttered appearance.\n\nKey elements in the image include:\n- Several damaged boats that appear in various states of decay. One prominent green boat in the foreground shows signs of neglect, with visible damages and surrounded by trash.\n- A lot of wooden debris scattered around the area, including pieces of planks, broken furniture, and fragments of wooden structures.\n- Miscellaneous items like a bright green bucket and a large white piece that might be part of a boat or a large container.\n- The overall setting seems to be outdoors, under bright lighting conditions, suggesting it was taken during the day.\n\nThe texture of the wooden dock is weathered and worn, indicating long-term exposure to elements and perhaps lack of maintenance. The chaotic assembly of items and lack of any visible human activity give the image a sense of abandonment and neglect. The background is relatively indistinct, focusing the viewer's attention on the debris and damage in the foreground.","title":"Boat dock jumble in downtown Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["552128","549311","547941","547622","548105","552158","547594","544462","547584","547572","547957","549307","551985","552102","549306","547626"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["damage","boat","lack","debris","dock","neglect","piece","item","disarray","assembly"]}
