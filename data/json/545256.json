{"path":"545256.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a timber processing or storage area set in the foreground, with a heavily industrialized setting in the background. In the foreground, a large pile of logs is prominently visible. The logs vary in length and diameter, are randomly stacked, and some have rough, uneven ends suggesting recent cutting. They appear aged and weathered, indicative of outdoor storage.\n\nIn the background, a factory or industrial plant dominates the scene. It features tall structures, including stacks emitting white and grey smoke and steam, contributing to an atmosphere of industrial activity. The factory includes various complex architectural elements such as pipes, external staircases, and metal frameworks, which suggest ongoing operations or construction.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, providing a stark contrast to the industrial emissions, and indicates that the photograph is likely taken during the day under sunny conditions. The composition of the picture, with natural resources in the foreground and industrial elements in the background, juxtaposes the raw materials and their processing environment, possibly hinting at themes of natural resource use and industrial impact.","title":"St. Regis pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545260","543749","546236","552162","545244","550340","542942","552163","550349","542944","542945","550350","545910","550716","542941","548155"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["resource","log","factory","stack","processing","cutting","storage","industrialize","staircase","timber"]}
