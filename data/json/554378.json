{"path":"554378.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image captures a scene at what appears to be an exhibition or trade show setting, potentially focused on automotive or furniture design given the prominent display of stylish seats. In the foreground, two sets of luxurious-looking automotive seats are positioned; one set facing towards us and the other away. Both sets feature a cream-colored upholstery, possibly leather, with a horizontally segmented design enhancing their sleek and comfortable appearance.\n\nIn the center of the composition stands a fashionably dressed woman, dominating the scene with her striking attire. She wears a lengthy, intricate printed coat, and her head is adorned with a large, round, fluffy hat that adds a dramatic flair to her presence. She is holding a cigarette in one hand, which she appears to be smoking, adding a casual yet sophisticated energy to her posture.\n\nThe background is populated with a diverse group of spectators, some of whom are watching the woman, while others converse among themselves or look at other exhibits. The area is architecturally modern, with partitions, bold geometric color blocks on some walls, and ambient, soft overhead lighting that illuminates the venue adequately without overpowering the subjects. The entire scene conveys a blend of style, leisure, and business, characterized by the interaction of people, fashion, and design elements within a public display or commercial environment.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554383","554382","554386","556703","556695","554381","553275","554371","553191","556648","557723","554387","554389","554391","554372","554390"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["set","seat","display","partition","design","flair","exhibit","trade","exhibition","leather"]}
