{"path":"551213.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene view at dusk over a large body of water, likely a river, seen from an elevated vantage point. To the left, there's a massive dam or lock system. The dam is equipped with multiple gates and the upper tier features a series of circular shapes, which are possibly part of the damâ€™s operational structures, such as turbines or control units.\n\nA road runs parallel to the dam, illuminated by the soft light of sunset. The river reflects the waning sunlight, creating a shimmering path across its surface. In the middle distance, several boats are visible on the water, and one of them is moving, leaving a trail in the water reflecting the sunset light. The opposite banks of the river are lined with lush greenery and hints of buildings or small structures, barely visible against the evening sky.\n\nThe sky itself is rendered in muted tones of blue and purple, with the sun low on the horizon, imparting a calm and peaceful ambiance to the scene. The photograph combines elements of human engineering and natural beauty, showcasing a moment of tranquility at the end of the day.","title":"Osage river and bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["546392","551212","552263","547142","552350","549004","551215","551206","551210","543143","549486","550771","547731","547230","544707","545430"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dam","sunset","river","tier","render","impart","gate","engineering","unit","purple"]}
