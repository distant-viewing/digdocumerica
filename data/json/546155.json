{"path":"546155.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts two elderly men engaged in playing dominoes at a worn, square table. The man on the left is dressed in a plaid shirt with suspenders, his expression focused yet somewhat stern as he observes the game. His posture is relaxed, and he has a slight slouch. Opposite him, the man on the right wears a straw hat and a checked shirt; he actively reaches out to play a domino, suggesting motion and possibly strategizing his next move.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor or semi-outdoor area, possibly a porch or covered patio, indicated by the visible portion of a door and a window with shutters in the background. The walls are a light, muted color, adding to the serene outdoor feeling. The table itself is notably aged and distressed, adding a rustic feel to the scene. Overall, the image captures a moment of leisurely activity and companionship between the two men, within a tranquil, everyday setting.","title":"Ples Jones, 94, and Cephus Lafayette Cromwell, 75, play dominos on Jones' porch.","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["556219","544213","547376","558227","548567","548566","557152","553290","544219","546140","553215","557362","553291","553519","548581","548564"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["table","patio","move","suspender","man","companionship","shutter","straw","game","porch"]}
