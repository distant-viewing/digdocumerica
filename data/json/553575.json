{"path":"553575.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic view looking upward at a cluster of tall, slender trees against a darkening sky. The trees, which are likely conifers, have sparse branches primarily near their tops, with the branches etching intricate silhouettes against the sky. The trunks of these trees are straight and stand tightly packed, emphasizing a sense of verticality and height. A faint, soft glow, possibly from the moon, peeks through the trees, illuminating part of the sky in a gentle, diffused light which contrasts with the deep blues and blacks of the twilight sky. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of serenity and the majestic grandeur of nature. The image angle, pointing directly upwards from a ground perspective towards the sky, enhances the feeling of being dwarfed by the towering presence of the trees. There are no discernible human elements or activitiesâ€”just the natural elements in their quiet magnificence.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora scene within the section of the burn area known as \"granite fire.\"  This part of the territory has not yet been logged","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["543621","553576","555081","543442","554395","555128","553574","554981","542927","548744","555112","555119","543406","542725","553580","542849"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["etch","moon","verticality","branch","tree","conifer","black","darken","serenity","peek"]}
