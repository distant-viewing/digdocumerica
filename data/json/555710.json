{"path":"555710.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph showcasing a stunning natural landscape consisting of a multitude of elements. It captures a vast blue body of water, possibly a lake or a fjord, meandering through a mountainous terrain. The water is deep blue and dotted with numerous small islands and peninsulas covered with dense green forests or bushes, creating intricate patterns and shorelines.\n\nToward the top of the photograph, the scene stretches into rugged snow-capped mountain ranges in the backdrop, suggesting that this location could be in a colder, possibly northern, region. The mountains appear majestic with white snow contrasting against darker rocky patches.\n\nIn the middle of the blue waters, a single boat or ship, evident by the white wake it leaves behind, is moving, hinting at human activity and the scale of the landscape. This boat adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene natural scenery.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests it might be taken during the day under clear skies, allowing for vivid colors and clear visibility of the geographical and natural features. The overall composition beautifully captures the interaction between land, water, and human presence in a rugged, pristine environment.","title":"The Alaska ferry \"Bartlett\" heading west across Prince William Sound, near Valdez.
