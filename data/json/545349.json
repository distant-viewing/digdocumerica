{"path":"545349.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The image captures a serene and somewhat moody rural scene during dusk or early evening. A dirt road stretches from the foreground into the distance, bordered by sparse vegetation and patches of grass. The road is gravelly, and the ambiance suggests it's not frequently traversed. There is a stop sign to the left at the edge of the road, slightly tilted, adding to the rural, neglected vibe of the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there's a person standing, facing away from the camera towards the horizon. The person appears to be wearing a wide-brimmed hat, typically a cowboy hat, along with what seems to be casual, possibly denim attire. This attire and their posture, as they look into the distance, contribute to a contemplative or introspective mood.\n\nThe background features a range of low mountains or hills under a sky painted with the soft colors of sunsetâ€”pinks, purples, and blues melding together, which adds a dramatic yet tranquil tone to the landscape. Few thin clouds are scattered across the sky, enhancing the sunset's effect. Additionally, there are distant utility poles and lines, adding a subtle hint of human presence in this otherwise natural and peaceful setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a sense of quiet and isolation, underscored by the vast open spaces and the solitary figure. It invites the viewer to reflect on solitude and the beauty of natural, untouched landscapes at twilight.","title":"Rio GRande Valley","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["543044","556960","543024","552521","545347","549140","555881","545886","554832","547300","549182","553820","557119","549261","547292","548230"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["road","sunset","stop","hat","cowboy","pink","person","attire","denim","purple"]}
