{"path":"544350.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque natural setting featuring a large waterfall. The waterfall is situated within a rugged canyon, with steep, rocky cliffs framing the scene. Water cascades directly down from the top of the cliff into a serene, turquoise pool below. Around the edges of the pool, several smaller cascading pools can also be observed, adding to the tranquility and beauty of the scene.\n\nThe area surrounding the waterfall is lush, with a variety of trees and dense foliage, including some drought-resistant vegetation like cacti. Several towels and beach mats are spread out on the sandy shore near the pool, suggesting that this is a popular spot for relaxation and perhaps swimming. A few individuals can be seen in and around the water, enjoying the cool, refreshing environment.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is one of peacefulness and seclusion, offering a respite from the outside world in a stunning natural setting. The composition of the photograph, with its rich natural colors and the positioning of the waterfall centrally, draws the viewer's eye directly to the water cascading into the pool, highlighting the natural beauty of the landscape.","title":"Bathers enjoy the Havasu Falls.
