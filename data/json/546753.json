{"path":"546753.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This is a vintage aerial photograph with a panoramic view that captures a sprawling desert landscape at sunset. In the foreground, multiple areas are densely dotted with clusters of buildings or structures—possibly a small town or residential area. Their roofs and surfaces reflect the sunlight, creating vivid specks of light that resemble glowing embers spread across the terrain.\n\nThe background showcases a dramatic mountain range silhouetted against a soft, glowing sky. These jagged peaks help frame the photo and add a sense of depth and grandeur. Above them, the sky is a combination of dusky purples and blues, punctuated by lighter clouds that are tinged with the orange and yellow hues of the sunset.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—blending the rugged terrain with the ethereal sky—creates a contrast between the earthy landscape and the transcendent quality of the sunset, emphasizing nature's beauty and scale. The use of lighting, with reflections off certain surfaces, further enhances the visual impact of the sunset on this desert environment.","title":"Aerial shot of Apache Junction-rapidly developing suburb of Phoenix","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544051","547717","552897","545752","552923","545748","552896","545771","557560","544024","545761","544063","544027","542680","544400","542675"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sunset","desert","speck","combination","purple","grandeur","terrain","peak","surface","town"]}
