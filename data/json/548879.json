{"path":"548879.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a man kneeling on grass next to open, sophisticated equipment housed within foam-lined carrying cases. The man wears a light-colored, plaid, short-sleeved shirt and dark jeans. He appears to be examining or demonstrating a piece of electronic monitoring equipment contained within one of the cases; the device has several switches, knobs, and wiring.\n\nTwo cases are visible; one is large and suitcase-like, with sections for different components, and another smaller toolbox filled with metal cylinders and parts. Both cases have components that suggest their use in a precisely technical or scientific field, possibly related to environmental monitoring, as indicated by one visible label that partially reads \"AIR QUALITY MONITOR.\"\n\nIn the background, two trucks equipped with canopies are parked on grass, indicating that the location might be a field or temporary mobile work site. This setting suggests an outdoor, possibly industrial or research-related activity. The scene is overcast, with light clouds diffusing the natural light, enhancing the focus on the man and his technical equipment.","title":"Mobile monitoring equipment from epa's Las Vegas national research center.
