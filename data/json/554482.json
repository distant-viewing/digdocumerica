{"path":"554482.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In the photograph, a vibrant and social outdoor scene is captured at a roadside establishment under a clear sky. The location, defined by the signage as \"Northern Lights,\" appears to be a food and drink place that advertises fried chicken baskets, bagels, baked goods, and \"LA beer.\"\n\nKey elements in the frame include a diverse mix of classic vehicles and people, suggesting a casual gathering or stop-off point. Prominently, there is a bright red convertible with a group of people around it, engaging in conversation. Two individuals are seated on the trunk of the car facing the camera, while three others stand by the side, facing each other. Clothing styles reflect casual, everyday wear, with jeans and t-shirts predominating.\n\nTo the left, several motorcycles, possibly custom or Harley-Davidson types, are parked. Each bike features a unique design and chrome detailing, indicating the personal styles of their owners. At least one person is seated on a motorcycle, contributing to the relaxed, communal atmosphere.\n\nForeground elements include a partial view of a green car on the far left and the spacious parking area that accommodates both cars and motorcycles. The background is composed mostly of lush green trees, indicating either a suburban or rural setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combined with the vehicles, attire, and social interaction, evokes a sense of Americana, possibly from the late 20th century. The scene is relaxed and informal, with a focus on social interaction and leisure, capturing a moment in the everyday lives of the people pictured.","title":"Motorcyclists traveling through Adirondack Forest Preserve near Inlet, New York, on Route #28","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556538","557684","546183","554481","554871","547495","547789","543471","543856","554873","549113","547855","551084","546993","554709","554874"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["motorcycle","owner","predominate","car","beer","accommodate","bike","basket","people","seat"]}
