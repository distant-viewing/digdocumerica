{"path":"543073.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic coastal environment where the primary focus is a surfer walking along a wet sandy beach. The surfer, holding a surfboard under their arm, is captured in a moment of transit across the shallow edge of the incoming tide. They are dressed in a full wetsuit, suggesting the water might be cool.\n\nThe background is dominated by large, dark volcanic rocks, partially submerged by waves. These rocks introduce a rough texture contrasted against the foamy, white waves and the smoother surface of the wet sand. The ocean water is creeping up in thin, serpentine lines around the rocks, indicating a gentle tide.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, as the light casts soft shadows and enriches the colors with a warm hue. The overall palette of the scene is natural and earthy, dominated by the blue of the ocean, the black and gray of the rocks, and the dark wet sand.\n\nThis setting conveys a sense of solitude and the peaceful interplay between the natural elements and the lone figure of the surfer, highlighting both the vastness of the natural landscape and the individual's connection to the ocean.","title":"Frogman emerges from surf","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["546953","545086","543287","543055","543293","545095","543255","542890","547607","543078","543237","557424","545195","555400","543019","543493"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["tide","rock","sand","ocean","wave","surfboard","wetsuit","income","thing","foamy"]}
