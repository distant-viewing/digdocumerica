{"path":"542654.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a rural farming scene set during the day under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is dry, cracked soil leading up to rows of lush green grapevine fields, suggesting the location might be a vineyard. In the midst of the fields, a person is seen operating a small tractor or a similar farm vehicle. The tractor is emitting a significant amount of mist or spray, possibly water, pesticides, or herbicides, which is being dispersed over the grapevines.\n\nThe person driving the tractor is positioned in the mid-ground, slightly off-center to the left, indicating movement from left to right through the vineyard. They are focused on their task, looking straight ahead, coordinating the vehicle's movement through the plants.\n\nIn the background, the vineyard continues with lush greenery, and a line of trees can be seen far in the distance, which demarcates the property line or provides a windbreak for the vineyard. The atmosphere is quiet except for the activity of the tractor, emphasizing a typical day of work in the fields. The overall composition and the early morning or late afternoon light suggests a hardworking ambiance in a calm, rural setting.","title":"Spraying grapevines at dawn","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542534","544888","557521","553665","547436","552577","554204","547297","548950","555878","544323","545893","544319","555879","543667","547301"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["tractor","field","pesticide","movement","midst","person","farming","property","amount","line"]}
