{"path":"556448.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a serene residential street, likely taken during spring given the blossoming trees. The foreground is dominated by branches of a tree with large pink flowers, possibly a magnolia, which partially frames the view and adds a vibrant splash of natural color.\n\nBeyond the floral foreground, the middle ground shows a peaceful street lined with houses. The houses appear to be vintage, characterized by weathered wood sidings and dark shingles. Each house has a front porch, hinting at a friendly, community-oriented neighborhood. The architecture is charming and typical of early-20th-century American suburbia.\n\nThe houses are separated from the street by small, tidy lawns and low fences, enhancing the quaint and orderly appearance of the neighborhood. A hedge runs along the length of the fence on the near side, adding greenery and privacy.\n\nThe street itself is quiet, without visible cars or people, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. The pavement shows signs of wear and patches, suggesting an older community. The lighting is bright and suggests a sunny day, casting soft shadows and enriching the colors of the houses and vegetation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural framing, focus on floral beauty, and depiction of quiet residential life, conveys a sense of peaceful suburban living. The aesthetic and ambiance suggest a nostalgic appreciation for simpler, slower-paced times.","title":"View of the main highway through Holden, West Virginia near Logan, showing homes of mining supervisors framed by pink dogwood. The town has sidewalks, a feature not evident in many of the mining communities. These two-story houses with four rooms on each floor contrast with the typical miner home of one story and four rooms next to the railroad tracks. The separation between the two types was symbolic of a caste system that is becoming a thing of the past.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556435","556950","556601","546441","546430","549279","556433","547388","550121","550035","545372","556426","558039","547433","550125","551102"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","street","neighborhood","fence","hedge","privacy","appreciation","blossom","pace","community"]}
