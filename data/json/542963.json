{"path":"542963.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene featuring a group of deer in a grassy clearing. The foreground shows several deer standing and grazing behind a rustic wooden fence, which creates a boundary between the viewer and the animals. The background is dense with tall coniferous trees standing against the skyline, giving an impression of depth and wilderness. The lighting is soft and appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the deer and elements of the landscape. The atmosphere conveyed is peaceful and quietly vibrant, typical of a forested area in a natural park or similar reserve. The composition uses the fence as a leading line that draws the eye into the scene, while the distribution of the deer across the plane provides balance and a focal point in the image.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["546232","544114","542955","546088","546198","544914","545902","553808","558368","542959","542961","543369","545898","543279","549219","543326"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","fence","reserve","distribution","plane","graze","clearing","boundary","forested","wilderness"]}
