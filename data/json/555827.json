{"path":"555827.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a group of workers busy at a maritime task, possibly involved in environmental or maritime research operations. The scene takes place on the deck of a ship with a clear view of the sea beside it.\n\nThe majority of the workers are wearing brightly colored safety helmets—red and one in white—along with heavy-duty protective clothing including orange life vests, indicating safety protocols normally observed in marine and environmental operations. Their outfits suggest that the tasks they are handling could be hazardous. The workers are engaged in manipulating long poles which extend over the side of the ship, possibly to collect samples from the water or to deploy equipment into the sea.\n\nThe deck is partially visible, decked with various maritime and scientific equipment, suggesting the specific function of this vessel could be for environmental monitoring or similar research activities that involve water sampling. On the left part of the image, two workers are more focused on some equipment directly on the deck, which contributes to the overall occupation.\n\nThe ocean next to the ship shows moderate activity of water, hinting at reasonable weather conditions for maritime operations. The perspective and composition of the image provide a dynamic view of the ongoing activities, showcasing both the efforts of the individuals and the broader context of their work environment.","title":"National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ship \"Ferrel\" with crew checking current meters in the New York Bight.
