{"path":"555877.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of manual labor in an outdoor, muddy environment. It features two individuals, though the primary focus is on the man in the foreground. This man, who is kneeling in the mud, is engaged in the process of manipulating a large, cylindrical pipe submerged in water and mud. He wears a dark gray uniform labeled with the word \"COASTAL\" and a matching cap. His facial expression suggests concentration or exertion as he grips the pipe.\n\nIn the background, another man is partially visible. He appears to be an observer or perhaps a supervisor. He is dressed in a lighter colored shirt and dark pants, standing upright with his arms crossed, suggesting an evaluative posture.\n\nThe setting seems somewhat barren and desolate, likely a work site, evidenced by the lack of vegetation and the extensive mud and standing water. The overall ambience is that of a work-intensive environment requiring physical labor, set against a landscape that appears challenging and somewhat inhospitable due to the mud and apparent isolation.","title":"Some of the liquid which had been treated and spread at the disposal site is shown where it filtered to the lowest portion of the field.  It was collected and returned to another part of the disposal area.  Epa personnel supervised cleanup of the contaminated pond treatment and disposal.  The pond posed a possible hazard to Great Salt Lake and a nearby wildlife refuge","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["545667","555562","555876","556903","555561","555563","547949","547498","556447","556866","548761","544755","554856","546023","550251","545663"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["mud","pipe","labor","exertion","observer","grip","manipulate","kneel","ambience","require"]}
