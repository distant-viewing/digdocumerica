{"path":"542787.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of a man in the act of chopping down a large tree in a wooded area. The man, appearing focused and exerting effort, is using a chainsaw to cut into the trunk of the tree. He is dressed in work attire, which includes a long-sleeve shirt, pants, gloves, and a hard hat, suggesting safety measures are in place for the task.\n\nThe tree itself is massive, with rough, thick bark, emphasizing the challenging nature of the task. Wood chips and sawdust are flying off the trunk as the chainsaw digs into the wood, creating a dynamic and active scene.\n\nThe background is a dense forest with various trees and underbrush, indicating that the setting is likely a forested or woodland area. Light and shadows play through the trees, adding depth to the setting and focusing attention on the man and his activity.\n\nThere are also some felled tree limbs and debris around the base of the tree, which add to the impression of ongoing woodcutting or forestry work. The overall scene communicates a rugged outdoor work environment with a focus on forestry and tree management.","title":"\"faller\" d.Jackson dropping red fir tree","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542786","553604","553602","553608","542788","542785","542769","542771","554414","542773","554415","553614","542770","555472","553601","553643"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["chainsaw","forestry","tree","trunk","work","task","limb","chip","measure","glove"]}
