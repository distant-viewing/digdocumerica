{"path":"548801.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, outdoor setup featuring two Volkswagen buses. The focus is on a red and white bus parked on a beach-like terrain. The red bus appears to be a vintage model, likely from the 1960s or 1970s, equipped with a pop-up camper roof that is extended upwards, indicating that the bus is set up for camping. The front of the bus faces the camera, showing its distinctive V-shaped front with the classic Volkswagen logo. It features a clean and polished exterior with shiny chrome details like bumpers and hubcaps.\n\nBehind the red bus, there is another similarly styled Volkswagen bus, painted in a pale green or beige color. This second bus is further in the background, and its side is visible to the viewer. Both buses are parked on a rough, grassy surface with patches of sand, suggestive of a low-traffic beach or coastal area.\n\nThe background of the image shows a calm sea extending towards the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds that appear dynamic and add a sense of depth to the image. The overall setting is tranquil and leisurely, typical of a beach outing or a campsite by the sea. The picture evokes a sense of adventure and nostalgia, typical for travel and exploration themes associated with such vintage campervans.","title":"Beach at little duck key.
