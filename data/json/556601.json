{"path":"556601.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential street lined with suburban single-family homes. The composition showcases a series of houses on the right arranged in a descending manner, where the street slopes downhill slightly. Each house features a similar architecture with peaked, shingled roofs, chimneys, and a mix of front porches and front yards. The houses differ in colors such as pale yellow, white, and light brown, with some homes adorned with latticed porch designs and others with more solid rails.\n\nThe street is relatively narrow, appearing to be a quiet, less trafficked road with no visible automobiles. The sides of the street are bordered by neatly trimmed bushes creating a uniform and groomed appearance. The vegetation is lush, with a range of deciduous trees visible, some of which are beginning to show early autumn colors in shades of green and red.\n\nIn the background, heavily wooded hills rise steeply, covered with dense greenery, suggesting that this neighborhood is situated in a valley or a similar geographical feature offering a verdant, mountainous horizon. The gray overcast sky suggests it might be a cloudy day, muting the overall color palette of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a tranquil suburban environment, possibly from mid-to-late 20th century America, characterized by its orderly home fronts and serene natural surroundings.","title":"Homes on a street in lynch, Kentucky, near Cumberland which once was the largest coal company town in the world.
