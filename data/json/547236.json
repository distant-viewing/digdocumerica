{"path":"547236.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures an active construction site bustling with activity and machinery. In the foreground is a piece of heavy construction equipment, part of which prominently features a \"THINK SAFETY FIRST THANK YOU\" sign, emphasizing the site's commitment to safety. The equipment is industrial yellow, suggesting it might be a crane or heavy-duty vehicle, but only part of this machinery is in view, showing some mechanical details and gears.\n\nToward the middle ground, there are several workers who appear to be engaging in a discussion or planning. The workers are clad in typical construction attire, including hard hats and high visibility vests or jackets. This group is standing by more machinery, including what seems to be a large mounted concrete or cement mixer truck, characterized by its rounded, barrel-shaped mixing drum.\n\nIn the background, more construction equipment and activity are visible, though the details are less distinct due to the depth of field. Some construction barriers can also be seen, indicating the enclosed and active nature of the site. The environment is dusty and open, typical of a large urban construction project. The entire setting conveys a sense of organized chaos typical of major construction sites, with attention clearly directed toward the ongoing work and worker safety.","title":"Metro subway construction on G St., N.W., between 13th and 14th streets","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["553394","550274","547240","553886","547235","553382","551966","553381","553378","547989","546252","548431","557479","553383","544167","557742"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","worker","machinery","equipment","safety","cement","drum","chaos","barrel"]}
