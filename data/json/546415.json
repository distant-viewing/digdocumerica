{"path":"546415.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a modern architectural structure under a clear sky with few clouds. The building in the foreground presents a minimalistic design, characterized by sleek lines and solid planes. The left side of the building reveals a high, flat wall with the top portion showcasing a row of rectangular windows, allowing natural light inside while preserving the simplicity of the design. The right side of the building employs a different structural form: it consists of a white cylindrical section linked to a glass-fronted tower that exposes a staircase within. The visible section of this glass facade suggests an emphasis on transparency and natural lighting which contrasts with the mostly opaque surfaces of the rest of the building.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph imposes a sense of modernity and functionality, focusing on huge, uncomplicated shapes and a clean aesthetic, suggestive of a contemporary public or commercial building. The blue sky above adds a fresh, airy feel to the scene, complementing the stark whiteness of the building. There are no people or activities visible in the image; the focus remains purely on the architectural elements and their placement within the frame.","title":"Construction of Fodrea Community School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["555318","546531","546481","546506","546518","546543","546464","548648","546473","546456","546539","555329","545885","546484","546448","544565"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["building","modernity","section","glass","plane","staircase","placement","functionality","design","rest"]}
