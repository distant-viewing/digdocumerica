{"path":"556661.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a crowded scene on a subway train, likely taken during peak travel hours. The photograph showcases a diverse group of passengers, many of whom are standing, tightly packed, and holding onto overhead hand grips. These grips are distinctive curvy shapes, designed to accommodate multiple people. The center and upper part of the image features these silver grips hanging from the ceiling, and they dominate the view, creating a visual pattern.\n\nThe passengers, a mix of men and women, appear engrossed in various activities. Some are reading newspapers, evident from visible headlines such as \"New York Daily News.\" Others seem to be looking at books or simply gazing around. The atmosphere suggests a typical busy day with everyone immersed in their personal spaces despite the close proximity to each other.\n\nThe background elements include advertisements lining the upper part of the subway walls, contributing to the typical urban transit environment. The lighting in the subway casts a rather warm glow, softening the otherwise metallic and harsh surroundings typical of a subway car. \n\nOverall, the composition of the image, along with its elements and subjects, vividly portrays urban commuting: the intimacy of shared public space, individual absorption in personal activities, and the underlying communal experience of city life.","title":"Hanging straps steady standing passengers on the Lexington Avenue line of the New York City Transit Authority subway. The system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world. There was a decrease in daily ridership from 2.2 million to 2.1 million between 1960 and 1970. Although the system is crucial to the city, voters have refused to vote any more funds for improvement, or to allow the fare to be increased above the present 35 cents to cover Transit Authority costs.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556817","554328","556691","556665","556669","554326","554327","556780","554370","556653","556698","556813","556818","548256","551895","551883"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["subway","grip","passenger","headline","commuting","intimacy","silver","newspaper","transit","space"]}
