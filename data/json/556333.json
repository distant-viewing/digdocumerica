{"path":"556333.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image captures a moody and detailed scene of a residential area nestled within a hilly landscape. The photograph appears to have been taken from an elevated vantage point looking down onto a curved street lined with rows of similar-looking two-story houses, typical of an older, possibly industrial, community.\n\nThe houses are modest, each with a pitched roof and a small front porch. They are separated by narrow yards, and the architecture suggests a mid-20th-century or earlier time period. The overall color palette is quite muted, featuring dark greens, browns, and grays, alluding to either an overcast day or the onset of dusk.\n\nA single road winds through the center of the frame, curving past the houses and disappearing into the trees in the background. The road is bordered by utility poles and wires, emphasizing a connection to rural or semi-rural locales. An old sedan car is visible parked beside one of the houses, and another blurred vehicle is on the road, adding a sense of everyday life happening in this secluded spot.\n\nIn the foreground at the bottom, there's also a part of a structure with a flat roof, possibly a commercial or industrial building, though it's not fully in the scene, which gives a clue to a mixed-use area.\n\nThe background is mountainous, filled with barren trees that suggest the photograph was taken either during late fall or early spring. There are no leaves, and the overall atmosphere is slightly bleak yet peaceful. High above on the hill, isolated among the trees, sits a solitary large building that might be a community center or institutional building, further suggesting a self-contained small community.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of quiet solitude and a glimpse into life in a small, possibly Appalachian or similar region town, where the landscape and architecture have shaped the community living there.","title":"Old coal company town of Red Ash, Virginia, near Richlands in the southwestern part of the state, showing the valley and general terrain.
