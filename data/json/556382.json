{"path":"556382.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph presents a vivid industrial landscape, predominantly featuring railroads and freight elements, set against a backdrop of a steep and barren hillside. In the image foreground, two parallel railroad tracks run horizontally across the frame, supporting numerous parked and in-motion trains carrying various types of cargo, including freight containers and tank cars.\n\nTo the bottom left, there is an industrial site comprised of small buildings with gabled roofs, likely serving as workshops or storage facilities. These structures are shaded in muted colors such as green and gray, blending subtly with the industrial surrounds. The area is equipped with multiple vehicles, including trucks, seen parked or navigating around the site.\n\nAbove this scene, the trains emit visible white steam or smoke, contributing to a sense of brisk activity on what appears to be a damp or chilly day, indicated by the gray overcast sky above and dampened surfaces visible in the setting. The background hillside shows sparse vegetation and appears rugged and weathered, suggesting a remote or less cultivated region, perhaps indicative of a mining or industrial area.\n\nMoreover, an atmosphere of industrious energy is palpable, with the scores of freight cars and industrial equipment set against a stark and somewhat stark natural environment. The scene likely captures aspects of mid-20th-century industrial operations in a region focused on heavy industry and rail transport.","title":"Coke furnaces at Keen Mountain, near Richlands, Virginia made from coal, the coke will be sent for use in the furnaces at steel mills.
