{"path":"549675.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a subway station platform at night. The lighting is subdued, mainly coming from overhead lights along the platform, which spreads a dim, greenish hue throughout the scene. On the left side of the image, a person sits alone on a bench, holding a bag and looking down, possibly waiting for a train. This individual appears to be a young woman dressed in casual attire.\n\nIn the middle of the platform, there is a large informational billboard with writings and maps, understandable as station guides or advertisements. The text indicates the station name \"Schmidt-Platz\". To the right, continuing along the platform, another individual stands alone near additional billboards that display various posters and signs.\n\nOn the far right, the subway train is in motion, captured as a blur indicating its speed as it enters the station. The train's front features visible lights illuminating parts of the track ahead. The platform itself is clean and well-maintained, with a simple design featuring a flat ceiling and a straightforward, uncluttered layout. The atmosphere of the photograph conveys a quiet, somewhat isolating experience of public transportation at night.","title":"Trolley line beneath the plaza of the town hall","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551889","556662","551894","556660","556650","556667","549650","551895","548274","556663","556821","556649","556651","551883","548259","556051"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","station","train","subway","billboard","night","writing","map","poster","enter"]}
