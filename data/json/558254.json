{"path":"558254.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Bisping, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a parking area filled with various vehicles, primarily from the 1960s or 70s. The vehicles include a mix of station wagons, pickup trucks, and what appear to be camper attachments on some of the trucks. Notable is a vehicle on the right with a spacious rear-section, possibly a large station wagon or an early style of SUV, featuring a spare tire mounted on the back.\n\nThe setting appears to be an organized parking lot, hinted by the alignment of the vehicles which are neatly parked in rows. The background is difficult to ascertain in detail due to the focus on the cars, but it gives the impression of an open, possibly public, parking space with hints of more vehicles and possibly some structures in the far background, likely indicating an urban or suburban setting. The overall feel is a snapshot of an everyday scene, catching a glimpse of automotive styles and recreational vehicle use during this era.","title":"Street scene showing parked vehicles in the fall at New Ulm Minnesota.

It was founded in 1854 by a german immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from europe.  Population stabilized at 8 to 9,000 between 1900 and 1945, then grew slowly as manufacturing firms arrived.  In the 1960's the business district was run down, but was revitalized with community support","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["554349","556736","546813","556773","546879","547954","546731","556790","554617","547826","556204","546599","547480","556721","556201","557016"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["vehicle","parking","wagon","station","attachment","truck","camper","alignment","70","pickup"]}
