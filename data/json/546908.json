{"path":"546908.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph shows an expansive industrial site dominated by numerous factory buildings and chimneys, all emitting large volumes of smoke into the air. The scene is captured from a slightly distant viewpoint, likely from across a body of water given a water body visible at the bottom edge of the frame. The sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the photograph, depicting a partially overcast day with soft, diffused light, enhancing the murky quality added by the smoke. The smoke varies in color from white to darker gray, blending into the cloudy sky backdrop.\n\nThe industrial complex features several tall, thin smokestacks of varying heights, actively releasing plumes of smoke. At the heart of the scene, there are metal structures and buildings which are parts of the factory, including some that appear slightly rusted or aged, indicating either long-term use or lack of recent maintenance.\n\nThis industrial scene portrays a moment in an active, functioning factory likely focused on heavy manufacturing or processing, evident from its robust and somewhat grimy appearance. The overall atmosphere evoked is one of heavy industrial activity with significant environmental impact, suggested by the substantial smoke emissions. The composition and color tones of the photograph highlight themes of industry and possibly pollution.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550868","550716","546808","550328","545236","548376","550869","543005","546884","550329","545447","543011","557225","550344","547696","550981"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","factory","heart","volume","third","term","highlight","emission","viewpoint","manufacturing"]}
