{"path":"547704.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to show a group of fish submerged in water, likely captured from above the surface of the water. The fish are dead and seem to be in a state of decay. The water is dark and murky, with lots of debris and particulate matter floating around, contributing to an overall gloomy and unsettling appearance. The fish vary in size and are scattered across the frame, their bodies looking somewhat ragged, which indicates they could have been dead for some time or experienced some volatile physical conditions. The image captures a sense of desolation and might indicate environmental distress or the aftermath of a fishing-related activity.","title":"Dead alewives float along the tideline just north of the chesapeake bay bridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["555560","546846","546930","546784","546779","550878","546782","552067","547687","546898","546792","542985","545063","546185","545161","547737"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","distress","matter","aftermath","desolation","experience","lot","submerge","float","fishing"]}
