{"path":"558394.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The image features a young boy with striking blue eyes and blonde hair styled in a short cut. He appears to be around four or five years old, dressed in a knitted olive green sweater over a white shirt. He has a solemn, slightly curious expression on his face as he looks directly at the camera. The childâ€™s hands are clasped together, and he seems to be sitting, although only his upper body is visible in the frame.\n\nThe background is blurred and out of focus, depicting warm, golden hues that suggest indoor lighting, possibly in a spacious area like a church hall or a large room due to the architectural details that can be barely made out. Soft bokeh lights indicate the existence of some light sources or reflections in the background, contributing to the photograph's overall warm tone.\n\nThe composition centers predominantly on the child, capturing a moment that feels both candid and intimate. The lighting on the boy's face highlights his features and expression, adding depth to his contemplative gaze.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The largest group of churchgoers are Roman Catholics. A youngster of the New Ulm Cathedral parish is shown attending a folk guitar mass. This weekly event was begun for the younger people and has become the most popular mass with standing room only. The church interior is decorated with baroque carvings reminiscent of churches in southern Germany's Bavarian.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556606","543870","553170","556138","556140","543476","553494","549299","553168","553147","556146","544222","543744","552942","556144","543688"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","existence","clasp","child","hall","expression","year","strike","church","face"]}
