{"path":"546088.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a group of white-tailed deer grazing in a natural setting. The image shows seven deer positioned in the foreground of a dirt clearing, surrounded by dense flora which includes tall trees and an undergrowth densely populated with yellow flowering plants. These plants are lively in color and contrast with the earthy browns of the ground.\n\nThe deer are variously engaged in grazing or looking towards the camera, each presenting a calm demeanor. The animals' slender forms and long legs are evident, and their soft brown fur matches the natural surroundings, suggesting they are well-adapted to their environment.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dark, leafy forest area that provides a rich green contrast to the bright yellow of the flowering plants and the light brown of the dried grass and soil in the deerâ€™s immediate environment. The scene is set during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as the lighting is soft and not overly harsh, lending a tranquil quality to the setting.","title":"Wild deer at feeding spot","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["546198","546232","542963","544114","544916","545902","546163","542955","544914","552339","542961","554621","543279","544571","543369","543326"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["deer","plant","grazing","brown","fur","undergrowth","flora","clearing","demeanor","yellow"]}
