{"path":"546537.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a casual, everyday scene featuring a young person walking on a paved area while playing with a ball. The person, who appears to be a child based on their height and playful activity, is dressed in a multi-striped pair of pants and a jacket with perhaps fur lining on the hood. Their stride suggests movement, possibly chasing or kicking the ball forward.\n\nIn the background, there is a modern architectural structure featuring several pointed roofs, characteristic of contemporary building styles. The building is made primarily out of brick with dark trim and large windows, indicating a possibly institutional or educational use. There is a well-maintained lawn around the building, and small trees and shrubs line the edge of the paving where the child is playing.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives a feeling of a tranquil, sunny day with leisure activities taking place in a well-kept urban or semi-urban environment. The shot is composed with the child off-center, moving into the vast open space on the left, which may draw the viewer's eyes across the scene, emphasizing both the action and the surrounding architecture.","title":"W.
