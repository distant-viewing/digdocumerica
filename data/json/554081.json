{"path":"554081.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic coastal landscape. The foreground is softly blurred and features clusters of bright red flowers, possibly from a type of shrub or small tree. The focus of the photograph shifts to the middle and background where a vibrant blue sea dominates the view. The sea's surface is textured, suggesting gentle waves or ripples.\n\nTowards the middle of the composition, a stretch of lush coastline is visible. This appears to be a tropical area given the dense green vegetation and the style of the visible structures, which resemble small, modest houses or cabins nestled among the trees. The coast curves gently inward, forming a small bay or cove, with a few tiny islets or rock formations protruding from the water close to the shore.\n\nIn the far background, the coastline extends into the distance, gradually fading into a hazy blue horizon under a partially cloudy sky. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and picturesque, highlighting a harmonious blend of natural beauty and modest human habitation.","title":"Honomanu Bay lies in a conservation district of the island.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554082","542968","547592","543066","553805","543184","543401","542917","543346","543299","557523","557429","543196","543399","543404","545129"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coastline","cove","islet","middle","sea","shift","coast","stretch","bay","habitation"]}
