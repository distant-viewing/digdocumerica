{"path":"552574.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a person engaged in an agricultural activity, presumably during the late afternoon or early evening given the warm, low sunlight bathing the scene. The individual, dressed in a vibrant red-orange jacket and a white wide-brimmed hat, is intensely focused on shoveling or digging into the ground. They wield a long-handled, curved tool, which is likely used for clearing or tilling the soil.\n\nThe setting is outdoors in a cultivated field, enclosed by a simple wire fence supported by wooden posts. In the background, a hill covered with dark vegetation rises, contrasting with the clearer sky above. The lighting highlights the motion and energy of the person's task, casting dynamic shadows and enhancing the contours of their clothing and face, though their face is partially obscured by the angle and their own hat.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the rugged and labor-intensive nature of the work, within a relatively serene environment framed by natural elements and softened by the fading light.","title":"Three generations of oldlands have ranched on piceance creek.
