{"path":"547347.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural scene at sunset. The sky, filled with shades of orange and red, serves as the vibrant background. Sunlight diffuses across the horizon, casting a warm glow. In silhouette against this vivid sky, a classic windmill stands prominently on the right. It is an old-fashioned, metal structure typical of rural landscapes. To the left of the windmill, there is a dark, silhouette outline of a simple, rectangular barn-like building, featuring sharp angles and a sloping roof. Additional tree silhouettes flank the structures, contributing to the rustic setting. The composition evokes a peaceful and serene end to the day in a rural setting, emphasizing the beauty of the natural environment and traditional technology used in agriculture.","title":"Seward County farm and windmill at sunset","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547345","547283","545848","547293","547289","545852","545856","552462","557119","549210","549216","549212","547309","549211","545832","558140"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","silhouette","agriculture","barn","technology","diffuse","end","orange","sunset","flank"]}
