{"path":"550448.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a Dall sheep standing in a natural, outdoor setting. The sheep appears prominently in the center of the image with its body facing to the right while its head is turned to gaze directly at the camera, offering a frontal view of its face. The sheep's wool is predominantly white and looks thick and textured, covering its body and legs. It has blood on one of its right rear legs, suggesting recent physical activity, possibly from running through rough terrain or a minor wound.\n\nThe sheep's curved horns, which are typical features for its species, are visible and not fully grown, suggesting it may be relatively young. The animal's expression is alert and its eyes are wide open, lending a sense of immediate engagement with the viewer or its environment.\n\nThe background shows a kind of open, yet rugged terrain composed predominantly of red and brown hues, indicative of either a mountainous or a moorland area which corresponds to the typical habitat for this species. The overall lighting in the image seems natural, possibly taken during an overcast day given the soft shadows and muted light contrasts, enhancing the serene and somewhat wild atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Bolder than its companions, this mountain sheep decided to investigate photographer Dennis Cowals.
