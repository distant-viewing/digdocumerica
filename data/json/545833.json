{"path":"545833.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of an industrial facility, likely a power plant, situated near a large body of water. The image is taken from an aerial perspective, providing a comprehensive overview of the layout and surrounding environment.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, the main elements of the industrial facility include several large, dark-colored structures with multiple levels, equipped with numerous pipes and smokestacks. These structures are rectangular and densely packed, suggesting heavy machinery and complex operations typical of energy production or processing plants.\n\nAdjacent to these structures are smaller, rectangular buildings assumed to be administrative or support facilities. The presence of a power substation, characterized by its electrical insulators and transformers, is evident, indicating high voltage operations typical of such facilities.\n\nTwo massive, circular storage tanks dominate the scene closer to the water's edge. These tanks are typical for storing liquids such as oil or chemicals, necessary for the plant's operations. A network of roads and pathways connects the various components of the plant, and landscaped areas with grass are visible, slightly enhancing the industrial aesthetic.\n\nThe background features a vast expanse of water that extends to the horizon, intersected by partially visible landforms or islands. This positioning suggests that the facility might utilize water for cooling processes or as a discharge point for treated effluents, following environmental regulations.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a well-maintained industrial facility, likely involved in energy production, showcasing the integration of heavy industry with the natural environment at a large scale.","title":"Houston Lighting and Power Company on Galveston Bay","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["551994","545841","544494","551998","550856","550339","544495","555775","543872","544573","557392","545837","550331","546103","549507","546395"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["facility","plant","production","energy","operation","power","discharge","tank","voltage","regulation"]}
