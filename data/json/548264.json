{"path":"548264.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene featuring a man driving a red vintage GMC truck, labeled as belonging to York Trans. Co., Inc. The truck is detailed with the number \"626001\" and additional text indicating that it is a \"5500 V-Six\" model. The driver, a middle-aged man, appears focused on the road ahead and is dressed in a dark-colored jacket. His elbow is resting on the door of the truck, adding to a casual, candid atmosphere of the image.\n\nThe setting is urban, with hints of a busy street scene visible in the blurred background. Indistinct images of people and possibly other vehicles suggest the hustle and bustle typical of a city environment. The narrow depth of field focuses attention on the driver and his truck, with the truck's sharp red juxtaposed against the softer tones and movement of the background. The angle of the photograph provides a side view into the driver's cab, capturing a moment that seems both ordinary and uniquely personal.","title":"Truck caught in herald square traffic","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548275","546092","557044","546176","548272","544329","542803","549869","549866","547666","544349","542606","549883","556714","542782","547093"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","driver","elbow","cab","belong","hustle","drive","model","number","text"]}
