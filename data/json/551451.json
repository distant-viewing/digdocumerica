{"path":"551451.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a casual, sunny day outdoors, set around a large circular fountain. The main subjects in the image are two individuals sitting on the ground. To the left, there is a young woman with her back to us, watching the scene; she has long red hair and wears a white tank top and denim shorts. To the right, another individual, possibly a young man, sits facing toward the left with only the right side of his face visible; he has short, dark hair and is dressed in a black t-shirt and denim shorts. \n\nBetween these two, a cyclist is seen in motion, approaching a parked bicycle next to the sitting figures. The bicycle appears to be an older model with a prominent frame and thin wheels, suggesting a city or commuter bike.\n\nIn the background, the fountain sprays water vigorously. The scenic background hints at a public park ambiance with trees and other park-goers faintly visible in the distance.\n\nThe composition uses natural sunlight, which brightens the setting and creates a pleasant, relaxed mood. The focus and depth of field suggest a candid, everyday moment captured, emphasizing a sense of uninterrupted life and urban leisure.","title":"Oasis in the city--block square park at East 5th and Market streets","placename":"Saint Paul (Minn.)","location":"Saint Paul, Minnesota","nn1":["553207","551453","551545","551793","551449","551480","553185","551640","550748","551858","551017","551772","555947","551468","553166","549982"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","bicycle","denim","short","goer","cyclist","park","commuter","bike","hair"]}
