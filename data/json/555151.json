{"path":"555151.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and natural woodland scene, predominated by large, fallen trees intersecting in the foreground. The trees are covered with moss and show signs of aging, with rough, weathered bark and scattered branches. These trunks lie across each other, creating a tangle that suggests recent storm damage or natural decay.\n\nThe background is less focused but depicts a dense forest setting with more standing trees which also exhibit moss growth, indicating a moist, possibly temperate climate. The sky is overcast, casting an even, soft light across the scene, which enhances the lush green hues of the moss and the subdued browns of the tree trunks.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the immediate chaos of fallen trees, the landscape appears to slope upward, possibly into hills or mountains barely visible due to mist or low clouds. This adds a sense of depth and wildness to the image, emphasizing the untamed and possibly secluded nature of the area. \n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its interlocking fallen trees in the foreground leading into a murky, forested background, creates a narrative of natural events shaping a forest environment, untouched and evolving away from human influence.","title":"Blow down area caused by increased wind velocity blowing through the valley after the Wynoochee Dam created a reservoir in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
