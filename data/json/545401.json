{"path":"545401.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph features an outdoor setting with a young man standing in the foreground. He is dressed casually in a light-colored, patterned button-up shirt with rolled-up sleeves, and blue denim overalls. With an attentive expression, the man looks directly at the camera, standing slightly off-center to the left side of the frame.\n\nThe background shows a stark contrast between residential and industrial environments. Behind the man, thereâ€™s a row of modest, single-story wooden houses with peaked roofs and porches, typical of early to mid-20th century American architecture. These houses are painted in dark colors and are closely spaced along a dirt road that curves gently through the scene.\n\nFurther back, dominating the right side of the photograph, is an industrial setting marked by multiple large structures with tall, vertical pipes and staircase-like frameworks, indicative of a factory or a plant, likely a steel mill or similar heavy industry facility. This industrial complex emits a sense of robust, busy activity despite no visible smoke or steam.\n\nThe contrast between the residential area and the industrial backdrop, along with the lone figure in casual attire, suggests themes of community, industry, and possibly the socio-economic conditions surrounding the area. The clear sky and bright lighting enhance the details and amplify the stark differences in this mixed landscape.","title":"Housing adjacent to U.S. Steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545405","547277","548299","556541","543648","556391","553025","542548","545219","545520","545390","544105","545087","545423","545388","547325"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["industry","difference","amplify","overall","house","staircase","mill","button","denim","man"]}
