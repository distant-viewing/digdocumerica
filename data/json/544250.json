{"path":"544250.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a man standing in a rural farmland field. The man appears to be in middle age, wearing a dark navy shirt with rolled-up sleeves, light brown trousers, and a brown hat which he holds onto with his left hand atop his head. His expression conveys a look of contemplation or fatigue, possibly from labor. \n\nThe man stands beside young crop plants â€” the leaves narrow and tall, suggesting they could be a type of grain or grass. To his immediate right rests an agricultural sprayer, branded \"CHAPIN\", indicating he might be in the process of applying treatments to the crops.\n\nThe background reveals an open sky with some clouds and a blurred hint of trees and a small building in the far distance, suggesting a secluded farm setting. The ground is visible as partly grassy and partly tilled earth with sparse vegetation, highlighting an agricultural activity scene.\n\nThis image captures an essence of rural farming life, possibly focusing on the care and management of crop fields by an individual farmer navigating the daily challenges of agriculture.","title":"Farmer and pesticide spray cam","placename":"Plaquemines Parish (La.)","location":"Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana","nn1":["554203","544246","547734","549259","549036","547416","557696","548876","544371","549051","555619","545087","548874","547409","558106","546262"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crop","farmer","farmland","grain","treatment","field","care","challenge","agriculture","farming"]}
