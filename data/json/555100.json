{"path":"555100.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The image presents a close-up of a young conifer tree in a natural setting. The tree's branches are covered with numerous fresh buds and vibrant, new green growth emerging at the tips. Each bud is surrounded by a distinct whorl of long, narrow, needle-like leaves that are typical of coniferous trees like pine or spruce. The needles have a glossy appearance and are densely packed along the branches, giving the tree a lush, full appearance.\n\nThe growth at the top of the main vertical stem seems to be particularly vigorous, suggesting that the tree is actively growing and healthy. The background is dark, creating a contrast that highlights the rich green color of the tree and its buds. There aren't any specific background details that are clear, suggesting that the focus of the photograph is entirely on capturing the detailed texture and natural beauty of the tree itself.","title":"Closeup of new spring growth on a Sitka spruce tree in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555004","555003","555099","557542","554988","557592","543624","542573","555053","557602","542574","555007","554589","555183","555096","543622"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["bud","needle","tree","growth","branch","tip","stem","appearance","pine","close"]}
