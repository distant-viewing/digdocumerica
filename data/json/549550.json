{"path":"549550.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a natural scene featuring a dynamic and turbulent river. At the forefront, the river runs vigorously over rocks, creating white, frothy water that emphasizes the river's powerful current. Several large, dark rocks are visible in the lower portion of the frame, partially covered by the rushing water. The background is dominated by a group of trees with dense, lush green foliage, suggesting this scene is set in a forested area during a time when the trees are fully leafed out, likely spring or summer.\n\nThe trees are situated on what appears to be an island or riverbank, discernible due to their position in the middle ground and their partial envelopment by the river's course. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, even light over the entire scene, which enhances the vibrant green of the trees against the grey-blue of the rushing water. The overall mood of the photograph is one of raw, natural beauty and the unbridled force of a river in motion.","title":"Niagara River rapids above the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553855","550658","550742","553416","544856","542743","549542","550698","553653","544871","548156","549442","554407","550367","550655","552692"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","course","rock","current","tree","island","force","grey","position","riverbank"]}
