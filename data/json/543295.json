{"path":"543295.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal scene, where sharp, jagged rocks dominate the landscape. The viewpoint is from an elevated position looking down towards the ocean, which allows for a dramatic perspective of both the rocks and the water.\n\nThe rocks are angular and have a dark, weather-beaten appearance, suggesting they have been shaped by the force of the ocean over many years. Their surfaces are uneven and rough, and they range in color from dark brown to black. Some of the rocks protrude into the sea, creating a series of natural spikes against the horizon.\n\nThe ocean itself is turbulent, with white waves crashing against the rocks, creating a lively interplay of water and rock. The sea appears powerful and restless, with foamy waves that suggest strong currents and possibly windy conditions. The water close to the rocks is a deep blue, indicating depth and the presence of the open sea beyond.\n\nThe sky is clear, showcasing a bright blue backdrop that enhances the contrast with the dark rocks and white froth of the sea. This combination gives the scene a vivid and dynamic quality.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the untamed beauty of the natural world, highlighting the enduring struggle between land and sea. The setting appears remote and untouched, suggesting a place far removed from urban life and human interference.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543092","543309","545122","543243","543306","553775","545130","543250","543307","545173","543067","553771","543291","543060","547486","543061"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","sea","ocean","interference","wave","froth","beat","struggle","remove","crash"]}
