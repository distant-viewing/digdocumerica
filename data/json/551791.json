{"path":"551791.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is an elevated, angled view of a bustling urban pedestrian area, presumably taken from a window or balcony. The image features a busy street lined with traditional European style buildings that have businesses on the ground floors and residential or office spaces on the higher floors.\n\nAt the forefront, there is a square tiled in a grid pattern, at the center of which sits a modern, simple-style fountain with water spraying upwards. The square is adorned with various potted plants and flowers, adding vibrant colors to the scene.\n\nThe scene captures multiple people engaging in various activities; some are walking across the square, a few are sitting on the edges of the fountain, and others are simply enjoying the day. The street behind the square is crowded with more people walking alongside shops and cafe-style seating protruding onto the sidewalk, suggesting a lively community atmosphere.\n\nIn the distance, the narrowing perspective of the street leads the eye towards a church spire and other historic architectural roofs and windows, indicating the area's old city charm. The sky is blue with few clouds, suggesting a clear, pleasant day.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussg√§ngerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
