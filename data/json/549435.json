{"path":"549435.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and intense moment of a sailing yacht at sea, angled sharply as it cuts through the water. The yacht, named \"La Forza del Destino,\" is prominently displayed with its name and home port (\"Squam Lake, New Hampshire\") visible on the stern. The yacht is a larger vessel with a deep blue hull and multiple white sails hoisted. It is heeling over to one side, indicating strong wind conditions and active maneuvering.\n\nThe crew consists of several individuals who are actively engaged in managing the yacht. The crew members are scattered around the deck, each attending to different tasks necessary for sailing. They appear focused and determined, with some handling the ropes, others adjusting the sails, and a few positioned to balance the boatâ€™s tilt. They wear casual, sporty attire suitable for a sailing environment.\n\nThe sea around the yacht is choppy, with waves visibly striking against the hull. The sky is overcast, suggesting possibly challenging weather conditions. The photograph portrays a moment of teamwork and adventure amidst the natural elements of wind and water, highlighting the excitement and challenges of sailing.","title":"Contender in the five-class Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay near the start of the race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549430","549436","549434","549433","549391","547449","547457","549401","549388","547458","549429","547448","547460","549390","549404","547454"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["yacht","sailing","crew","hull","wind","sporty","name","heel","angl","sea"]}
