{"path":"557973.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a series of discarded tires piled up beside a river. The river appears swollen, possibly due to recent rainfall, and flows amidst a wooded area. The tires are of various sizes and conditions, and some are stacked on top of each other. They are located on a muddy and perhaps rocky riverbank, with patches of grass and small plants visible around them. A couple of the tires have visible rims, suggesting they are automotive tires. The surrounding environment includes lush green trees and a bit of sunlight filtering through the canopy, highlighting parts of the river and the tires. The scene brings attention to environmental pollution, particularly the issue of tire disposal and its impact on natural water bodies.","title":"Used tires placed to deflect high water from the bank of the cuyahoga river which passes close to riverview road, south of ira road near Akron, Ohio.  They were placed there by the Summit County engineer's office.  The river and valley are part of the 30,000 acre cuyahoga valley national recreation area which came into being in december, 1975.  The area includes the last major undeveloped land between Akron and Cleveland.  Officials are now waiting for Congress to appropriate money to buy land","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["547517","546878","547846","543559","546838","542531","547986","551440","545945","552082","552189","546820","551441","547590","546913","556419"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","river","rim","disposal","rainfall","bring","issue","bit","discard","riverbank"]}
