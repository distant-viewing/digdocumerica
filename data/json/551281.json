{"path":"551281.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene, likely taken during the late afternoon given the dim lighting and shadows. The main focal point is a small motorboat in the foreground on the right, containing two men wearing casual clothing. One man is piloting the boat while the other is seated facing him, and they appear to be engaging in conversation.\n\nThe river curves gracefully through the image, bordered by dark banks. On the far left side of the bank, a few cars are parked, suggesting this might be a popular spot for launching boats or fishing. The river's surface is partially reflective, mirroring the dusky sky and the boat's wake.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by wooded hills which fade into the dusky background, hinting at an isolated or rural setting. There are a couple of buildings visible on the bank in the distance, they appear small and modest, likely residential or utility structures related to the nearby activities or land use. \n\nThe overall ambiance of the image is calm and secluded, emphasizing outdoor recreation and a connection to nature. The photograph's dark, somewhat underexposed quality adds to the sense of quiet evening hours by the water.","title":"Two fishermen set out from a backwater anchorage at gravois mills on the northern arm of the lake of the ozarks.
