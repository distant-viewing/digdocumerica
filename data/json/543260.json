{"path":"543260.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene aquatic scene, with the predominant color being the deep blue of the water. Sunlight is reflected in numerous small, rippling spots scattered on the surface, giving the water a shimmering look. A notable feature of the scene is the presence of underwater vegetation which can be seen in the transparency of the water. These plants create linear patterns under the surface, lending a sense of structure and movement to the blue expanse.\n\nAmong these natural elements, a starkly contrasting handmade object stands out: a small, stylized bird figurine floating on the water. The figurine appears to be made of a material that allows it to float freely. It has a glossy finish, reflecting some of the sunlight, and is mainly white with detailed paintings in other colors for accents around its eyes and beak, adding an artistic, whimsical touch to the scene.\n\nThe photograph itself has a peaceful, isolated feel, focusing strictly on the interaction of light, natural water patterns, and the charming oddity of the floating bird figurine. The composition beautifully encases the lone decorative element in the vastness of the natural surroundings, emphasizing the bird's isolation and the expansive nature of the water body.","title":"California--near Carmel","placename":"Carmel (Calif.)","location":"Carmel, California","nn1":["550388","549896","548832","551352","545142","543918","555552","543063","542526","557255","543317","553777","554623","551378","544543","547744"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","float","water","beak","encase","painting","finish","sunlight","isolate","accent"]}
