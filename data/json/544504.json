{"path":"544504.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene where a group of shorebirds, likely sandpipers or a similar species, are gathered along the water's edge. The birds are spaced fairly evenly along a shallow section of water that reflects hints of the blue sky. Behind them, the beach is primarily sandy with some scattered patches of white, which could be shells or small stones. In the background, lush green vegetation, potentially mangroves or a similar type of coastal flora, lines the horizon, providing a dense and vibrant backdrop that contrasts with the pale sand of the beach. The overall mood of the image is peaceful, showcasing a slice of natural coastal life.","title":"Shore birds on pavillon key at 10,000 islands","placename":"Ten Thousand Islands (Fla.)","location":"Ten Thousand Islands, Florida","nn1":["547008","552146","544838","543282","550387","545991","545280","557495","543303","547697","548729","547596","547726","548832","544620","547612"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["beach","mangrove","hints","shell","species","showcas","flora","slice","bird","behind"]}
