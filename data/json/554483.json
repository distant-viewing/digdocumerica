{"path":"554483.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph presents a serene outdoor scene, apparently taken at a fishing access site in Lake Placid, New York, as indicated by a hanging wooden sign. The sign is mounted on a utility pole and includes details such as \"Lake Placid Fishing Access Site\", \"State of New York\", and \"Department of Environmental Conservation\". The background features a broad view of a calm lake, bordered by distant mountains partly shrouded by low-hanging clouds, suggesting either early morning or overcast weather.\n\nThe parking area in front of the lake is mostly gravel and hosts a variety of vehicles, a typical sight for a recreational area that facilitates fishing and lake access. There are several cars, a few vans, and a bus, hinting at the popularity of this location among both individual visitors and groups. Adjacent to the parking lot, a grassy area with trees offers a visual transition from the man-made environment to the natural setting of the lake.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the informational sign in the foreground, a wide-open parking lot, and a picturesque natural backdrop, encapsulates a typical outdoor recreational space designed for public use. It conveys a sense of accessibility and readiness for lake-related activities, setting a tranquil tone for visitors seeking leisure and connection with nature.","title":"Example of New York State boat launching sites.
