{"path":"552560.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rugged landscape, characterized predominantly by a series of rolling hills and valleys. The hills are etched with intricate patterns suggesting erosion or various landforms shaped by natural forces, possibly due to agricultural activities or natural vegetation patterns.\n\nCentral to the image is a meandering river that cuts through the valleys, providing a stark contrast with its blue-green waters against the predominantly dark brown and greenish hues of the surrounding terrain. Alongside the river, patches of flat green land possibly indicate areas of more fertile soil or agricultural activities. \n\nThe terrain is largely devoid of any visible urban development, maintaining a natural and untouched appearance. The perspective provided by the aerial view highlights the vast expanse and the undulating topography of the area. Shadows cast by the low sun, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, accentuate the curves and depths of the hills and valleys, adding a dramatic element to the landscape.\n\nOverall, this composition evokes a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty, typical of remote, rural areas dominated by natural geographic features and minimal human alteration.","title":"Looking south over piceance creek.
