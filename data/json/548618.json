{"path":"548618.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a candid and colorful scene featuring two elderly women engaged in activities at what appears to be a public outdoor location, possibly near a beach. The setting includes a pavement that is wet, possibly from recent rain or nearby water activities.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, one woman outfitted in a yellow cardigan and matching headscarf is bending over to rinse off a striped, foldable beach chair at a street-water faucet. She wears sunglasses and casual slip-on shoes, and seems to be making an effort to wash or cool the chair, with water splashing visibly as it strikes the pavement.\n\nOn the right, another woman, dressed in a light-colored, floral-printed dress, stands beside a cylindrical metal trash bin. She holds a similar foldable beach chair, colored yellow and white, and it looks like she is either placing it into or retrieving it from the bin. She also carries a beige tote bag and wears simple sandals.\n\nIn the background, the environment features a pale, utilitarian building marked with circular windows and signs that indicate gender-specific restrooms (\"MEN\" visible on the door). A palm tree and a thatched roof structure suggest a coastal or tropical setting, enhancing the beach-day theme of the scene.\n\nThis photograph documents a moment in the daily lives of two women, possibly concluding or preparing for a relaxing day at the beach, highlighting both the routine and the unique character of local life in this environment.","title":"Members of the large retirement population of south beach these ladies live in one of the many residential hotels that border the public beach","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["556176","548620","548621","553484","548625","552952","546855","546768","544231","557175","550679","551817","548646","551937","552962","551436"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["beach","bin","chair","pavement","woman","conclude","slip","retrieve","gender","sandal"]}
