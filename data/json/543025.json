{"path":"543025.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and moody seascape under a twilight or dusk sky. The ocean is a dominant feature, covering most of the foreground and middle ground, characterized by its slightly blurred surface, suggesting motion and a long exposure. Numerous rocks and boulders, varied in size and shape, emerge from the water, dotting the seascape and leading off into the distant horizon. These rocky formations, some rugged and jagged while others are smoother and rounder, create an impression of rough natural terrain against the soft and flowing water.\n\nThe background shows a coastline that extends towards the left side of the image, meeting layered hills or mountains that fade into the mist and distance. The colors in the scene are predominantly deep blues and hints of gray, enhancing the overall serene yet somber atmosphere. The sky is partly obscured by clouds or mist, contributing to the imageâ€™s mystique and seemingly cold environment.\n\nThere's a perceived peacefulness about the scene, yet it also carries a sense of isolation and wild natural beauty. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures present in the immediate environment, emphasizing the untouched and rugged nature of the landscape.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547638","553852","543060","543091","545173","543068","547483","543092","543081","553975","553989","542808","545122","552891","543080","543138"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["seascape","mist","mystique","peacefulness","boulder","coastline","twilight","exposure","dusk","ocean"]}
