{"path":"542713.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a pastoral and agricultural landscape with various elements of land use. The image is centered around a meandering river or canal that cuts diagonally across the frame from the upper left to the lower right corner. The river is bordered by roads and some scattered trees along its banks. A bridge crosses the river near the bottom center of the image, facilitating transport between the divided patches of land.\n\nOn either side of the river, there are orderly agricultural fields. To the left and upper section of the river, there are large harvested fields that appear golden brown, indicating either recently harvested crops or dry, fallow land. This expanse is marked by some vehicle tracks, adding detail and texture to the scene.\n\nTo the right of the river, there are densely planted orchards in a grid-like pattern, covering a large area. These orchards present a stark contrast to the open fields, with the trees providing a rich green hue. Each row in the orchard is evenly spaced, showcasing the meticulous planning and management of agricultural space.\n\nOverall, the photograph showcases the use and management of land in a rural setting, emphasizing the balance and interaction between water management, agriculture, and transportation infrastructure. The contrast between cultivated and uncultivated areas alongside the natural river flow creates a dynamic visual composition emphasizing human influence on the natural landscape.","title":"Canal irrigates citrus ranches","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542730","547995","553661","549260","549081","553668","553663","558414","547724","552858","550392","552733","547227","548817","549098","552594"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","management","land","fields","banks","harvest","spac","showcase","canal","field"]}
