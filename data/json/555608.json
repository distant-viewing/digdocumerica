{"path":"555608.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor construction or earth-moving scene in a rural setting. In the foreground is a rugged terrain filled with rocky debris and bare earth, indicative of recent heavy machinery activity. Two prominent construction vehicles dominate the middle ground. On the left, there is a large bulldozer with a dirt-covered blade in front, and on the right, a towing tractor is pulling a sizable, dusty red dump trailer filled with debris.\n\nThe background features a gently rolling landscape with green fields and a few scattered buildings, possibly farmhouses, along with several trees. The sky appears to be clear, suggesting a fair weather condition which is typical for such construction activities. The presence of these heavy vehicles and the disturbed state of the ground suggest that the area is undergoing significant earth-moving operations, possibly for road construction or land development. The overall composition combines elements of rural tranquility with the industrial activity foreground, creating a dynamic contrast between nature and human engineering efforts.","title":"Bulldozer pulling a seeding machine over recontoured land that had previously been strip mined by the coal companies off Route 800 near Edgewater Park, Ohio, and Barnesville","placename":"Edgewater Park (Ohio)","location":"Edgewater Park, Ohio","nn1":["543105","554809","554837","549205","545652","547254","555601","553378","547926","545665","543114","543760","544138","556456","552814","549203"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["construction","earth","farmhouse","dump","blade","tractor","debris","bulldozer","trailer","engineering"]}
