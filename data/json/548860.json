{"path":"548860.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents an indoor scene, seemingly set within a laboratory or medical research environment. The focus of the image is slightly shifted towards the foreground where part of a large cylindrical object, possibly a piece of laboratory equipment, dominates the left side. Its specific function is unclear from the image alone, but it features several wires and attachments.\n\nTo the right, a woman in a white lab coat is actively engaged in an activity. She seems to be adjusting or setting up a plate with the number \"856\" visible on it; this could be part of an experiment or a way to catalog or tag certain items or samples. Her expression is focused and she appears absorbed in her task.\n\nIn the background, you can glimpse a green-walled room dotted with more laboratory equipment and what appears to be bags of waste or supplies on a shelving unit. The room gives off a utilitarian atmosphere, consistent with a research or clinical setting. The woman's attire, including protective eyewear, suggests adherence to safety protocols typical in scientific or medical research facilities.\n\nDespite the straightforward functionality of the space, the composition of the photograph, with its foreground focus and background activity, provides a narrative about scientific endeavor and attentiveness to detail in a professional setting.","title":"Laboratory at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548856","548861","546327","548862","548891","546278","546288","546344","546323","547710","548858","549342","555249","542737","549608","546284"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["research","room","shelving","protocol","attachment","attentiveness","tag","lab","experiment","sample"]}
