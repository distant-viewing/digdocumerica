{"path":"555065.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a snake in a natural outdoor setting. The snake has a glossy, textured skin with a prominent pattern of black, white, and emerald green scales. It is captured with its mouth open, displaying its pink tongue and the inside of its mouth, which adds a dynamic element to the image. The snake's eyes are clearly visible, reflecting a level of detail that suggests it is very alert or in the middle of an activity.\n\nThe background and surrounding area are softly focused, highlighting natural elements such as dirt, small plants, and a lone yellow flower on the upper left side that contrasts with the darker tones of the snake. Bits of brown and green vegetation can be seen, indicative of a possibly dry environment, perhaps a field or a rocky area. The composition of the image is such that the snake and the flower are the main focal points, with the natural textures and colors of the environment enhancing the visual impact of the snake in its habitat.","title":"One garter snake living within a colony of garter snakes who made their home in a deserted beaver house at tin mine lake in Kitsap County, Washington.
