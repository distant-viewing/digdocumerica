{"path":"551924.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene viewed from an elevated perspective. In the foreground, there is a large vacant area that looks like a barren parking lot with patches of dirt and debris scattered around. A single figure in a red shirt is walking alone across this desolate ground.\n\nBeyond this empty lot, there is a fenced area with children playing on what appears to be a concrete playground. The kids are engaged in various activities; some seem to be running, while a couple of others are standing and watching their peers.\n\nAdjacent to and partially framing the playground, are two buildings. The building on the left appears to be a multi-storied structure, likely residential, with visible architectural details like bricks and stone columns. The building's fire escape adds to the sense of dense urban living. The structure on the right has a faded exterior and darkened windows, adding to the sceneâ€™s gritty feel.\n\nAlong the street beside these buildings, there are a few parked cars and open, almost empty roadways, suggesting an urban environment that is not bustling at the moment. The overall tone of the image depicts a stark, somewhat neglected urban landscape.","title":"A poor neighborhood, mostly Black, on the Near North Side near Oak Street and about a mile from N.
