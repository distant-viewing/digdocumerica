{"path":"553217.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a moment between two individuals at a performance or public venue. One person is predominantly in the frame, appearing young and dressed casually in a horizontally striped, sleeveless top and pinkish-red pants. They wear a unique red hat adorned with what looks like a pin or emblem, leaning forward over a dark, glossy counter, resting their chin on their hand in a pose that suggests deep thought or contemplation. Their gaze is directed toward a small black object, possibly a tape recorder or a similar device, placed on the counter.\n\nThe other individual, seen from behind with only the back of their head visible, is seated on the other side of the counter. They are dressed in a striped, collared shirt with vertical lines, and seem to be facing away from the first person, possibly focusing on something else outside of the frame.\n\nThe background is dimly lit, accentuating the contrast and creating a somewhat introspective or intimate atmosphere at this public setting. The overall ambiance is one of quiet interaction or solitary reflection, amidst a space that feels both personal and exposed.","title":"Listening to transistor in fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["552859","547437","553178","551337","557909","543039","557907","553275","552931","551436","551342","554895","557033","557910","557863","556655"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["counter","tape","pin","ching","emblem","venue","collar","performance","accentuat","person"]}
