{"path":"549188.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image features a prominent outdoor billboard advertisement positioned against a clear blue sky. The billboard is for \"Pacific Power\", specifically advertising the Dave Johnston Plant with a capacity of \"750,000 Kilowatts from Wyoming Coal\". The sign uses bright colors, mainly red, yellow, and green. On the left side of the sign, there's a cartoonish drawing of a gleeful electrical plug character standing on a pile of coal. The background shows a barren landscape typical of a rural or semi-arid region, characterized by sparse vegetation and low rolling hills. There are no people visible in the photo, emphasizing the sign and the landscape. The colors of the sign are vivid and contrast sharply with the natural tones of the environment.","title":"This 750-megawatt power plant, located on the North Platte River, is part of the massive strip-mining development planned for the Powder River region.","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555380","549223","545263","549164","557297","557403","544296","555445","549161","549190","544145","542516","543641","545240","545241","555389"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["billboard","sign","drawing","capacity","coal","advertisement","character","pile","region","hill"]}
