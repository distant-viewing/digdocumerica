{"path":"546534.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a verdant garden scene, lush with diverse plant life, looking toward a series of distinct, modern structures in the background. The foreground is dominated by a plethora of greenery, featuring a variety of trees, bushes, and shrubs, including coniferous trees and flowering bushes that add splashes of brighter colors like white and red to the scene. \n\nIn the background, a series of unique, white arch-shaped buildings can be seen. These structures have curved roofing, reminiscent of Quonset huts, and are aligned in a row, partially obscured by the rich tapestry of foliage in front of them. The sides of these buildings are also white, and they appear to be part of a larger, perhaps industrial or research complex, suggested by their uniform design and the way they are grouped together.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph blends a natural, organic foreground with a manmade, architectural background, creating a contrast between the natural world and human construction. The lighting suggests it is either a bright day or the brightness is accentuated by the photograph's exposure, highlighting both the vibrancy of the natural elements and the starkness of the architectural features.","title":"House on harrison lake","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546457","546460","546505","544519","546481","546485","546473","546702","546480","551777","544523","542593","546463","558052","546464","553743"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bushes","hut","series","starkness","roofing","tapestry","brighter","reminiscent","vibrancy","featur"]}
