{"path":"544189.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a young girl standing in front of a large body of water, capturing a casual summer day. She’s dressed in a two-piece swimsuit with a bold, striped pattern in red, white, and blue, suggesting a patriotic theme. The girl, with a pleasant expression and slightly damp hair, appears to have been engaging in water activities.\n\nIn the background, the calm water spans across the scene with several vertical poles sticking out of it, possibly remnants of a dock or a mooring setup. Adjacent to her, there's a rustic wooden dock that extends into the water but is partially submerged or broken, indicating it might be old or in disrepair.\n\nThe area around her is serene, with no other people visible in the immediate vicinity, emphasizing a tranquil, private setting ideal for swimming or relaxing near the water. The lighting and color saturation suggest that this scene was captured on a bright, sunny day, enhancing the vibrant colors of the girl’s swimsuit and the natural blue of the water.","title":"Shrimp boat","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544185","549103","543468","544339","546190","543884","550242","544200","543875","551160","554611","543391","547688","550920","543457","553447"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["girl","swimsuit","dock","water","mooring","span","swimming","ideal","saturation","disrepair"]}
