{"path":"554992.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a densely vegetated forest scene, likely in a temperate rainforest setting. The image is rich in shades of green and browns, underlining the lush, moisture-rich environment.\n\nThe focal point of the image is a large tree with reddish-brown bark, possibly an old growth tree, standing prominently in the center-right of the frame. Its bark is rugged and vertically striped, suggesting maturity and exposure to the elements. Surrounding this central tree are various types of flora typically found in a rainforest.\n\nTo the left and intermingling with the branches of the central tree are several ferns with luscious green fronds that appear vibrant against the darker background. The undergrowth is thick with smaller shrubs, moss, and other fern species which carpet the forest floor and climb up the sides of the trees, indicating a high level of humidity in the air.\n\nIn the backdrop, beyond the central tree, the forest continues densely packed with similar trees, ferns, and moss, creating a wall of greenery. The light seems soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky which is common in rainforest environments. This lighting enhances the vividness of the greens and the texture of the bark on the trees.\n\nNo sky is visible, implying the canopy above is thick and likely blocks much from view, creating a secluded and shaded forest floor. Overall, the photograph depicts a serene and untouched natural habitat, teeming with life and natural beauty.","title":"A dense hemlock and western red cedar coastal forest with rainfall of more than 120 inches annually in the Ish Rivers country of the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555000","555057","554961","555054","545285","555043","554957","554972","554958","554978","554975","554970","554999","545271","555028","546947"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["rainforest","fern","bark","forest","tree","moss","maturity","humidity","floor","frond"]}
