{"path":"552188.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a moody, atmospheric industrial scene at twilight or dawn. The primary focus is on an expansive, somewhat murky landscape that includes a body of water in the foreground. Along the shoreline, there's an industrial complex, marked by a tall, solitary chimney that stands prominently against the dimly lit sky. This chimney emits a faint plume of smoke or steam, contributing to the overall industrial feel of the scene. Additional smoke or steam rises from other parts of the complex, suggesting active industrial processes.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts everything in hues of deep purples and muted oranges, indicative of either sunset or sunrise, adding a dramatic and somewhat somber tone to the scene. The sky is overcast with thick clouds, diffusing the light and enhancing the atmospheric quality of the photograph.\n\nIn the background, vague silhouettes of distant hills or mountains can be discerned under the heavy sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the landscape. The overall feel is of a quiet, possibly isolated industrial area, captured at a moment when natural and artificial elements blend into a tableau of industrial activity and natural beauty. The image provokes contemplation about the relationship between human industry and the natural environment.","title":"Tacoma smelter at Ruston contributes to the city's air pollution problems.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557381","545239","551140","547539","557220","550821","544173","545446","557375","547702","551026","544035","546042","547090","547084","552165"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","chimney","complex","provoke","smoke","relationship","tableau","discern","sunrise","isolate"]}
