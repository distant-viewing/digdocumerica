{"path":"551780.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene, likely from a street in a city, characterized by a mixture of residential and perhaps commercial buildings. The image predominantly features a young woman engaged in tending to a small, rectangular in-ground garden which is fenced in by a decorative white, metal railing. She is surrounded by blooming red and yellow flowers, possibly tulips and daffodils, which add a vibrant contrast to the relatively mundane urban setting.\n\nThe woman, kneeling on a newspaper to protect her knees from the pavement, is dressed casually in a pink patterned blouse and black pants, focusing intently on the plants. Her presence and activity lend a touch of care and attention to the urban environment, suggesting a theme of nature and nurture within a concrete city landscape.\n\nThe background of the image shows a typical city street lined with parked cars and multi-storied buildings, which exhibit a variety of window treatments, suggesting residential use. A yellow taxi, a likely symbol of an active city life, is visible further down the road amongst other vehicles. Above the scene, a \"NO PARKING\" sign attached to a street lamp is clearly visible, indicating the regulatory constraints of the area. The overall atmosphere is one of a bustling city space where small personal efforts are made to beautify and personalize the urban surroundings.","title":"Volunteer gardener tends tiny flower plot on 62nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues in Midtown Manhattan.
