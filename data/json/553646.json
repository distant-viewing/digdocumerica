{"path":"553646.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a forestry or logging scene. A person, wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a red helmet, is present in the image. They are outdoors, walking among large, dark logs that are scattered on the ground, with one particularly prominent log being measured with a measuring tape held by the person. This log appears charred or darkened, potentially from fire damage or weathering.\n\nIn the background, a tall pile of uniformly cut logs is neatly stacked, creating a barrier or wall of wood. The sky is overcast with grey and white clouds suggesting an overcast or gloomy weather condition. The ground is dark and muddy, indicative of recent rains or a typically damp environment, common in forestry areas.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is industrial and rugged, common in logging or forest management activities which involve the measurement and cutting of timber. The person's gear, including the helmet and clothing, suggests safety precautions typical in such environments.","title":"In august, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora, California salvage operations on acreage owned by the pickering lumber company of standard, California., began promptly.
