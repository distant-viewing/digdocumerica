{"path":"549805.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph features a striking red-tinted sky under which the silhouette of an antenna tower dominates the composition. The antenna, centrally positioned, rises prominently against the backdrop, adorned with multiple horizontal elements and crossbars that extend variously in length. To the right background, the upper part of a building is visible, its surface details lost to the shadow and color wash. Near the bottom left, another antenna with fewer details appears, significantly smaller, suggesting it is either farther away or of lesser stature than the central figure.\n\nNear the bottom of the frame, the vague shapes of other structures or objects can sporadically be noted, forming a subtle horizontal line that separates the sky from the darker lower foreground. The sun appears as a dim orb, floating low in the sky, shrouded by the haze that saturates the scene. The subdued luminosity and size of the sun contribute to the eerie, otherworldly atmosphere pervading the image. The red monochrome palette suggests either the time of day around dusk or dawn or perhaps a filter effect, emphasizing the mood of isolation and stillness, devoid of any human or natural activity.","title":"TV antennas at sunset, Upper Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549811","549826","546389","544020","553830","549827","548886","549011","555164","553028","554452","548851","543903","544011","557310","555302"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["antenna","luminosity","bottom","wash","orb","sun","filter","detail","stillness","length"]}
