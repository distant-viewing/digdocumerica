{"path":"550542.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a broad, scenic aerial view of a rugged natural landscape. The central focus of the image is a snaking river, which flows through a valley surrounded by extensive woodlands and terrain. The river appears vibrant and reflective, suggesting movement as it meanders through the terrain. On one side of the river, a strip of grassland runs parallel to the watercourse, while dense forests flank the other side and spread into the surrounding hills and mountains.\n\nThe scene is dominated by the natural, untamed wilderness. The color palette consists of various shades of green indicating dense foliage, alongside darker and lighter browns that signify the earth and barren areas. The upper portion of the image shows mountainous terrain with less vegetation, possibly indicating higher elevation or rougher, rocky ground.\n\nThe light appears natural, suggesting that the photograph was taken during the day under clear skies. There are no visible buildings, roads, or human presence, emphasizing the untouched and serene nature of the landscape. Hints of white in the water could suggest either rapids, rocks, or reflections of light, highlighting the dynamic nature of the river.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a sense of tranquility and rugged beauty, highlighting the vastness and unspoiled quality of the natural environment from an aerial perspective.","title":"Hillsides and tundra typical of the region","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550627","550562","542701","550529","550508","550531","549456","550616","550524","550700","550581","542700","550577","553452","542695","550487"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","terrain","rapid","grassland","woodland","signify","snake","elevation","meander","strip"]}
