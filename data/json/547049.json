{"path":"547049.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene pastoral scene under a twilight or stormy sky. The composition primarily features nature and man-made elements. On the left side, the silhouette of a leafless tree is prominent, its delicate branches sprawling across the sky, while a similar tree appears on the right partially framing the image.\n\nThe central focus is on a seemingly elevated green hedge or shrubbery that spans across the middle of the image. Behind this greenery, three identical signs are visible. Each sign is mounted on its own pole and features a rectangular design, possibly indicating direction or information, typical of road signs or park entrance signs.\n\nThe foreground is a lush green field, indicating either a well-maintained park or rural area. The field is dotted with small flowers or debris, adding texture to the scene. The overall mood is tranquil, possibly depicting an early evening or a less sunny day given the muted lighting and the cool color tones dominating the scene. The backdrop is a slightly clouded sky that helps to emphasize the outlines of the trees and signs.","title":"Lakefront road near Ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547705","543104","546533","552484","547649","557013","546154","555567","545040","543621","547546","555537","549142","556960","556985","553809"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["sign","hedge","park","field","shrubbery","information","twilight","entrance","outline","direction"]}
