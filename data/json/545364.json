{"path":"545364.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a grave adorned with various memorial objects. The headstone, painted in a muted off-white color, displays the name \"Lumina Trujillo\" with the dates \"Born - May 22, 1916. Died - June 1, 1965\" handwritten in dark paint. The text \"REST IN\" is visible with the presumably following word \"PEACE\" mostly obscured.\n\nAround the headstone, there are numerous floral tributes predominantly consisting of artificial flowers, including roses in muted tones of lavender, peach, and white. A few bright yellow flowers add contrast to the color palette. Multiple potted plants, one in a white container and another in a faded decorative pot, are placed at the base of the grave.\n\nOther objects visible include a small cross, potentially made of brass or another metal, attached to the front railing of the metal fence surrounding the grave. Additionally, various personal items and tokens are scattered, reflecting tokens of remembrance left by visitors.\n\nThe background setting appears to be a dry, natural landscape with sparse vegetation, indicative of a grave in a more rural or desert-like area. Subdued lighting suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, adding a somber, serene ambiance to the scene.","title":"Spanish graveyard","placename":"Bernalillo (N.M.)","location":"Bernalillo, New Mexico","nn1":["545357","547801","554210","544267","545314","550365","555566","554206","544307","544427","545322","550364","546147","546098","544259","557942"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","headstone","remembrance","die","brass","rose","flower","pot","object","paint"]}
