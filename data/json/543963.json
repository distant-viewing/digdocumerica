{"path":"543963.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures a large riverboat cruising on a body of water during twilight. The riverboat is ornately designed, lit up with multiple levels of white lights, which outline its structure and give it a festive appearance. The boat is multi-decked, suggesting it might be used for tours or leisure cruises.\n\nSmoke is emitted from two tall stacks on the boat, signifying that it is powered by steam. The glow of the lights on the boat reflects beautifully on the water, creating an ambient and serene atmosphere. The sky transitions from a deeper blue at the top to a warm pinkish hue near the horizon, indicating that the sun has recently set. The surrounding environment is dimly lit, with the riverbank barely visible and appearing as a dark, tree-lined silhouette against the evening sky.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a tranquil evening scene centered around a picturesque, traditional riverboat in motion, evoking a sense of nostalgic charm.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboat on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543967","553815","543955","543962","543971","543959","543972","545917","545921","551214","543964","551313","551147","550825","545736","546392"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["riverboat","boat","cruise","evening","tour","charm","twilight","stack","steam","riverbank"]}
