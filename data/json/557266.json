{"path":"557266.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This image depicts an urban scene, likely within a large city's downtown district. The foreground features vibrant red geraniums neatly planted in a rectangle planter along a paved walkway. The floral bed is bordered by a white stone edge which matches the paving of the walkway. On the walkway, three individuals are visible. They appear to be casually strolling and enjoying the day; two are walking side by side towards the viewer, possibly in conversation, while a third person is a bit further behind them.\n\nIn the background, towering high-rise buildings dominate the scene, framed against a clear blue sky dotted with a few clouds. These buildings, clearly commercial in nature, display typical architectural features of mid to late 20th-century design, such as uniform window patterns and minimal ornamentation. To the left of the image, the side of another large building forms a backdrop, partially casting a shadow onto the scene.\n\nOn the right side, a faint glimpse of a water fountain, possibly part of a larger urban square or park, adds to the cityscape atmosphere. The overall composition of the photograph captures a peaceful moment in a bustling city environment, enhanced by the presence of greenery and open skies. It balances urban architectural elements with natural beauty, creating a serene yet vibrant urban tableau.","title":"Park-like settings stressing plantings of various kinds, sculpture, and pools were features of the urban renewal renaissance program in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the early 1950's.
