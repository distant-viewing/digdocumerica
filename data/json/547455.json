{"path":"547455.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and active moment on a sailboat. There are five people aboard, all wearing matching yellow t-shirts and shorts, engaged in various sailing activities. Here are the details from the image:\n\n1. **Sailboat:** The sailboat is mid-sized with a white hull and equipped with modern sailing gear. The sails are hoisted, indicating the boat is in motion. The main sail is visible in the upper left corner of the image, filled with wind.\n\n2. **People:**\n   - **Front of the boat:** A person is seated towards the bow, handling ropes possibly adjusting the sail tension.\n   - **Middle of the boat:** Three individuals are actively engaged with the sailing operations. One of them is standing and seems to be either looking ahead or communicating with another crew member. The other two are seated; one is managing a winch and the other appears to be either steering or also managing another sail control.\n   - **Back of the boat:** There is an individual standing at the stern, possibly overseeing the entire operation or ready to take action if needed.\n\n3. **Attire:** All individuals are dressed in uniform yellow t-shirts, yellow shorts, and each has different styles of footwear ranging from sandals to sneakers. Their attire contributes to a coordinated and team-oriented atmosphere.\n\n4. **Environment:** The environment suggests an overcast day with calm waters, ideal for sailing. The presence of choppy waters around the boat suggests mild to moderate wind conditions, perfect for a day out on the water.\n\n5. **Activity and posture:** There is a sense of urgency and focus in the posture and activity of the crew, indicating they are possibly in a maneuver or adjusting their sailing strategy.\n\nThis picture portrays a team of sailors working in unison, clearly enjoying a day of sailing and handling their vessel with care and precision. The coordination of their outfits adds a nice touch of unity to the scene.","title":"Crew of the Yellow Jacket add color to the Annapolis--Newport Race, a biennial sailing event","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547466","549388","549427","547458","549399","548513","549433","549392","549397","548503","549428","549386","549389","549429","547453","547465"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sail","boat","team","crew","t","sailboat","wind","short","unity"]}
