{"path":"548726.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows a diver coming up from the water, likely after a dive. He is in the process of removing his diving mask, which he holds with his left hand above his head. The diver wears a black, sleeveless wetsuit top that appears wet, shining under the sun, and is equipped with a yellow snorkel. His hair is wet and slicked back, and water droplets are visible glistening on his face and wetsuit.\n\nThe background of the image is a serene, deep blue body of water that occupies the upper portion of the composition. The lighting in the photo suggests that it was taken on a sunny day, given the bright light reflecting off the diver’s wetsuit and the clear visibility in the water.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is dynamic and refreshing, capturing a moment of transition from underwater exploration to above-water, with a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment evident in the diver’s activity.","title":"A scientist from the shell oil company surfaces after a snorkeling expedition to study the coral formations beneath the waters of john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["547134","548724","549359","549347","548714","544351","548680","553444","548681","548675","544129","546304","548683","552227","555834","554614"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["diver","wetsuit","snorkel","dive","slick","diving","shine","refresh","glistening","underwater"]}
