{"path":"553950.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a serene outdoor scene that appears to depict a group of people gathered around a picnic table under the shade of a large, leafy tree. The primary subjects, a group of silhouette figures, are seated and standing around the table, suggesting a casual social gathering or picnic.\n\nThe composition of the photo uses a silhouette technique, where the figures are backlit, and details are obscured, giving the scene a sense of mystery and universality. Above the figures, the tree's dense foliage dominates the upper portion of the image, its leaves detailed against the sky, creating a natural canopy.\n\nThe background is softly focused and appears to be a broad vista, potentially a view from a high vantage point given the hint of a distant horizon. This suggests the setting may be a hilltop or a similar elevated outdoor area. The lighting is muted and diffuse, with no harsh shadows, indicating the photo may have been taken on an overcast day or during a time when the sun was obscured.\n\nOn the right side of the image, slightly apart from the group, an individual is seated in what looks like reflective solitude, adding a contemplative element to the overall relaxing and communal atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a peaceful, communal vibe, emphasized by the natural environment and the gathering of people in a shared space.","title":"Sunday picnic at Poipu Beach","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["552033","548756","552036","552032","545228","553065","555947","557985","554477","556522","551682","551017","548568","549716","554099","556298"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["picnic","figure","group","table","gathering","hilltop","silhouette","vista","technique","obscure"]}
