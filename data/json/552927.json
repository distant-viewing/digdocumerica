{"path":"552927.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking landscape scene during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The image features a series of distant mountains, whose silhouettes layer one behind another, creating a sense of depth. The mountains have softly rounded peaks and are enveloped in a haze that adds a mystical quality to the view.\n\nAbove the mountains, the sky is a dramatic and integral part of the composition. A large, partially overcast sky dominates the upper half of the image, with the sun breaking through the clouds in several places. The sunlight streams through the breaks in the clouds, resulting in striking rays that spotlight certain areas of the mountain range and the plains below.\n\nThe foreground is relatively flat and appears to be an expansive plain or prairie, giving a stark contrast to the textured, undulating mountain range. There are minimal features on the land except for what might be a fence line running horizontally, suggestive of a rural or semi-wilderness area.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are rich and varied shades of yellows, golds, browns, and dark blues, reflecting the intense and moody atmosphere typical of such luminous moments during the golden hours of the day. The overall effect is serene yet powerful, capturing the awe-inspiring beauty of natural light playing over earth's ancient geological forms.","title":"Late afternoon, (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
