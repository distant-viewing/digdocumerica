{"path":"553592.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette of an individual, presumable a woman, looking through binoculars. The person is framed against a window with several panes. The window itself contains handwritten scribbles, possibly annotations or marks of monitoring, including numbers and short phrases that suggest measurements or distances.\n\nThe woman's face is in profile, indistinct and kept in shadow which directs the focus toward what she's observing outside rather than her own features. Her hairstyle is prominent and appears to be in a bun or similar style. She's also wearing what seems to be a dark, long-sleeve shirt or jacket.\n\nThe view through the window shows a placid twilight or early dawn scene, hinted at by the gradation of blue in the skies opposite the dark interior. The visible structures she is looking through are somewhat worn and rustic, suggesting an older building or a rustic setting ideal for environmental observation, such as a fire lookout or wildlife observation point. \n\nOverall, the composition applies strong contrasts between light and shadow to emphasize the act of observing and the tranquil natural environment beyond the confines of the indoor setting.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora although in the center of the burn area, the Woods River Forest Service lookout was unharmed.
