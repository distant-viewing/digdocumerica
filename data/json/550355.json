{"path":"550355.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a view of a pine plantation. On the left side of the image, a prominent sign with the text \"PINE PLANTATION ST.REGIS Keep Maine Green\" is set on two metal poles. Behind and around the sign are numerous young pine trees spreading across the image under a clear blue sky. The trees are moderately spaced, allowing some light to filter through to the undergrowth below, which consists of low shrubs and grasses. The ground is mostly covered with greenery. In the background, the guideline of a road or path is faintly visible along the left side, adding some depth to the landscape. The image conveys a sense of tranquil outdoor space dedicated to forestry or environmental conservation.","title":"Reforestation by the St. Regis Paper Co., about 20 miles south of Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["554461","545045","555091","544239","553457","556918","555109","544913","542604","545262","556920","555116","549226","545259","542789","546200"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["forestry","undergrowth","pine","conservation","sign","text","shrub","path","pole","side"]}
