{"path":"544786.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a wetland area characterized by intricate patterns of water channels and muddy terrains. The central focus is a series of branching water pathways that extend from the bottom, converging and diverging as they progress upwards. These channels are outlined by dense, dark green vegetation that contrasts strikingly with the lighter-colored mud and sand.\n\nThe broader landscape includes expansive flat areas inundated with shallow water, creating reflective surfaces that catch the light. Additional channels wind through these areas, varying in width and density. The backdrop features soft, hazy mountains, suggesting a calm yet isolated natural setting. The light, likely either early morning or late afternoon, enhances the textural details of the landscape, casting gentle shadows and enriching the colors of the natural elements.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene yet dynamic ecosystem, illustrating the complexity and beauty of wetland environments.","title":"The game refuge on the eastern shore includes many species of birds.","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["545114","552924","545033","550783","544649","544760","544506","550341","550786","547589","544773","544757","547500","544593","547488","557498"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["channel","wetland","width","mud","calm","density","complexity","ecosystem","pathway","sand"]}
