{"path":"552184.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of an industrial site, specifically focusing on a large chimney stack emitting a thick plume of white smoke into the air. The chimney is cylindrical, with a beige or light gray color, and appears to have bands around it, possibly for structural support. There are also several square platforms around different levels of the chimney.\n\nSurrounding the chimney, there are complex industrial structures, which include various buildings and a complicated network of pipes or conduits. These structures appear to be metallic and are organized in a very intricate and densely packed manner.\n\nThe image captures the stark contrast between the industrial activity, represented by the smoke and the structured environment of the buildings and pipes, against the darker surroundings which could be other parts of the facility or shadows. The photograph provides a perspective that highlights the environmental impact and scale of industrial operations.","title":"Smoke stack of aluminum smelting plant","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["546760","556499","548376","544777","547468","545472","557301","544495","550871","550938","550998","556502","545441","552185","543005","545247"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","pipe","conduits","organized","smoke","band","manner","represent","plume","network"]}
