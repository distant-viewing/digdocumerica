{"path":"547132.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and somewhat desolate scene with two vintage cars submerged in a body of water, likely a lake or a river. The bodies of the cars are half-submerged and appear abandoned, one of them tilted forward into the water as if caught mid-sink. The water around the cars is muddy and in motion, with waves crashing into the vehicles, suggesting a strong current or waves. The scene is set against a contrasting backdrop with vibrant yet dark blue water and sky which enhances the sense of isolation and abandonment.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor environment, emphasized by natural lighting and the composition of shadows highlighting the metallic sheen and rusty textures of the submerged vehicles. The surrounding area is strewn with small stones, and some vegetation can be seen at the forefront, slightly blurred, contributing to an overall feeling of wild, uncontrolled nature reclaiming human-made objects. The atmosphere evoked is one of decay and the relentless force of nature.","title":"Homeowners lined the lake beach with abandoned cars in an effort to hold back the erosion that threatened their property.
