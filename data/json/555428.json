{"path":"555428.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment likely in a dimly lit interior setting at night, dominated by warm, soft lighting primarily emanating from an old-fashioned oil lamp. The lamp, positioned on the right side of the frame, has a clear glass base and chimney, through which the yellow-orange glow of the flame is visible, casting gentle light across the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, a young woman is seen engaging in reading a book. The focus on her is soft, contributing to a dreamy, contemplative atmosphere. She rests her head on her hand, suggesting a moment of deep concentration or perhaps tiredness. Her expression is thoughtful and absorbed in the content of the book.\n\nThe background and surrounding details are obscured by the darkness and the narrow depth of field, focusing the viewer's attention on the two main elements: the glowing lamp and the woman reading. The overall mood of the photograph is quiet and intimate, evoking a sense of timeless tranquility and the simple pleasure of reading by lamp light.","title":"Reading and studying by kerosene lamps became more common as people tried to conserve electricity.
