{"path":"556388.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, specifically the interior of a factory or a workshop focused on heavy machinery or production. The image captures a large, robust machine, which appears to be a type of press or mechanical apparatus, likely used in manufacturing or processing materials. The machine is constructed from heavy metal, featuring thick, solid beams and reinforced structures. It possesses a dark, oily surface that suggests frequent usage and contact with industrial materials.\n\nThe setting is dimly lit, illuminated by overhead lights that cast shadows and highlight parts of the machine, which adds a gritty, working atmosphere to the scene. The infrastructure around the machine includes metal beams and columns, partly visible piping and ductwork, and electrical conduits, all indicative of an engineering or industrial environment.\n\nThe floor is barely visible but appears to be concrete, and there is minimal visible debris or clutter, suggesting a maintained working area. No human figures are present in the scene, focusing all attention on the machinery and the environment surrounding it. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of heavy industry and mechanical operation, emphasizing themes of production and manufacturing.","title":"Rocker trays that clean the coal and grade it by size at the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia the v-p company processes metallurgical coal which is used in making steel","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["543997","558371","543158","546757","544026","546923","556386","547964","556314","544045","556389","544822","546932","546036","554429","557387"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["machine","production","manufacturing","beam","press","conduit","possess","machinery","contact","clutter"]}
