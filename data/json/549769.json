{"path":"549769.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a wasteland foreground with a city skyline in the background. The foreground is cluttered with piles of debris and rubbish, including pieces of wood, bits of masonry, and miscellaneous trash scattered across a dirt-covered area. Prominently, there's a sign in the foreground that reads \"PRIVATE PROPERTY NO DUMPING VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED P.D.\" suggesting that the area is meant to be protected against illegal dumping, yet itâ€™s clearly littered with waste.\n\nIn the background, a clear, unobstructed view of the World Trade Center towers and other Manhattan skyscrapers is visible against a blue sky, partially enveloped by slight haze. The contrast between the well-maintained, prosperous-looking cityscape and the disorganized, dirty dumping ground creates a stark juxtaposition. This suggests a narrative of urban expansion and the overlooked environmental or community impacts that might accompany such development. The image evokes themes of neglect, urbanization, and the environmental challenges associated with city growth.","title":"Despite warning signs, illegal dumping continues in this area just off the New Jersey Turnpike facing Manhattan. Below this area to the south, is the landfill site of the proposed Liberty State Park.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549767","549768","549762","549776","549957","549764","547899","549782","549747","557283","549958","549823","549739","545506","549773","549752"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["masonry","urbanization","dumping","rubbish","expansion","city","challenge","skyscraper","property","trash"]}
