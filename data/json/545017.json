{"path":"545017.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a scene in an expansive grassy outdoor area, likely a field or park. The image captures a young male chef, dressed impeccably in a traditional white chef's uniform consisting of a double-breasted jacket and tall chef's hat, known as a toque. The chef's attire is complete with white pants and a white apron; his stance is casual yet composed, with hands on hips and his body slightly angled towards the camera, suggesting a pose of relaxed authority or contemplation.\n\nAdjacent to the chef, there is a large, circular grill filled with burning coals. Attached to the grill is a unique, sizable rotisserie setup enclosed partly with aluminum foil, which could be used to uniformly cook large cuts of meat or whole animals. It appears that whatever is being cooked is sizable, given the proportion of the setup.\n\nThe background is a subdued, overcast sky that suggests it could be either early morning or approaching inclement weather. Behind the chef, to the far right, a simple wooden structure is visible, possibly a storage shed or outdoor restroom, which complements the rustic, outdoor cooking setting. The vast open field stretches behind the entirety of the scene, meeting a distant horizon that fades under the heavy sky, adding a sense of openness and tranquility to the setting. The overall atmosphere is quiet and slightly moody, emphasizing the seriousness with which the chef is undertaking his task.","title":"Salmon bake","placename":"Otter Crest (Or.)","location":"Otter Crest, Oregon","nn1":["544986","544983","544974","557801","544979","549451","555983","554511","546127","550085","557934","557700","545021","542726","554862","551275"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["grill","setup","meat","authority","seriousness","entirety","aluminum","cooking","apron","hip"]}
