{"path":"543495.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and nostalgic scene at a seaside location. On the left, a series of telescopes mounted on sturdy posts are lined up, available for viewers to get a closer look at distant sights on the ocean or shore. Each telescope has a small plaque, presumably with information or instructions for use.\n\nTo the right of the telescopes, people are engaged in various activities. A young woman with long hair, wearing jeans and a dark jacket, is peering through one of the telescopes. Near her, an older man with a beard and sunglasses, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt, is waiting his turn or observing the surroundings. \n\nCentral in the image, seated on a weathered wooden railing, an elderly man and woman appear to be enjoying a conversation or simply soaking in the atmosphere. The man is wearing glasses, a vibrantly patterned short-sleeve shirt, and dark pants, while the woman is dressed in a lighter, possibly gray, outfit.\n\nIn the background, other visitors can be seen meandering or standing around. The scene also features vintage cars, adding a touch of historical charm. The cars, prominently displayed in the foreground, have shiny, colorful exteriors and are characteristic of 1960s or 1970s American auto design, featuring sleek lines and large, curved windows.\n\nThe background reveals a bit of the natural setting, with a rocky coastline and the ocean extending to the horizon under a clear sky, suggesting a sunny day perfect for outdoor activities.\n\nThis photograph not only depicts a leisurely day by the sea but also effectively evokes a sense of the era through fashion, car models, and the overall ambiance.","title":"California -- Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["550934","547499","548529","550922","547495","557475","549329","547478","549314","546412","545252","550921","545237","545221","545849","545857"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","plaque","woman","auto","car","soak","instruction","sleeve","get","seaside"]}
