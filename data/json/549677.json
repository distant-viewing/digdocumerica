{"path":"549677.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph portrays a lively outdoor café setting bustling with patrons. The café is characterized by multiple round tables each shaded by visually striking umbrellas adorned with blue and white panels and labeled with the word \"KAFFEE\" and \"ARABIA\" in bold lettering, suggesting a coffee theme or brand. There is a noticeable abundance of these branded umbrellas, creating a colorful and patterned canopy over the seating area.\n\nEach table has several red chairs around it, occupied by customers engaged in various activities such as drinking, eating, conversing, or reading newspapers. The patrons appear casual and relaxed, indicative of a social, leisurely environment typical in café settings.\n\nThe image is captured from an elevated perspective, providing a top-down view that focuses on the arrangement of tables and umbrellas, and captures a good portion of the crowd but obscures individual faces, thus emphasizing the overall atmosphere more than the specifics of the people.\n\nAdditionally, the background of the image reveals part of a pedestrian area with a few more individuals walking by or standing, possibly indicating that the café is located in an urban or semi-urban setting with moderate foot traffic. The composition and color scheme of the image, with vivid colors set against a neutral ground surface, offers a lively and inviting impression of this public space.","title":"Outdoor cafes take the place of traffic congestion during those hours of the day when the Graben is closed to traffic.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549672","549657","551650","549669","551634","551803","551637","550037","551635","553190","551846","551848","551834","553320","551867","551795"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["café","umbrella","patron","table","drinking","specific","coffee","abundance","customer","brand"]}
