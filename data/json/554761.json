{"path":"554761.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural landscape dominated by a calm lake in the foreground and a range of mountains in the background. The lake reflects some of the colors of the sky and is bordered by lush forests showing a beautiful array of autumn colors, including shades of red, orange, and yellow. The mountains appear rugged and densely forested, ascending steeply from the lakeside. The highest peaks are rounded, suggesting erosion over time.\n\nThe left side of the image features the silhouette of pine branches, framing the view and adding depth to the composition. The sky above is clear and deeply blue, indicating a bright, sunny day without clouds. The lighting suggests early to mid-day, as it brightly illuminates the leaves and casts gentle shadows on the mountainside.\n\nOverall, the scene is picturesque and tranquil, typical of a North American wilderness area during the fall season. This could be a location popular for hiking, nature observation, or simply enjoying the peace of the outdoors.","title":"Famous high peaks scene from the Marcy Dam trail in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554648","554757","554758","554635","554714","554649","554642","555692","543547","543816","554719","554653","554713","554749","543605","552599"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountainside","lake","peace","mountain","hiking","lakeside","observation","outdoor","fall","erosion"]}
