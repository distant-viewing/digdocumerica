{"path":"552876.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on board a boat, where a group of men is involved in the process of sorting or handling oysters. The deck of the boat is cluttered with large piles of oyster shells. Some tools, possibly for handling the oysters, like a shovel, are scattered on the deck.\n\nThree men are present on the boat. The first man, on the left, is drinking from a cup and leaning against what appears to be heavy machinery or equipment, possibly related to the oyster harvesting process. The second man is standing with one leg propped up on a part of the boat, smoking a cigarette and engaging in a conversation. He wears casual, somewhat dressy apparel and sunglasses. The third man is seated, hunched over, also smoking a cigarette, looking attentive to the conversation.\n\nAbove them is a simple metal canopy structure, providing some shade. A bright, clear sky suggests a sunny day, enhancing the outdoor, maritime work environment depicted in the photo. The focus on manual labor and natural resources is evident, offering a glimpse into the working operations on an oyster boat.","title":"Lake borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi river flood waters has polluted their oyster beds.
