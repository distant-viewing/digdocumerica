{"path":"550770.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"In the photograph, a person stands beside a canoe that is partially on the shore of a muddy river. The person appears to be dressed in historical or traditional attire, suggesting a setting from the past or a reenactment scene. They wear a knee-length, loose-fitting, olive-green jacket and dark pants with knee-high boots. The person's hair is gray and long, tied back at the nape. They hold a long rifle vertically with both hands, resting on the ground, conveying a sense of readiness or pause in activity.\n\nThe canoe is filled with various items, including what appears to be bundles wrapped in light-colored fabric, possibly supplies or personal belongings. Some oars can also be seen inside the canoe.\n\nThe background features a tranquil river surrounded by dense green foliage, with trees and leaves prominently in the frame. The river has a slightly red-brown hue, suggesting it might be rich in sediment or reflecting the earthy environment. The scene is serene and appears to capture a moment from a journey or expedition set in a natural, wooded landscape. The lighting is soft and natural, contributing to the historical or timeless feel of the image.","title":"The canoe is a replica of one used by father marquette and louis Joliet when they explored the Mississippi and its tributaries in a 3000 mile voyage in 1673.
