{"path":"552239.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up of what appears to be a highly textured and visually intriguing pattern of a fluid or semi-fluid substance. The coloration is predominantly a mix of dark hues, including shades of gray, black, and touches of earthy browns. There are also white specks and whimsical, swirling patterns that enhance the complexity of the image.\n\nAt first glance, this might remind one of marble or an abstract painting, but the fluidity suggests it’s possibly a view of some organic material or a surface seen from a close range. There are distinct lines that flow in a sinuous manner, forming loops and curves that mimic natural geological patterns, perhaps indicative of flow lines or sedimentary layers.\n\nThe swirling patterns and combination of contrasting colors give the image a dynamic feel, almost as if it’s capturing a moment of motion in a normally solid substance. It’s an artistic and almost otherworldly representation, reminiscent of aerial photographs of earth landscapes or even images of other planetary surfaces taken from space. This evokes a sense of the sublime and the intricate processes of natural phenomena.","title":"Pumping waste water in Bellingham Waterway, site of the Georgia Pacific pulp mill and other industrial plants.
