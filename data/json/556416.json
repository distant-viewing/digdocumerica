{"path":"556416.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a landscape dominated by a large brown-red pile of earth or mining spoil in the background, slightly obscured by smoke or steam, with patches of forest visible on its upper reaches. In the foreground, there are three small white houses with pointed roofs aligned next to each other, suggesting a residential area. These homes have visible chimneys and surrounded by fences, and there are few blooming trees in the vicinity, adding a touch of natural beauty to the scene. A telephone pole stands prominently on the right side of the image. A parked car is visible close to the middle house, hinting at the presence of residents or visitors. The overall setting suggests a small community nestled close to industrial or mining activity, highlighted by the residential structures juxtaposed against the backdrop of large-scale earth movement. The atmosphere of the photograph has a somewhat somber tone, perhaps due to the environmental impact indicated by the nearby industrial activity.","title":"Coal slag heap burns above company houses near Hutchinson, West Virginia, near Logan, in the southern part of the state. Spontaneous combustion, lightning, a fire, or variety of other causes can result in ignition of these coal mine refuse piles, and they can burn for years. It is one of the things that makes the miners and their families mad.","placename":"Logan (W.
