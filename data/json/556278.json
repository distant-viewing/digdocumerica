{"path":"556278.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"In the photograph, a group of marchers, who appear to be part of a parade, are carrying multiple flags. The group is predominantly composed of young women or girls dressed in uniform. Their attire includes white blouses with navy blue and red trim, navy blue skirts, white knee-high socks, and white shoes. They also wear white gloves, and many of them sport a white hat with a red band.\n\nThe scene shows the marchers in motion, each carrying a pole with a flag attached. The flags predominantly have a white background paired with red; one central flag is dark green. Their disciplined and synchronized movement suggests they are part of a marching band or similar performance group, possibly during a ceremonial or festive event.\n\nThe background includes a vivid blue sky speckled with light clouds, and lush green trees are visible, suggesting the photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day. The setting looks like a city street or a public area designated for the parade, with no visible spectators or other distinct background details aside from the natural scenery and the clear weather conditions.","title":"Black youngsters carrying flags during the annual Bud Billiken Day Parade along Dr. Martin L.
