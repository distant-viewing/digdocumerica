{"path":"553229.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a charming and playful scene set in an urban environment, likely in a public square or a park. The focal point is a toddler, who appears joyful and curious, sitting in a shallow part of a water fountain. The child is lightly splashing water with hands and seems to be enjoying the cool water, particularly noticeable due to the child's expressive face and dynamic body language.\n\nIn the background, a prominent water fountain sculpture enhances the composition. It features a metallic statue of a young male figure, possibly mythological, seated and poised with one leg crossed over the other, surrounded by spouts of water cascading beautifully around him. The statue appears to be crafted in a classical style, adding a sense of timeless elegance to the scene.\n\nThe setting includes architectural elements such as parts of buildings with large windows and what can be an ornate facade in the immediate background. The urban backdrop features high-rise buildings, suggesting the fountain might be located in a city's downtown area. The light and shadow in the photograph accentuate the textures of the water and the gleaming wet surfaces around the child.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of innocent enjoyment amidst an urban setting, juxtaposing the liveliness of childhood with the static grandeur of city structures and classical artistry. The scene is both a personal memory for those involved and a public display of everyday urban life.","title":"A noble bath in fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551467","552539","551638","551446","553245","551857","552737","553192","553149","550747","551647","550080","551667","552540","553219","552703"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","statue","child","water","artistry","memory","liveliness","toddler","elegance","gleam"]}
