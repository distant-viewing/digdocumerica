{"path":"550130.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene focusing on a sidewalk and the facades of businesses in likely an older urban area. The image features large vertical signage hanging from a dark wooden facade with traditional swinging signs that bear the names \"Edith Blondis Inc.,\" \"Bill's Barber Shop,\" \"Soup Travel,\" and \"Atlas Travel Inc.\" These establishments suggest a mix of services including a hairdresser or barber, and travel agencies.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is prominently depicted, walking on the sidewalk towards the camera. He is wearing light-colored pants, blue shortsleeved shirt, and has a short haircut. He is carrying a leather briefcase in one hand and some books or folders in the other. His serious expression and professional attire might imply he's coming from or going to a business meeting or workplace.  \n\nFurther down the sidewalk, another figure is visible, who appears to be a woman with long hair, dressed in a casually styled outfit, walking away from the camera. It is sunny, indicated by the shadows cast on the sidewalk and the bright sunlight illuminating the buildings and the street. The architecture of the buildings suggests a somewhat quaint and possibly historic area, with features like ornamental trim and wooden siding common to certain traditional American storefronts.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on street level business signs and pedestrian activity, offers a glimpse into day-to-day urban life in what might be a small to medium-sized city. The photograph appears to have a vintage feel, perhaps taken a few decades ago given the style of clothing and the design of the signs.","title":"Mail delivery on attractively Renovated street of stores (Lake and Detroit Roads) in suburban Rocky River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550114","550127","546419","550110","546428","550136","546034","556733","548399","546672","556223","556199","545333","550132","546427","550142"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["sidewalk","business","street","folder","haircut","facade","briefcase","workplace","sign","leather"]}
