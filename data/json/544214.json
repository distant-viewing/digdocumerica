{"path":"544214.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting by a body of water. In the image, a man wearing a light-colored hat and plaid shirt is sitting beneath a large tree draped with Spanish moss. The area around him is cluttered with various objects including metallic containers, old furniture pieces such as a disassembled wooden chair, and other miscellaneous items that suggest a workspace or a makeshift repair area.\n\nBeside the man, there are three boats moored at the water's edge. The closest boat to the viewer is a small, flat-bottomed skiff filled with items that may be used for fishing or boat repair. The middle boat, painted in light blue, seems to be a slightly larger motorboat. The third boat, to the right in the image, is equipped with an outboard motor and appears ready for use.\n\nThe background consists of calm water reflecting the greenery surrounding it, further enhancing the tranquil, slightly rustic atmosphere of the scene. The overall composition suggests a moment of daily life by the water, perhaps involving fishing or maintenance activities in a lush, natural setting.","title":"Fishing boats and gear: ubiquitious sight along banks of Louisiana bayous","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544260","544973","550975","548304","550841","544567","546984","552806","552317","544266","546356","546939","546976","550000","546985","548235"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","repair","disassemble","fishing","item","motor","motorboat","furniture","workspace","drape"]}
