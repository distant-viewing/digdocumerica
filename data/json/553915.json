{"path":"553915.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two women wearing traditional Polynesian attire, likely at a cultural or social event. The focus is on the woman in the foreground who is smiling warmly. She wears a broad straw hat adorned with a light brown ribbon and an off-center white flower, complementing her cheerful appearance.\n\nHer dress is colorfully patterned with large tropical flowers in shades of orange and brown, giving a lively and festive feel. Draped heavily around her neck are multiple strands of leis, predominantly made of white flowers, which add a significant traditional element to her attire.\n\nThe woman partially visible in the background also seems to be wearing similar floral leis and a vibrantly patterned dress, though her expression is less visible. Her dress appears to have red and white colors and she has a red flower tucked behind her ear, enhancing her femininity and connection to the cultural setting.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the women and their elaborate traditional attire. The event they are attending is not directly visible, but the emphasis on flowers and the outdoor lighting suggests a daytime outdoor setting, possibly a festival or a community gathering celebrating Polynesian culture. The warmth of the sunlight illuminates the subjects' faces, highlighting their features and expressions.","title":"Hawaiians ready to demonstrate hula dance to Waikiki Beach tourists","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553916","553708","553917","553918","553709","553758","556281","553711","553759","553760","557040","553712","553761","556150","549678","547358"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["flower","dress","woman","attire","strand","ribbon","event","festival","ear","straw"]}
