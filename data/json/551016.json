{"path":"551016.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene taking place in an outdoor setting with lots of greenery in the background, suggesting a park-like environment. The focus is on two African American individuals, a man and a woman, involved in a moment of interaction.\n\nThe man is sitting on the ground or a low platform. He is wearing a light pink tank top paired with vertical striped pants, which appear to be black and white. His footwear includes sneakers, and he has his left leg crossed over his right. He has a focused yet relaxed expression as he looks upward.\n\nStanding beside him is a woman in a red tank top and blue jeans. She is adorned with sunglasses pushed up onto her head, a noticeable necklace, and dangle earrings. She is actively engaged in fixing or arranging something on the man’s head or hair, indicated by her hand’s position near his head.\n\nThe evident casual and tender interaction between them and the relaxed outdoor setting provide a warm, intimate atmosphere. The sunlight and shadows suggest it might be either late afternoon or early evening. Other partially visible figures in the background, along with the general vibe of the setting, suggest that this could be a social gathering or a public event in the park.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 100th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
