{"path":"547808.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The image shows a rustic, possibly old storefront porch area, encapsulated by a weathered wooden structure. The atmosphere suggests a blend of wear and enduring character.\n\nThe focal point is an aged, wooden porch covered by an A-frame overhang. The roof itself, angled sharply, looks like it may be made of tin or similar material, painted in dark hues that show signs of wear and rust.\n\nA striking red column supports the overhang, centrally located in the frame of the photo. Attached to it is a sign reading \"HELP KEEP THIS PLACE CLEAN,\" which suggests the place is frequented by visitors or patrons.\n\nTo the right side, there is a door accompanied by a roughly textured, white sign that says, \"PUSH TO OPEN DEPOSIT CLOTHES IN BOX AFTER HRS.\" The text and the overall state of the sign portray an old collection point, possibly for a charity or second-hand clothing store.\n\nInside the doorway, the interior is dimly visible, featuring additional doors and wooden furnishings. Parts of an old register and perhaps shelving units can be seen, hinting at commercial use.\n\nAt the leftmost edge, counterbalanced by the placement of the vertical column, is an old, rusty hanging lantern that frames the porch entrance. This artifact adds to the rustic, historical feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall architectural details, including the weathered steps leading to the porch, the layers of peeled paint, and the rugged charm, intermingle to create a nostalgic essence, evoking times past and the remnants of local commerce.\n\nLastly, the shadows cast by the strong overhead sunlight enhance the textures of the surface materials and lend a geometric contrast to the scene, emphasizing the antiquity and resilience of the structure.","title":"Cleaning establishment in Northside (Stockyards area) of Ft Worth","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["552489","555377","557633","557646","552488","557640","557649","548654","545355","557643","550006","544911","552681","543348","543339","557156"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["porch","overhang","column","sign","wear","tin","patron","door","lantern","furnishing"]}
