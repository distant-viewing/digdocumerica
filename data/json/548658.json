{"path":"548658.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures a partial view of a historic building showcasing architectural details. The focus is on a section where the balcony intersects with the buildingâ€™s structure. The balcony is adorned with a white balustrade featuring rounded balusters which support a smooth handrail. Below this, the roof is visible, covered in tan shingles that provide a textural contrast to the smoothness of the balcony above.\n\nThe building itself features walls with a brick-like appearance, painted in a muted pink, adding a warm hue to the composition. Adjacent to this are light teal shutters, closed against similarly painted window frames, complementing the building's warm tones with a dash of cool color. The repetition of shutters suggests multiple windows, reinforcing the building's residential or possibly commercial nature.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly out of focus, fronds from a palm tree intrude into the frame, adding a sense of location - possibly a tropical or subtropical area. The lighting in the photograph indicates a sunny day, casting shadows of the palm fronds on the shingle roof, creating dynamic lines and patterns.\n\nThe myriad of architectural elements and the play of light and shadow in the composition give the scene an inviting warmth, hinting at the historical character of the structure and its surroundings.","title":"Detail of one of the historic houses of Key West.
