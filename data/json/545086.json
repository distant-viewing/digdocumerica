{"path":"545086.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic seascape scene at a rocky beach. In the foreground, a person engages with the waves while casting a net, poised in a moment of action. The individual, dressed in dark clothing that includes a long-sleeve jacket, pants, and possibly boots, is partially submerged in the surf. This suggests they are performing a task related to fishing or collecting something from the ocean.\n\nThe beach itself is adorned with an array of rocks scattered in and around the water's edges, adding a rugged texture to the scene. These rocks vary in size and contribute to the untamed character of the shoreline. The sand appears coarse and speckled, intersecting with the frothy white waves that wash ashore, reflecting the energy of the ocean.\n\nThe background features the open ocean, merging seamlessly into a bright, clear sky that dominates the upper portion of the image. The sea is lively, with small waves cresting in different areas, indicating a breezy day. The horizon is distant but distinct, marked by the convergence of the sea and sky.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment filled with motionâ€”the rhythmic dance of the waves, the determined activity of the individual, and the natural beauty and harshness of a coastal environment. The image emphasizes the interaction between human and nature in a coastal setting, underlined by a sense of solitude and endeavor.","title":"Netting smelts","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["543019","543492","543073","543092","543309","543391","542976","545085","547913","543253","543139","547486","545095","545122","543033","543295"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["wave","ocean","beach","harshness","sea","surf","dance","crest","poise","seascape"]}
