{"path":"547626.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat polluted and neglected aquatic environment, possibly a small port or dock area. Visible in the foreground is a collection of debris and refuse scattered along the water's edge. This includes a variety of discarded items such as rocks, twisted wires, fragmented wood planks, and other unidentifiable rubble partially submerged in the water.\n\nThe water itself shows signs of oil pollution, visible as a rainbow-colored sheen that covers much of the surface, implying environmental degradation and possibly neglect or industrial impact. Drifts of this oily film shift patterns across the calmer surface of the water.\n\nIn the background, there are industrial or storage buildings made of metal, painted in a greenish shade. These structures appear functional and simple, likely associated with storage or processing functions within an industrial or maritime setting.\n\nFurther, there are skeletal remains of what could have been a dock or pier. Wooden posts and planks that once might have formed a stable structure are now dilapidated, decayed, and uneven, contributing to the overall neglected vibe of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a scene of environmental neglect and industrial decay, highlighting issues of pollution and poor maintenance in a water-adjacent industrial area.","title":"Oil floats on Providence River in area of tanker terminal.","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551985","547582","551559","547622","552127","546854","547618","547907","547614","547493","552158","549307","551562","547897","547581","544810"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["neglect","plank","decay","pollution","rainbow","dock","drift","storage","water","sheen"]}
