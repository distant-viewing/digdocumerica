{"path":"544314.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene where a diverse group of people are engaged in what appears to be a group discussion or learning session. The setting looks like a classroom or an informal education room, evident from educational posters and diagrams on the walls, and a whiteboard visible in the background.\n\nThe composition focuses on eight individuals sitting in a circular arrangement. To the left, a man with glasses, wearing a dark shirt, is holding papers and seems to be leading the discussion or presenting to the group; he is speaking and gesturing with his hand. The remaining people, consisting of a balanced mix of men and women, are seated around him. Each person has papers or notebooks on their laps, indicating engagement in note-taking or reference to handouts during the discussion.\n\nInterestingly, a box filled with what looks like cassette tapes or books is prominently placed in the foreground, suggesting that the session might involve audio-visual learning materials or that these are resources related to the topic under discussion.\n\nThe individuals show varying degrees of engagement: some are looking directly at the person speaking, while others appear to be contemplating or reading their materials. The lighting in the room casts a cozy, warm glow, indicating the photograph might have been taken in the evening or in a room with warm artificial lighting.\n\nOverall, the image portrays an environment of learning and interaction, underlined by an informal yet focused atmosphere.","title":"Training HavaSupai teachers in reading and language instruction methods","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["545547","554332","555290","556028","557704","546299","552616","557027","557038","557703","558214","544318","543920","552592","555233","557029"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Community Gatherings"],"terms":["discussion","session","learning","room","engagement","group","paper","diagram","topic","tape"]}
