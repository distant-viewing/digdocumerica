{"path":"547689.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and somewhat melancholic scene at a waterside with various environmental details. The setting is likely during late afternoon or early evening, as suggested by the soft lighting and the long shadows. \n\nIn the foreground, numerous discarded objects, predominantly tires, are scattered over the muddy shoreline. These tires are strewn haphazardly, partially submerged in water, creating reflective surfaces. Besides tires, there are other forms of debris, indicating neglect or pollution in the area.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features a calm body of water that leads to a visible tree line. A lone, leafless tree stands prominently on a slight rise near the shore, characterized by its bare branches stretching outward. This tree is a focal point and contributes to the tranquil yet desolate feel of the landscape.\n\nIn the background, a soft haze partially obscures the horizon where the sky meets the water, enhancing the sense of depth and spaciousness in the photograph. The further shore across the water is lined with more trees, and a clear sky is visible above, providing a contrast to the cluttered and muddy foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements within the photograph evoke a quiet sense of abandonment and environmental concern, highlighted by the contrast between natural beauty and human-generated waste.","title":"Discarded tires litter the shoreline of the middle branch of Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546913","543552","547590","546838","546066","547622","550352","551441","547893","547582","545866","550201","550947","552080","547581","545213"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","spaciousness","shore","waterside","cluttered","strewn","tree","desolate","water","concern"]}
