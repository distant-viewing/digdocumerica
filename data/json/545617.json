{"path":"545617.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a brown rectangular sign lying on a similarly colored rocky ground. The sign has white lettering, which reads:\n\n\"TRACKS\nTRACKS CAUSE EROSION\nKILL VEGETATION AND\nMAR SCENIC BEAUTY\nTHEY REMAIN FOR YEARS\nPLEASE STAY ON THE ROAD\"\n\nThe sign seems to be made of a solid material, probably metal, and is slightly weathered, indicating it has been outdoors for some time. The text on the sign promotes environmental conservation by urging viewers to stay on established roads to prevent erosion, vegetation damage, and the degradation of scenic beauty. The background is a natural, gritty texture of small rocks and bits of soil, in warm earthy tones that complement the color of the sign. There's little variation in the color palette, consisting mostly of browns and subtle shades of orange, emphasizing the natural and undisturbed environment being protected.","title":"According to park superintendent dave wilson, the number one environmental problem in the canyonlands is off-road use of vehicles.  Because of the thin ground cover and scarce rain, tracks are visible for many years.
