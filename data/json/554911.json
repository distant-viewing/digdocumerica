{"path":"554911.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph portrays two young individuals engaged in an intimate moment outdoors. On the left, there is a young woman with long, flowing blonde hair accessorized with a light blue headband. Her expression is serene, with closed eyes and slightly parted lips as she focuses on the moment. She interacts closely with the person on the right, who appears to be lighting a small pipe that the woman is presumably about to inhale from.\n\nThe person on the right has shoulder-length dark hair, held back from their face, and dons a casual striped t-shirt. Their face is turned inwards towards the blonde woman, focusing on the task at hand, illustrating a moment of shared connection.\n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring lush green trees and what appears to be a large, textured tree trunk to the left, suggesting this interaction is taking place in a quiet, secluded park or wooded area, providing a natural and peaceful setting. The overall ambiance is calm and somewhat private, emphasizing a candid and potentially reflective moment between two individuals.","title":"Boy and girl smoking pot during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas.
