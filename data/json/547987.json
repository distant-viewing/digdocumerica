{"path":"547987.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph encapsulates a sense of camaraderie between two elderly men standing in a rugged, industrial outdoor setting. The two men are posing closely together, both wearing work attire that includes caps and jackets, suggesting they may be workers or overseeing the site featured in the background.\n\nThe setting appears to be an expansive industrial or construction site, evidenced by the heavy machinery and equipment surrounding the area. On the left side of the frame, there's a partial view of a yellow machine, possibly a truck or some construction equipment, distinguished by its robust, utilitarian build and muddy tires. Behind the men is another large vehicle, colored in white and yellow, contributing to the notion this is a construction or industrial zone.\n\nThe ground is uneven, muddy, and scattered with various debris, enhancing the impression of an active work site. The backdrop shows an open field that looks overworked or under renovation, with posts sticking out irregularly from the ground. The atmosphere is overcast, adding a grey tone to the overall image and emphasizing a no-frills, hardworking environment.\n\nAdditionally, a bird is captured in mid-flight in the upper center of the photo, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static and muddy scenery. This inclusion subtly injects a hint of natural life into a predominantly mechanical and human-made environment.","title":"Workers at site of controversial landfill operation on Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543651","547160","544969","555563","556893","556868","556903","556447","556866","549947","556391","545661","556339","556503","556322","542989"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["site","construction","notion","no","renovation","build","inclusion","camaraderie","equipment","work"]}
