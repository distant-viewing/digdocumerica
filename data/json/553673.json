{"path":"553673.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a densely populated urban area, characterized by numerous high-rise buildings, possibly in a large metropolitan city. The buildings vary in height, color, and architectural style, suggesting a mix of residential and commercial functions. Most buildings are modern with rectangular and square designs, predominantly in shades of beige, white, and gray, reflecting common urban construction materials such as concrete and glazing.\n\nThe majority of the visible buildings in the foreground are high-rise residential condominiums or apartment complexes with balconies, while the background fades into more of the cityscape with similarly structured buildings. There is no visible horizon line, but the city extends to the edges of the photograph, illustrating the vastness of the urban area.\n\nIn terms of vegetation, there are some trees and green areas interspersed between some buildings, particularly noticeable at lower levels near streets or on terraces, adding a bit of natural relief to the otherwise concrete and steel environment. The streets, although not very prominently visible, show typical urban setting elements like small moving vehicles, indicating activity and life within the city.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a perception of a bustling, congested urban environment that combines living and business spaces closely packed together, typical of a major city setting.","title":"Massed highrises of Waikiki district, favorite of tourists seen from top of Diamond Head, the famous extinct volcano. The Waikiki Improvement Association has formed an architectural design review board to oversee such building, but it is probably too late. In 1963 there were 9,203 hotel rooms in all of Oahu Island. Today there are some 26,000 rooms, most of them here in Waikiki.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["548424","549476","548425","555743","548364","551509","548374","549477","551506","549971","549979","556180","551510","546579","552394","553674"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","building","rise","relief","terrace","majority","street","apartment","term","balcony"]}
