{"path":"551834.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features three individuals sitting at a table, likely in an outdoor cafe setting, positioned behind what appears to be a wooden railing. The three individuals are viewed from the outside, looking in through the railing.\n\nThe person on the left, who looks relatively younger, with short light-colored hair and glasses, is wearing a cream or light-colored jacket. The middle individual, possibly male, with dark rimmed glasses, appears more mature and is dressed in a dark suit or jacket. He also is wearing glasses and seems to be looking down, possibly focusing on a menu or table. The person on the right, a woman with dark brown hair, is wearing a light blue blouse and is turned slightly towards the individual in the center.\n\nThe background of the scene shows a bustling shopping area with pedestrians walking by. The architecture is grand with ornate details and large windows; a building sign reads \"STSATTE AUGUS\" which is possibly a truncated version of a store name or location. Above the café, a hanging flower basket and a street light add a welcoming ambiance.\n\nAlso notable in the composition is a bright red object with a logo, partially obscuring the view through the café's railing. This could be a part of street furniture like a post or bollard, contributing to the urban café scene. The overall mood of the photo is everyday city life, capturing a moment of these individuals perhaps discussing or waiting for their meal in a lively urban area.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
