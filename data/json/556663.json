{"path":"556663.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a subway station, specifically identified as the 86th Street station, likely in New York City. The setting is a subway platform which appears slightly disheveled and dimly lit by overhead fluorescent lights that stretch along the platform. The platform is partly crowded with several passengers waiting. On the left, there is a seated group of people including a woman with a shopping cart full of belongings, depicting a sense of everyday life and possibly long waits or tiredness from travel.\n\nThere are also advertisements hanging on the subway wall, typical of a metro setting, promoting a film named \"Foxes\" starring Jodie Foster, adding to the ambiance of the urban environment and providing a hint about the time period, likely late 1970s or early 1980s based on the movie poster.\n\nA man stands on the right side of the frame, near a column where the platform number \"86\" is prominently displayed. He is dressed casually in a light jacket and pants, looking down the tracks, perhaps awaiting the arrival of a train.\n\nIn the background, the headlights of an approaching train illuminate the tracks, creating a bright contrast to the generally murky atmosphere of the station. The approach of the train adds a sense of motion and expectation to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a typical moment in a city's busy public transport system, capturing both the mundanity and the minor dramas of urban commuting.","title":"Passengers wait for a Lexington avenue line subway on one of the platforms of the New York city transit authority.
