{"path":"550190.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a misty or smoggy cityscape, possibly taken during the early morning or on a cloudy day. The skyline is dominated by a variety of buildings, including what appears to be a tall skyscraper with a spire, standing prominent as the focal point in the composition. The city is nestled under a blanket of grey clouds, contributing to a somewhat muted and hazy atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, a more suburban area can be seen, featuring green trees and a fenced park or sports area, which is contrasted starkly against the urban backdrop. Notably, the area includes a playground and an open field, bordered on one side by a road lined with street lamps. The visibility is somewhat low due to the atmospheric conditions affecting the clarity and color fidelity of the distant buildings.\n\nThe overall composition of the image strikes a balance between nature and urban development, depicting how human habitation stretches from dense urban centers to more open, suburban environments. The photograph may be interpreted as a commentary on environmental issues, urban spread, or simply as a depiction of a city on a foggy day.","title":"Cleveland skyline in the smog of July 20, 1973, day of pollution alert","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545499","548385","549620","550178","548360","549970","552394","548384","548334","557271","548365","544791","550186","551141","550202","548339"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["playground","commentary","spire","spread","city","blanket","balance","depiction","habitation","clarity"]}
