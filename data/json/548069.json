{"path":"548069.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a large industrial hook and chain, silhouetted against a blue sky with scattered clouds. The hook and chain, evidently part of a crane or lifting apparatus, dominate the foreground, displayed against a softly blurred background. The hook, with its robust and curved form, and the chain, made up of heavy, interlinked metal rings, are slightly rusted, emphasizing a sense of utilitarianism and frequent usage.\n\nIn the background, across a calm body of water, there is a shoreline visible, marked by industrial structures. A complex with tall smokestacks releases plumes into the sky, suggesting it might be a factory or power plant. This setting likely indicates a port or industrial zone, where such equipment would be common for loading and unloading heavy materials. The overall lighting in the image is soft, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, and gives the industrial scene a somewhat serene atmosphere despite the inherent ruggedness of the equipment and the operation suggested by the presence of the industrial hook and chains.","title":"Grappling iron of ship at dock at Rainier, Oregon, on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547615","547223","550874","547113","549592","551563","555269","547579","544127","545979","550910","555809","553027","545655","555285","551954"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["hook","chain","ring","loading","equipment","ruggedness","usage","apparatus","port","plume"]}
