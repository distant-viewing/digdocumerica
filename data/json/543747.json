{"path":"543747.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a shadowy, silhouetted figure standing amidst a dimly lit woodland scene. The environment is filled with trees and underbrush, the details of which are mostly hidden in the low light except for hints illuminated by a subtle, natural backlighting, which may be sunlight. The predominant feeling is moody and slightly mystic due to the streams of smoke or mist weaving through the trees, catching the faint light as it filters through the leaves above. The ground is covered in what appears to be dry leaves or small twigs, reflecting a natural, forest floor.\n\nThe silhouette, likely that of a person, stands contemplatively with their back towards the viewer, facing the direction of the light and smoke, contributing to an air of mystery or introspection. The setting and composition of the image, with the play of light and shadow, smoke, and natural elements, give it a serene yet slightly eerie quality, suggesting a moment captured deep in a forest or wooded area, separated from the bustle of everyday life.","title":"Early morning at the Golden Gate Campground, part of the Colorado State Park system","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["553625","557601","543021","554956","542929","542926","553620","542931","542932","542849","553578","553579","543406","554395","554998","554394"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["smoke","underbrush","leave","introspection","backlighting","bustle","twig","forest","light","mystery"]}
