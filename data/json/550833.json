{"path":"550833.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene in a pastoral setting. In the foreground, three cattle, their coats a blend of indistinct shades of brown and white, graze peacefully on a vibrant green grass field. The animals are scattered across the field, with one closer to the left, partially framed by the dark green leaves of a tree that occupies the top corner of the image.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a broad expanse of marshland or wetland, characterized by patches of water reflecting sunlight and interspersed with grassy areas. This wetland provides a textured contrast to the smooth and ordered foreground where the cattle graze.\n\nThe background consists of a line of trees and beyond them, gently rolling hills that fade into a soft-focus horizon, suggesting a vast, open landscape beyond the immediate pictured area. The sky above is slightly overcast, with soft, diffuse light bathing the scene, enhancing the serene, bucolic mood of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its layers of landscape - from the detailed foreground to the blurred background - and its calm, pastoral elements, evokes a sense of peace and the simplicity of rural life.","title":"Not far from its source in central Wisconsin the fox river passes through scenes of pastoral tranquillity","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["542626","546102","557022","542627","542628","557749","545153","544535","555645","554560","554071","557012","552566","548984","543318","549027"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cattle","graze","wetland","marshland","fake","peace","field","grassy","diffuse","bath"]}
