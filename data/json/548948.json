{"path":"548948.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is a high-altitude aerial view of a landscape at night. The image appears somewhat blurry, possibly because of motion or low light conditions, giving it a slightly ghostly greenish tinge overall.\n\nThe landscape below shows a combination of industrial areas and agricultural plots. A prominent winding river bisects the scene, illuminated by the ambient light, and is surrounded by various land plots that seem to be in different states of useâ€”some are empty, while others are filled with crops or material, radiating hues of red and white. These plots are arranged in a geometric pattern, creating an organized yet colorful patchwork.\n\nAdjacent to the river, there are clusters of bright lights indicating built-up industrial areas. These areas show structures and possibly storage tanks that give off significant artificial lighting, standing out against the darker surroundings.\n\nTowards the edges and corners of the photograph, the terrain fades into darkness, leading to a greater urban or natural area beyond the reach of the visible lights. The general ambiance is serene yet industrial, with human influence clearly visible in the structuring and usage of the land. No human presence is visible in the picture, with the focus entirely on the illuminated patterns and the snaking river cutting through the terrain.","title":"The Colorado river feeds crops and vegetation (dark areas) town of needles in foreground","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543734","543735","555783","548943","545100","548931","545913","545042","553668","543004","547724","550638","545144","545646","551174","550392"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["plot","river","radiat","urban","bisect","patchwork","tinge","illuminated","land","winding"]}
