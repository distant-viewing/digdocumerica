{"path":"547076.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image depicts a man standing in front of a large mound of coal. He is leaning on a shovel and dressed in work attire, consisting of a long, dark, oil-stained coat and a cap. A patch is visible on the jacket, perhaps indicating his name or the company he works for. His expression is gentle, with a subtle smile, and he appears to be taking a pause from his work.\n\nThe background features a brick wall with a faded sign that includes a phone number, hinting at an industrial or urban setting. The ground is concrete and scattered with bits of coal and debris, suggesting the area is used for heavy, possibly manual labor.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of rest in a labor-intensive environment, highlighting the individual's role in his work setting.","title":"Coal delivery in Chicago's North Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547108","556345","556337","558312","556428","556342","556343","542783","556599","556391","556346","553618","556357","556320","556338","556344"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["coal","labor","work","pause","phone","shovel","company","oil","smile","mound"]}
