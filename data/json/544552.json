{"path":"544552.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a lush agricultural setting. It features a large crop field that slopes slightly, filled with rows of green plants. At the forefront of the image, there is a distinct demarcation; part of the field has crops whereas the other part is bare and plowed, giving a textural contrast. There are two vehicles parked on the dirt road that runs parallel to the fields, and at least one person can be seen, possibly engaged in agricultural activities.\n\nIn the background, there is a mix of open fields and clusters of suburban development. Several buildings, including large industrial or farm storage structures, can be clearly seen, hinting at a rural community with some level of industrial activity. Trees sporadically dot the landscape, and the area is flat, extending far into the horizon where a faint bluish haze suggests distance.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a comprehensive view of an orchestrated agricultural landscape, balancing nature and human activity, possibly in a region devoted to farming and light industry. The sky, mostly clear, suggests good weather, enhancing the vibrant green of the crops.","title":"Vegetable farming","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["554029","554030","552466","554055","548820","548907","558414","548296","554015","542708","544548","552858","553698","549094","544481","557517"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","field","demarcation","plow","farming","farm","forefront","balance","haze","industry"]}
