{"path":"552978.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful, sunny day at a lakeside beach, set against a stunning backdrop of distant snow-capped mountains. The scene unfolds on the edge of a calm, expansive lake under a clear, blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of people is enjoying leisurely activities on the grassy shore. There are four people sitting or lying on colorful beach towels. They appear relaxed, some are facing towards the water, and one is sitting up, possibly engaging in a conversation with a friend.\n\nFurther towards the water, two individuals are standing on the pebbly beach. One of them is in a playful pose, seemingly throwing a stone into the lake. The other one, closer to the shore, stands upright and looks over the water.\n\nTo the right side of the image, there is another person who walks along the shore, their silhouette outlined by the bright reflection on the water. Near them, a large wooden structure, possibly a dock or pier, extends into the lake, supporting a small building at its end.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and idyllic, inviting viewers to appreciate the natural beauty and tranquility of the lakeside setting.","title":"(from the documerica-1 exhibition.
