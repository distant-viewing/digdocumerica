{"path":"554158.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a prominent foreground element, a sign with text reading \"REGISTERED HOTEL GUESTS ONLY PLEASE.\" The sign is oval-shaped and appears to be mounted on a pole or stand, which is visible on the left side of the image. The text on the sign is oriented in three lines, with a decorative four-leaf clover design beside the word \"ONLY.\" The sign and its text are slightly out of focus, adding a soft effect to the overall look.\n\nThe background is blurred, suggesting a shallow depth of field used during the photograph. Despite the blur, some details can be discernedâ€”appearing to be an outdoor setting possibly within hotel grounds. There is a hint of green foliage, and specks of pink and white that might be flowers or other decorative elements typical of a landscaped area. The light conditions suggest it might be daytime with ample natural light contributing to the bright and somewhat overexposed background.\n\nOverall, the composition uses selective focus to draw attention to the sign, relegating the background to a secondary role that provides contextual hints but no distinct details.","title":"Maunce kea beach hotel, near Kamuela, is located on one of the few sandy beaches in all of Hawaii.
