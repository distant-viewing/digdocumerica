{"path":"551767.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view from a park setting, looking out onto an urban cityscape, likely captured from a park such as Central Park in New York City. The foreground is composed of a lush green meadow bordered by blooming trees and sporadic shrubbery. The grass is speckled with patches of brown and flecks of fallen leaves that suggest it might be either late summer or early autumn.\n\nFramed by the natural archway of tree branches and leaves in the upper part of the image, a group of people can be seen leisurely enjoying the park. They appear seated on the grass, forming a small, informal gathering, which contributes to the calm and recreational atmosphere of the park.\n\nIn stark contrast to the natural and serene foreground, the background prominently features a panorama of towering skyscrapers. Among these buildings, the Essex House, a well-known hotel and residential building, is clearly visible, marked by its prominent signage at the top. This juxtaposition of the bustling city life against the peaceful park setting effectively captures the dual character of urban environments where nature and architecture coexist closely.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the intersection of natural and man-made environments, making this a visually appealing and thought-provoking photograph.","title":"Central park offers countless nooks where quiet and solitude may be enjoyed","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553469","548406","557271","557257","548394","549516","550075","547707","547784","551776","544808","550074","551756","551653","551652","551685"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["park","fleck","panorama","think","blooming","archway","provoke","hotel","fallen","coexist"]}
