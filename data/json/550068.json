{"path":"550068.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene, likely at a marketplace or fair with diverse activities occurring. In the foreground, a man is seen engaged in an activity with a vase or jug, possibly evaluating it for purchase or sale. He wears a striped, short-sleeved shirt and appears absorbed in his task.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a line of tables arrayed with various ceramic items, including bowls, pots, and jugs, suggesting a pottery sale or exhibition. An individual, presumably a vendor, is sitting behind the table, and two children are inspecting the items closely, indicating an interactive aspect to the display.\n\nIn the background, there is a substantial fountain, creating a lively and pleasant ambiance with water jets rising into the air. Several people, including both adults and children, are around and in the distant part of the fountain area, enjoying the sunny day and the refreshing water scenery which adds a recreational feel to the setting.\n\nAdditionally, the setting is outdoors on what appears to be a sunny day, contributing to the relaxed, leisurely atmosphere of the scene, making it a typical warm-weather public gathering space where people come to enjoy the outdoors and engage in community commerce and social interaction.","title":"Ceramic show on the mall, Cleveland's civic center.
