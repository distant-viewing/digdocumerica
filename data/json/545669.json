{"path":"545669.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures an environmental activity, specifically involving a water-cleanup or containment operation. Two individuals are seen on a small blue motorboat navigating a muddy river. They are wearing helmets and handling a long, flexible containment boom, which is orange and white-striped, extending into the water. The boom, likely used to limit the spread of pollutants, snakes from the shore into the river and is partially submerged, showing signs of wear or soiling.\n\nThe setting is a vast, open landscape under a cloudy sky. The riverbanks feature barren soil and sparse vegetation, suggesting a remote or semi-arid region. In the background, there are layered rock formations and a flattop mountain that provide a dramatic backdrop to the scene. The overall atmosphere is gloomy, likely due to overcast weather conditions which also suggest a cool or temperate climate.\n\nThe shore is rocky and uneven, adding to the rugged nature of the terrain. The image communicates a sense of urgent environmental intervention, showing efforts to manage or mitigate an ecological issue in a natural setting.","title":"Oil slick on the San Juan river just above log boom.  A burst pipeline at Shiprock, New Mexico, spilled about 285,000 gallons of crude oil.  The oil flowed downstream more than 200 miles before the booms contained it.
