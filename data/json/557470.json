{"path":"557470.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene, dominated by a sweeping view of a long beach viewed from a high cliff. On the left side of the image, a man stands on the edge of the cliff, dressed in a dark military-like uniform, complete with a peaked cap. He looks out over the ocean, giving the impression of contemplation or observation.\n\nThe beach itself extends into the distance towards an indistinct horizon, with gentle waves breaking along the shoreline. The cliff where the man stands is covered in dense, dried brown vegetation, perhaps succulents or scrub typical to the coastal environment, which also fringes the edge of the beach. The overall mood is somewhat melancholic and introspective, emphasized by the overcast, misty sky and the soft, muted colors of the scene. The ocean and the sky blend in a wash of greyish-blues and pale colors, enhancing the tranquility and isolation conveyed by the photograph.","title":"A marine patrols the shoreline at his camp Pendleton. Limited public access has allowed the area to retain much of its natural beauty. There are some 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay) in the state. Of this total 662 miles or 61 percent are privately owned; the remaining amount of 410 miles is public property controlled by federal, state, county and local authorities. Of the 145 miles under federal control 47 miles are open to the public.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["543237","545222","543252","543085","546953","543300","543078","543244","547612","543249","543090","545106","547943","555400","545280","542976"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","beach","ocean","wash","observation","edge","contemplation","uniform","shoreline","cap"]}
