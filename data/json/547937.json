{"path":"547937.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a collection of weathered and rusted mooring buoys, primarily in a foreground setting. The buoys, which are large spherical objects, show signs of significant wear and exposure to the elements, with chipped paint and rust patches visible on their surfaces. Some are marked with numbers and symbols, indicating possible use for maritime navigation or mooring points. They are piled up haphazardly on a wood and concrete waterfront, accompanied by ropes and chains that are likely used to secure them to docks or ships.\n\nIn the background, there is a calm body of water with several boats moored at a pier extending into the water. The boats appear small and are mostly recreational. The sky above is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The setting gives the impression of a working or industrial harbor area, possibly utilized for fishing or small-scale maritime activities. The overall composition captures a rustic maritime scene, evoking a sense of the oceanfront's working life, paired with the natural aging of equipment used in such environments.","title":"Old buoys on wharf in Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550306","548788","547594","546939","551978","548105","548688","542911","544672","549306","547941","547581","547548","548547","548078","548740"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["mooring","buoy","rust","chipp","aging","navigation","use","symbol","secure","accompany"]}
