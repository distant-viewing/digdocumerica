{"path":"546543.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a modern building viewed from across a broad expanse of lush, green grass. The foreground is dominated by a well-maintained lawn, which leads up to the building in the background. The building itself has a long, horizontal architecture with a flat roof and features an expansive glass facade through which some interior details like yellow furnishings are visible. Supporting the glass are slender, vertical columns, likely metallic, that segment the facade evenly. It appears to be a single-story structure with a very open and airy feel, fostering a sense of transparency and integration with the surrounding environment. The setting suggests a relatively serene, possibly academic or corporate campus with modern design principles emphasizing functionality and minimalism. No people are visible in the image, adding to the sense of quietude and focus on architectural and natural elements.","title":"The Republic (local newspaper), built in 1971","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546464","546456","546473","548866","546460","546481","546702","546531","546415","546448","546539","544565","546542","546506","542593","556625"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["campus","foster","facade","furnishing","glass","integration","quietude","functionality","segment","lawn"]}
