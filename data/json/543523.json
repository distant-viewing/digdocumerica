{"path":"543523.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a fluid, mud-like substance, likely a mixture of water and soil, moving or swirling on the ground. The texture seems viscous and wet, with hues of brown and hints of red, giving it an earthen appearance. The mud's surface is uneven, with ripples and folds that suggest motion and liquidity. Scattered across the surface are small, shiny particles, possibly mineral specks or water droplets, reflecting light and adding a sparkled look to the muddy mix.\n\nThe immediate surrounding area is similarly muddied, featuring transient patterns possibly formed by the movement of water or an earlier disturbance in the mud. There is a visible inclusion of small debris, like twigs or vegetative fragments, adding to the natural, outdoor setting of the scenario. No human activity or animals are visible in this specific frame, focusing entirely on the natural elements and the texture and movement of the mud within a possibly larger wetland or flood area.","title":"Scum on lake caused by siltation","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552983","550837","548089","544992","545850","544858","554347","552066","554778","555545","544762","553582","553581","555559","555626","547422"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["mud","fold","fluid","particle","inclusion","flood","movement","twig","speck","droplet"]}
