{"path":"547981.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a row of stately, historical houses. The architecture of these houses suggests they are likely from the late 19th or early 20th century. The main building in the foreground is a two-story structure painted in a light yellow shade with white trim. It features a prominent mansard roof with black shingles and has several dormer windows. Each window on the structure has dark green shutters.\n\nThe house's front porch is covered, with a rounded arch entranceway and is supported by columns painted in dark blue or black. The porch railing is ornate, possibly made of iron, and matches the columns in color. The steps leading to the porch are white, adding a contrasting touch to the overall coloring.\n\nTo the right and in the background are similar houses lined up along the street, all displaying the same architectural style and color scheme. Their roofs, trim, and porch designs are highly consistent with the first, creating a harmonious appearance among them.\n\nThe lawn in front of these buildings is well-maintained, with lush green grass. The sky above is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day. This setting appears peaceful and well cared for, reflecting perhaps a residential area meant for affluent occupants at the time of its construction. The buildings seem to potentially belong to a historic district or a specifically preserved part of a town, considering their uniform style and pristine condition.","title":"\"officers' row\" at fort hancock, Sandy Hook","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["558155","548470","555889","558160","548667","547335","557076","555912","546439","555920","558156","546433","548471","558152","551629","557094"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","column","trim","pain","19th","first","iron","reound","mean"]}
