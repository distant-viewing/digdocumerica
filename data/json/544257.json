{"path":"544257.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic outdoor scene featuring a young girl standing near a small roadside stall. The girl, who has a cheerful expression, is wearing a light-colored dress and is barefoot. The stall is constructed with a combination of wooden planks and poles, and it has a corrugated metal roof that extends over the area where the girl stands, offering some shade and shelter.\n\nThe stall is displaying various fruits and products for sale. Visible on and around the stall are several crates and cartons with labels such as \"Coca-Cola,\" \"Sunshine Krispy Ritz,\" and other fruit and food brand names. There are also large, uncut melons placed at strategic selling points on the stall. One of the crates prominently shows pecans for sale, as indicated by a handwritten sign that reads \"Pecan For Sale.\"\n\nThe background offers a glimpse of rural life with dense trees and foliages, and parts of a wooden structure, possibly part of the stall or a nearby building, can be seen. The environment around the stall is gravelly, with no paved roads visible, capturing a quaint and country-like atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of simple, rural livelihood, with the focus being on the freshness and homespun quality of the goods for sale, as emphasized by the natural and informal setup of the stall and its surroundings. The girlâ€™s pleasant demeanor adds a friendly and welcoming touch to the scene.","title":"Vegetable stand","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544261","557757","544192","544265","553813","556546","554036","556215","551838","555377","556454","551116","550041","557756","553097","551690"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["stall","girl","sale","fruit","crate","freshness","country","offer","sell","quaint"]}
