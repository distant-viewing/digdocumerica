{"path":"542689.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays three potted plants closely positioned together, each within their own black plastic pots. The pots appear to be filled with rich, dark soil, and each contains a cluster of tall, narrow leaves which are predominantly green with some featuring a lighter shade possibly due to lighting. \n\nThe plants are shown in a close-up view, and they exhibit erect, slender green leaves, some of which have a slightly drooping tip. The texture of the leaves seems smooth and there are no visible flowersâ€”only the foliage is showcased.\n\nPositioned within each pot, there appears to be a small, white, rectangular label made of a thin material, perhaps plastic or wood, marking perhaps for species identification or planting date, although the details on the tags are not discernible.\n\nThe background of the photograph is slightly blurred, suggesting it was taken with a shallow depth of field. This part of the image features what seems to be an outdoor setting with a concrete surface that could be part of a patio or garden walkway. The subdued color palette and soft natural lighting suggest the photograph might have been taken during the early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Smog-damaged plant at the statewide air pollution research center, university of California.
