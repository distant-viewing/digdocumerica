{"path":"557324.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting with a complex assemblage of objects and architectural elements. Central to the image is a structure made of dark brown wooden beams forming an intricate geometrical pattern, which appears to be part of a dome-like structure or greenhouse framework. Transparent plastic sheeting, possibly serving as a covering, is stretched over parts of this wooden frame.\n\nPiled within and beneath this framework are numerous black plastic pipes with a ribbed texture, which are seemingly discarded or stored in this area. These pipes vary in size and are stacked haphazardly, intertwining with the architectural elements.\n\nThe natural light coming from outside suggests the setting might be in a greenhouse or a similar structure used for storage or agricultural purposes. The light filters through the translucent plastic, casting soft illumination and shadows within the space. The background is obscured but hints of an outdoor setting are visible through the transparent sections of the encompassing material. The environment is blurred, suggesting it might be covered in snow, hinting at a cold or wintery season outside.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes a sense of abandonment or disuse, with focus on the interplay of organic (wood) and synthetic (plastic) materials under a canopy-like structure amidst a natural setting.","title":"Solar greenhouse owned and built by peter howell, located at about the 8,500 level in the front range","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["545982","544281","555304","556324","546767","555167","556351","557325","554622","552102","557976","546156","546189","546757","556353","555364"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["greenhouse","plastic","framework","pipe","rib","intertwin","disuse","dome","discard","material"]}
