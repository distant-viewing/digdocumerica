{"path":"547224.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil aquatic scene, which is centered around a floating white buoy-like structure in a body of calm water. The structure appears cylindrical and industrial, with various equipment mounted on it; it seems primarily functional rather than aesthetic. It casts a crisp reflection in the water, which adds to the serene atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there appears to be a cityscape or a densely built area just beyond the waterfront. The architectural landscape consists of several low-rise buildings, exhibiting a mix of utility and residential features. Some buildings have terraces, others have multiple windows, and one noticeable building in the center has an intricate white dome, giving off a slightly more distinguished architectural vibe compared to the others. These buildings are diverse in design yet unified by their horizontal spread across the frame. The sky is clear and bright blue, which indicates a sunny day. A solitary seagull is flying above the water, adding a slight dynamic element to the otherwise still scenario.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a peaceful urban waterfront setting, likely intended to highlight the interaction between industry and the natural environment around the waterway.","title":"Filtration unit at Blue Plains sewage treatment plant","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555731","549303","549304","547109","552717","546886","547677","555807","550014","545979","550937","546865","546823","552040","552139","553352"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterfront","terrace","seagull","buoy","spread","other","dome","building","scenario","waterway"]}
