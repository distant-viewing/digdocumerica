{"path":"547722.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an artistic and somewhat abstract representation of an automobile, possibly taken during a commercial shoot or an exhibit due to its stylized nature. The car is photographed from a low angle, emphasizing a dramatic and dynamic silhouette.\n\nThe vehicle in the image is captured in a way that most of its body and design are obscured by darkness, leaving only the outlines and some details highlighted. There's a clear focus on the vehicle’s rear, with an illuminated trunk showing its open doors and contents vividly against the darker surroundings. Inside the trunk, there are visible documents or promotional materials neatly arranged, which could suggest a promotional or sales-oriented setting.\n\nThere appears to be a spotlight illuminating the rear and inside of the car, and the background fades into a deep blue to purple gradient, enhancing the car's futuristic or high-end feel. The overall atmosphere is moody and focused, with sharp contrasts between light and shadow.\n\nThe framing involves two blurry, diagonal elements in the foreground, possibly due to the camera being partially shielded or shot through some slots or an object—adding a mysterious or avant-garde overlay to the scene. This creative approach to photography ensures the focus remains on specific elements of the car, suggesting a blend of art and automotive showcasing.","title":"Abstract of a new mazda car waiting shipment at Terminal Island","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557847","556703","542636","557848","554384","555476","552800","557874","557917","552787","548435","557052","554376","554920","557891","557908"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["shoot","car","trunk","spotlight","shield","representation","contents","automobile","ensure","art"]}
