{"path":"546860.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy scene at a port. The primary focus is a large cargo ship named \"American Alliance\", docked at the pier. The ship’s hull is predominantly dark, possibly black up front, turning light closer to the stern, with the ship’s name clearly visible in white lettering.\n\nAdjacent to the cargo ship are tall, industrial shipping cranes structured with steel beams. These cranes are equipped with various signs including ones that read \"PASSED APPRENTICES ONLY\" and \"MARYLAND PORT ADMINISTRATION\". The cranes are mounted on rails allowing them to move along the dock and handle containers.\n\nThe dock itself is concrete, with visible bollards and ropes securing the ship. There are several people seen on the dock, likely dock workers or crew members, engaged in various activities related to the operations of loading or unloading and general maintenance of the shipping area.\n\nIn the background, additional containers and possibly other maritime or port infrastructure can be discerned. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a soft light over the entire scene, which gives the photograph a utilitarian and robust industrial feel typical of a working commercial port.","title":"Bethlehem Steel workers at the Sparrows Point shipyard for the launching of the new tanker \"Chevron Hawaii.\"","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555260","546804","546828","546881","546934","548125","555270","553740","546850","555283","548127","551558","547474","552303","546894","551582"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","dock","port","crane","shipping","cargo","container","bollard","unloading","loading"]}
