{"path":"545268.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial area viewed from a higher vantage point, possibly a hill or a higher building, partially obscured by foreground vegetation. The atmosphere is filled with a heavy presence of smoke or haze, implying air pollution, which tints the entire scene in a pinkish-purple hue, likely due to the time of day (either dawn or dusk) contributing to the coloration.\n\nIn the foreground, small branches and leaves are silhouetted and appear dark against the lighter background, adding texture and a sense of depth to the image. The middle ground is populated with various industrial structures, including buildings and smokestacks, some of which are emitting plumes of smoke. The density and layout of these structures suggest a busy and heavily industrialized area.\n\nIn the background, the details become hazier but more industrial features are visible, including what appears to be a body of water, possibly a river or a harbor, which hosts more industrial activity. There are reflections on the water that indicate the presence of lights, perhaps from the nearby facilities or vessels. The overall ambience is one of a somber industrial landscape, with pollution being a prominent theme, impacting both the environment and the visual clarity of the scene.","title":"Smog blankets Tacoma harbor","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547539","545239","557225","551054","550181","547084","545447","550725","544999","547122","545265","546862","543001","550172","551140","551567"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["pollution","smoke","ambience","coloration","harbor","clarity","density","vantage","plume","vessel"]}
