{"path":"547396.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, a man stands in a livestock pen observing a sheep. The man, likely a farmer, is wearing a light blue and white checkered short-sleeve shirt, matching blue pants, a brown leather belt with a noticeable buckle, and a brown cowboy hat adorned with small decorative elements. The hat casts a shadow over his face that obscures his eyes, giving him a somewhat introspective or focused expression.\n\nThe farmer stands on a dirt-covered floor typical of a livestock handling area. He appears relaxed yet attentive, with his arms hanging loosely by his sides. A metal fence is partially visible behind him, and a simple wooden structure can be seen in the background.\n\nA lone sheep is in the foreground of the image. It has a thick wool coat that suggests it might be a breed raised for wool production. The sheep shows signs of recent shearing with patches of shorter wool. It is turning its head, possibly reacting to the presence of the farmer or simply moving about its pen.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph gives it a slightly dim, warm hue, adding to the rustic and pastoral feel of the scene. The overall setting suggests a farming environment focused on livestock management, possibly taken during a routine check or feeding time.","title":"At the annual lamb sale at Seward County Fairgrounds lambs are sold mostly to youngsters for 4-H club showings.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["554883","554880","544391","554894","547326","554882","554886","552568","552573","543690","554881","554884","548952","552677","548959","554892"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["wool","farmer","sheep","livestock","pen","buckle","breed","react","leather","feed"]}
