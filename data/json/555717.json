{"path":"555717.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and vast body of water under a hazy or foggy sky, creating a serene and somewhat monochromatic scene. The water has subtle ripples and a reflection that suggests a calm surface, tinted with various shades of purple and pink presumably due to the lighting conditions like a setting or rising sun. The horizon is nearly indiscernible, blending seamlessly into the sky which contributes to a sense of endlessness and peace.\n\nThere are no prominent features like boats or people disrupting the water's surface, though there might be a slight hint of a small object on the horizon which could be a distant ship or buoy â€” it's too small to clearly distinguish. The overall feel is one of simplicity and quietude, encouraging a viewer to pause and absorb the calmness of the scene. This composition emphasizes vastness, the subtle interplay of light and the minimalist beauty found in nature.","title":"Smog on the Bight 13 miles offshore near the sludge dumping grounds.
