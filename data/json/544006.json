{"path":"544006.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph portrays an outdoor scenic view focused on a recreational area by a large body of water, likely a lake. In the foreground, you see a sandy shore that wraps around a cove with dark blue water. There are several groups of people engaging in leisure activities; some appear to be swimming or floating in the water with the help of red inflatables, while others are standing or walking along the shore. Several boats are anchored near the shore, with one larger sailboat moored at a dock extending into the lake.\n\nIn the middle ground, diverse vehicles are parked near the water, some towing boat trailers. This suggests the presence of a boat launch area or a parking space designated for visitors partaking in water-related activities.\n\nThe background is dominated by a rugged hillside implying a mountainous region. The vegetation on the hills is sparse, typical of an arid or semi-arid environment, and the sky is clear and sunny, indicative of good weather conditions, likely conducive for outdoor recreational activities.\n\nVisually, the photo captures the appeal of outdoor water recreation, showcasing an interaction between people and the environment in a serene, enticing setting.","title":"Labor Day boaters and swimmers enjoy the holiday at Lake Pleasant.","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544002","544025","558233","544442","554476","549934","549939","546856","548002","549088","543998","555386","546397","554485","543518","553133"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["shore","boat","cove","water","help","lake","appeal","recreation","trailer","sailboat"]}
