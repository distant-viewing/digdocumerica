{"path":"549212.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph portrays a dramatic and moody rural landscape under an overcast sky. A sleek windmill stands prominently on a silhouette of a hillside towards the right-hand side of the frame. The windmill, with its classic design featuring a tail and blades, is mounted atop a tall, narrow metal tower. Along with the windmill, there are several utility poles carrying power lines that extend across the landscape and disappear into the horizon on the left side of the image.\n\nThe sky itself is a major element in this composition, filled with dark, imposing clouds suggesting an impending storm or late evening light. This sets a somber tone, accentuated by the minimalistic and dark silhouette of the landscape. The hill's contour creates a gentle slope that cuts diagonally across the frame, and the dark foreground sharply contrasts with the textured sky. These features together create a scene that evokes a sense of isolation and the expansive nature of rural environments.","title":"Windmill and power lines near the dave johnston power plant","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["549213","549216","549210","545832","549211","547283","545848","545852","555291","547347","547345","543728","545828","549217","547293","553820"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["windmill","silhouette","disappear","blade","tail","storm","hillside","contour","accentuate","tower"]}
