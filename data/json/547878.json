{"path":"547878.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image depicts a cluttered urban area overwhelmed with trash. The primary focus is a large pile of garbage accumulating in what looks like an alley or a similar outdoor space. The garbage includes numerous white plastic bags, some visibly filled with miscellaneous waste, and others torn open with their contents partially spilling out. Among the visible trash, there are several cardboard boxes, one noticeably reads \"TOMATOES.\"\n\nIn addition to the garbage bags and boxes, there's a large, dark-colored dumpster that is also overflowing, its contents reaching far beyond its capacity. The ground is littered with scattered pieces of broken glass, loose papers, smaller pieces of debris, and bricks, contributing to a generally unkempt and neglected appearance of the space.\n\nThe background includes a glimpse of a building with exposed bricks and what appears to be a metal barrier or partial fencing. The setting suggests an industrial or old residential area. The bright sunlight emphasizes the textures and details of the piled-up waste, accentuating the vividness and chaotic nature of the scene.","title":"Garbage outside a seafood restaurant in Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549833","549840","549739","545506","545494","557307","543824","549839","548214","549746","549747","549750","550801","553039","550798","544298"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","content","trash","box","bag","waste","dumpster","tomato","brick","pile"]}
