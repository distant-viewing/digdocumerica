{"path":"550835.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment of two individuals boating in a calm body of water. The scene is set against a lush, natural backdrop under an overcast sky. The boat is a small, simple rowboat and appears to be made of metal. It floats gently on water that reflects a blend of blues and grays, mirroring the cloudy sky above.\n\nIn the boat, there are two individuals, each seated facing opposite directions. The person at the front of the boat is dressed in dark clothing including a hat, while the person at the back is wearing a plaid jacket and is in charge of rowing. Both individuals seem to be in a peaceful setting, possibly enjoying nature or in a contemplative quietude.\n\nThe background features tall, dense trees and lush greenery, contributing to the sense of tranquility and isolation from urban life. The waterscape blends into patches of wetland or marsh, with very little distinct separation between water and land, adding to the overall stillness and reflective beauty of the environment. The composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on soft natural light and simple colors, enhances the tranquil and timeless quality of the moment.","title":"Algae carpets the sluggish waters of the Fox River on the northward leg of its course toward Lake Winnebago.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553411","549417","548553","553409","550000","546976","551680","546356","557563","550975","552317","550208","552123","550769","550780","544532"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","charge","rowing","waterscape","separation","rowboat","quietude","individual","blend","person"]}
