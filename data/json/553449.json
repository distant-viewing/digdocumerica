{"path":"553449.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful moment of a family enjoying time together in a body of water. The focus is on four individuals, likely two adults and two children, engaging in water play.\n\nOn the left side, a woman with shoulder-length brown hair is seen partially submerged in the water. She is wearing a red and floral patterned bikini and holds onto a surfboard or floating device, which a young girl, appearing around 5-7 years old, clings to. The girl, wearing a green bathing suit with floral prints, has short hair and a big smile as she lies with her stomach on the board.\n\nTo the right, an adult male, with his upper body above water, supports another child on the same surfboard. The man, who is shirtless, seems to be helping or playing with the child, who is also lying stomach-down on the board. Both the man and the child have wet, tousled hair, aligning with the playful water activity context.\n\nThe entire scene takes place in a body of water, evidenced by the rippling, dark blue water surrounding them. The lighting indicates it might be a sunny day, contributing to the bright and vibrant atmosphere of the photograph. This candid scene captures a moment of familial bonding and leisurely fun, typical of a leisurely summer day spent by the water.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["556293","552975","543515","551544","552702","556295","543458","551160","546851","548113","543530","544197","554611","557740","550829","543943"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["surfboard","child","board","water","girl","hair","down","bonding","adult","fun"]}
