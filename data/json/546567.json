{"path":"546567.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor setting where landscaping work is being carried out. In the foreground, a man, dressed in light-colored long pants and a white T-shirt with a cap, is actively engaged in digging or hoeing the soil. He appears to be a middle-aged individual focused on his task. Surrounding him are several young trees that have been recently planted in a row, each supported by a thin stake and showing young, sparse foliage.\n\nThe background of the scene reveals a large, dark-colored building with a sleek, reflective facade, likely made of glass. This building's reflection vaguely shows more trees, suggesting a continuation or mirror of the scene in front of it. On the ground, there are scattered white plastic covers, possibly used to protect other plants or control weed growth around the young trees. Part of the ground is covered by a black tarp or geotextile fabric which might be used to suppress weeds or stabilize the soil.\n\nAdditionally, in the foreground, there is a safety barrier cone, hinting that this area might be partially restricted due of ongoing construction or landscaping. The overall setting suggests that this is a newly developing area, possibly part of urban development or renovation of commercial or public property. The soil looks freshly tilled, indicative of recent or ongoing landscaping efforts to beautify or repurpose the space.","title":"Trees are planted near the civic mall","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551632","553423","553424","550055","551737","543439","544240","545217","549298","557735","554856","543672","555824","557742","556177","553637"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["landscaping","weed","soil","repurpose","renovation","stake","restrict","till","tarp","cone"]}
