{"path":"558341.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures two elderly women involved in assembling a quilt. The woman in the foreground is wearing a red shirt, glasses, and a brooch on her chest. She is focusing intently on the quilt, placing her hand on a piece of fabric. The other woman, slightly out of focus in the background, wears a checkered shirt and glasses. She too appears engaged in the quilting task, overseeing a section of the quilt.\n\nThey are working on a large quilt made up of various patterns and colors of fabric, including but not limited to, floral designs, stripes, and polka dots. The quilt appears vivid and colorful, spread out on a table that fills the frame of the picture.\n\nThe setting seems to be a workshop or a crafting room, dimly lit except for bright fluorescent lights overhead which illuminate the quilt directly. In the background, there seem to be coats or other items hanging, along with shelves that likely hold supplies. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and creativity, reflecting a moment dedicated to traditional craft.","title":"Closeup of senior citizens quilting in New Ulm, Minnesota they are attempting to keep the old frontier crafts alive.
