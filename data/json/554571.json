{"path":"554571.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a mossy surface. The moss is visually dense and appears lush, predominantly in a rich green color with hints of yellow. Its texture seems soft and spongy, consisting of many small, intricate leaf-like structures which are tightly clustered together. Scattered among the moss are several thin, dry pine needles and bits of small other plant debris, which contrast with the moss due to their brown and beige colors. These pine needles are somewhat parallel and straight, adding a linear element to the predominantly textured moss. \n\nThe background is blurred out but suggests a continuation of this moss-covered environment, hinting at a possibly forested or natural area. The perspective is from above, looking directly down on the moss, which allows for a detailed view of the plant's structure and surrounding elements. The lighting in the photo is natural, enhancing the vividness of the moss and the subtle, earthy tones of the fallen debris.","title":"Sphagnum moss located in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555025","555026","543147","555018","555027","545271","554993","555058","554985","555183","554975","554991","555000","554554","555191","555093"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","needle","mossy","continuation","debris","leaf","plant","vividness","yellow","bit"]}
