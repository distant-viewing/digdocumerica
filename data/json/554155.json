{"path":"554155.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a long, straight road cutting through a rugged landscape. Plumes of white and light pink smoke are rising from the ground, primarily along the road, suggesting the presence of vehicles, possibly due to traffic or a specific activity like racing or a convoy movement that is causing dust and exhaust fumes to billow up. The scene is enveloped in a haze, adding to the somewhat mysterious or intense atmosphere.\n\nThe terrain on either side of the road appears barren and desolate, with sparse vegetation visible, indicative of a desert or similarly arid environment. The image is cast in a reddish-purple hue, possibly due to the lighting at the time the photo was taken or a filter effect used during processing, giving it a muted, almost otherworldly feel.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the interaction between the human-made element of the road and the natural landscape, highlighting the impact of human activities on nature. The scene captures motion and activity without depicting any individuals, focusing instead on the environmental and atmospheric effects of these activities.","title":"New highway, under construction north of kailua on the western side of the island, presages zoning changes from agricultural and conservation use to urban development","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554154","545886","554131","543988","544043","553127","544178","549013","548594","545367","554130","549016","554802","553124","545604","554165"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","fume","racing","exhaust","effect","cause","billow","dust","envelop","plume"]}
