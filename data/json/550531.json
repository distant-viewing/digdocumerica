{"path":"550531.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a rugged landscape dotted with numerous bodies of water and winding rivers. The scenery features a dense forest predominantly composed of coniferous trees, stretching out to a mountainous horizon, which suggests the terrain might be part of a larger wilderness or natural park.\n\nThe river, appearing vivid due to its winding and dynamic course, acts as the central focus due to its pronounced meandersâ€”sharp bends that loop back on themselves, creating an almost serpentine pattern. Alongside the river, various smaller lakes and ponds are scattered throughout, serving as reflective surfaces that catch light amidst the darker tones of the surrounding forest.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and complex, varying from flat river valleys to slightly raised hillocks and low-lying mountains in the distance, contributing to a rich and textured visual tapestry. The sky is not very prominent in the frame, but a glimpse at the horizon suggests a clear day which provides excellent visibility, enriching the vividness of natural colors in the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its perspective from altitude, presents an expansive view that emphasizes the natural beauty and untamed character of this wilderness area, inviting contemplation of nature's intricacies and the serene isolation of such landscapes.","title":"Grayling Creek, view north","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550571","550542","550601","550627","550700","542701","550616","550508","550625","550562","550526","550529","550577","550622","550544","550559"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","wilderness","loop","intricacy","tapestry","course","forest","vividness","horizon","altitude"]}
