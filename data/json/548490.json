{"path":"548490.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a scene featuring a bird, likely an osprey, sitting in a large nest. The nest is composed of an assortment of sticks and twigs, and is positioned prominently in the foreground of the image. Interestingly, the nest is situated very close, possibly atop, a structure that resembles a small lighthouse or marine marker, which is white with a clear, beacon-like top part. Part of a red triangular warning sign is also visible at the edge of the nest, adding a striking contrast of color against the natural tones of the nest and the bird.\n\nThe bird itself appears vigilant and is looking towards its left with noticeable alertness, showing off a speckled chest and sharp eyes. Its presence adds a dynamic and natural element to the otherwise static structures within the image.\n\nThe background is a muted blue sky, suggesting the photograph may have been taken on a clear day. The overall composition of the photograph, with the natural elements juxtaposed with human-made objects, offers an intriguing visual narrative about the intersection of wildlife and human environments.","title":"At home on a channel marker in Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548493","548505","548497","548501","544513","544489","544505","544547","555010","549231","553876","544501","551378","547196","542919","543595"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["nest","bird","marine","alertness","lighthouse","twig","warning","chest","marker","assortment"]}
