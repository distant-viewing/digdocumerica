{"path":"543695.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a hand holding a small pile of amber-colored crystalline material, which appears to be raw, unrefined amber. The amber crystals are of various sizes and have a rough texture with some translucent properties visible.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, is a red container holding multiple open black bottles. The contents of these bottles aren't visible, but they contribute to a setup that suggests scientific or geological fieldwork, possibly relating to the collection or study of the amber.\n\nThe focus of the image is on the amber in the hand, emphasizing the texture and color variations of the pieces. The setting implies a methodical examination or processing environment for these natural elements, adding context to the presentation of the amber in a practical, possibly research-oriented scenario. The overall mood conveys a sense of discovery or analysis.","title":"Closeup of beer bottles crushed into fine glass.
