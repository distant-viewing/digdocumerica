{"path":"546351.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a natural landscape predominantly featuring a river and its surroundings. The river, curving through the scene, is a central element, dividing into two branches at one point. Its waters appear murky, possibly indicating sediment or reflections of the lush greenery lining its banks.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the river is diverse, featuring areas of dense green vegetation which could constitute a mix of trees and brush, indicative of a fertile environment possibly supporting a variety of wildlife. In contrast, there are patches that appear to be cleared or less vegetated, hinting at human activity or natural clearings.\n\nNoticeable are several sandy or muddy areas along the riverbanks and at the river bifurcation, where sediment seems to have been deposited, possibly as a result of water currents or recent floods.\n\nThe top left area of the image exhibits human impact more evidently than other parts: a cleared strip of land alongside part of the river, with what appears to be fallen logs or debris scattered around. This area might be used for various human activities, potentially related to resource extraction or land management.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a striking natural scene from an altitude that provides a broad perspective on both the ecological features and the human interactions within this river ecosystem.","title":"Aerial view of body of polluted water","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["542881","552838","550392","555753","550623","550580","549081","557506","550530","542822","547990","550527","550542","550885","550616","550524"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","sediment","clear","brush","land","deposit","extraction","flood","result","current"]}
