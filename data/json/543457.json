{"path":"543457.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a young girl stands on a sandy beach. She is dressed in a light pale yellow outfit, consisting of a sleeveless top and matching trousers. Her dark hair is long and appears slightly windblown. She holds in her right hand what seems to be a brown, tangled piece of seaweed, stretching down almost to the ground.\n\nThe setting is a beach during daytime, suggested by the bright sunlight and shadows cast on the uneven sandy surface, which is littered with small pieces of debris and seaweed. There is no visible water body in the immediate background, indicating that the girl may be some distance away from the water's edge. The background is softly out of focus, emphasizing the girl in the foreground.\n\nHer expression is serious or contemplative, and her gaze is directed off to the side, not looking at the camera. Her posture and the way she holds the seaweed suggest a moment of casual exploration or play. The overall mood conveys a sense of calm and the simplicity of a child's interaction with nature.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548280","555398","550241","543468","548291","543392","548793","549105","547727","543875","550233","547676","552279","548282","542657","544200"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["seaweed","girl","beach","piece","gaze","daytime","calm","simplicity","play","exploration"]}
