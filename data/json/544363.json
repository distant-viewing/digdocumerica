{"path":"544363.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features a striking natural landscape centered on a large, dramatic rock formation. The formation itself is sharp and jagged, rising prominently against the sky. It has a rugged texture and appears to be composed of sedimentary layers, which are somewhat vertical, suggesting geological lift and erosion over time.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a rocky terrain covered with sparse vegetation, possibly tundra or a similar ecosystem, indicating that the location could be in a high-altitude or northern environment. The ground is uneven and strewn with small rocks and patches of low, hardy plants which provide a subtle range of greens and browns.\n\nThe sky, occupying the upper portion of the frame, is mostly cloudy with several breaks allowing blue sky to show through, suggesting a dynamic weather condition.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the natural beauty and ruggedness of the landscape, invoking a sense of isolation and the powerful processes of natural erosion and weathering. The mood is somewhat solemn and awe-inspiring, emphasizing the majesty and solitary presence of the rock formation in its harsh environment.","title":"Church Rock near Monument Valley","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545801","545805","552444","552890","544376","550428","545775","544392","555592","545571","544745","554410","552685","543838","545792","545696"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","erosion","rock","tundra","lift","majesty","awe","ruggedness","weathering","break"]}
