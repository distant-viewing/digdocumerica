{"path":"552519.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image features a religious symbol, specifically a cross, mounted on the exterior wall of a building. The cross is in the foreground and appears to be constructed from a grey or silver metal, giving it a sleek and modern look. It is anchored to the wall by a metal bracket or support arm, which maintains the cross at a distance from the background surface.\n\nThe background is composed of a large, textured brick wall. The bricks are aligned in a vertical pattern and have a reddish-brown color, commonly seen in brick buildings. The shadow of the cross is cast onto the wall, creating a visual effect that doubles the presence of the cross on the building. This shadow is slightly offset and follows the contours of the cross.\n\nThere is an overall simplicity and minimalistic aesthetic to the composition, focusing the viewer's attention on the interplay of the geometric shapes and the textural contrast between the metallic cross and the rugged surface of the brick wall. This setup likely aims to evoke a sense of contemplation and reverence appropriate for a religious symbol.","title":"Grace methodist church in Nashville","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["545250","546467","557093","545873","547439","545811","557082","545366","547332","557083","546466","558018","558411","558019","554208","552530"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cross","wall","brick","symbol","reverence","bracket","anchor","sleek","reddish","aim"]}
