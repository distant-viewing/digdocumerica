{"path":"554451.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a marching band performance, likely during a parade or a public event. In the foreground, two young girls are seen having a conversation. On the left is a girl wearing a white long-sleeve blouse paired with a red skirt, white knee-high socks, and black shoes with white accents. She is facing the other girl, with her back mostly towards the camera, and her hair is long and dark.\n\nThe girl on the right is dressed in a formal band uniform, complete with a maroon jacket adorned with white and golden embellishments, and maroon trousers with a broad white stripe down the side. Her outfit is accessorized with white gloves, tall maroon hat featuring a large white plume, and she is holding a saxophone and its strap. She also wears glasses and her blond hair is styled in braids that are coiled around her ears. \n\nIn the background, other band members are visible. They are dressed in similar uniforms and hold various brass instruments, actively engaging in the event. There are adults (female) in slightly different attire, likely instructors or coordinators, supervising the group. The setting seems to be a large outdoor area, possibly a cleared field or dirt road, surrounded by trees and some parked cars, suggesting the event is in a rural or semi-rural area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of community and the enjoyment of a local celebration or festivity.","title":"Cheerleader chats with high school band leader before Memorial Day parade at the little town of Inlet near the Fulton Chain Lakes.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["556283","552656","547022","556279","552661","553713","558221","553173","557264","554449","554450","556284","549567","556278","549702","551020"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["girl","band","maroon","event","uniform","braid","brass","festivity","embellishment","female"]}
