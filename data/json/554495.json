{"path":"554495.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at an ice cream stand. The stand is housed in a simple structure with white walls and a wooden counter. The window of the stand has several colorful advertisements featuring different ice cream treats, such as sundaes, hot dogs, and popsicles, which mirror the offerings proffered by the attendants inside.\n\nIn the foreground, a diverse group of customers is engaging with the stand. On the left, a young woman wearing a plaid shirt and jeans is munched on a snack, her attention directed towards one of the attendants. Beside her, a young boy in a striped red shirt and black shorts appears to be placing an order, guided by a taller individual in blue jeans and a greenish shirt, presumably a family member or guardian.\n\nOn the right, another customer, a man with curly hair and dressed in a denim jacket and jeans, leans casually against the standâ€™s counter. He also appears to be conversing with someone inside the stand or perhaps waiting for an order.\n\nThe background shows a peaceful suburban environment with brick buildings and trees, suggesting a quiet neighborhood setting. The overall atmosphere is casual and indicative of a pleasant community interaction centered around the enjoyment of summertime snacks.\n","title":"Typical hot dog stand at Lake George, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548540","546979","554187","555390","554708","548544","545457","553204","547887","553212","551485","554217","547855","545452","558190","551731"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["attendant","snack","order","customer","counter","jeans","ice","stand","treat","greenish"]}
