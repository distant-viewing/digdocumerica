{"path":"552459.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph displays a large, weathered advertisement painted on a brick wall. The main feature of the advertisement includes intertwined and oversized lettering stating \"6-30-69 FLOUR,\" designed in a bold, ornate style, typical of early 20th-century advertisements. Above this central inscription, the phrase \"GRANTED ALWAYS ALL RIGHTS\" is visible, though it is partially obscured and faded, suggesting age and exposure to the elements. Below the main lettering, the words \"SEMI XO DIGESTIB\" can be seen, possibly a fragmented portion of something like \"semi so digestible\" or similar wording indicating the quality or type of the flour, but the exact text is faded and illegible in parts.\n\nThe background is comprised solely of the red brick surface onto which the advertisement is painted. The bricks show signs of wear and age, including uneven coloring and some areas where the bricks and mortar are more exposed.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a sense of historical commercial art, emphasizing a type of product branding that was commonly used in earlier times. The photograph could invoke a sense of nostalgia or historical interest, particularly towards old marketing techniques and urban decay aesthetics.","title":"On an old store wall in La Rose","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552478","544081","552463","544088","544113","544720","552511","550131","553479","547005","554307","556047","551495","545339","550132","545355"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["advertisement","brick","lettering","age","branding","inscription","phrase","type","coloring","nostalgia"]}
