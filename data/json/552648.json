{"path":"552648.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting comfortably in a wheelchair. His attire is unique and colorful: he wears a patterned shirt beneath a blue sweater, paired with a structured jacket that has a diagonally striped tie. On his lap, he holds a straw hat with a striped band that matches the tie. The setting is rather dark with light coming from the side, highlighting parts of his face, shirt, and hat. His expression is content, and his glasses reflect a small glimmer of light, adding a spark to his overall demeanor.\n\nThe background is largely shadowed, with hints of a rustic setting suggested by faint, warm-hued light filtering through textures that might be wooden or curtain-like. The environment gives a serene, intimate feel to the scene, focusing the attention on the elderly man and his quiet, pleasant moment.","title":"Eighty-one year old Celia Mapes speaks for most of her fellow town people when she says, \"Rifle is the only place for me.\"","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["554857","553090","557056","547330","556486","546105","556084","558332","548226","556133","548224","554858","556452","552871","548218","547179"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["tie","glimmer","wheelchair","spark","like","hat","filtering","lap","straw","band"]}
