{"path":"545094.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an unusual and dynamic scene featuring a decrepit, red three-wheeled vehicle, which appears to be a customized or old-fashioned car, struggling up a steep incline on a sandy dune. This vehicle is packed with several individuals—a total of four, including three men visibly engaged in various actions that suggest a thrill or adventure-like activity. One clings onto the side, another sits atop the back where luggage might normally rest, and another is seemingly in the driver’s seat, steering the vehicle. The vehicle and passengers have a distinctly vintage or possibly improvised appearance, accentuated by the visible engine and rustic red paint.\n\nThe setting is a vast, open sandy landscape with a clear, blue sky that fills the background. The slope of the dune creates a dramatic diagonal composition that enhances the sense of movement and precariousness of their ascent. The occupants are dressed casually and seem to be enjoying their adventure, contributing to a lively and somewhat humorous overall mood of the picture.","title":"Dune buggy in national recreation park","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["545102","545098","551969","543207","545596","548986","547758","543211","553056","543370","544038","546093","543856","553113","551316","550935"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["dune","adventure","vehicle","ascent","total","thrill","incline","luggage","occupant","engine"]}
