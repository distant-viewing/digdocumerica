{"path":"555088.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a desolate landscape marred by environmental damage, displaying a stark scene of deforestation or possible wildfire aftermath. The foreground shows a steep slope littered with dead trees, many broken and charred, accompanied by the exposed, barren earth. Some stumps remain in the ground, standing as solemn reminders of the trees that once were. The middle ground is a hazy shroud of smoke or fog that envelopes the hills in the distance, suggesting possibly ongoing environmental changes or hindered recovery of the terrain. The background features surviving forests on distant hills, though the atmosphere is dimmed with a bluish-grey haze, indicative of smoke or mist. This contrast highlights the extent of destruction in the area portrayed and evokes a sense of loss and devastation.","title":"Burned clear-cut area of olympic national timberland Washington.
