{"path":"549293.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph shows two elderly men engaged in a conversation on a sunny day. The man on the left, wearing a dark suit and a light-colored fedora hat, is talking animatedly and gestures with his hand. He has dark, thick-rimmed glasses. The man on the right appears to be listening intently and wearing a light beige jacket over a light-colored shirt, a beige tie, and also sports large, black-rimmed glasses. He holds a rolled-up newspaper or magazine in his left hand, emphasizing a casual or possibly unplanned encounter. Both men are white and seem to be relaxed and enjoying their discussion.\n\nThe setting suggests they are outdoors, possibly in a park or a similarly green space, due to the presence of blurry green foliage in the background. The focus and depth of field suggest a personal moment captured in an everyday public setting. The image evokes a sense of leisurely, engaged conversation perhaps among friends or acquaintances meeting unexpectedly.","title":"Residents of the community bordering on Logan Airport are engaged in a continuous struggle with Massport (Massachusetts Port Authority). Here Matthew Vieira (left) and Jerry Colella discuss a news story praising Massport for buying a neighborhood house for $30,000 when its original price had been $5,000. The story says nothing about today's price for a comparable structure.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553153","549291","557079","549292","547443","557143","547382","551469","557854","548482","554026","553208","557856","547411","553558","553182"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["encounter","magazine","fedora","conversation","man","glass","friend","newspaper","talk","relax"]}
