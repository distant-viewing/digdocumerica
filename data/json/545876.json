{"path":"545876.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph presents an intriguing contrast between industrial activity and urban development. In the foreground, a rugged, yellow dump truck loaded with debris is seen on a dirt path, emphasizing ongoing clearing or construction work. The truck is in the left foreground, showing details like dirt and grime on its surface, indicative of heavy use, and the number \"775.\" This suggests the truck is part of a larger fleet.\n\nThe middle ground shows a sparse area with some grass, bushes, and scattered trees, likely the outskirts of the construction or dump site. In contrast, the background features a vibrant city skyline under a hazy sky, with various high-rise buildings that create a bustling urban vista. The skyline includes a mix of architectural styles and sizes, indicating a diverse and densely populated city.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, using the dump truck in the foreground with the city in the distance, highlights the intersection of natural landscapes, industrial activities, and urban living, possibly pointing to themes of development, environmental impact, or urban expansion.","title":"Houston skyline seen from holmes road landfill site","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549743","549638","545146","545851","549740","557283","549765","550270","545677","549752","549913","542538","549768","549777","545251","549767"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dump","truck","city","skyline","grime","development","dirt","construction","expansion","vista"]}
