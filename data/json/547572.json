{"path":"547572.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene industrial waterfront scene. The foreground is dominated by what appears to be decayed wooden beams, possibly remnants of an old pier or jetty, floating in calm blue water. These timbers are weathered, with visible algae or moss, suggesting long exposure to the elements.\n\nIn the background, a large cargo ship is docked at a port facility, with several industrial structures visible including cranes and large storage tanks or silos. These elements hint at ongoing maritime or industrial activities typical of a working harbor.\n\nThe lighting of the photo suggests it was taken during daytime, with a clear sky as indicated by the bright blue water. A distinct glint of sunlight is reflected off the water's surface, adding a spark of brightness and contrasting the darker tones of the wooden beams and the silhouetted ship in the dim light.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a juxtaposition of neglected wooden debris in the foreground against a backdrop of active industrial operation, possibly underscoring themes of nature versus human engineering or abandonment versus bustling activity.","title":"Unused pier near allens avenue--main industrial area along the waterfront","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547585","547581","547474","547584","547594","550910","547575","547622","552240","551978","546876","552244","547582","551577","548105","552216"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["beam","ship","glint","spark","tanks","jetty","alga","timber","harbor","hind"]}
