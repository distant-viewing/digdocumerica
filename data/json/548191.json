{"path":"548191.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a group of people engaged in a clean-up activity on a sandy and grassy riverbank. In the foreground, a young man in a blue jacket and jeans, wearing gloves, bends down to pick up trash. Several other individuals, both adults and younger members, are scattered across the scene, similarly occupied in collecting wasteâ€”some are using plastic bags to gather the trash.\n\nThe setting is outdoors under a clear sky with few clouds. The river that runs along the background appears calm and expansive, surrounded by a flat, open landscape mainly composed of sandy areas and sparse vegetation. Some bits of driftwood and several patches of uncollected trash are noticeable on the ground around the volunteers.\n\nThe participants are dressed in casual, practical clothing suitable for outdoor work; some are wearing jackets or sweaters that suggest the weather might be a bit cool. The mood of the scene is productive and community-oriented, as the group works together in environmental conservation efforts.","title":"Cub Pack 16, from the Harvey Scott Grade School in Portland cleaning up beach litter at Sauvie Island on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["551427","548198","543927","551391","552948","542655","551421","544800","546863","552951","545531","550060","550056","552085","545535","551388"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["trash","bit","jacket","driftwood","glove","group","participant","member","conservation","sweater"]}
