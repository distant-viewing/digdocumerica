{"path":"555344.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph showcases an outdoor residential scene captured from what appears to be a shaded porch or patio area. The foreground is occupied by a lush, well-maintained green lawn dotted with several flowers, notably roses, which add a vibrant touch of color. Objects like a soccer ball can be seen on the grass, hinting at recreational activities. A few functional, unadorned stools are scattered around the yard.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's an oval-shaped swimming pool surrounded by a concrete walkway. The surface of the water reflects the clear blue sky overhead, indicating a sunny day without visible clouds. Adjacent to the pool, to its right, is a somewhat rustic wooden structure fitted with solar panels on its slanted roof, which suggests a concern for sustainable energy usage in the household.\n\nThe background is bordered by a variety of trees that are moderately dense, and behind these trees, the faint outlines of a hill or a raised area can be seen, enhancing the sense of a secluded suburban or semi-rural setting. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and leisurely, with no signs of active human presence when the photo was taken.","title":"Solar heating panels in the background are used to heat the swimming pool shown at a home outside of Tucson, Arizona.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["557717","557426","555342","557440","557437","549279","555615","546435","556426","557698","544558","553458","557755","545896","557552","547248"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["pool","rose","stool","patio","ball","household","swimming","overhead","usage","fit"]}
