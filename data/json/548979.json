{"path":"548979.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene focusing on agricultural activity on a farm. The image shows a large expanse of a harvested field at sunset, illuminated with the golden hues of the setting sun that cast deep, warm tones across the landscape.\n\nIn the foreground is a swath of cut crop, possibly wheat, laid out neatly in a straight, long line that leads towards the horizon. This line creates a linear perspective, drawing the eye towards the center of the image where the main activity is centered.\n\nMidway across the field, slightly to the right, is a harvest machine, possibly a combine harvester, which is either still working or has just completed its run. The harvester appears to be stationed at the head of an unharvested section of the field, separated by the already harvested area that runs seamlessly into the horizon, dividing the field into neat sections.\n\nThe field itself is expansive, stretching flat and wide, characterized by the recently flattened crop which reflects a mix of golden and dark hues indicative of its ripe state just before or after harvesting. The background is relatively clear, marked by a flat horizon that suggests an open, rural landscape typical of large farming areas.\n\nThe sky, touched slightly by the picture's edges, appears clear and vast, contributing to the idyllic yet industrious nature of this farming scene. The overall atmosphere evoked by the photograph is one of peaceful productivity in the late hours of a farming day.","title":"Cutting barley in the Imperial Valley--near Brawley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548976","554015","548985","547432","547730","549149","557119","554044","547288","547309","544050","548964","553810","549036","548981","554056"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvest","harvester","farming","field","crop","wheat","swath","horizon","productivity","flatten"]}
