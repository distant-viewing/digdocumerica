{"path":"544077.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an old brick building, likely a historical or industrial structure, under clear blue skies. The building's facade is marked with faded white lettering that reads \"MYERS DARLING AND HINTON CO.\" suggesting it may have been a company building. The architecture includes arched windows on both stories, although many of the windows are missing panes, and a robust, red brick texture covers the entire structure.\n\nThe building has a classic, somewhat dilapidated aesthetic typical of surviving structures from an earlier industrial era. Notably, details like the curved top edges of the windows and the ornamental brick patterns above them add a touch of decorative craftsmanship characteristic of the period. Telecommunication lines run across the top right corner of the frame, and a glimpse of mountainous terrain can be seen in the background, providing a sense of the building's surroundings and perhaps its small-town or rural industrial context.","title":"Building in the downtown area of an old mining town","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["545355","544088","550013","544824","552681","557643","547822","550023","551586","552964","547969","557156","549159","552966","557140","545334"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["brick","telecommunication","survive","window","building","craftsmanship","pane","miss","company","lettering"]}
