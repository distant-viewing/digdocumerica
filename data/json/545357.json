{"path":"545357.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a grave marker in a natural, outdoor setting. The grave marker is a handmade, rectangular headstone with a flat surface, painted white. It bears the name \"Matilde Gomez\" prominently above the details of her life span, \"Born 1871 - Died 1949\", all written in a bold, black handwritten style. Above the name, a Christian cross is painted in black.\n\nThe headstone is adorned with various decorations. A lace-like material, possibly part of a wreath or floral arrangement, frames the top edge, and artificial flowers in shades of white, pink, and orange are arranged around this area. Immediately in front of the stone, there are fresh flowers and a few branches with yellow flowers, contributing more color and a sense of being freshly tended.\n\nAt the base of the headstone, there is a wrinkled, faded pink cloth or ribbon, adding a touch of personal memorabilia or ceremonial significance. The ground around the grave is dry and covered with sparse vegetation and rocks, typical of a rugged or desert-like landscape.\n\nThe photograph captures a poignant memorabilia, portraying a personal and respectfully maintained resting place, encapsulating a blend of humble craftsmanship and heartfelt tribute.","title":"Spanish graveyard","placename":"Questa (N.M.)","location":"Questa, New Mexico","nn1":["545364","547801","554210","545314","554206","544267","544307","555566","544259","552452","549041","550365","552683","545322","546098","547417"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["headstone","marker","flower","bear","name","die","grave","like","lace","ribbon"]}
