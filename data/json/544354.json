{"path":"544354.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment of three children engaging in playful activities outside. The image is vibrant and bustling with energy.\n\nIn the foreground, a child wearing a yellow top is lying on the ground with a joyful expression and his arms outstretched. He appears to be holding onto a metal pole, perhaps during a game or play. Next to him, partially visible, stands another child in a striped top who is also engaging with the pole.\n\nIn the mid-ground, another child wearing a blue shirt and maroon pants sits on the dirt ground. This child is facing the camera, his facial expression one of calmness or perhaps tiredness, and he is holding the metal pole, supporting the child who is lying down.\n\nThe background is subtly blurred but one can discern a sandy or dusty environment with hints of a metallic fence and some sparse greenery. The overall scene suggests an outdoor setting possibly in a rural or undeveloped area where children are making the most of simple, available materials to have fun. The photograph might be highlighting themes of innocence, childhood, and resourcefulness.","title":"Young Navaho","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556136","556287","554498","553512","556166","557410","548965","544424","556437","552591","553507","549674","551128","557987","555931","556175"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","pole","maroon","fun","innocence","childhood","ground","game","calmness","expression"]}
