{"path":"543249.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a striking coastal scene, likely taken in the late afternoon given the soft lighting. Prominent in the foreground is a rugged cliff face characterized by its deep reddish-brown color with vertical erosion patterns, towering over the sea. The cliff is partially covered with greenery, including bushy plants and some white wildflowers.\n\nThe background features the vast ocean stretching into the horizon under a clear sky with a few faint clouds. Small, jagged rocks are scattered in the water near the shore, adding texture to the dynamic ocean surface that appears to have gentle waves. The coastline curves inward, forming a small, secluded cove.\n\nFurther in the distance along the coast, higher hills or mountains softly rise, cloaked in a haze, suggesting a combination of moisture in the air and the effect of the distance from the viewpoint. On one of these distant hills, there appears to be a small structure, possibly a building, which is tiny due to the distance but brings a hint of human presence to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its dramatic cliff edges and expansive views of the ocean, evokes a sense of rugged natural beauty and tranquility. The image could be on the Pacific coast, reminiscent of areas such as Big Sur in California.","title":"California--Rocky Point","placename":"Rocky Point (Calif.)","location":"Rocky Point, California","nn1":["543061","543184","543080","553771","543428","543291","543297","543300","545125","553775","547991","542917","543304","545122","545129","545934"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","coast","ocean","cove","cloak","distance","hill","bring","moisture","wildflower"]}
