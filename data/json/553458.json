{"path":"553458.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph portrays a natural outdoor setting with a multi-level white house in the background. The house seems to be surrounded by a wooded area. The foreground is dominated by a large tree trunk and scattered branches, suggesting a forest or heavily treed area. Below and slightly to the left of the trunk is a small pool of water, reflecting light, possibly caused by recent rainfall or a natural low spot that collects water.\n\nThe house has a visible exterior chimney and several windows, but the details of the property are not entirely clear due to the distance and the intervening branches. The woodland around the house hints at a rural or semi-rural location, with the ground appearing muddy and covered with fallen leaves, typical of what might be seen in late autumn or early spring.\n\nThe photograph has a quiet, somewhat somber mood, characterized by the shadowy foreground and the natural lighting that highlights the house in the background. The composition utilizes natural elements to frame the house, creating a sense of seclusion or retreat from the viewer's perspective.","title":"Ribbons mark surveyors' work in this housing development in townsend","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["558110","545041","555632","558102","556426","551091","556472","554787","557669","554822","556999","558104","554788","549195","543543","556962"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","trunk","branch","retreat","seclusion","collect","rainfall","muddy","outdoor","utilize"]}
