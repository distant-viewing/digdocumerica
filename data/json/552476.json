{"path":"552476.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape under an overcast sky. In the foreground, there's a vibrant yellow newspaper delivery box labeled \"CHRONICLE\" mounted on a dark pole. It is situated beside a wire fence that stretches across the image. The ground is covered with lush green grass and dotted with several white dandelion heads.\n\nIn the background, the expansive flat terrain extends into the distance, accentuated by various shades of green from the fields. A few solitary trees punctuate the horizon. Further in the distance, small farm buildings or houses can be discerned, appearing as small specks against the vast open space. The overall mood conveyed by the cloudy sky and wide-open spaces is serene and somewhat somber.","title":"Mailbox and fence","placename":"Hinckley (Ill.)","location":"Hinckley, Illinois","nn1":["549142","557749","555596","545040","557946","557087","554803","549227","551304","549182","550667","554801","549256","549252","553809","549222"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dandelion","delivery","speck","newspaper","discern","punctuate","space","distance","wire","farm"]}
