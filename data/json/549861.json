{"path":"549861.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Morgan, Hank","caption":"This photograph captures a busy multilane highway leading towards a large steel bridge, notable for its tall, intricate arches and lattice structures, which suggests it might be a significant urban bridge. The scene is depicted under an overcast sky, adding a somewhat somber tone to the image.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple lanes of traffic are visible. The lanes appear divided by a concrete barrier that runs down the center, with traffic moving in both directions. On the left side, there are two large trucks, one red and the other white, showing signs of motion blur. This blur, combined with sharper images of other vehicles, suggests varying speeds among the cars and trucks.\n\nAdditionally, there are smaller vehicles including various cars captured in lesser blur compared to the trucks, indicating their slower speed when the photo was taken. Some small yellow road cones are also visible in one lane, indicating possible road work or lane closures ahead.\n\nOverhead, traffic signs are visible, suspended above the road, likely providing navigation information or traffic regulations pertinent to the route leading to the bridge. The lighting conditions demonstrate a cloudy or overcast day, with streetlamps intermittently placed along the highway.\n\nThe background is simplistic, featuring a flat horizon with indistinct urban buildings, very likely hinting at the outskirts of a city. The overall composition highlights the hustle of urban transport and the infrastructure that supports it.","title":"The george Washington bridge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549878","546724","546588","556832","552708","548418","545451","549902","556194","546569","553846","548413","548401","549879","549890","550954"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lane","blur","traffic","bridge","speed","highway","road","truck","cone","lattice"]}
