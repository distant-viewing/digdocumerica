{"path":"553800.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals enjoying a leisurely moment in a small rowboat on a body of water. The setting reflects a serene environment primarily dominated by the calm blue water.\n\nIn the rowboat, there are two young women. The woman positioned at the stern is seated upright and is actively rowing the boat with a single oar. She has blonde hair and wears a two-piece bathing suit, suggesting the weather is warm and conducive for water activities. Her attention appears focused either on the act of rowing or perhaps something in the distance on the water.\n\nThe other woman is reclining in the bow of the boat with her head tilted back and her eyes possibly closed, reflecting a state of relaxation or sunbathing. She wears shorts and a sleeveless top, with her hair partly tied back.\n\nThe boat itself appears compact and sturdy, suitable for a casual outing on water. No visible land or other boats are in the immediate background, distilling a sense of peaceful isolation. The image predominantly communicates a relaxed, sunny day spent on the water, enjoying nature and companionship.","title":"Larrabee State Park. (From the sites exhibition.
