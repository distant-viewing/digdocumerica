{"path":"550535.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a natural, wild landscape, predominantly featuring a boreal forest biome. This setting is characterized by dense clusters of young coniferous trees, most likely spruces or pines, scattered throughout the frame. These trees are relatively small and thin, suggesting a young forest or a regrowth area.\n\nThe ground is covered with a mixture of grass, moss, and a variety of bushy undergrowth. Notably, there are patches of bright red and pink plants which could be wildflowers or shrubs, adding pops of color against the green and brown palette of the scene. The texture of the undergrowth implies a marshy or bog-like terrain, possibly indicating a high-moisture soil type or the presence of peat.\n\nIn the background, the tree density seems to decrease leading towards a more open skyline, through which a mountain range or raised landforms are partially visible under a cloudy grey sky. The atmosphere of the photo conveys a remote, untouched quality, typical of vast natural reserves or protected areas.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects an ecosystem abundant with plant biodiversity and demonstrates the serene yet rugged aspects of a northern forested landscape. The lighting appears natural and slightly overcast, which accentuates the saturation of the green and red hues in the vegetation.","title":"Typical tundra-muskeg black spruce swamp of these regions scenes such as this (taken behind Prospect Creek Camp) are typical from the Yukon River north to the Brooks Range.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555654","550536","555217","550643","558088","542604","555133","554589","550602","557596","546205","555114","555675","543615","554978","557019"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["undergrowth","biodiversity","reserve","pop","landform","forest","pine","saturation","plant","moisture"]}
