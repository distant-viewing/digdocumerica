{"path":"545781.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor hiking scene, likely in a rugged desert-like area. There are two individuals depicted, engaged in hiking over a large boulder. The boulder's surface is smooth, indicating erosion likely caused by wind and water over time.\n\nThe person in the foreground is actively climbing up the steep face of the boulder. This individual wears a red backpack, blue shorts, and hiking boots. The backpack looks quite loaded, suggesting that the hike might be a part of a longer trek. Their left hand is bracing against the rock for support, and the right leg is bent as they step up.\n\nIn the background, another hiker is seen higher up on the trail, walking away from the camera towards the top of the boulder. This person is wearing a light-colored sleeveless top and darker shorts. Both individuals appear focused on navigating the rough terrain.\n\nIn the far background, the landscape features layered rock formations typical of canyons or desert regions, under a bright blue sky with a few clouds. The natural formations in the distance add a dramatic element to the scene, underlining the adventurous aspect of the hike.\n\nOverall, the composition accentuates the challenge and beauty of hiking in such an environment. The clear, sunny weather conditions also suggest that this image was taken during a favorable time for hiking.\n","title":"Backpackng in the maze, a wild and rugged region in the heart of the canyonlands.

Previous experience is necessary: water is scarce, the terrain harsh, and help is sometimes days away but the rewards are great and many people feel that this is the only way to fully experience the canyonlands","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544305","545772","545785","554503","545700","545751","545768","544906","545762","544301","544903","544902","545758","545759","554504","545766"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiking","boulder","hike","backpack","desert","brace","short","trek","formation","hiker"]}
