{"path":"544096.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph shows a large open-pit mining site characterized by deep, layered, and terraced excavation areas. The colors within the pit are a mix of dark browns and shades of black, perhaps indicating the presence of coal or other minerals. The pit displays a pattern of terraced levels that are created as excavation progresses, allowing for the extraction of resources from progressively deeper layers.\n\nThe site is vast, with visible tire tracks and paths crisscrossing the surface, suggestive of frequent vehicle movement. A few large industrial vehicles, possibly dump trucks or excavation machinery, can be seen within the pit, underscoring the operational nature of the site. These vehicles appear very small relative to the overall size of the mining area, emphasizing the immense scale of the operation.\n\nLines of utility poles are discernible, potentially for electrical power distribution needed for mining operations. The overall terrain around the pit appears barren, with minimal vegetation or other landmarks, focusing the viewer’s attention solely on the human-engineered landscape. The photograph’s perspective suggests it was taken from an elevated position, giving an extensive overview of the site’s complex and rugged terrain.","title":"The Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine. The mine is 1,100 ft. deep; the first 500 ft. was alluvium, a waste product. The operation has a 10 to 1 ratio of waste to usable ore.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["544110","549241","544112","544054","553049","544111","549172","544785","544789","549242","552177","555621","554631","544100","544064","549177"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["pit","excavation","site","mining","vehicle","overview","distribution","operation","black","extraction"]}
