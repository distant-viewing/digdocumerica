{"path":"545476.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image depicts an X-ray of a human chest displayed on a viewing box or screen that radiologists typically use to examine such images. The X-ray itself shows the bony structures of the rib cage, the spinal column, and the darker areas that represent the lung fields. There is also a visible clavicle and the faint outlines of the heart and mediastinum visible in the central region between the lungs.\n\nThe darkness at the bottom part of the image reveals a hand, identifiable by the outline of fingers and a thumb. This hand is holding a pointer, which is being used to indicate or highlight a specific area or feature within the X-ray. The pointer's tip is directed towards the right side of the X-ray image, although the specific anatomical feature or issue being pointed at isn't discernible simply from the image.\n\nThere is slight wear or damage visible on the surface, denoted by a few scratch marks across the X-ray. The overall atmosphere evoked is clinical, typical of a medical setting where diagnostics like these are commonly analyzed. The photograph has a practical and educational context, likely used for explaining, diagnosing, or teaching about human anatomy and medical conditions based on chest X-rays.","title":"A lung damaged by emphysema is much larger than a normal lung.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545474","553034","556567","558167","556568","545395","545403","558168","556572","556574","556556","555176","545482","548463","547399","548861"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["ray","outline","cage","screen","scratch","heart","finger","tip","chest","mark"]}
