{"path":"547437.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of a crowded place, likely a public event or gathering. The focus is on two central figures, a man and a woman, both of whom are clad in distinctive hats. The man to the left wears a checked flat cap and appears to be looking downwards at something out of view. The woman to the right sports a white lace hat and is seen with a somber or reflective facial expression, staring forward.\n\nThe lighting is somewhat dim, casting shadows across their faces and contributing to an overall moody atmosphere. The background and peripheral areas are blurred, with hints of other individuals and possibly movements, suggesting a bustling environment. The use of color is quite rich, adding a depth to the composition, with the warm tones appearing prominently through the blur. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of immediacy and the personal experiences within a public space.","title":"At the annual intra-mural football game of the university of Nebraska, one of the biggest sports events of the year","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553275","553304","553709","558291","543482","547438","553176","553178","553217","553202","551813","557040","553822","554179","558295","551808"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["immediacy","lace","downward","hat","check","clad","woman","blur","experience","sport"]}
