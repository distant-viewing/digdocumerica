{"path":"550406.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a stunning aerial view of a rugged, snow-capped mountain landscape under a clear sky. In the foreground, at the base of the mountains, there is a small, isolated settlement consisting of several buildings, which are likely part of a remote village or research station. The shadows cast by the low sun accentuate the contours of the terrain, emphasizing the sweeping valleys and sharp peaks.\n\nThe terrain is predominantly covered in snow, suggesting a cold, possibly Arctic or sub-Arctic location. Several patches of exposed ground create contrasting dark areas amidst the bright snow-covered surfaces. A river or stream snakes its way through the valley, partially frozen, adding a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nThe atmosphere of the scene is serene yet harsh, conveying the beauty and isolation of this extreme environment. The photograph captures the vastness and raw nature of this wilderness area, showcasing the interaction between human habitation and the natural world in such a remote setting.","title":"Looking southwest toward galbraith lake camp and the brooks range","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550514","550423","542519","550410","550402","542520","550401","550515","543750","550501","550416","550413","550419","550502","550500","550408"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","valley","sweep","village","mountain","settlement","snake","world","habitation","research"]}
