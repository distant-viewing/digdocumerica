{"path":"547784.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene urban park setting. The foreground features a large, rugged concrete structure on the left, likely part of a bridge or walkway, with branches from nearby trees arching into the frame from the top. The middle ground shows a calm body of water, likely a lake or pond, containing a fountain that's actively spraying water, creating a dynamic focal point. The surrounding area is lush with grass and scattered trees, suggesting a well-maintained public park.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a number of tall, seemingly residential buildings that characterize an urban skyline. The atmosphere appears peaceful, with a few individuals visible around the parkâ€™s edge, engaged in quiet activities such as sitting or walking. Overall, the composition offers a balanced view of nature amidst the city, with elements of architecture, landscaping, and recreation.","title":"Turtle Creek in Lee Park","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["551776","550752","557282","550052","551772","549815","550298","550747","550075","557257","548406","546535","551647","550762","557258","547251"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["park","landscaping","fountain","recreation","walkway","pond","number","skyline","bridge","branch"]}
