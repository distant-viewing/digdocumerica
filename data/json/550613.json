{"path":"550613.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a landscape, which includes a long, straight highway cutting across various types of terrains. The highway stretches from the bottom right corner diagonally towards the upper left side of the image. Surrounding the highway are large expanses of dense forests, primarily composed of dark green trees. This greenery subtly transitions into more brownish and barren areas, particularly visible near the center and bottom of the image. \n\nSeveral small bodies of water reflect light, appearing brighter against the darker shades of the land. These include two notable ponds located near the bottom right and top right corners of the image. The terrain is irregular and varied, with some patches of land showing signs of marshiness or boggy conditions, especially near the water bodies.\n\nThe topography is mostly flat, and there are no visible buildings, vehicles, or people, emphasizing the remoteness and natural state of the region. The environment suggests a landscape that is primarily undeveloped, possibly located in a northern or wilderness area where infrastructure is minimal. The overall mood of the scene is serene and untouched, providing a snapshot of nature intersected by human-made infrastructure.","title":"Intersection of pipeline with Richardson Highway.
