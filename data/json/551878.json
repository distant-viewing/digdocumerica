{"path":"551878.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling urban scene centered on a Hitachi-branded train. The train, painted in white and blue, stands stationary with its doors closed. Above one of the compartments, there's a prominent Hitachi logo. A digital display next to the logo likely indicates the train's route or destination, though itâ€™s not clearly visible.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals are seen; their attention is not directed towards the camera. To the left, a woman with blonde hair, wearing a light blue jacket and a darker blue skirt, walks by while holding a shopping bag adorned by the Olympic rings, suggesting a context or period related to the Olympic Games. Another woman and a man stand on the right side, appearing to be either waiting for the train or just engaging in a casual conversation; only the woman's profile is visible while the man is facing the train.\n\nThe background is somewhat blurred and indistinct which subtly emphasizes the focus on the foreground activity around the train. Moreover, the natural lighting and the composition of the elements suggest this photograph was taken during daytime, in a possibly busy urban train station setting.","title":"This small 8-seater trolley is used as a hinge so that two larger ones in front and back can get around a sharp turn.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["556670","556026","556091","551889","556827","549650","551883","556845","556767","556044","556821","556076","555985","556693","556823","556817"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","logo","woman","ring","compartment","destination","shopping","brand","route","skirt"]}
