{"path":"552546.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph prominently features a collection of large rocks. The rocks vary in size and shape but most are angular and jagged. The color palette is mostly a mix of dark gray and lighter grayish-white tones, which suggest they could be limestone or shale. The lighting in the image is intense and direct, indicating that the photograph was likely taken under bright sunlight, casting deep shadows between the rocks, enhancing the texture and three-dimensional feel of the image.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the photograph; its focus is solely on the geological features. The background is filled by more rocks, continuously extending the texture and tones seen in the foreground. This suggests the photograph could be set in a rocky landscape, possibly part of a dry, barren terrain or a mountainous area.\n\nOverall, the composition tightly frames the rocky surfaces, giving a sense of rugged and natural environment, emphasizing the harsh and uninhabited characteristics of the location. The play of light and shadow, along with the varying textures of the rocks, provides a dynamic visual interest.","title":"Oil shale.
