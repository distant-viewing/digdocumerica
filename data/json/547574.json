{"path":"547574.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image provides a view of an industrial area leading into a shipyard with a backdrop of a tree-covered hillside and distant landmarks.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a busy industrial yard. A large building with a flat roof, a light-brown exterior, and large black doors occupies the lower portion of the frame. In front of this building, various items such as pallets, crates, and machinery scattered around. Positioned prominently is a truck and behind it are cylindrical storage tanks, clusters of barrels, and vehicles in varying sizes and colors, suggesting a bustling work environment.\n\nMoving towards the midground, there are several railroad tracks extending parallel across the image. These tracks are prominently noticeable and seem to lead into or out of the shipyard. The visibility of train cars indicates active rail transportation. Another large ship is docked in the harbor, which features prominently and suggests this area's role in import-export activities.\n\nThe background features a shipyard with a large ship docked. The ship is old, with visible rust and a faded hull, indicating it might be in for repairs or maintenance. Beyond the shipyard, the landscape ascends into a hillside densely covered in greenery, suggesting the area borders a more residential or less developed region.\n\nRising from the hill, and noteworthy in the skyline, are striking structures. A lighthouse-like tower punctuates the view, characterized by its red and white segmented coloration suggesting it might be an observational or communication tower. Just to the side of this structure, barely visible in the framework of the image, appears to be a slightly futuristic structure or possibly a water tower.\n\nAbove it all, the sky is filled with clouds, hinting at overcast weather which casts a soft diffuse light over the scene, muting the colors to soft hues of greens, grays, and earth tones, which bathes the whole scene in a typical industrial atmosphere.","title":"Fields Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555776","548346","548423","545147","552244","546359","551609","550886","550890","550963","550021","549969","555738","555724","546016","547667"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["shipyard","ship","tower","hillside","track","pallet","lighthouse","parallel","crate","communication"]}
