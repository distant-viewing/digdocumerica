{"path":"551298.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image captures a vibrant and dynamic scene at a fair or amusement park at night. The photo highlights two people, one of whom appears to be an operator, standing on a platform adjacent to a brightly lit amusement ride. They are dressed in carnival-style attire, featuring vertical-striped shirts, each wearing bell-bottom pants, which give a sense of the era the photo might have been taken.\n\nThe ride itself is spectacularly illuminated with numerous small, white bulbs that outline its structure, adding a bright, enchanting glow against the darker night sky. The viewpoint of the photo is slightly tilted, emphasizing the motion and height of the ride. \n\nIn the midst of the scene is the blurred motion of another ride, captured in a swirl of lights that creates an abstract pattern of white streaks against the dark background, giving the photograph a sense of movement and energy.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast of light and dark, the patterns of the lights, and the attire of the characters to convey a festive, lively atmosphere typical of a night at a bustling carnival.","title":"Ablaze with lights, the trabant, a german amusement ride stands at the entrance to \"fun city\".  \"fun city\" is a recently opened establishment on \"the strip,\" a mile-long commercial playground beginning at bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551297","545460","545458","551299","545465","545448","547278","545444","545464","551295","545456","549623","553298","545454","545449","551325"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["ride","carnival","night","amusement","motion","bulb","operator","bell","photo","streak"]}
