{"path":"553750.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a multi-story car parking structure in the foreground with a large apartment building in the background. The parking structure is several stories high and is packed with cars of various models and colors on each visible level.\n\nThe parking structure features large letters across its facade that spell out \"ALOHA CHEVROLET OK US.\" These words and letters are painted in a bold, red font and distributed across the levels, creating a visually striking advertisement or signage.\n\nIn the background, behind the parking structure, there is a tall apartment building. This building has a light-colored facade and is equipped with numerous balconies, suggesting residential use. Each balcony appears to be covered, running the length of the building, and there are multiple columns of balconies visible.\n\nThe surroundings, beyond the infrastructure captured in the frame, indicate an urban environment with other structures barely visible in the distant background. The image has a somewhat vintage feel to it, suggestive of a scene from the mid-to-late 20th century based on the architectural styles and car models visible.","title":"Every foot of space must count on the island: 4-decker car dealer's showroom and high-rise apartments","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553751","555748","557292","556790","556722","546685","547826","549875","546715","548432","546879","543961","547686","556721","546708","556773"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","balcony","apartment","letter","model","facade","spell","level","car","font"]}
