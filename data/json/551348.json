{"path":"551348.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene, likely taken from an elevated viewpoint near or on a forested slope. The primary focus is on a clear blue river or stream gracefully meandering through a wooded landscape. The water is transparent and mirrors the sky's reflection, tinting it a vibrant blue. The riverbanks are lined with lush green trees and dense underbrush, with some of the branches overhanging directly into the water, glistening with moisture, suggesting either recent rainfall or a damp climate.\n\nOn one side of the river, there is a noticeable clearing where the bank transitions from water to a sandy or possibly gravelly shore, providing a small beach-like area. The sand strip is bordered by the dense forest and bushes, enhancing a sense of seclusion and natural beauty.\n\nLight interaction in the scene highlights the vivid colors of the foliage and the water's reflective quality. The top part of the image shows the lighter sky through the tree canopy, while the lower section shows a more shaded view into the river depths and forest floor. The overall composition is peaceful and evocative of a quiet, remote woodland location, ideal for contemplation or enjoying nature undisturbed.","title":"Spring waters caught in a trough between high ridges at Ha Ha Tonka form a lake of approximately two acres. The water issues from Gunter's Big Spring. It is crystal clear and on dull days gives a glow as if lit from beneath. The Bluff from which the spring flows is pictured here behind the sand bar.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["550656","546171","544861","555075","542523","550839","542844","557250","555076","554629","554762","550845","545861","558085","554406","550717"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","underbrush","seclusion","overhang","woodland","forest","rainfall","ideal","glisten","moisture"]}
