{"path":"550412.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic winter mountain scene. In the image, a mountain is covered with patches of snow and rugged rocky surfaces. The mountain's stark, layered rock formations are distinctly visible, exhibiting shades of dark brown and gray, interspersed with white snow that highlights the contours and ledges of the terrain. These layers suggest various stages of sediment deposition and erosion, which is typical in mountainous regions.\n\nThe mountain peak and its surrounding areas are devoid of any vegetation, signifying a high altitude or a particularly harsh environment where flora cannot thrive. The background of the photo shows neighboring mountain peaks and slopes that are also snow-covered, enhancing the cold and isolated ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates either early morning or late afternoon, as the light strikes one side of the mountain, casting some parts into shadow and illuminating others. This interplay of light and shadow accentuates the rugged texture of the mountainâ€™s surface.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the majestic and raw beauty of the winter mountain landscape, conveying a sense of tranquility and the formidable power of nature. No human activity or presence is visible, highlighting the untouched and pristine condition of the environment.","title":"An isolated rock buttress at the west end of peak 5308 at the entrance to the atigun gorge","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550514","550416","550505","555681","550422","550415","550515","550504","550501","550413","543831","550408","550591","550421","550425","550500"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","winter","peak","snow","deposition","neighbor","layer","ledge","thrive","signify"]}
