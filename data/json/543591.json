{"path":"543591.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site during the development stage of what appears to be a residential or commercial building project. It features several rectangular foundation forms composed of cinder blocks and lumber, arranged in a way that details the layout of future buildings. Throughout the site, various construction materials such as timber planks and cinder blocks are stacked and scattered. There are also sections of the wooden framework already assembled on the foundations.\n\nIn the foreground, a vintage white and blue pick-up truck is parked next to the building foundations, suggesting the ongoing presence of workers. At least one construction worker is visible, identifiable by his hard hat as he bends over some woodwork, seemingly engaged in measuring or cutting.\n\nThe background presents a contrasting atmosphere with completed buildings that emulate a rustic architectural style, possibly indicating a mountain resort area. Notable among these is an establishment with a sign reading \"LAKESHORE PINE RESTAURANT.\" Behind these structures, densely wooded mountains rise under a clear blue sky, establishing a scenic, natural setting often associated with tourist or recreational regions.\n\nThis setting paints a lively scene of architectural development with a balanced integration into a picturesque natural environment, hinting at the blending of functional construction with aesthetic considerations appropriate for leisure or residential purposes in a scenic locale.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543583","547829","547833","550737","543592","553922","556635","556940","550273","557728","543584","557730","546988","548551","553703","543593"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["foundation","cinder","construction","block","worker","blending","cutting","woodwork","consideration","development"]}
