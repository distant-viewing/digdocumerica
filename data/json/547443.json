{"path":"547443.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a group of elderly men engaged in an informal gathering outdoors. The focus is on three men prominently displayed in the foreground. All three are wearing hats and suits, suggesting the photo may be from an era when this was more common, possibly around mid-20th century.\n\nThe man on the left is wearing a dark suit and a black hat, and is leaning slightly into the middle man, who is wearing a light-colored hat and a suit in a muted tone. They appear to be in conversation. The man on the right, standing slightly closer to the camera, sports a broad smile and is dressed in a light gray suit with a striped gray tie and a gray fedora. He is holding a small book or notepad.\n\nIn the background, additional individuals are visible, dressed similarly in suits; one of them is engaged in a conversation with someone unseen. Behind them is a somewhat rural background, featuring open fields and a tree-lined area. A vintage car is also partially visible on the left side of the frame, further setting the historical context of the image.\n\nThe clothing, the relaxed yet engaged postures of the men, and the outdoor setting combine to suggest a gathering of friends or colleagues, possibly around an event or a meeting, in a rural or semi-rural setting. The overall atmosphere is cordial and pleasant.","title":"Members of the congregation of immanuel lutheran church of garland exchange greetings after sunday morning service","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553208","549293","554026","547359","547411","557145","551853","557856","553182","551459","547425","556528","556247","549908","556543","551854"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["suit","man","hat","colleague","gathering","fedora","conversation","meeting","friend","engage"]}
