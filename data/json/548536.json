{"path":"548536.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a quaint tourist train resembling an old-fashioned steam locomotive in a sunny coastal setting, suggesting it might be in a vacation spot, perhaps in a place like Key West, as indicated by the text on the train. The train, which sports a classic black and yellow design, includes a locomotive section and at least one passenger carriage.\n\nThe locomotive section has a large, black, tank-like body with \"CONCH TOUR TRAIN\" written in yellow lettering, suggesting itâ€™s named after the local term \"Conch\" often used to describe people from the Florida Keys. There's a prominent black smokestack completing the vintage look. The driver, wearing a white shirt and sunglasses, is seated at the front, actively steering or perhaps navigating the route.\n\nThe attached passenger carriage is open-air with a roof that provides shade, covered with a striped fabric. It is painted in vibrant yellow, enhancing the cheerful, tourist-friendly appeal. Passengers can be seen seated in the carriage; particularly notable is a woman facing away from the camera, which focuses more on her relaxed, leisurely pose than distinct facial expressions, reinforcing the casual, holiday environment.\n\nIn the background, a serene blue water body (likely the ocean or a sea) along with lush green foliage on the distant shore, and clear skies suggest a tranquil, picturesque setting typical of coastal tourist destinations. The ambiance is relaxed and leisurely, befitting a sightseeing tour in a sunny locale.","title":"The Conch Tour Train takes visitors on a fourteen mile circuit of the city and the naval base.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["557966","557956","556117","556857","557964","556118","557967","557963","554061","547843","555971","556759","556022","556009","556063","556784"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["carriage","tourist","passenger","train","sightseeing","describe","locomotive","holiday","vacation","tour"]}
