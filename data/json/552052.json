{"path":"552052.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This image captures a picturesque scene of a bridge and landscape. The photograph features a large acr bridge constructed with metal frameworks that create an arching, open-spandrel design. The bridge pier foundations are made of substantial masonry or concrete and are set prominently in the scene. Below the bridge is a riverbed, which appears mostly dry with small patches of water and mud, suggesting either a drought or a seasonal reduction in water level. \n\nThe foreground is dominated by rich, dense greenery, possibly shrubbery or small plants, which gives the scene a lush appearance and adds a contrast to the dryer riverbed. In the middle background, a cluster of residential houses, nestled between green trees, can be seen, implying that the bridge connects, or is near, a populated area. The houses are traditional and appear to be spread out across a hilly area that extends to the horizon.\n\nThe sky is partially covered with clouds, providing a dynamic and slightly dramatic effect to the lighting in the photograph. Overall, the composition, with its blend of industrial and natural elements, presents a serene yet vivid landscape.","title":"Sewer outlet on the north side of the 12th street bridge across the Kansas river","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["548064","557959","542734","549469","558048","548087","549547","558051","552247","549068","551527","552598","557969","557096","551186","548207"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","riverbed","masonry","drought","foundation","house","shrubbery","mud","concrete","pier"]}
