{"path":"553046.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive, flat surface with diagonal lines running across it, creating a pattern. The lines appear to be seams or joints, possibly on a surface made of concrete or another hard material. The photograph has a strong one-point perspective, with the lines converging towards the upper right-hand corner of the frame, giving a sense of depth and distance.\n\nThe coloring of the photograph is a warm, yellowish tint, which might be due to the type of film used or an effect added during processing. The surface has a rough texture visible upon closer inspection, with minor stains and variations in shading, suggesting it might be an outdoor environment subject to wear and weather conditions.\n\nThere are no people or obvious specific activities occurring in the photo. The background is minimalistic, mainly consisting of the continuation of the same patterned surface, stretching out toward the horizon line. The overall mood is calm and somewhat abstract, focusing purely on the pattern and perspective.","title":"Fields of dried barley. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
