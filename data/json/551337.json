{"path":"551337.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene featuring two elderly people, likely in a small room or booth. The primary figure is a woman standing close to a window, on the left, facing the camera with a slight sideways glance. She is wearing a floral patterned blouse and large, rounded glasses. The lighting falling on her from the window illuminates her face and glasses, giving her a thoughtful appearance as she holds and shows a black folder or book.\n\nThe second person, a man, is seen from behind and is slightly out of focus compared to the woman. He is wearing a light-colored shirt and is facing towards the woman, appearing to be engaged in listening or talking to her. His presence suggests a conversational or interactive scene between the two.\n\nIn the background, there are pictures and possibly informational displays attached to the dark-colored walls, suggesting that the room could be part of a museum, exhibition, or educational venue. The overall ambiance is somewhat dimly lit, with the main source of natural light coming from the window next to the woman. This light casts soft shadows and contributes to the intimate and focused atmosphere of the interaction depicted.","title":"At the second reunion of inhabitants of old Linn Creek, Mrs. Lena Hall, retired school teacher, looks at photographs of her former home town.
