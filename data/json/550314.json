{"path":"550314.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque view of a coastal town seen from a high vantage point, possibly a hill or elevated area. The picture is dominated by the broad, flat expanse of a grayish blue body of water that reflects a subtly cloudy sky.\n\nTo the right, a small lighthouse, painted white with a red top, stands on a tiny island or rocky outcrop close to the shore, following a quaint and typical maritime motif. The lighthouse is connected to the mainland by what appears to be a narrow causeway.\n\nThe main focus on the left is a cluster of houses and buildings on the opposite side of the water. These buildings are densely packed and vary in color, predominantly in hues of white, red, and gray, set against a backdrop of trees in various shades of green. The architecture suggests a residential area with some larger structures which could include public buildings or local businesses.\n\nIn the foreground, the land is covered with wild, untamed grass and shrubs, suggesting that the photo was taken from a natural or less developed area. The overall mood of the photograph is calm and slightly melancholic, possibly due to the overcast sky and the muted colors of the landscape and buildings.\n\nNo people are visible in the scene, which adds to the tranquil and somewhat solitary atmosphere of the photo. The composition successfully conveys a sense of peaceful coastal life, with a focus on the interplay between human habitation and the natural environment.","title":"Lubec, looking west from Campobello Island.
