{"path":"544081.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an aging brick building, the surface marked by time and elements, showcasing vintage advertisements painted directly onto the bricks. The prominent advertisement on the right side of the building is for Pepsi-Cola, featuring bold, curved red lettering with a white outline and shadow effect, emphasizing the 'Pepsi-Cola' script. The phrase \"Drink Pepsi-Cola\" is visibile above the main logo.\n\nTo the left of the Pepsi advert, there's a smaller, somewhat faded advertisement for Nesbitt's California Orange soda. This ad includes a representation of an orange soda bottle alongside the striking orange text on a darker background, which also promotes the beverage as a \"Drink.\"\n\nThe building itself shows considerable signs of wear: the brickwork is discolored and uneven, with visible cracks and patches lacking mortar. There are four windows visible; they are closed and show no signs of curtains or any other coverings. The paint from the ads has faded and chipped over time, suggesting the vintage nature of these advertisements and the long history of the wall as an advertising space. The red brick wall serves simultaneously as a reminder of a past aesthetic of urban advertising and the enduring nature of these iconic brands. The angle of the photo captures the nostalgic essence, giving viewers a sense of both decay and the lasting impact of commercial art in public spaces.","title":"Ubiquitous advertising signs in an old mining town","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["552512","544113","552478","552459","544088","552518","552529","545355","556232","550141","547805","554298","546051","545411","552463","556631"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["advertisement","ad","soda","advertising","brick","drink","script","discolor","covering","fade"]}
