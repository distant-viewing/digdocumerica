{"path":"542732.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene, likely taken in a mountainous or forested park area. The foreground prominently features the weathered, rough texture of a large fallen tree trunk, angled diagonally across the bottom left corner of the frame. This element adds a natural ruggedness to the scene.\n\nBeyond this, the middle ground unfolds into a small clearing surrounded by tall, dense conifer trees. This area is dappled with sunlight, creating a bright and inviting space. In the clearing, there are several people involved in leisure activities; some are standing and appear to be chatting or observing their surroundings, while others might be involved in setting up a campsite or preparing for a hike.\n\nNotably, the clearing includes a couple of makeshift structures or tents, suggesting that this is a popular spot for camping or outdoor gatherings. The overall setting is peaceful and remote, with no visible signs of modern infrastructure, making it an ideal depiction of nature retreat and outdoor recreation.\n\nThe background is dominated by more evergreen trees against a clear blue sky, enhancing the sense of seclusion and wilderness. The composition of the photograph, with its inclusion of fallen wood, people casually engaging with nature, and lush forestry, effectively conveys a narrative of adventure and tranquility in a natural setting.","title":"Big stump meadow","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["545293","543446","542604","543599","555151","543388","542791","557985","558012","542728","553464","543445","558088","554663","554667","547045"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["clearing","campsite","dapple","chat","hike","inclusion","retreat","tent","unfold","involve"]}
