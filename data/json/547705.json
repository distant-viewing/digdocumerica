{"path":"547705.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a serene landscape scene at twilight or early evening. The primary subjects are large, leafless trees with intricately branched silhouettes occupying the left and right sides of the frame. These trees, possibly oaks, display a detailed network of branches that spread across the image, contributing to a somber yet beautiful aesthetic.\n\nBehind the trees, the sky is an ombre of colors transitioning from a deep blue at the top to lighter hues near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The clouds are sparse and soft, adding a gentle contrast to the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, just below the horizon, there's a distant line of street lamps emitting a luminous yellow glow, indicating the presence of a road or a developed area. These lights are small due to the distance but noticeably bright against the dimming sky.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, the silhouette of a fence or barrier can be observed, partially obscured by the darkened foreground, which likely represents the ground or a low lying field.\n\nThis photograph evokes a calm and reflective mood, emphasizing natural forms and the subtle interplay of light and shadow during the evening or early morning hours. The composition, with its strong nature elements and hints of human presence, paints a picture of tranquility and the quiet transition between day and night.","title":"Trees frame mail and newspaper boxes along Lake Front Road at Bass Lake on Lake Michigan.","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["543621","547546","554731","542625","546533","553578","554403","543410","543016","556473","543137","555119","557579","557013","542849","553579"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["oak","transition","evening","dim","branch","silhouette","darken","sunrise","night","horizon"]}
