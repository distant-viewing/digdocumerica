{"path":"543621.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody woodland scene, predominantly featuring a group of tall, slender trees against a dusk or twilight sky. The trees, which are without leaves, suggest that it is either winter or early spring. Their branches are intricate and bare, crisscrossing against the sky, creating a natural lattice pattern. \n\nThe sky in the background is a gradient of colors, transitioning from a darker blue at the top to softer shades of purple and pink near the horizon, possibly indicating that the sun has recently set. This soft, multi-hued backdrop contrasts sharply with the dark silhouettes of the trees.\n\nThere is a feeling of quiet and stillness in the image, with no visible movement or wildlife. The composition utilizes a vertical perspective, giving a sense of height and emphasizing the trees reaching towards the sky. The natural setting and limited color palette convey a tranquil, almost contemplative mood.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["553579","547705","553578","542849","555119","543406","555122","553575","555081","554731","553574","554403","556473","548744","542625","555217"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lattice","tree","crisscross","utilize","purple","stillness","gradient","wildlife","twilight","reach"]}
