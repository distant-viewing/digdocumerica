{"path":"544767.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged outdoor scene, featuring an old pickup truck heavily laden with a pile of wood, parked on a dirt road beside a water body. The truck is aged and shows signs of extensive use, with dirt and wear evident on its surface. Its bed is overloaded with branches and old wood, some pieces extending beyond the tailgate, suggesting the vehicle is used for hauling significant loads, possibly for clearing or gathering firewood.\n\nThe setting is a natural landscape with a large body of water visible next to the road where the truck is parked. In the background, expansive rocky cliffs and plateaus stretch across the horizon, conveying a sense of a remote or wilderness area. The terrain is rocky and uneven, covered with small stones and sparse vegetation, typical of arid or semi-arid environments. The sky is clear and bright, indicating a sunny day, which enhances the rugged textures and natural colors of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines elements of human activity within a natural setting, highlighting themes of work, the environment, and perhaps the challenges and beauty of rural or non-urban life.","title":"Colorado--Black Hawk","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["543588","555875","555154","554412","544061","552087","542609","543173","556429","557468","542853","553627","545930","553628","543896","554561"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["truck","haul","plateaus","wood","dirt","pickup","bed","clear","challenge","road"]}
