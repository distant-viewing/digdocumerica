{"path":"550522.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a rugged and remote landscape dominated by a large mountain and several winding rivers. The mountain in the foreground is prominent, with steep, rocky slopes that give it a distinctly jagged appearance. The mountain casts a shadow over part of its lower terrain, suggesting a time either earlier or later in the day.\n\nFlowing from the distant mountains, multiple rivers snake through the valley. One primary river, significantly wider than the others and with a lighter color suggesting either glacial melt or shallow, sediment-rich waters, curves prominently through the landscape, defining the valley's contours. Smaller streams feed into this river, creating a network of waterways.\n\nThe terrain is mostly barren of trees; it includes patches of grassy and shrub-filled areas, providing a minimal green hue to the otherwise stark and earthy colors of the landscape. The distant mountains under a light haze offer a sense of immense and uninhabited wilderness.\n\nThis image captures the untouched and dramatic beauty typical of high-altitude or polar regions, possibly indicative of an area within the Arctic or sub-Arctic zones, or a high mountain range where vegetation is sparse and conditions are harsh. The overcast sky contributes to the moody and wild nature of the scene.","title":"Sukakpak Mountain, view southeast. The pipeline will cross the Koyukuk River in the right foreground below the peak and then parallel the line of the mountain south along its western base. Sukakpak is a limestone mountain.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550402","550498","550523","555678","550507","550410","550403","550590","550401","550500","550632","550512","550518","550508","550609","550511"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","river","valley","sediment","altitude","terrain","contour","stream","waterway","curve"]}
