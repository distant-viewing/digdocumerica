{"path":"551092.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph shows an outdoor public swimming pool scene on a sunny day. In the foreground, a person is performing a dive from a high diving board, captured mid-air in a tucked position heading towards the water. The pool area is surrounded by various other people engaged in different activities: some appear to be preparing to swim, others are just diving in, and there are people sitting at the poolside, possibly sunbathing or watching the activities.\n\nThe pool is equipped with multiple diving boards, both high and low. Off to the left, two girls are climbing up the steps of a lower diving board, while another person starts a dive from it. More people, including several children, are seen around the pool's edge, either standing or sitting on deck chairs.\n\nBeyond the pool, the background features a row of residential houses and a small building that might serve as a changing facility or a club house. The environment suggests a community in a valley setting, with rolling hills visible in the distance under a lightly clouded sky. The houses and trees around the pool create a typical suburban atmosphere, enhancing the communal, leisurely ambiance of the scene.","title":"Glasgow swimming pool is the only one between Charleston and montgomery","placename":"Charleston (W.
