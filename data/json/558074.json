{"path":"558074.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene autumn landscape. In the foreground, there is a variegated display of foliage and wildflowers, including vibrant red leaves, presumably from sumac trees, intertwined with clusters of small purple and white flowers. These colorful plants are densely packed, creating a lush layer of vegetation at the lower part of the image.\n\nThe middle ground is composed of a thick band of trees; here, the fall colors transition to shades of gold, orange, and lingering greens. The trees appear in a mixed forest setting, suggesting a variety of species, which contribute to the multi-hued tapestry of leaves.\n\nThe background shows a subtle hint of a hill or a rising terrain, completely covered in trees and showing the full splendor of autumn colors. Above this scenic natural tapestry, the sky casts a dramatic effect, with dark, stormy clouds suggesting an impending change in weather, adding a sense of dynamic contrast to the otherwise tranquil and picturesque setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its rich layers of color and texture, draws the viewerâ€™s eye across a natural spectrum of forest and sky, reflecting the beauty and transient nature of the autumn season. The looming clouds also add a touch of drama and the unpredictability of nature to the peaceful woodland scene.","title":"New England aster (novae anglicae) and rich fall color along Riverview Road at Snowville Road near Brecksville and Cleveland, Ohio.
