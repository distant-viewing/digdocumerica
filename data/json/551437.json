{"path":"551437.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene where three women are interacting around a small, metallic promotional booth. Two of the women are dressed in promotional attire featuring white wide-brimmed hats and white button-up shirts, both emblazoned with a logo that includes a red circle and the text, which appears to say \"Butte Special\". They seem to be employees engaging in promotional activities, possibly handing out flyers or samples. Each has a professional and cheerful demeanor.\n\nThe third woman, not dressed in the promotional uniform, has long blonde hair and is wearing a sleeveless, dark purple top. She appears to be a customer or a passerby interacting with the promotional staff. The setting is lively and informal, likely a public, possibly urban area, given the hints of trees and a bustling background that suggests a street or public square filled with people.\n\nThe general mood conveyed by the image is casual and businesslike, focused on a promotional or marketing activity. The vintage style of the clothing and overall ambiance, including the film quality and aesthetic, suggests that this photograph might be from several decades ago, possibly the 1970s, highlighting a slice of life and consumer interaction from that era.","title":"Fund raising for charity on Nicollet Mall--these women are selling tickets to \"Duffs Celebrity Golf Tourney.\"","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["554391","553761","543932","551466","550079","558252","549678","553204","551808","551436","553275","556532","558295","558194","551718","547772"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["interact","woman","employee","consumer","staff","circle","booth","customer","sample","say"]}
