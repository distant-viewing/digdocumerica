{"path":"545552.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph displays a healthcare setting where an elderly man is being attended to by a doctor or medical professional. The elderly man is laying down on a hospital bed and appears to be receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula. He is dressed in a white hospital gown and glasses, and has visible wrinkles on his hands, which are resting on his abdomen.\n\nStanding next to him is a middle-aged man, presumed to be a doctor, who is intently focused on adjusting the medical equipment, possibly the oxygen supply. He is wearing glasses and donned in a dark suit with a distinctively patterned tie and a light green shirt.\n\nThe background is quite simple, featuring clinical elements such as a pale blue curtain, a part of an IV stand holding a bottle, and a heating or cooling unit fixed high on the wall. The overall lighting in the room is soft and the atmosphere conveys a sense of calm professionalism.","title":"Dr. A.H. Russakoff attends a patient suffering red lung.
