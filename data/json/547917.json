{"path":"547917.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a stark and somewhat desolate scene with two main subjects: a derelict car and an unoccupied multistory building.\n\nForeground:\n- In the foreground, there is an old car with its hood and one door open. The car appears to be abandoned and in disrepair. It is a mid-20th-century model, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, with a white exterior and a red interior. The car is tilted to one side, suggesting it may be stuck or partially sunken into the ground.\n\nBackground:\n- Behind the car stands a tall, unoccupied building that appears to be in a state of incompletion or disrepair. This building is rectangular and features many balconies or structural protrusions on its exterior. It is about eight or nine stories tall and constructed with a brick-like material, which has patches of discoloration or damage.\n- The surrounding area is barren with sparse vegetation and scattered debris, giving the impression of a neglected or abandoned site, possibly on the outskirts of an urban area.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of abandonment and decay, emphasizing themes of urban decline or the remnants of industrialization. The overcast sky contributes to the melancholy and forbidding atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Abandoned car and unfinished apartment house construction of highrises on breezy point Peninsula was stopped by city in major effort to conserve area for public recreation","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547587","546400","553007","550279","552997","544809","547481","547771","553010","545540","553009","549785","545295","549107","544060","556330"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","disrepair","abandon","exterior","protrusion","tilte","derelict","discoloration","industrialization","decline"]}
