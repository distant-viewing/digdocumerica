{"path":"554870.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a relaxed scene inside what appears to be an automotive shop or a similar setting focused on vehicle maintenance. There are three men visible in the image, with each portrayed in casual, seated positions, suggesting a break or a lull in their workday.\n\nThe man on the left side of the photo is wearing a red cap and a red zip-up jacket over a darker shirt. He sits on a metal stool and rests his booted foot on a box adorned with automotive branding. This individual has a demeanor of amusement or contentment while engaging in what seems to be a friendly conversation.\n\nThe central figure slightly sits behind and is comfortably leaning back on a simple office chair, which appears to be unique amidst the otherwise utilitarian setting. He wears a red pullover and dark pants. His posture and relaxed arms crossed over his lap indicate a casual moment of rest. A display rack filled with various automotive products, including oils and lubricants, is clearly visible next to him.\n\nTo the right of the image, another man, dressed in a white t-shirt and brown pants, sits with one leg crossed over the other. He leans back into a stylish swivel chair casually, mirroring the relaxed expression seen in his companions. This person appears to be in mid-conversation or a moment of thoughtfulness.\n\nThe background of the photograph includes various details pertinent to a shop environment: rows of neatly arranged automotive products, a metallic filing cabinet, promotional and informational posters hanging on the walls, and another commercial rack with assorted goods. Notably, there's also a wild boar head mounted high on the wall, adding a distinct and personal touch to the decor, suggesting either a local cultural element or a personal interest of the shop owner.\n\nThe environment is lit with natural light, diffused through what might be shop windows or doorways, casting soft shadows and contributing to the laid-back atmosphere of the scene. Overall, the image offers a glimpse into the everyday life at a local automotive shop, where camaraderie and casual conversation mix with the tools and trappings of manual labor.","title":"Interior of a local gas station in Leakey, Texas, during the noon hour, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549947","557852","557883","557906","557864","557902","557897","557858","553802","557835","545984","557867","546628","542763","549652","546225"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["shop","rack","conversation","product","chair","contentment","stool","owner","workday","companion"]}
