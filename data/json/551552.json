{"path":"551552.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and atmospheric view of a natural landscape under a bright sun. The image mainly features a vast, open space that appears to be a muddy or silt-filled river or floodplain. The terrain is uneven and covered in deep grooves and patterns that suggest the movement of water, possibly a quickly drying area or a shallow riverbed.\n\nThe sky dominates the top part of the image, cast with clusters of clouds and a bright sun directly above, causing a flare and a streak of lens flares cascading downwards through the frame. The sunlight is intense enough to create a high contrast scene with deep shadows and bright highlights reflecting off the water surfaces below.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a line of lush greenery, perhaps bushes or low-lying shrubs, which forms a natural boundary that frames the bottom edge of the image. This greenery is a stark contrast to the barren, muddy ground of the central and far landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of this image is both ethereal and rugged, presenting a moment of natural wonder and rough beauty under strong sunlight, producing a mesmerizing yet stark visual effect.","title":"Reserve Mining Company's dump site on Lake Superior.
