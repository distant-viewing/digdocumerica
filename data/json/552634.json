{"path":"552634.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a worker, likely a butcher, engaged in the process of meat preparation in an industrial setting. The man is wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a yellow apron over a white shirt with a yellow tie, suggesting an environment where both cleanliness and safety are prioritized. He is actively trimming or inspecting a large piece of meat, which is suspended from a hook overhead, likely part of a beef carcass given its size and shape.\n\nThe background is dimly lit and features metallic surfaces and what appears to be a yellow wall, indicative of an environment designed for food processing tasks. The floor is not fully visible but suggests an industrial setting through its glimpse of a concrete or similarly sturdy material. Notably, the focus and lighting are primarily centered on the man and the meat, highlighting the intricacies of his task and the physicality of the work. This image captures a moment of concentration and skill in meat processing, reflecting both the expertise necessary for the profession and the industrial nature of the setting.","title":"The Rifle Packing Plant, a family operation, processes locally grown livestock.
