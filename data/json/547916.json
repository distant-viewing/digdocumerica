{"path":"547916.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a towering lighthouse set against a soft, azure sky scattered with wispy clouds. The lighthouse is a tall, cylindrical structure made from what appears to be rugged stone or stucco, colored in a blend of off-white and light gray tints with natural aging signs like spots and streaks. It features a black lantern room at the top where the light would be housed, surrounded by a metal railing.\n\nSeveral small rectangular windows punctuate the lighthouse's facade, allowing sparse light to enter. Adjacent to the lighthouse is a small building, likely the keeper's house or an equipment storage, with a gable roof and a blue door that provides a pop of color in contrast to the muted tones of the lighthouse itself. Nearby, there's a glimpse of another building with a red roof, partially visible, suggesting this lighthouse is part of a larger complex, possibly located within a maritime or harbor setting.\n\nSurrounding the base of the lighthouse, lush greenery and foliage are evident, indicating the lighthouse is situated in a well-vegetated area, enhancing its picturesque and serene appearance.","title":"Sandy Hook's Fort Hancock lighthouse, oldest in America","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["543141","546151","543086","544996","550361","545118","549375","547131","550362","542796","547154","550314","551600","543403","550360","543426"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","stucco","lantern","pop","streak","tint","maritime","harbor","roof","railing"]}
