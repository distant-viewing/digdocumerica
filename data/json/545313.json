{"path":"545313.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a sweeping landscape with a dramatic mountain range in the background. The mountains are characterized by their craggy peaks, partially covered with snow, indicating possibly higher altitudes and colder temperatures at their summits. In the foreground, there is a vast expanse of rolling hills and flatlands. The valley appears to be dotted with patches of forests and areas cleared for agriculture or other uses. Patches of red earth are visible, suggesting the soil might be rich in minerals or clay. \n\nSome human presence is indicated by small structures or houses and what seems to be roads or paths cutting through the landscape. No people are visible, suggesting the focus is on the natural environment rather than human activity. The lighting and the quality of the photograph suggest it might be taken during daytime with clear skies, as evidenced by the shadows and the bright illumination of the landscape. The overall composition presents a tranquil and almost untouched natural setting, drawing attention to the contrast between the rugged mountains and the more gentle terrain of the valley.","title":"Mancos River Valley","placename":"Mancos (Colo.)","location":"Mancos, Colorado","nn1":["550497","550634","550525","543750","550516","550441","550596","550510","552593","550415","545807","543720","550502","550609","542519","552144"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","valley","summit","clay","temperature","illumination","agriculture","mineral","daytime","clear"]}
