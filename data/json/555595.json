{"path":"555595.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph portrays a striking natural landscape featuring an expansive, deeply eroded canyon or gully. The erosion has created sharp, deep ridges which make the terrain appear dramatically textured. The colors in the terrain range from various shades of red and brown indicating possibly clay or iron-rich soil.\n\nVegetation sparsely inhabits the area; small green bushes and a few trees are scattered across the top edges of the terrain, giving a contrast to the otherwise barren, eroded ground. The top of the ridges appears more flat and covered by a thin layer of grass or low shrubbery.\n\nThe background reveals more forested areas, which seem largely unaffected by the erosion. The overall feel of the landscape indicates it might be a secluded region, not heavily altered by human activity, possibly highlighting a natural geological formation or the aftermath of some natural processes like heavy rainfall or river flow cutting through a softer type of rock or soil.\n\nThis scene is captured during daylight with adequate natural lighting, emphasizing the richness and depth of the earth tones and the rugged textures of the eroded ground.","title":"Strip mined land erodes if not recontoured by the coal companies.
