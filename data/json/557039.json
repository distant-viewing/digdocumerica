{"path":"557039.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a middle-aged woman in casual daytime attire, standing in what appears to be a bustling urban street. She is wearing a loosely fitted floral print blouse paired with a dark, patterned sleeveless vest and coordinating bright floral skirt. Her accessories include a wide-brimmed hat and a large shoulder bag. Her expression is gentle with a subtle smile, and she seems to be engaged in a conversation or an interactive situation, as she is looking intently towards someone off-camera and gesturing with her hand slightly raised.\n\nThe background features a blur of urban environment details, including partial views of other pedestrians, parked cars, and typical city infrastructure such as street lamps and building facades. The focus and depth of field blur suggest the photo might be taken with a portrait intent, emphasizing the subject while allowing the busy city life to meld into a less distinct backdrop.\n\nThe overall composition and the attire of the individual suggest a candid, everyday moment caught in an urban setting possibly during the late 20th century, given the style of clothing and film quality.","title":"Woman crosses the street at Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia.
