The architecture includes turrets and quaint windows, painted primarily in red, blue, and beige, giving it a whimsical, storybook appearance.\n\nTo the left of the wax museum, there's a multi-story building with numerous signs, one of which prominently displays \"Restaurant.\" Below this building is a street-level arcade with various shops displaying more signs, possibly for other attractions or eateries. The facade of this building is adorned with American flags, suggesting a theme or a patriotic celebration.\n\nAcross the street, other establishments can be seen, including one called \"Life Museum\" with banners advertising its name and possibly its offerings. The street itself is busy, with several 1970s-era cars parked and driving by, suggesting this photograph dates back a few decades.
