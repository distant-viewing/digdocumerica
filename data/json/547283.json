{"path":"547283.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This dramatic photograph captures a silhouette of a windmill against a sunset sky. The windmill, centered in the frame, is a traditional structure with a slender tower and triangular frame, showing a wheel at the top that is distinctly outlined. The background showcases a sunset, with the sun itself appearing as a large, vivid orange sphere partially dipping below the horizon. This creates a striking gradient of deep crimson blending into orange hues across the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, one can observe faint outlines of buildings' rooftops, suggesting the setting might be on the edge of a rural or semi-rural area. To the left of the windmill and higher in the sky, there is a small bright spot, possibly a star or distant aircraft. Additionally, there are a few lines in the sky, likely power lines strung between poles, that add subtle detail to the composition.\n\nThe overall ambiance is that of serenity and the timeless beauty of a rural sunset, highlighted by the stark contrast and simple, compelling lines of the windmill's silhouette.","title":"Windmill sunset","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["545848","545852","547347","545856","547345","549212","545832","549216","547293","549210","549213","555291","549211","558140","547289","545418"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["windmill","sunset","sphere","line","silhouette","serenity","star","rooftop","aircraft","gradient"]}
