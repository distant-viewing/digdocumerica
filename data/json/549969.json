{"path":"549969.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an industrial area with a slightly foggy or smoggy atmosphere. The scenery is dominated by large buildings, numerous parked cars, cargo containers, and other industrial logistics paraphernalia suggesting a busy industrial or dockyard zone. The area is surrounded by water, possibly a river or harbor, evidenced by a pier-like structure extending into the body of water.\n\nDirectly on the waterfront, there's a significant building with a tall, active smokestack emitting a plume of smoke or steam, contributing to the haziness above the scene. This building appears to be a power plant or some sort of factory due to its architectural structure and the smokestack.\n\nTo the right, there is a large parking area filled densely with rows of parked cars and buses, indicating either a workday at industrial facilities or a storage area for these vehicles. Additionally, several large, flat-roofed industrial buildings occupy the landscape, one of which has multiple smokestacks, though these do not appear to be actively emitting smoke.\n\nThe overall color tone of the photograph is muted, with shades leaning towards gray and brown, which could be due to the weather conditions, time of day, or the nature of industrial activity in the area. The waterfront setting, combined with the industrial elements, paints a picture of a bustling industrial harbor area engaged in significant commercial activity.","title":"City incinerator on the Delaware river","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["548423","550890","555769","551566","552181","551609","550886","548340","549472","555770","544999","555773","555776","552151","547058","545987"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smokestack","workday","smoke","logistic","building","harbor","emitte","waterfront","waterfro","sort"]}
