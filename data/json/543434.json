{"path":"543434.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a coastal landscape. The image prominently features a series of mountains with varying shades of warm browns, tans, and greens, indicating different vegetative cover or rock formations. These mountains rise directly from the coastline, adding a dramatic vertical element to the scene.\n\nThe coastline itself is rugged, with rocky outcrops and cliffs that descend into the ocean. The ocean is visible on the left-hand side of the image, its surface reflecting sunlight and showing white foamy waves crashing against the shore.\n\nIn the valley areas of the mountains, patches of green suggest areas of cultivation or denser vegetation, contrasting with the more barren mountain slopes. The landscape is largely undeveloped, preserving a wild, natural appearance.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, with some white clouds hovering over and casting shadows on the mountain peaks, suggesting a dynamic and changing weather pattern. The light in the photograph brings out the richness and texture of the terrain, highlighting the natural beauty of this coastal region.","title":"Roads wind along California coast","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543430","543328","543432","543429","554020","553995","545934","557532","543051","543435","543045","554052","553778","543424","553983","543088"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["mountain","coastline","ocean","tan","richness","cultivation","outcrop","cover","cliff","peak"]}
