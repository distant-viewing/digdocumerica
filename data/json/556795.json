{"path":"556795.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a bus filled with passengers from various walks of life, creating a slice-of-life tableau that appears to date from the mid to late 20th century, judging by the attire and style of the bus interior. \n\nThe bus interior features rows of padded seats on either side, upholstered in a patterned fabric, likely designed for comfort during transit. Large windows line both sides of the bus, flooding the space with natural light and providing a view of the exterior, which appears to be lush with greenery, although the specifics of the location are not visible.\n\nPassengers vary in age and dress, suggesting diversity in both age and possibly socio-economic backgrounds. A notable element is the variety of expressions and activities engaging the passengers: \n\n- On the left side, seated near the front, is a woman in a green dress with a bow and a pearl necklace, holding a white purse and a paper bag on her lap, looking pensive or perhaps tired.\n- Behind her sits a man in a suit and tie, his expression one of contemplation or mild concern.\n- Towards the back, individuals are seated and one younger man stands, holding onto a rail, suggesting either the bus is in motion or itâ€™s preparing to stop.\n\nOn the right side:\n- Closest to the perspective we are given, a man is absorbed in reading a newspaper, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings.\n- Next to him sits two women engaged in conversation. One of the women has an attentive, almost concerned expression.\n- At the far end, another group of passengers includes individuals who are looking out the windows or lost in their thoughts.\n\nThe architecture of the bus, with its overhead handrails and framed advertisements above the windows, reflects common public transport designs of the past decades and speaks to the universal scene of daily commuting experienced by urban dwellers. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet everyday travel, with each person wrapped up in their thoughts or activities, a communal journey marked by individual experiences.","title":"Commuters aboard a metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) bus in Atlanta, Georgia.  In 1974 the system carried 73,727,000 passengers, an increase of 27 percent from 1970.  Almost 90 percent of the increase came from the sector of population who had not ridden the bus before.  They were attracted by a combination of a fare decrease from 40 to 15 cents, new buses, new routes, night service, passenger waiting shelters and fringe parking","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["556797","556745","555978","556748","554264","556756","554241","556743","556691","556034","549893","556789","556834","546174","556747","555974"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","passenger","thought","experience","seat","interior","expression","dweller","upholster","woman"]}
