{"path":"556590.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman carrying a young child in a neighborhood setting. The woman has short, dark hair and wears a white sleeveless top, paired with a plaid skirt. She appears slightly concerned or attentive as she looks to her side. The toddler, dressed in a red shirt and blue shorts, is held securely by the woman and has a pensive expression, with one hand near the mouth.\n\nThe setting is a residential alleyway, characterized by a rough, patchy road flanked by side yards and modest homes. To the right, two cars are parked beside a garage, and a red and white ball lies near the curb, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The homes in the background have a quaint appearance, typical of a mid-20th-century American suburb.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests an overcast day, enhancing the colors in the scene and lending a slightly muted tone to the image. This photograph seems to capture a candid moment, perhaps indicating a daily routine or a casual walk interrupted by a moment of reflection or concern.","title":"Mrs. Sharon Bowling, 25, and son, Mark, 2, in the street outside their home in Cumberland, Kentucky.
