{"path":"546772.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a grassy hill with several people engaging in various activities. In the foreground, there is an old cannon mounted on a concrete base, acting as a historical display. Around the cannon, a group of children play; some of them seem to be climbing on and around the cannon. The children are dressed in casual clothing suitable for a day outside, such as shorts and T-shirts.\n\nTo the left, there is an adult male and a young girl, both standing and facing towards the cannon where the children are playing. The adult male appears to be overseeing the children, dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants, while the girl is in a navy blue outfit.\n\nIn the background, through a hazy atmosphere, an industrial landscape is visible with smokestacks, large buildings, and cranes, suggesting this scene might be near a port or industrial area. The overall atmosphere is that of a casual, leisurely day out, perhaps in a park or similar public space, juxtaposed against the backdrop of industrial activity. The photograph has a vintage feel, indicated both by the style of clothing and the quality of the image.","title":"Tourists at fort mc henry","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546814","546790","558277","558274","546906","558275","546897","544817","558276","545242","545246","546145","556290","554072","557987","558273"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","male","girl","adult","play","clothing","oversee","climb","port","t"]}
