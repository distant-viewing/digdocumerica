{"path":"554309.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, likely taken in the mid to late 20th century, given the style of the vehicles and street signage. The setting appears to be a crowded city street, possibly in a business district due to the density of signs and the architecture.\n\nIn the foreground, a dominant element is a large towing truck labeled with \"POLICE PES\" and the number \"3584.\" This truck is hitched to a white car, indicating it might be towing the vehicle away, possibly due to parking violations or a breakdown. Apart from the towing truck, the street is lined with various cars from the era, which look to be American models from the 1970s or early 1980s. The cars are tightly parked or stuck in traffic, creating a sense of crowdedness.\n\nLooking beyond the vehicles, the street is flanked by tall buildings on either side, packed with multiple commercial signs. Notable among them are signs for a deli, a café, and other service-oriented businesses, hinting at a vibrant urban commercial area. The buildings are typical of mid-20th-century American architecture seen in business districts—tall with a utilitarian design.\n\nIn terms of human activity, the scene includes several pedestrians who are faintly visible in the background, walking along the sidewalks and appearing to go about their daily routines. The overall atmosphere is busy, typical of a working day in a central business district.\n\nThe photograph uses natural lighting, contributing to the realistic portrayal of an everyday moment in the life of the city. The composition directs the viewer's attention down the center of the street, guided by the lines of parked and moving vehicles, thus creating a perspective that draws the eye towards the towed car and the bustling street activity.","title":"New york police tow truck removes illegally parked cadillac","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546743","554310","554293","554297","547651","556724","549886","548410","551913","555782","551135","549853","549866","547369","545216","549872"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["tow","street","business","district","truck","car","vehicle","breakdown","café","sign"]}
