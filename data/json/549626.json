{"path":"549626.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a single-story building which appears to be a school or a similar institutional structure. The building has a central double door entrance flanked by symmetrical windows, a hip roof, and is painted in a light color, standing distinct against a bright sky. An American flag flies on a flagpole in front of the building, signaling the setting is likely in the United States.\n\nIn the foreground, framing the view, are numerous large trees with Spanish moss hanging from the branches, creating a canopy-like effect and giving a sense of a Southern U.S. environment. The foliage is lush, suggesting a location rich in vegetation. The trees partially obstruct the view, adding depth and a natural framing element to the composition.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a parking lot with various cars parked in it, indicating a time period possibly around the mid-20th century judging by the model styles of the cars, which look vintage by current standards.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph communicates a tranquil, academic setting, possibly in a rural or suburban area, highlighted by strong natural elements and a sense of quiet community life.","title":"EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory at Dauphin Island","placename":"Mobile (Ala.)","location":"Mobile, Alabama","nn1":["546329","546460","548866","551613","557156","557171","546448","542593","558099","549360","546702","558146","546456","549279","546464","552507"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["flagpole","judging","hip","front","school","building","moss","car","vintage","flag"]}
