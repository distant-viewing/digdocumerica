{"path":"550290.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of an ornate building, likely a historic shopping arcade or market, distinguished by its architectural elegance. The image showcases a vertical top-down view of a multi-level facility featuring four visible floors, including a ground level and three upper galleries.\n\nThe ceiling is a grandiose and expansive lattice structure, possibly made of metal, which forms a complex grid under a glass roof, allowing ample natural light to illuminate the interior. Suspended centrally from this ceiling is a large American flag, displayed vertically and adding a vibrant touch of color against the more muted tones of the structure.\n\nThe floors are connected by ornamental balustrades, which have a traditional design and are possibly made of wrought iron or another dark material, adding to the historical ambiance of the scene. Each gallery level offers a view of the floors below through these railings, and the levels are accessed by visible stairways that have a similar decorative style.\n\nThe ground floor appears to be a wide corridor flanked by businesses or possibly open market stalls. People are scattered throughout the space, some walking and others seemingly engaged in conversation or browsing the area. The flooring pattern includes tiled sections with what could be geometric or floral motifs, contributing to the overall historic aesthetic.\n\nOverall, this setting presents a photograph rich in architectural detail and bustling, albeit modestly, with human activity, capturing a moment that blends daily life into a space of significant historic and aesthetic value.","title":"The arcade--enclosed shopping area in downtown Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550294","550286","556069","556679","551487","556067","558117","555963","549991","556828","546517","551786","556018","549974","550003","551870"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["floor","level","market","ceiling","interior","stairway","value","balustrade","flooring","corridor"]}
