{"path":"551532.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The image features an industrial scene by a body of water, possibly a river. In the background, there is a large industrial mechanism or extraction site comprising several components. There are towering structures made of metal, including steep chutes and platforms, which appear to be set up for processing or moving materials. This setup might be used for mining or sorting materials such as gravel or sand.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph shows a river, its surface rippling gently. Sunlight creates a sparkling effect on the water with small gleams and reflections visible. The riverbank on the near side, where the industrial machinery is located, is bare with visible patches of dirt and small mounds of the presumably extracted material, which look like gravel or sand piles.\n\nThe sky is deep blue, indicating clear weather, and there are small bushes or shrubs scattered along the edge of the water and among the industrial elements, adding a touch of natural texture to the otherwise mechanical and stark environment. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the isolation and perhaps the automated nature of the operation. The setting suggests a balance or contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment surrounding it.","title":"Site of an abandoned sand and gravel operation on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the suburb of Brooklyn Center, near 55th Avenue, north","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552427","550673","552070","554546","551515","548774","544036","550961","551576","543661","556504","544702","546007","557376","551156","544527"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["gravel","material","sand","chute","extraction","mechanism","balance","river","mound","riverbank"]}
