{"path":"549040.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a historical sign and a cemetery in the background. The sign is positioned prominently in the left foreground of the image, mounted on a vertical wooden post. It displays the text \"HISTORICAL LANDMARK GLAMIS CEMETERY 1878\" at the top in black lettering. Below this, there is a warning message in red lettering that states any person who mutilates, disinters, or removes human remains from the place without authority is guilty of a felony, citing the California Health & Safety Code, Section 7062. The sign concludes with \"BY ORDER OF HERBERT HUGHES, SHERIFF, IMPERIAL COUNTY.\"\n\nBehind the sign, a rustic cemetery is visible, enclosed by a wooden picket fence painted in a dark color. The cemetery contains several crosses and grave markers, hinting at its age and historical relevance. There is a series of wooden posts supporting the fence, with some noticeable wear and deterioration. The ground within the fenced area is barren and sandy, typical of a desert environment. In the far background, one can observe utility poles and a clear blue sky, emphasizing the remote and open setting.","title":"Imperial valley cemetery","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545314","545322","549041","552683","546106","545357","544845","547801","545824","546147","545826","546098","548239","543637","544259","544267"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["cemetery","fence","lettering","post","sign","conclude","authority","picket","deterioration","remove"]}
