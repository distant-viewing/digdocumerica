{"path":"548937.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a high-angle aerial view of a scene that includes several notable features. The dominant object in the image is a bus painted in a red, white, and blue pattern resembling the American flag. The bus is parked on a patch of dirt road or an open field, adjacent to a cluster of buildings.\n\nDirectly surrounding the bus are several structures. These include what appear to be mobile homes or modular buildings with flat roofs. To the right of the bus, separated by a small dirt path, is a larger building possibly serving as a warehouse or a large shelter, identifiable by its elongated structure and metal roofing.\n\nIn terms of natural elements, the area is interspersed with trees which provide small patches of greenery in an otherwise dusty, brown environment. To the top right, one can observe a less cultivated area with more foliage, alongside what might be stacks of logs or construction materials.\n\nThe overall area surrounding these central features seems rural or semi-industrial, with a focus on practical usage of space rather than aesthetic landscaping. The environment appears dry and possibly situated in a region experiencing arid or semiarid conditions.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or people in the photograph; the focus is mainly on the placement and the interrelation of inanimate objects within a larger landscape setting.","title":"Vacation living on the shores of havasu lake","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544193","555568","544061","547133","546927","550565","545346","544507","554166","550587","552376","554165","553662","556455","545939","556917"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["bus","dirt","roofing","object","landscaping","placement","usage","shelter","featur","term"]}
