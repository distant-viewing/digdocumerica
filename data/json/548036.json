{"path":"548036.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a roadside scene that focuses on a town population sign for Cathlamet, indicating a population of 656. The sign is prominently featured in the foreground on the right side and is designed with a green background and white lettering. It also includes the profile outline of a person's head facing left.\n\nBehind the sign, the photograph shows a hilly terrain densely covered in greenery and shrubs. Amidst this natural backdrop, you can see residential structures perched on the hill. There are at least three visible houses; they appear traditional, with one of them prominently featuring a white facade and another partially visible at the top of the hill.\n\nAdditionally, there is a \"Speed Limit 25\" sign positioned on a pole just to the left of the population sign. The sky is partly visible at the top of the image, suggesting a clear day. This setting suggests a small-town environment surrounded by natural landscapes, possibly indicating the town's rural and quiet character.","title":"Cathlamet, wa","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548040","548031","556394","556438","550583","556460","556580","551117","549163","551101","556585","557154","557653","551106","556469","550994"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["population","town","sign","facing","hill","perch","roadside","lettering","speed","profile"]}
