{"path":"556479.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural landscape, dominated by lush greenery and a reflective body of water in the foreground. On the left side of the image, near the center, an old-fashioned wooden cart with large wheels rests on the grass, suggesting a rural or historical setting. It appears to be an antique farm cart, lacking any modern characteristics.\n\nBehind the cart, the scene gently slopes upward, covered in vibrant green grass and scattered with trees sporting early spring or late autumn foliage. A wooden fence, somewhat in disrepair, stretches across the middle part of the landscape, adding to the rustic charm. \n\nIn the distance, slightly to the right from the center, a figure is visible. This person is standing and appears to be engaged in a leisurely activity, possibly walking or observing the surroundings. The figure lends a human presence to the otherwise tranquil and natural tableau.\n\nIn the extreme background, the terrain continues to rise, with more dense clusters of trees, which contribute to a sense of depth and seclusion. \n\nThe reflection in the water is crisp and vivid, mirroring the trees and sky, thus enhancing the peaceful and almost symmetrical composition of the scene. The water's surface is calm, amplifying the quietude and reflective mood of this pastoral setting. \n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a sense of tranquility and timelessness, inviting the viewer to contemplate simplicity and natural beauty.","title":"Near Shady Springs, West Virginia, about four miles from Fireco which is near Beckley. This tranquil scene with pasture, pond and natural vegetation shows the contrasts between different communities in the coal mining area. The old company towns are vastly different than ones which came into being without dependence on coal.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550778","545008","546963","554527","550845","558093","551332","542653","551352","557091","555567","549236","550779","553410","551304","553083"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cart","timelessness","tableau","quietude","figure","seclusion","characteristic","grass","disrepair","charm"]}
