{"path":"557718.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and bustling hot air balloon event. In the foreground, a large balloon with a predominantly red envelope is in the process of being managed by a team of people. One man stands inside the basket, appearing to make adjustments or preparations, while reaching out to someone outside the basket. Another person, outside the basket, is actively involved, possibly helping with the balloonâ€™s management or safety measures. There is a person standing by observing, dressed in a dark outfit.\n\nThe background of the scene is lively with several other hot air balloons at various stages of flight. Some balloons are fully inflated and airborne, showcasing colorful patterns, including one with a bold American flag design. The environment looks like a wide open field, slightly muddy, with patches of grass and bare soil, hinting at recent activity or rainfall. The field is bordered by trees, and there are few vehicles and spectators scattered around, contributing to a casual and somewhat rural setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of excitement and activity, typical of a balloon festival or gathering, with various individuals engaged in different tasks related to the hot air ballooning experience.","title":"Pete Hodkinson, III, president of the Alpine Valley Investment Corporation, fires the propane burner on his hot air balloon, the Helen, during a warmup for the second annual Helen to Atlantic Ocean Balloon Race.
