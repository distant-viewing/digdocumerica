{"path":"557541.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a vibrant scene of nature, dominated by a cluster of bright orange and yellow flowers, which appear to be California poppies. The flowers are scattered densely across the frame, creating a lively and colorful display. Their bright petals are open, soaking in sunlight, which enhances the vividness of their hue.\n\nThe background and the area surrounding the flowers are filled with assorted green foliage and grass, some of which intermingle with the poppies, adding a natural and wild characteristic to the scene. There are also some thin, dark grass stalks that crisscross abstractly over and among the flowers, adding texture to the composition.\n\nThe picture is shot during the day, as indicated by the bright lighting and the sharp shadows cast by the floral elements, suggesting that the sun is shining directly on them. This outdoor setting helps convey a sense of freshness and the beauty of a wildflower field. No human activity or man-made objects are visible in the scene, which focuses solely on the natural beauty of the flora in their natural environment.","title":"Plantlife in the Malibu Canyon area of the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557433","543206","550781","544574","545718","545723","542645","552503","544443","544439","544938","557098","553076","543596","548027","542704"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","intermingle","freshness","soak","stalk","shine","shoot","petal","grass","vividness"]}
