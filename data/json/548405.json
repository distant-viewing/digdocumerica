{"path":"548405.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial setting on a waterfront, capturing a dock that extends into a body of water. The image features a large metal building with a white corrugated roof and reddish-brown sidewalls, situated at the end of a pier. Next to the building, there is a huge pile of an aggregate material such as gravel, suggesting this might be a loading or unloading area for bulk materials.\n\nThe ground around the building appears to be paved, possibly with concrete, and is covered partially by snow, indicating that the photo was taken during a colder season or in a cold climate. There are various pieces of industrial equipment and small structures scattered around the building, though their specific functions are unclear from the photograph.\n\nThe water next to the pier appears dark and slightly rippled, which could indicate a gentle movement. Frozen patches near the shore hint at very cold temperatures. The overall scene is devoid of any visible human activity, focusing entirely on the infrastructure and materials handling facilities in this industrial waterfront area.","title":"Fertilizer plant in upper Manhattan--loading platform for barges","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546876","552152","547474","547958","547575","548423","552135","552151","546006","551988","546823","552207","546083","552209","552208","547903"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pier","material","bulk","temperature","unloading","reddish","building","hind","loading","waterfront"]}
