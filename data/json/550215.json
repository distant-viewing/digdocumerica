{"path":"550215.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is a photograph depicting an outdoor natural scene with elements of environmental pollution. The location appears to be a beach with a stormy sea. Agitated waves crash onto the shore under a gloomy, overcast sky, conveying a somewhat bleak atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a sandy beach littered with various items washed up the shore including a prominent wine bottle, small branches, dead fish, and assorted debris. The wine bottle, placed significantly in the center of the frame, particularly stands out against the wet sand and is possibly an indication of human pollution.\n\nLooking toward the background, there is a retaining sea wall made of concrete or stone, helping to prevent the land behind from eroding. Above the wall, an area with sparse grass and a couple of simple tall structures or poles can be seen, possibly part of a nearby infrastructure or a small industrial area. This adds to the sense of environmental stress depicted in the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a message about the interaction and often the discord between natural forces and human activities, highlighting issues of environmental pollution and coastal management.","title":"Littered beach.
