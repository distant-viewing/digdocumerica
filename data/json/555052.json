{"path":"555052.jpg","date":"March 1967","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a dark, almost black background that captures intricate natural elements in the foreground. There are several thin, vertical structures apparent in the image, likely plant stalks or thin tree trunks. Two of these structures on the left are notably adorned with small, light-colored thorns or buds that are evenly spaced, glinting slightly, perhaps due to light reflection. These two stalks intersect with another similar one to create a minimal yet striking natural lattice.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a denser, more leafy plant structure. This plant stretches vertically as well, but unlike the sparse stalks, it appears fuller with numerous small, elongated leaves densely clustering around the central stem, giving it a lush appearance in contrast to the starkness of the thorn-adorned stalks.\n\nThe overall composition seems to play with elements of darkness and light, texture, and the natural geometry of plants, possibly illuminated by a light source outside the frame to cast an ethereal and slightly surreal glow on the subjects. The focus is crisp on the elements, set against the deep, uniform backdrop that highlights their details and forms.","title":"Brambles in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546156","557617","555106","545521","555031","555188","552554","555053","557169","555185","557620","558079","554554","557593","558077","557197"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stalk","plant","glint","adorn","starkness","lattice","bud","stem","darkness","intersect"]}
