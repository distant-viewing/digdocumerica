{"path":"554924.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a scene involving an individual by the side of a road engaged in putting up a sign. The prominently featured sign reads \"WEBUYFIRS\" in large, somewhat irregularly painted black letters on a white wooden background. This makeshift sign is held up by wooden posts and the person, who is perhaps the owner or employee of the business, is standing on the bed of a two-tone (yellow and white) pickup truck to reach and adjust the sign.\n\nThe person is wearing a hat typically associated with outdoor or rural settings, along with a plaid shirt and jeans, suggesting a casual work environment. The truck's design and color scheme hint at a model from the mid to late 20th century, giving the scene a somewhat dated feel.\n\nIn the background, there are trees without leaves suggesting it might be late fall or winter. A building with signs of wear and some structural damage, possibly due to disrepair, can be seen directly behind the truck and sign. The overall setting appears to be in a small town, as indicated by the presence of another house and tree-lined street in the farther background. There is a clear sky, which gives a sense of clarity and brightness to the outdoor setting.","title":"Fur buying and selling is brisk during the hunting season in Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549871","554939","555439","544370","544720","545962","555817","552513","543588","547782","543115","544292","554952","544262","547183","544767"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","truck","employee","owner","put","pickup","scheme","person","bed","disrepair"]}
