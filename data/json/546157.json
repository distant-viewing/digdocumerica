{"path":"546157.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a barren tree positioned atop a large mound of rough, rocky materials, against a bright blue sky. The tree has no leaves and exhibits multiple gnarled, intertwining branches. The mound appears to be composed of gravel or crushed stone, which creates a textured grey and white surface. Standing prominently, the tree's silhouette and the rugged mound it stands on dominate the image. In the distant background, slightly to the right, there is a hint of modern structures, possibly grain silos or industrial buildings, characterized by their vertical form and muted colors that contrast with the natural and stark foreground of the image. The sky is vivid and mostly clear with minimal cloud coverage, providing a bright and airy backdrop to the scene. The composition emphasizes a feeling of isolation and ruggedness, focusing on the starkness of the tree and its environment.","title":"Waste from cement plant has killed the large tree near dumping ground.","placename":"Marshall (Tex.)","location":"Marshall, Texas","nn1":["543722","543718","545747","544921","545534","554994","552551","544019","555573","543843","549248","555639","554780","542861","543658","552433"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["mound","starkness","coverage","ruggedness","grain","silo","tree","gravel","grey","feeling"]}
