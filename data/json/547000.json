{"path":"547000.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of land clearing or deforestation. The image shows a large, yellow bulldozer with a cage over the cabin, actively engaged in moving or pushing a pile of debris which includes tree limbs and trunks. In the background, there is a small fire, possibly from the burning of cleared vegetation, emitting a plume of smoke. The environment appears to consist of dense green foliage characteristic of a forested area, with some trees still standing but many others felled, indicating a heavy amount of tree removal.\n\nThe setting seems to have been significantly disrupted by the activity, reflected in the presence of dirt tracks and disturbed soil around the bulldozer. The sky is visible in patches through the canopy, mostly clear. The overall setting suggests a rather disorderly and impactful clearing operation within a previously wooded or natural site, likely for development purposes.","title":"A bulldozer clears a forest, making way for a golf course on John's Island, (part of the Seabrook Island development).","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546950","554544","548807","542614","543105","545950","556456","542851","553619","551947","553624","545272","555601","548806","542948","543114"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bulldozer","clearing","cage","removal","burning","limb","deforestation","cabin","amount","fire"]}
