{"path":"554275.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively winter scene in a snowy street that appears to be in a ski-resort town. In the foreground, we see four individuals in ski attire. Three of the people are equipped with skis and ski poles, and they are walking on the street, seemingly either heading toward or coming from a ski area. They are all dressed in winter gear suitable for skiing; two of them notably wear bright yellow outfits, while another is in a darker jacket.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a bustling street crowded with several other people who are also dressed warmly, suggesting the photo was taken in cold weather. The architecture visible includes buildings with snow-covered roofs, signifying recent snowfall. Notable signage on the buildings includes references to a lodge, ski rentals, and even a casino, indicating that this location caters heavily to tourists and ski enthusiasts.\n\nThe environment suggests a popular ski resort town, characterized by its vibrant winter activity and alpine-style buildings. The ambiance is casually energetic, with people enjoying leisurely activities in a snowy, picturesque setting.","title":"\"No skiing in the streets\" says the regulation","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554279","554235","554267","554261","554289","554214","554276","554242","554236","554262","554259","550017","554238","554237","554269","554257"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","winter","resort","street","town","lodge","reference","snowfall","skiing","enthusiast"]}
