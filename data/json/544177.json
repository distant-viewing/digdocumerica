{"path":"544177.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a sign with a clear environmental message. The sign is rectangular and uses a simple two-toned color scheme of black and white, which aids in highlighting its text and message clearly. The text on the sign is in bold, black lettering against a white background, making it very legible.\n\nThe main message of the sign is, \"Please DON'T DIRTY God's Woods & Waters.\" The words \"DON'T DIRTY\" are emphasized in larger font than the rest of the text, drawing attention to the plea being made. The reference to \"God's Woods & Waters\" adds a moral or spiritual dimension to the appeal, suggesting that the natural environment is sacred and should be treated with respect.\n\nBelow the main message, there's an attribution that reads, \"Courtesy: Baton Rouge Woods & Waters Club,\" indicating that this sign was placed by a local organization concerned with the conservation of natural environments in or around Baton Rouge.\n\nThe background of the image is completely dark, focusing all attention on the sign itself. The overall tone of the image supports an environmental or conservationist message, urging viewers to respect natural spaces by keeping them clean.","title":"Conservation sign in wetlands","placename":"Houma (La.)","location":"Houma, Louisiana","nn1":["547854","548158","550688","544297","553729","550699","546386","554567","545517","546805","544813","547992","545617","553457","550272","552084"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["message","respect","sign","text","treat","font","reference","dimension","organization","aid"]}
