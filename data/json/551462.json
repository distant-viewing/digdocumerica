{"path":"551462.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a young man and woman having a conversation while sitting on a raised, stony curb in what appears to be a park or a public square. The man is on the left, dressed in a light-colored jacket and pants, with his body turned towards the woman. He is leaning slightly forward, resting his arms on his knees, and is possibly speaking, gauging from his bemused expression and slightly parted lips.\n\nThe woman on the right is dressed in a plaid jacket with a dark collar and is wearing jeans. She holds a cigarette in her right hand and seems to be listening to the man, indicated by her attentive posture and neutral expression. Her hair is styled simply, and she gazes directly at her companion.\n\nThe background suggests a lively urban park setting with blurry figures of other people who are distant and not interacting with the main subjects. Behind the couple, the park features dense foliage, and small patches of flowers can be seen next to where the pair is sitting. The foreground is softly out of focus, adding a vibrant splash of color at the bottom of the frame, which might be a close-up of some flowers or perhaps another blurred object, enhancing the depth of the setting.\n\nOverall, the image exudes a casual, relaxed atmosphere of two people engaged in a personal conversation, enveloped by the tranquil environment of a busy park.","title":"Lunching on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["548482","553244","554900","557143","551450","553164","549756","549324","549673","551016","549922","548267","549755","551514","551454","547834"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["park","woman","flower","conversation","companion","lip","gauge","jacket","sit","cigarette"]}
