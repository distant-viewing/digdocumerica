{"path":"557189.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape, likely a prairie or meadow. The foreground is dominated by lush greenery interspersed with vibrant purple flowering plants, possibly a type of wildflower. The vegetation varies in height and type, suggesting a rich biodiversity typical of wild grasslands.\n\nBeyond the immediate flora, the middle ground gently transitions into rolling hills. These hills are covered with grass that, due to the distance and lighting, appears as a lighter shade of green, contrasting subtly with the darker greens of the foreground. The horizon shows an unbroken line of these hills, emphasizing the expansive nature of the landscape.\n\nThe sky is not visible in the image, suggesting the photo was taken aiming downward at an angle to focus on the flora and the contour of the hills.\n\nNo human figures or man-made structures are visible, underscoring the untouched, natural aspect of the scene. This presentation not only highlights the beauty and tranquility of the landscape but also serves as a showcase of a healthy, natural ecosystem. There is also a noticeable absence of animals or any visible wildlife in the captured view. The overall feel is one of calmness and isolation, away from urban environments.","title":"A view of a portion of konza prairie, 1,000 acres of virgin tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas","placename":"Manhattan (Kan.)","location":"Manhattan, Kansas","nn1":["557191","549218","552903","557098","549225","551370","557099","556990","549155","544581","557190","549238","547540","549186","549236","549158"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","flora","prairie","biodiversity","type","presentation","green","grassland","wildflower","meadow"]}
