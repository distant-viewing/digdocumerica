{"path":"550847.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures three individuals fishing on a dam structure. They are standing on a concrete platform with metal railings, and there are two large wheel mechanisms alongside them which are likely used for controlling the dam gates. Flowing water is visible pouring from small openings beneath the platform, creating white foam as it meets the still water of a river or lake. The setting is outdoors, in what appears to be a sunny day judging by the brightness and reflections on the water.\n\nTo the left, a young man in casual attire and a fishing rod stands near one of the wheels. The middle of the image shows a blonde woman, also equipped with a fishing rod, standing between the wheels. To the right, an older man with a bucket hat and shorts is holding a fishing rod as well, walking towards the center of the platform.\n\nIn the background, we can see a peaceful body of water, surrounded by lush green foliage and trees. The calm and scenic nature of the location contrasts with the industrial feel of the dam, offering a unique balance in the composition of the photograph. The image seems to be from an earlier time period, as suggested by the style of clothing and the type of fishing equipment used.","title":"Fishing from locks on the fox river near montello.
