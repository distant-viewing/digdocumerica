{"path":"546313.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a hand holding a small fish underwater. The fish appears to be translucent, combining whitish and grayish colors, likely indicating it is in a juvenile stage. The human hand is partially submerged in a body of water, and the skin appears wrinkled from possibly being in water for an extended period.\n\nThe overall setting suggests this could be an observational or educational activity, potentially in a natural environment like a lake, river, or a water tank designed for educational purposes. This is accentuated by the calmness of the water around the hand and the natural lighting that subtly illuminates the scene.\n\nThe background is mostly out of focus, mostly dark with blue-green tones suggesting depth and the density of the water. There is minimal disturbance in the water, which indicates that the motion is gentle. The photograph has a vintage aesthetic to it, suggested by the faded colors and the vignette around the edges, adding a timeless quality to the moment captured.\n\nDetails like particles floating in the water and the slight reflections visible on the water's surface add to the authenticity and immersive feel of the environment. No discernible man-made objects or other disturbances are visible, thus the focus remains on the interaction between the human hand and the fish, highlighting a serene and isolated moment.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
