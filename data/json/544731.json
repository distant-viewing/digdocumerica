{"path":"544731.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The image displays a close-up view of a small branch with leaves, positioned in a natural setting. The leaves shown are somewhat ovate in shape but appear slightly curled and wilted. They are covered with what looks like a fine, dusty substance, possibly mildew or frost, imparting a textured look to their surface. The coloration of the leaves varies from dark green to rustic brown, suggesting either a changing season or the presence of disease or stress.\n\nThe background is blurred, featuring vertical dark and light grey streaks, suggesting shadows or objects in the distance, possibly tree trunks or man-made structures. The focus is notably shallow, with the emphasis entirely on the leaves in the foreground, making the background minimally invasive but providing a strong contrast that highlights the details of the leaves.\n\nLighting in the photograph is soft yet sufficient to illuminate the details on the leaves, indicating either an overcast sky or shaded conditions. This lighting contributes to the muted color tones and enhances the textural details of the leaf surfaces. The overall composition evokes a serene yet slightly melancholic mood, emphasizing natural textures and the quiet beauty of decaying flora.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["557593","551356","555185","554744","542686","555178","551372","543620","555030","543560","555006","542688","552693","546096","558077","551357"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","detail","frost","stress","streak","coloration","leaf","substance","flora","emphasis"]}
