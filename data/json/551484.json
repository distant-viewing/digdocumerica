{"path":"551484.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a young woman engaging with a fountain in an urban setting. The woman, who has long dark hair, is leaning over the edge of the fountain, immersed up to her arms in the water. She is reaching out to touch or play with the water as it flows from the fountain. She is dressed casually in a light blue long-sleeve shirt over a dark blue or black outfit.\n\nThe fountain itself is dark-colored, possibly black, and has a solid, block-like structure from which water cascades down into a shallow pool. Behind the scene, the background includes a large building with a sign that reads \"MIDWEST FEDERAL\". This indicates that the image is potentially taken in a downtown or commercial area of a city. Other people, appearing in smaller sizes, can be seen walking in the background, suggesting a lively, public space.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of casual urban life, possibly on a warm, sunny day given the clear skies and shadows evident in the photo. The atmosphere is animated yet peaceful, centered around this moment of interaction between the woman and the fountain.","title":"The water is cooling--at the fountain on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552700","550748","551468","551467","549982","551664","551449","550747","553224","553192","549985","551658","550072","551663","553229","557258"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","woman","downtown","pool","block","outfit","arm","water","sleeve","size"]}
