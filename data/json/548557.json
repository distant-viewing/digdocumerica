{"path":"548557.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people, presumably seniors, seated in rows watching an event or presentation indoors. The setting features dim ambient lighting, possibly to focus attention on a stage or screen out of view. The focal point is a man in the foreground with glasses, wearing a blue polo shirt, notably smiling broadly and perhaps reacting to the event unfolding before him. \n\nSurrounding him, other attendees show varied levels of engagement; some are attentively looking forward, while others, like a woman next to him in sunglasses and a floral blouse, seem more relaxed and less engaged. Seating is simple folding chairs, indicating a temporary setup typical for events like lectures or presentations. The background is largely in shadow, enhancing focus on the brightly lit faces of the audience members. There is also a chandelier visible above, adding a touch of formality to the otherwise plain setting. The overall mood seems light and pleasant, suggested by the smiling man and the casual attire of the attendees.","title":"Evening entertainment at the clubhouse of the Century Village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["547375","558393","556450","557703","543924","547438","556243","558291","554322","547870","552618","557027","544314","556451","543925","551808"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["presentation","attendee","event","formality","folding","screen","polo","audience","seating","member"]}
