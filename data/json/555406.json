{"path":"555406.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime cityscape, showcasing a panoramic view of an urban landscape brightened by numerous lights. The composition includes multiple high-rise buildings that dominate the central sky profile. These buildings are illuminated by internal light, with reflections visible on some of their windows. They are set against a dark, possibly overcast sky, which gives the city lights more prominence.\n\nIn the foreground, many smaller lights delineate the shape and density of a massive city. The lights likely represent street lamps, car headlights, and possibly lights from other buildings, streets, and infrastructures, contributing to the intricate network of lights visible from this vantage point.\n\nTo the left of the frame, dark silhouettes of trees are just discernible against the night sky, framing the city lights and providing a slight natural contrast to the urban environment. Overall, the scene conveys a typical post-dusk urban environment where artificial lighting plays a vital role in the cityâ€™s vibrancy and activity levels, suggesting a bustling, densely populated area.\n","title":"Overall view of downtown Portland, at 8 p.m.  In october, 1973 showing lack of commercial lighting during the peak of the energy crisis.
