{"path":"557992.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring four individuals riding horses in a grassy area surrounded by lush foliage. The setting appears to be a sunny day with ample sunlight illuminating the greenery and the subjects. Each rider is on a distinct horse: two chestnut-colored horses, one tan horse, and one light gray horse.\n\nFrom the left, the first rider, a child, is on a chestnut horse and seems to be in motion, possibly adjusting their footing in the stirrups or communicative with another rider. The second rider, an adult woman with blonde hair, is also atop a chestnut horse, riding composedly with a focused gaze ahead. The third rider, also a child, is on a tan horse and appears slightly turned towards the fourth rider, possibly engaged in conversation. The fourth individual, another adult, is riding the gray horse and wearing a denim jacket, appearing relaxed with their posture upright as they look ahead.\n\nThe riders are dressed in casual riding attire, suitable for a leisurely day of horseback riding. The background is dense with various shades of green from the trees and bushes, hinting at a secluded or less urban area. The natural light and shadow play across the scene, highlighting the tranquility and recreational enjoyment of the group. The composition of the image, with its vivid colors and dynamic arrangement of riders and horses, portrays a moment of leisure and connection with nature.","title":"Horse riders in the brecksville reservation, a part of the Cleveland, Ohio, metropolitan park system.
