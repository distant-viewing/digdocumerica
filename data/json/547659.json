{"path":"547659.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph portrays a scenic, somewhat moody view of a long, straight road surrounded by dense greenery. The road is flanked on both sides by lush forests, with a canopy of trees forming a natural tunnel over the road at certain points. The colors suggest that it might be late summer or early autumn as the leaves are fully out, yet there's a hint of darkness and depth in their hue.\n\nAt the forefront, noticeable skid marks stain the asphaltâ€”indicative of recent activity, perhaps a vehicle braking sharply or losing control. The road stretches forward, disappearing into a dip before rising again, aligned perfectly with the perspective and drawing the eye deep into the scene. This creates a strong sense of depth and continuation.\n\nThere are no visible buildings or people, indicating the location might be relatively remote or reserved for transit rather than residence. It's clearly daytime, yet the lighting is somewhat subdued, possibly due to overcast weather, lending the scene a slightly gloomy or introspective tone.\n\nOverall, the composition is straightforward yet evocative, capturing a snapshot of tranquil nature juxtaposed with a hint of human interaction marked by the tire tracks.","title":"Going south through unspoiled bristol county, on Narragansett bay, towards","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["544860","557555","557011","546401","544598","554130","557010","550567","556976","547354","544991","551240","554127","556579","553785","550695"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","dip","disappear","lose","tunnel","residence","reserve","continuation","mark","asphalt"]}
