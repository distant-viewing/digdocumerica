{"path":"546515.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph showcases a modern architectural environment, possibly an institutional building such as a school or a public office, characterized by geometric and angular structures. The scene includes several people engaged in different activities.\n\nIn the foreground, a man sits at a small table with wheels, immersed in reading or writing, providing a sense of quiet study or contemplation. He is dressed in a light-colored shirt with sleeves rolled up, suggesting a casual or working environment.\n\nTo the left, set against a large potted plant with lush foliage, is a young woman ascending a set of stairs. She is dressed in a graphic t-shirt and flared pants, indicative of casual or student attire.\n\nDirectly above the man at the table, one level up, two individuals are walking on a balcony. One is partially visible, dressed in denim, while the other, also wearing casual attire, is mainly obscured by the structure.\n\nThe architectural space itself is made up of stark concrete with a strong linear and angular design. The building features open walkways and staircases that create dynamic patterns and shadows. Natural light filters in from above, casting shadows and illuminating the concrete surfaces which add to the depth and texture of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively captures a snapshot of everyday life set against the backdrop of brutalist architecture, emphasizing both the human scale and the imposing concrete environment.","title":"Interior courtyard of southside junior high school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546519","546511","546526","546470","546500","546506","551487","546531","558211","546528","546539","546532","546517","551651","551493","555318"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["concrete","table","casual","flar","student","immerse","ascend","staircase","school","set"]}
