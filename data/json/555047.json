{"path":"555047.jpg","date":"March 1965","photographer":"","caption":"The image features an intricate composition of geological or natural formations, possibly of a canyon or rock crevice, viewed looking upward towards the sky. The formations create a series of jagged, irregular shapes that partition the view into dark and light segments.\n\nThe rock surfaces are visible in shades of blue and purple, hinting at a time of day with low light conditions or a particular photographic filter used. The sky peeking through the crevices appears in subtle pink, providing a soft contrast to the darker rock tones. This composition showcases a play between shadow, light, and the rugged textures of the natural environment.\n\nThe edges of the rock are sharp and uneven, suggesting erosion or natural wear over time. There are no visible living entities or human-made objects, focusing attention purely on the natural elements and their form. The overall mood is serene yet somewhat mysterious, evoking curiosity about the precise location and the natural processes that shaped this scene.","title":"Closeup of fern spores in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543421","545805","550428","544363","550481","544745","545795","552890","552444","545589","545802","553770","552685","545799","544898","544376"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["crevice","rock","entity","formation","filter","pink","segment","canyon","time","curiosity"]}
