{"path":"547433.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene suburban scene likely from the late 20th century, showcasing a housing development and a glimpse of daily life. The focus is on a row of single-story terraced houses or townhouses, characterized by simple, functional architecture. The houses have shallow-pitched roofs and visible chimneys. Their exteriors are painted in muted tones of yellow and beige, with darker trims around the doors and windows.\n\nThe scene is viewed from an elevated perspective, looking down the gentle slope of a grass-covered hill. There's a sidewalk that runs parallel to the row of houses, reflecting a neighborhood-friendly design. Along this sidewalk, various activities are taking place, predominantly involving children. There are children of different ages, most likely neighborhood kids, riding bicycles and tricycles. The presence of these children lends a vibrant, lively atmosphere to the otherwise quiet residential area.\n\nTrees and manicured lawns line the sidewalk, providing greenery and a suburban aesthetic to the landscape. The trees have lush foliage, suggesting that the photograph was taken in spring or summer.\n\nParked on either side of the road that intersects with the sidewalk are numerous cars, indicating the presence of several families in the area. This also suggests a dependency on vehicles, common in many suburban communities.\n\nThe background shows more residential structures and a clear blue sky, indicative of good weather. There are utility poles and street lamps intermittently placed, which are typical in residential areas for providing electricity and street lighting.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a typical day in a peaceful suburban neighborhood where community life and childrenâ€™s outdoor activities play a central role. The design of the community and the activity within it encapsulates a slice of everyday American life.","title":"Residential area in north Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557405","558131","556601","547769","557365","550121","551102","557454","547859","544510","546430","553704","547211","557290","550994","556436"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["sidewalk","child","neighborhood","community","house","tricycle","kid","townhouse","terrace","row"]}
