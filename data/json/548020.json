{"path":"548020.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a large dam and its surroundings. The dam, constructed from massive concrete walls, spans a wide river, holding back a significant body of water on one side. On the downstream side, the river continues to flow, bordered by roads and a mixed terrain of rock and vegetation. \n\nAdjacent to the dam is a complex of smaller buildings, possibly related to the damâ€™s operational facilities, and an open area with some construction activities evident. There are several curved roads leading to and from the dam, providing access for vehicles.\n\nA prominent steel truss bridge crosses the river downstream from the dam. This bridge connects two sides of the land, with one side featuring a well-developed neighborhood dotted with residential houses, laid out in a neat grid pattern surrounded by trees and green spaces. This housing area is contrasted sharply with the rugged and less developed terrain on the other side of the river.\n\nIn the background, hills or low mountains are visible, adding a natural backdrop to the technological and residential features in the foreground.","title":"GRand coulee dam","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548920","548003","548936","548007","548938","548975","548012","548947","548024","549004","551190","548927","548013","551212","548017","548016"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","river","bridge","side","truss","housing","continue","road","lay","terrain"]}
