{"path":"552309.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene of a lone fisherman at dusk. The fisherman is seated in a small rowboat, engaged in the activity of fishing. The boat is centrally located on the vast, calm surface of the water. The body of water reflects the vibrant colors of the sunset, blending hues of orange, yellow, and purple that suffuse the sky and clouds above.\n\nThe silhouette of the fisherman adds a poignant human element to the natural beauty of the scene. Beyond the fisherman and slightly to the right, there is another small, indistinct object on the water, possibly another boat or buoy, adding a sense of scale and solitude. The background and water are largely devoid of any other significant features, emphasizing the vastness and quietude of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the placement of the fisherman and the interplay of light and color to evoke a mood of peacefulness and reflection. The horizon is visible but subtly blends into the sky, which is streaked with darker clouds, suggesting the ending of the day. The overall effect is calming and introspective.","title":"Salmon fishermen at sunrise in the Strait of Juan de Fuca","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543753","545055","552308","552224","547555","547558","554147","547230","552314","543143","552124","551280","552313","552310","550296","551572"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","rowboat","buoy","quietude","boat","placement","peacefulness","cloud","water","purple"]}
