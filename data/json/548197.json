{"path":"548197.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural outdoor scene dominated by a dirt road or path that is heavily flooded. The water covering the road is murky and has patches of debris and mud, indicating recent heavy rainfall or overflow from a nearby water body.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is an individual wearing a dark jacket, blue jeans, and possibly a cap, who appears to be assessing or observing the extent of the flooding. This person is standing near the edge of the water, at a spot where the road begins to disappear under the flood.\n\nThe road is flanked by fence lines on both sides, though the one on the right side is partially submerged, indicating the water's depth. In the background, the terrain gently rises and features sparse vegetation, hinting at a rural setting with agricultural or undeveloped land use nearby. The scene suggests challenges in transportation or access due to natural events like flooding, evoking a sense of isolation or disruption. The colors in the image are fairly muted, with earth tones dominating the scene, contributing to the overall somber and challenging nature of the situation captured in the photograph.","title":"Effluent treatment canal of the Crown-Zellerbach paper mill in Camas on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552856","552855","552843","556445","552823","550247","555597","552832","548298","552829","552853","552824","544734","552845","547778","545680"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["road","extent","flood","flooding","disruption","situation","rainfall","challenge","mud","water"]}
