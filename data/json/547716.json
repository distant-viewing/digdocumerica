{"path":"547716.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and dramatic sunset scene characterized by the silhouettes of two individuals against a wide, open sky with a low horizon. The composition emphasizes the vastness of the landscape and the serenity of the moment. \n\nThe first figure, positioned on the left, is a male silhouette holding a pickaxe over his shoulder, with the tool's sharp ends outlined against the sky. The second figure, on the right, also a male, holds a shovel resting on his shoulder. The setting sun, positioned centrally in the background between the two figures, emits a soft yellow-orange glow, which gently fades into a gradient of blues and purples of the twilight sky.\n\nThe horizon is clean and almost entirely flat, suggesting an expansive plain or farmland. There are no visible buildings or other markersâ€”just open space, providing a sense of isolation and tranquility. The positioning of the figures and the tools they carry suggest that they might be workers, perhaps ending their day with the setting sun acting as a symbolic close to their labor.\n\nThe use of silhouette against the sunset creates a striking contrast and allows for an emphasis on the shapes and posture of the subjects, imbuing the scene with a sense of timelessness and universal appeal.","title":"Farm workers shoulder tools at end of day near Ripley, in the fertile Palo Verde Valley of the lower Colorado River region.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543417","548222","555140","550288","550296","554759","547719","552896","542680","546021","554674","554731","550646","549847","546100","543024"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["figure","male","silhouette","shoulder","sunset","tool","timelessness","plain","sun","shovel"]}
