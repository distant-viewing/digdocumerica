{"path":"550501.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a majestic mountainous landscape, most likely taken from an aerial viewpoint. The scene is dominated by snow-covered mountain peaks and ridges. The composition shows a series of rugged, steep slopes that are blanketed in snow, with exposed dark rocky surfaces creating stark contrast against the white snow.\n\nIn the center of the image, the mountains form a valley, where the snow appears less dense, revealing more of the underlying surface. The valley's contours are accentuated by the shadows and textured surfaces of the mountains. The texture of the snow varies across different parts of the mountain, from smooth coverings that highlight the contours of the terrain to areas where the snow is patchy, revealing the dark rock beneath.\n\nThere are no visible skies; the entire frame is filled with the mountain landscape, giving a feeling of closeness and immensity. The perspective suggests a sweeping view over the mountains, emphasizing their expansive and wild nature. There are no human elements or activities visible in this remote and untouched natural environment, which draws attention to the raw beauty and isolation of the mountainous terrain.","title":"View north toward dietrich pass from a point above the northwest tributary of the north fork of the chandalar river.
