{"path":"546866.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph showcases an industrial setting dominated by several large structures characteristic of a factory or processing plant. The scene is captured from a street view, focusing on the dull metallic and concrete colors of the industrial facility.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the image, there's a section of a leafy tree, suggesting the photograph might have been taken from behind some greenery, possibly for artistic framing. The streetscape is lined with closely packed buildings made of brick, demonstrating typical industrial architectural styles, with rows of small, rectangular windows. These buildings have a somewhat aged appearance, indicative of an older industrial area.\n\nDominating the mid and background are multiple large metal silos and towering stacks, which are likely part of a manufacturing or processing plant. These facilities are fitted with various pipes and conduits, suggesting complex industrial processes. The pale blue sky behind these structures suggests a clear day, providing a stark contrast to the industrial complex.\n\nThe street is populated with a variety of vintage cars, hinting at the vintage of the photograph. The vehicles, parked along the right side of the road, exhibit designs typical of mid-to-late 20th-century automotive style. A fire hydrant can also be seen closer to the foreground on the sidewalk, adding to the urban details.\n\nOverall, the composition portrays a blend of nature, urban life, and industrial activity, encapsulating a scene that likely reflects the everyday dynamics in an industrial area during the mid-20th century.","title":"Dredging to maintain dundalk marine terminal's capacity to handle large ships","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546085","546122","545992","557224","546968","550203","550199","557225","551033","557390","552002","542705","552190","550868","555772","557214"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["processing","hydrant","streetscape","conduit","century","facility","dynamic","street","fit","demonstrate"]}
