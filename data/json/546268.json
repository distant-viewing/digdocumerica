{"path":"546268.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a densely packed junkyard filled with a multitude of discarded vehicles. The scene is inundated with cars of various models and colors, many of which are significantly damaged or partly dismantled. The cars are stacked irregularly upon each other, creating hills of metal and parts. Hoods and trunks are open or removed, and several cars are missing wheels or windows, suggesting that parts may have been salvaged from some vehicles.\n\nThe environment is outdoors and appears to be in a forested or semi-forested area, judging by the trees visible in the background. The lighting suggests it's a sunny day, casting sharp shadows that accentuate the chaotic arrangement of the vehicles.\n\nOverall, the image captures a scene of automotive decay and disarray, portraying a landscape overwhelmed by mechanical refuse. It's a vivid representation of what becomes of vehicles after they are no longer road-worthy and are relegated to the final resting places of junkyards.","title":"Auto dump","placename":"Jackson (Miss.)","location":"Jackson, Mississippi","nn1":["553004","552999","545365","543166","555491","542656","545303","542590","553005","545340","553006","552739","555492","547476","552738","549023"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["junkyard","vehicle","car","disarray","refuse","multitude","representation","hood","wheel","arrangement"]}
