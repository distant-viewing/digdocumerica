{"path":"551243.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a rugged landscape predominately taken up by a large, smoldering pile of debris and refuse. The scene is dynamic and slightly unsettling, capturing a moment of environmental degradation. A fire within the pile emits a dense, dark smoke, contributing to a sense of pollution and neglect, while flames are visible among the material, indicating active burning.\n\nIn the foreground, there are various pieces of burnt and unburnt waste, including assorted containers and twisted metal objects, scattered across the earth. The ground itself appears rough and is littered with small, charred remnants and dirt, hinting at the harsh conditions of the dumping site.\n\nThe background reveals a forested hill, indicating that this location is possibly near a wooded area or in a rural setting. The landscape beyond is lush and green, providing a stark contrast to the devastation in the foreground. The sky above is mostly clear with a few fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the impact of the dark smoke rising from the fire.\n\nThis photograph likely serves as a commentary on environmental issues, highlighting the consequences of improper waste disposal and its stark contrast to natural beauty. It portrays a moment of destruction set against nature's backdrop, emphasizing the intrusive and damaging human impact on the environment.","title":"This burning dump at Sunrise Beach is scheduled to be covered over","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["553038","551247","551242","549957","552086","543828","550702","545731","545735","547485","543824","542819","550687","543676","546381","544823"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["fire","waste","burning","consequence","pile","smoke","flame","devastation","commentary","impact"]}
