{"path":"551479.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and atmospheric scene inside what appears to be a nightclub or a music venue. On the right side of the image, two male musicians are prominently featured. The musician in the foreground is wearing a red shirt with a notable sash or strap diagonally across his body and checkered pants. He is manning a microphone stand, apparently singing or about to sing, and holding what seems to be a set of maracas. Behind him, another musician with long hair and a patterned shirt is playing a guitar, partially obscured but still an integral part of the frame.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the focus shifts to the audience in the nightclub. Various people are seen in mid-conversation or engaged in listening to the music. A couple in the foreground talks, with the man dressed in a striped, long-sleeve shirt and the woman in a blue sweater. The lighting in the venue casts a colorful yet soft glow over the scene, with reflections and subtle light flares contributing to the moody ambiance. The ceiling of the venue is dark with what appears to be acoustic paneling, and a dimly lit bar or similar structure can be glimpsed in the background.\n\nThe photo composition effectively juxtaposes the performance with the audience's engagement, depicting a typical nightlife scene with a focus on music and social interaction. The image hints at the era, possibly in the 1970s or early 80s, based on the fashion styles and interior design elements visible.","title":"Dancing to a rock band at \"duffs.\"","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551319","551318","554283","556308","556304","551320","547363","551709","551782","551018","553305","553890","556032","558263","558387","547371"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["musician","music","venue","audience","80s","singe","guitar","paneling","microphone","flare"]}
