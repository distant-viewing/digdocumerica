{"path":"553730.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at an airport where passengers are boarding and deboarding a large airplane. The aircraft appears to be a commercial jet, part of which is seen on the left side of the frame. Several mobile staircases are attached to different parts of the plane, allowing access to both the rear and front sections.\n\nThere's a crowd of passengers, some of whom are walking down the stairs closest to the camera, while others are making their way towards the aircraft's entrance farther away. The passengers appear to be carrying hand luggage and personal items, typical of air travelers.\n\nSeveral ground crew members wearing white uniforms can be seen around the staircases and on the tarmac, overseeing the boarding and deboarding process, and ensuring safety and order are maintained during this busy period.\n\nThe background shows a flat, dry landscape that might suggest the airport is located in a relatively arid or less vegetated region. Some infrastructure typical of airports, such as service vehicles, additional buildings, and lighting poles, is visible around the edges of the tarmac area.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates it might be midday, with strong sunlight casting shadows on the ground. The overall atmosphere of the image is busy and somewhat chaotic, capturing a moment during a typical day at a busy airport.","title":"Honolulu international airport handles almost all of the island's visitors.
