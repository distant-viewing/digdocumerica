{"path":"548449.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photo features a close-up view of a man's hands as he holds and operates a noise level meter, focusing on measuring the sound from the environment around him. The device, which appears to be a vintage model based on its design, is positioned on the railing of an overpass or elevated structure. \n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred but clearly depicts an urban scene with a train moving along tracks below the bridge. The train is entering a tunnel, under what seems like an overpass, with several cars parked beside the road next to the railroad area. Above the train and tunnel, there is a clear view of a cityscape with buildings in the far distance and a vast sky. \n\nThe setting and the equipment suggest that the photograph might have been taken for purposes related to engineering, urban planning, or environmental studies, particularly focusing on urban noise pollution and its measurement. The watch and ring on the man's left hand indicate personal details about him, suggesting a professional context in day-to-day attire.","title":"Approaching MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) train records 87 decibels on noise meter.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548450","547740","544959","542661","557829","542765","553907","549052","542662","556861","542659","549513","556865","553887","542663","549625"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["noise","tunnel","train","overpass","sound","meter","measurement","ring","measure","railroad"]}
