{"path":"555427.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The image shows two traffic signs mounted on a pole, captured against a slightly overcast sky. The top sign is rectangular and predominantly white with a black border and text. It reads \"DID YOU FORGET?\" in bold black uppercase letters, with a large black question mark central to the design. Beneath this, a second sign, similarly designed with a white background and black border, displays \"50 M.P.H.\" in large bold numerals and letters indicating a speed limit reminder. Both signs appear to be part of a road safety campaign to remind drivers not to exceed the speed limit or possibly to prompt them about something they should remember while driving. The overall tone suggests a focus on alerting or cautioning drivers in a direct and simple manner.","title":"Both Oregon and Washington states led the nation in reducing driving speeds to conserve gasoline before federal limits were passed.
