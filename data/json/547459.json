{"path":"547459.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a majestic view of a large sailing ship named \"Mystic Whaler.\" The ship is tilted to one side, likely due to the wind filling its sails, and is sailing over a choppy sea. Each of the ship's impressive sails is fully unfurled, harnessing the wind's power for navigation. The sails appear robust and are colored a faded white, suggesting they have been well-used but are well-maintained.\n\nThe hull of the ship is painted black and prominently features the name \"Mystic Whaler\" in white letters along its side. The deck of the ship is busy with several people visible in the scene. The crew, clad in various casual outfits that seem appropriate for sailing and the cool weather, are engaged in different tasks, potentially managing the sails or ensuring the ship remains on course.\n\nThe background of the image is simple and provides a clear view of the overcast sky and the grey-blue ocean. These elements create a feeling of openness and a somewhat moody atmosphere, typical of seafaring scenes. The sea's vastness around the ship emphasizes the isolation and self-reliance often associated with such voyages.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its dynamic angle of the ship and the expanse of water and sky, evokes a sense of adventure and the timeless appeal of sailing.","title":"Schooner on Chesapeake Bay, seen during the early hours of the","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549395","549396","547467","549431","549403","544667","547458","547463","549404","549394","549405","549410","547461","549432","548513","547464"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ship","sail","sailing","wind","reliance","sea","self","course","crew","navigation"]}
