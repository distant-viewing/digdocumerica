{"path":"556655.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures an intimate moment of creativity and observation in a public setting, likely in a metro station or other communal area with seating. The scene focuses on two central figures: a woman sketching and another woman observing the sketch artist. \n\nThe sketch artist, seated to the left, is partly visible from the side and is engrossed in her work. She wears a red jacket, a patterned scarf, and jeans, holding a white marker or pen. The sketchpad in her lap displays a partially completed drawing featuring a figure with pronounced facial features and decorative elements. \n\nThe observer to the right is shown smiling warmly, displaying interest and amusement as she looks at the artist's work. She sports a dark outfit complemented by a strikingly printed scarf, and holds some papers or a pamphlet and a pen in her lap.\n\nThe background further sets the scene in a busy, possibly casual environment with other seated people visible, some blurred in the background, suggesting movement or conversation amongst them. The collective atmosphere is relaxed yet dynamic, with the artistic activity drawing curious attention amidst a possibly routine surrounding. The lighting is slightly dim, emphasizing the indoor or underground setting, enhancing the intimate and candid nature of the captured moment.","title":"Passenger aboard the New York city transit authority Lexington avenue subway spends his time sketching.  A new 2nd avenue line is under construction at a cost of $2 billion considerably more than the $151 million estimated in 1967.  Only $300 million in funds has been committed.  Controversy has arisen because the new line was to decrease crowding on the Lexington avenue line, but the need has decreased because of fewer riders commuters would rather see the money used to improve present lines","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551436","553217","552962","553164","557909","544318","551433","558216","557904","556822","557682","548255","546479","558345","556230","547175"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["artist","scarf","pen","lap","pamphlet","drawing","creativity","amusement","observer","engross"]}
