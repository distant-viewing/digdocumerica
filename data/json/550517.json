{"path":"550517.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph displays a textured landscape from a high-altitude perspective, possibly taken from an aircraft or a similar vantage point. The terrain is rugged and covered with a diverse pattern of textures suggesting a mix of vegetation and possibly eroded soil or rock formations. The colours are a mix of dark greens, browns, and patches of darker areas, indicating variations in vegetation density, moisture, or shadowing from the terrain's undulations. There are no visible structures or people, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of the landscape. The overall mood evoked by the image is one of remote, wild nature, highlighting the intricate patterns and textures formed by natural processes.","title":"Detail of soil creep (solifluction) on a grassy mountainside east of the pipeline route above Dietrich River. On steep hillsides especially, the weight of the soils causes them to slump downhill making the wave forms shown here.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550395","555029","550519","555793","555553","553564","552426","543549","543148","545139","545806","550596","543521","542821","552981","554817"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["undulation","mix","aircraft","moisture","pattern","variation","altitude","density","terrain","vantage"]}
