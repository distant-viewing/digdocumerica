{"path":"544769.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene in a rugged outdoor setting. The central focus of the image is an old, worn-down ore processing structure made of wood, with multiple levels and open sections that expose the inner framework, perched on a slope and supported by wooden beams. The building is weathered, indicating significant age and exposure to the elements.\n\nIn the foreground, a stream flows across the frame, characterized by its rusty red water, which suggests contamination by minerals or industrial waste, creating a stark contrast with the natural setting. The streambed is strewn with various sizes of rocks and boulders, and patches of snow can be seen along its banks and on the surrounding landscape, suggesting a cold environment.\n\nThe background features a mountainous area with sparse vegetation, under a clear blue sky that indicates it might be a bright sunny day. Electrical poles and wires can be seen cutting across the scene, adding to the industrial feel of the environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the dilapidated structure on the right and the polluted stream leading towards the foreground, illustrates a narrative of industrial decay and environmental impact in a once-pristine natural setting. This setting, combined with the lighting and elements present, evokes a sense of neglect and the passage of time.","title":"Water polluted by high mineral content flows from the abandoned Argo mine.","placename":"Idaho Springs (Colo.)","location":"Idaho Springs, Colorado","nn1":["543709","543815","550684","544037","551036","544702","543636","544036","553462","543661","550673","551562","552994","550343","544796","550710"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["stream","ore","contamination","boulder","mineral","passage","framework","wire","exposure","narrative"]}
