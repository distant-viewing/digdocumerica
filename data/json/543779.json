{"path":"543779.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and dynamic scene at a ranch, focusing particularly on livestock management. The composition of the image is created through an engaging perspective that places two men in cowboy hats at the foreground; one is looking ahead out of the frame and the other, with the side of his face visible, is smiling towards the center of the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, a young boy is seen mounted on a white horse, possibly in the midst of managing or herding the animals in the enclosed area. The horse stands out due to its robust form and pale color, contrasting with the earthy tones that dominate the scene.\n\nThe corral is filled with cattle, mostly white, which add to the lively agricultural setting. The backdrop is a clear sky with sporadic clouds, typical of a bright sunny day, enhancing the vividness of this outdoor setting. Fences and hints of vegetation in the far background anchor the image in a rural, open environment typical of farm or ranch life.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a distinctively Americana feel, capturing elements of western ranching culture through its portrayal of individuals engaging in everyday livestock management activities.","title":"Ranch scene","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543686","553104","552564","548830","543776","552565","553108","548828","543634","552562","553109","554128","554885","548838","553110","553114"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ranch","livestock","horse","management","ranching","herd","cattle","anchor","portrayal","midst"]}
