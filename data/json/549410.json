{"path":"549410.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph features a vibrant scene of a group of people aboard an ornate, traditional sailing boat, possibly a replica of a historic vessel, floating on calm waters. The boat is notable for its striking red and black colors with decorative elements that evoke a certain cultural or historical significance. It has a large red sail, hoisted and filled with wind, and the bow of the boat is adorned with an intricate design that includes a dragon head, suggesting influences from traditional Norse or Asian maritime design.\n\nThere are at least eight individuals visible on the boat, engaged in various activities. Some are handling the rigging and adjusting the sail, indicating active participation in sailing the boat. Others appear more relaxed, observing and enjoying the ride. The group is diverse in terms of age and gender, contributing to a lively and communal atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, the haze suggests a humid or misty day, possibly obscuring the view of a distant shoreline which can slightly be discerned. Other sailboats, small in appearance due to the distance, dot the waters further hinting at a popular or communal sailing area.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of leisure and adventure on the water, highlighting the beauty and function of the traditional boat as well as the engagement and enjoyment of the people aboard. The environment contributes to a serene but spirited setting, emphasizing outdoor and nautical culture.","title":"Viking image on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549415","548509","549412","547465","548524","549411","549397","548507","549413","549373","548513","547458","549386","548503","549392","547464"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","sailing","sail","sai","gender","rigging","det","spirit","hoist","participation"]}
