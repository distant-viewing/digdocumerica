{"path":"547286.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor scene where two distinct recreational activities are taking place. In the foreground, there is a small body of water with a sailboat that has a white hull and a beige sail with a visible identification mark. Two individuals are aboard the sailboat, actively engaged in sailing. The water appears slightly choppy, reflecting the daylight.\n\nIn the background, on green, hilly terrain which is likely part of a golf course, there is a group of four golfers. These individuals are dressed in traditional golf attire including hats and are engaged in playing. One of the golfers seems to be taking a shot while the others are observing. This area is adorned with neatly lined trees and some scattered shrubs.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is serene and leisurely, showcasing a vibrant outdoor lifestyle where people are enjoying different sports. The lighting suggests it could be either morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the light. The scene seamlessly blends aquatic and terrestrial recreational environments, enhancing the visual contrast and interest of the photograph.","title":"Saturday sail in Holmes Park","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["544021","547273","548555","552345","554149","544224","543994","544669","557416","554148","548513","558098","547781","548521","543941","548510"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["golf","sailboat","identification","softness","course","lifestyle","sailing","sail","hull","shot"]}
