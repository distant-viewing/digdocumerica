{"path":"549094.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a colorful, expansive agricultural landscape. The image shows a series of large, geometric field plots, each displaying different hues—ranges of greens, reds, and browns—indicating various types of crops or stages of cultivation. The fields are separated by defined roads or pathways, enhancing the geometric pattern. On the left side of the image, near the horizon, lies a body of water that stretches parallel to the fields, contributing an additional blue-green color to the palette.\n\nThe overall setting is flat, indicating a vast plain that is utilized for intensive agriculture. In the background, far beyond the fields, one can see a range of mountains, adding a soft, natural contrast to the man-made, structured appearance of the agricultural plots. The sky in the photograph has a slight greenish-yellow tint, possibly due to the color filtering or time of day, adding a surreal quality to the scene.\n\nAdditionally, there are intriguing linear streaks in the sky—likely an artifact of the camera or a reflection, appearing almost like a meteor or a quick-moving object captured during a long exposure. This element adds a dynamic and somewhat mysterious quality to the otherwise serene and orderly landscape.","title":"Checkerboard fields of California's imperial valley are fed by Colorado river.
