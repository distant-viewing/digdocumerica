{"path":"555123.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense forest of tall, slender pine trees covered in patches of snow, indicating it's possibly taken in winter or early spring. The trees are largely vertical, stretching upwards with a few broken or leaning trunks interspersed among the upright ones, adding a natural variety to the regimented vertical lines. The trunks are predominantly dark with snow highlighting their contours, giving them a textured appearance which contrasts with the dark, almost black background created by the shaded forest behind them. The canopy, while not fully visible, shows snow-covered pine branches drooping under the weight of the snow, visible at the top of the frame. The ground, though partially in shadow, also appears to be covered in snow, hinting at a cold, quiet woodland scene devoid of visible wildlife or human activity. This image, deeply shaded with pockets of brightness from the snow, plays on contrasts and the stark beauty of winter in a pine forest.","title":"Douglas firs 60 to 80 years old adjacent to a clear-cut area at Bon Jon Pass in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544918","557613","557020","543610","557597","549226","557608","542847","553574","555201","545297","542725","548744","555114","555117","557019"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["snow","pine","forest","winter","trunk","weight","pocket","brightness","one","wildlife"]}
