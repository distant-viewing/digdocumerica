{"path":"552302.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five individuals engaged in pulling and organizing a large fishing net on what appears to be a wooden dock or platform. The net is extensive and heavy-looking, adorned with a line of buoyant, spherical white floats connected by what looks to be red and silver linking devices. These floats are prominent and spread across the foreground of the image.\n\nThe individuals, four men and one woman, are occupied with the task, showing various degrees of movement and exertion. The men are wearing casual, functional outfits suitable for manual labor â€” jeans, t-shirts, and shirts, some wearing hats and others with their hair exposed.\n\nThe background reveals a calm body of water that reflects a cloudy sky, with trees and some industrial elements visible across the shore. The setting seems to be a rural or semi-industrial area, suggesting the activity might be part of a commercial fishing or similar maritime operation.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, indicating an outdoor setting during daylight hours, possibly under partly cloudy conditions that create a softer overall illumination. The composition focuses primarily on the action and interaction with the equipment, emitting a sense of teamwork and effort aligned with outdoor manual work.","title":"Preparing a purse seine for use in Alaska at home port of gig harbor in southern puget sound.
