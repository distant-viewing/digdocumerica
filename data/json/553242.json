{"path":"553242.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a lively outdoor scene, possibly a market or public square, rich with vibrant colors and activity. At the forefront, there's a flower stand with various large, colorful bouquets displayed in brightly striped pink and white, as well as plain yellow containers. These flowers vary from daisies to other less distinguishable types, adding a refreshing, natural element to the urban setting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman with long, curly brown hair is closely inspecting the flowers. She is dressed in a black and white checkered dress, a noticeable contrast against the colorful floral backdrop, and holding a beige purse with a pattern of green leaves.\n\nTo the right, there's a young girl with blonde hair, sitting and seemingly watching the surroundings or waiting for someone. She's dressed in a patterned top and a white skirt, her expression relaxed and interested in the ongoing scene.\n\nIn the background, the environment is busy with multiple people walking by and talking, blurred and indistinct. A hanging sign reading \"Fountain Square Sculpture Fund Inc.\" indicates possible fundraising or community events related to local art and sculptures.\n\nThe setting suggests a community-focused atmosphere in an urban area, possibly during a fair or market day, where locals gather to shop and enjoy the outdoor space. The depicted scene is both vibrant and casual, emblematic of city life and community interaction.","title":"August brings the \"D'Aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'Aug Days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
