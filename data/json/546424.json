{"path":"546424.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a picturesque view of a winding river valley surrounded by lush, green mountains. The image was taken during the day under partly cloudy skies, which casts varied shadows across the landscape, enhancing the depth and texture of the terrain.\n\nThe central feature of the photo is a river that snakes its way through the valley. Its shimmering surface reflects the light, making it a distinct visual element amidst the surrounding verdure. On either side of the river, dense greenery predominates, likely indicating a forested or heavily vegetated area. The river is bordered in some sections by flat, possibly cultivated lands, suggesting some human activity, possibly agriculture.\n\nA narrow road winds along and hugs one of the hill slopes. The road is visible in a few sections of the photograph, serving as a humanmade line through the natural scenery. A few small structures, perhaps houses or small farm buildings, can be spotted next to the road, indicating some residential or agricultural use.\n\nThe mountains show varying elevations, with some peaks noticeably higher than others, adding to the dramatic, rugged landscape. The sky above is filled with fluffy, white clouds, casting shadows and providing a dynamic and textural element to the sky.\n\nOverall, the scene is one of serene natural beauty, characterized by a harmonious blend of water, vegetation, and human presence, all under a vast and expressive sky.","title":"Guaynabo River south of San Juan","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552593","550526","550509","542700","550508","548010","550561","550562","550542","550525","542695","550528","542701","550586","550593","550487"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","valley","road","section","mountain","agriculture","elevation","wind","farm","scenery"]}
