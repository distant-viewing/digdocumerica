{"path":"547416.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man standing outdoors in a rural setting. He is located on the right side of the frame and wearing a tan fedora hat and glasses. He has a smile and squints slightly, which implies it's sunny. The man is dressed in a maroon sweater and a yellow shirt underneath.\n\nThe background reveals a vast agricultural field, lush and green, likely in early stages of growth. This field stretches to the background under a clear sky with few clouds. In the mid-background, there are a few farm buildings; a barn and other smaller outbuildings are visible. The immediate terrain near the man is muddy, showing patches of water, suggesting recent rain or irrigation.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a peaceful rural life, possibly on a farm, with elements underlining agricultural productivity and natural beauty. The man's attire and the location suggest he may be involved in farming or closely related activities.","title":"David frazer, 87, a leading citizen of utica","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["549051","544250","547409","558333","549042","554203","545087","547734","549120","552678","548876","545091","547679","547311","546068","542548"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farm","squint","productivity","fedora","maroon","outbuilding","irrigation","man","tan","underlin"]}
