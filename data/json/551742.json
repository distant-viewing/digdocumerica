{"path":"551742.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and bustling street scene, possibly dating from the mid-20th century based on the clothing styles and automobiles visible. The setting appears to be an urban environment with a mixture of lush greenery and city infrastructure.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are a couple of older adults engaging in conversation. The man is dressed in a dark overcoat and suit, and the woman next to him sports a teal hat, a light-colored coat, and a dark skirt. They seem to be casually speaking with each other as they walk.\n\nCentrally focused in the photograph is another older woman seated on a street bench. She is wearing an overcoat and has her legs crossed while seeming to be either waiting for someone or just resting and observing her surroundings.\n\nTo the right, the frame features a flowering tree with white blossoms, adding a touch of nature and beauty to the cityscape. This tree is in full bloom, suggesting that it may be springtime. On the far right, the corner of a building with a beige brick facade is visible.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a variety of mid-20th-century automobiles parked along the street, and further to the left, the top of what looks like a public building, possibly a museum or a governmental structure, can be seen, characterized by its large, detailed columns.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene and somewhat nostalgic, providing a snapshot of everyday life in what could be an American city during a bygone era. The presence of buildings, passersby, personal interactions, and a blend of nature among urban architecture are all woven into this scene.","title":"Couple pauses at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 79th Street to admire these crab apple trees at the peak of their bloom.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551665","548369","551739","555895","551815","551477","548388","546626","549906","546431","556199","556726","551824","556225","545372","549872"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["overcoat","automobile","street","museum","teal","passersby","blossom","century","city","bloom"]}
