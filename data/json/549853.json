{"path":"549853.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban scene, likely in an American city. Central to the frame are several large vehicles, including a prominent yellowish sedan in the foreground, and a shiny black sedan beside it. The street is bustling with activity featuring multiple other cars and a blue and white city bus. Prominently displayed on the bus is a sign that reads “DIMENTO CO.”\n\nIn the background, elevated roadways and train tracks add layers to the composition. A train can be seen passing on one of these elevated tracks. The architecture is distinctly urban, with tightly packed buildings flanking the street. Some buildings have visible external fire escape stairs typical of older city buildings.\n\nPedestrians are scattered throughout the scene, including a man crossing the street in the foreground dressed in white shirt and dark pants. Additionally, the scene includes various signs such as traffic lights and a \"TOW AWAY ZONE NO STOPPING\" sign on a street lamp. The lighting and the detail suggest a late 20th-century setting, emphasized by the style of the vehicles and the overall gritty atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Port authority","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550126","549886","555782","554309","549882","556224","546743","556724","554297","548410","548388","554310","556202","549874","555988","553276"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","bus","sedan","city","train","track","escape","sign","stair","roadway"]}
