{"path":"551355.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph focuses on the rugged and detailed texture of a tree bark, set as the primary subject in the center. The bark exhibits deep fissures and a rough, plate-like pattern, likely characteristic of an older tree. Its color varies from shades of gray to brown, with some areas possibly hosting lichen or moss, indicated by patches of white and light green.\n\nSurrounding the tree bark, green leaves partially frame the image, belonging to plants that suggest a forest or a densely vegetated area. The leaves are broad, possibly vine or shrub species. The soft lighting and natural tones suggest that the photo was taken in daylight under shaded conditions, typical of wooded environments.\n\nThe composition primarily serves to highlight the natural textures and the interplay between the organic growth of the bark and the encroaching greenery, portraying a sense of serene natural beauty and the complexity of woodland ecosystems.","title":"Ivy twines around rough bark of tree near gunter's big spring in the verdant ha ha tonka region","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554974","557616","545288","553587","543488","554592","550703","544662","557621","553586","555188","550792","542749","545292","542774","555181"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","vine","belong","host","shaded","varies","leave","plate","species","moss"]}
