{"path":"556198.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from the interior perspective of an older-model vehicle, showing a view out through the windshield. Inside the car, we see the back of the driver's head; he wears a striped shirt and is holding the steering wheel. The car's dashboard is adorned with various controls and dials typical of older vehicles, and includes a wide, black steering wheel.\n\nOutside, in front of the car, a man is observed standing with the hood of his vehicle open, inspecting the engine compartment. He appears to be dressed in a light-colored, possibly white shirt, and appears casual but focused on his task. Another individual, standing near the front side of the vehicle, who is slightly obscured, is interacting with the man checking the car or possibly assisting him.\n\nIn the background, there are other elements indicative of a parking lot or similar outdoor setting. A delivery-type truck can be seen, suggesting this scene could possibly be near commercial buildings or a service station. The environment hints at a practical, possibly mechanical, or maintenance-related activity taking place.","title":"Motorist at Soldier's Field, one of nine auto pollution test sites conducted free by the City of Chicago's Environmental Control Department.
