{"path":"543014.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and scenic coastal scene suffused with the late afternoon or early evening sun. The setting is a beach bordered by a high, dark cliff on the left, which casts a shadow over part of the sand. The right side of the image is illuminated by sunlight, reflecting brightly on the surface of the water, adding a silvery texture to the sea.\n\nIn the forefront, two people are riding horses along the waterâ€™s edge. The riders, presumably enjoying a leisurely ride, provide a sense of scale against the vastness of the shoreline and sea. Their presence adds a dynamic and human element to the landscape.\n\nThe beach itself is narrow and appears somewhat rugged, with dark sandy tones possibly indicating wet sand. Gentle waves lap onto the shore in rhythmic patterns. In the distance, the coastline extends into a rocky point that juts into the sea, partially silhouetted against the shimmering water.\n\nThe sun's position low on the horizon suggests either early morning or late afternoon, which creates a serene and somewhat moody atmosphere. The overall composition and natural lighting emphasize the beauty and tranquility of a coastal environment and the simple pleasure of a horseback ride along the beach.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542800","542806","542885","542956","542966","557509","543071","542891","542890","557529","542810","548221","545081","547483","554075","543252"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["ride","beach","sea","sand","horseback","sun","pleasure","rider","afternoon","horse"]}
