{"path":"554198.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image depicts three individuals on a boat amidst a serene water setting, seemingly engaged in the activity of fishing or managing a fishing net. The boat is light-colored and slightly elongated, characteristic of those used in calm waters or lakes. It houses one outboard motor visible on the rear side. \n\nThe person on the left sits calmly, wearing a red and white striped shirt, jeans, and appears to be observing the other two. The middle person is crouched, seemingly pulling the fishing net into the boat, dressed in a dark shirt and lighter colored pants. The person on the right stands and is actively handling the fishing net, wearing a dark jacket and pants. All three individuals demonstrate a focus on their respective tasks.\n\nThe background features a vast, open sky filled with soft clouds, blending into a distant horizon where the sky meets stretches of dense vegetation, and a clear view of the water reflecting the skyâ€™s colors. This setting suggests a calm day, suitable for lake or river activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the activities on the boat against a naturally scenic backdrop, conveys a tranquil yet engaging outdoor endeavor.","title":"Herbert May and companions gear up to fish on Red Lake","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["546053","552317","544980","546001","551350","552283","552313","549935","548164","542564","546976","552324","554199","546079","544770","547564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","fishing","boat","person","lake","motor","pant","endeavor","stretch","shirt"]}
