{"path":"543384.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a snowy mountain scene enveloped in a misty or foggy atmosphere. Two individuals are depicted skiing down a slope. They are dressed in red ski jackets and dark pants, and equipped with ski poles. The setting is a snowy landscape, with patches of dark, exposed earth providing contrast to the predominantly white snow. A few trees, thinly covered with snow, rise sparsely from the slope, adding a sense of desolation and quiet to the scene. The visibility is limited due to the fog, which adds a mysterious or ethereal quality to the image. The overall mood conveyed is one of adventure mixed with the solitude and stillness of a snowy mountain environment.","title":"Hikers of explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area climb from 7500 ft.
