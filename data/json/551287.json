{"path":"551287.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling commercial area alongside a roadway, overlaid with an ambiance of a typical overcast day. It features a dense cluster of advertisements and signs promoting various local businesses and attractions.\n\nForeground:\n- The most prominent object in the foreground is a sizable billboard with vibrant red and orange colors advertising the \"Bagnell Dam Union Electric.\" The vividly illustrated sign stands in noticeable contrast against the predominantly muted tones of the scene.\n\nMiddle Ground:\n- Across the span of the photograph, various other billboards and signs can be seen promoting tourist attractions such as the \"Ozark Opry,‚Äù \"Bridal Cave,\" and several others. These signs are indicative of a tourist-centric locale bustling with activities and offerings likely aimed at road-tripping families or visitors to the area.\n\nBackground:\n- Above the commercial signage, a small aircraft, seemingly a floatplane, is captured mid-flight near the top center of the image, hinting at the presence of a body of water nearby or an aviation activity related to tourism.\n- The background is filled with dense trees, creating a lush green canopy that suggests the area is either on the edge of a forested region or near a park.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light that softens the overall colors and shadows in the photograph, contributing to the sense of a typical gray, cloudy day.\n\nOverall Composition:\n- The composition of the photograph is horizontal, with a layered arrangement that places emphasis on the commercial vitality of the region while softly integrating natural and humanmade elements. The captured moment is characteristic of daily life in a busy tourist area, juxtaposed against a natural background and under moody skies.","title":"Bagnell Dam end of \"The Strip,\" a mile-long commercial \"funland\" winding along the ridge tops to the south of the dam.
