{"path":"545539.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"In the photograph, a child is seen from behind, standing at the edge of a reddish-brown water body, most likely a river or a large puddle of water. The child, appearing to be a young boy based on the short haircut, is dressed in a horizontally striped long-sleeve shirt in shades of brown, gold, and white. He wears what seems to be a dark knee-length skirt paired with weary-looking, dirt-specked calves typical of outdoor play. The child's pose suggests movement towards the water, with one foot stepping forward. \n\nThe water he is about to enter reflects white ripples, indicating either motion in the water or a reaction to something previously thrown or disturbed within it. The ground leading up to the water is wet and dark, indicating muddiness with scattered debris and stones, which allude to a natural setting rather than a maintained landscape.\n\nThe lighting in the photo evokes a moody atmosphere, emphasizing the vivid textures of the water and the earthy tones of the land. The focus and depth of field are on the child, making the background less detailed, yet it hints at a natural, open space with no visible built structures. The soft, natural light and the organic environment suggest a setting that could be in a rural area. The photograph conveys a sense of solitude and perhaps contemplation or play, as the child interacts with this seemingly secluded aquatic environment.","title":"Boy walks along banks of creek polluted by effluent from neighboring steel mills","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["544196","548837","547727","543689","544380","552940","549105","550241","548116","543468","543677","544200","546940","550268","550244","546220"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","water","calf","haircut","reaction","gold","puddle","foot","knee","skirt"]}
