{"path":"542567.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, atmospheric scene dominated by fog. In the foreground, there is a road sign that includes white text on a dark background, reading \"SEQUOIA GIANT FOREST\" with an arrow pointing left, and \"FRESNO\" with an arrow pointing right. The sign is slightly worn and has irregular, rough edges, suggesting it's been in place for some time.\n\nThe background features an ethereal landscape of towering sequoia trees partially shrouded in thick, misty fog, which adds a sense of mystery and quiet to the scene. The trees stand tall and dense, their silhouettes faint and ghostly due to the heavy fog that blankets the area, blurring details and softening the shapes of the trees. The overall ambiance is serene and somewhat isolated, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of a foggy day in the forest. The color palette is muted, with shades of grey and hints of green from the trees, contributing to the cool and damp atmosphere depicted in the image.","title":"Heavy fog","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["542575","542568","555124","542926","557601","543406","542930","542929","542750","555126","542928","542569","542925","555128","542748","545012"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pointing","arrow","fog","mystery","soften","tree","shroud","blanket","grey","sign"]}
