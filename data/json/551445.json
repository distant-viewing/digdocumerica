{"path":"551445.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph features a vibrant and bustling urban street scene with a primary focus on a woman on a bicycle next to a yellow bus. The bus, which appears vintage, is predominantly yellow with silver metallic details and red trimming, enhancing its mid-20th-century design. It has a banner above the windshield that reads \"EXPRESS SUNSET BLVD.,\" indicating the route or destination.\n\nThe woman, wearing a brown jacket, white top, and dark sunglasses, is exiting the scene to the right on her bicycle, which includes a front basket. Her relaxed posture and flowing hair suggest movement and a casual urban commuting scenario.\n\nIn the foreground, there are blurred metallic posts, possibly part of a fence or parking meter, suggesting the viewer's perspective from behind this barrier, giving the image a candid, snapshot quality.\n\nThe background is predominantly taken by other cars and elements that blur into the distance, emphasizing the focus on the bus and the bicyclist. The lighting is soft, likely indicative of either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle shadows and giving a calm mood to the scene. The ambiance captures a typical busy city life moment, filled with personal stories and a hint of nostalgia thanks to the vintage bus design.","title":"Bus crowds bicyclist on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["549891","547032","551504","556742","547814","556744","556804","556749","556791","547195","556799","556743","556708","556809","556792","556786"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","bicycle","trimming","commuting","blur","meter","windshield","nostalgia","banner","basket"]}
