{"path":"543168.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts two prominent red signs with white lettering on a rugged coastal landscape. The signs are planted on a patch of land with large and small rocks scattered around. The text reads “NO TRESPASSING CITY OF PACIFIC GROVE - PUBLIC ACCESS AREA BEACH OR WATER CONTACT ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED. CITY PUBLIC WORKS DEPT.”, indicating a restriction on access to the area.\n\nThe background features a rocky shoreline leading to the ocean, where waves can be seen crashing against the rocks. There is no vegetation on the rocks, which appear dry and sunlit, suggesting the photo was taken on a clear day with ample sunlight. The ocean is picturesque, with visible white surf, and the horizon meeting a clear, blue sky which covers the top portion of the image.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the image, focusing the viewer’s attention on the natural environment and the imposed restrictions signified by the signs. The overall composition juxtaposes the natural beauty of the location with the human-imposed restrictions, captured under bright lighting conditions.","title":"California--Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543420","545248","554119","554168","553861","547836","542984","543270","557474","547046","548846","545109","544228","544263","557441","550223"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["restriction","rock","ocean","surf","sign","lettering","access","animal","text","shoreline"]}
