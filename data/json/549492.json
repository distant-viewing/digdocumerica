{"path":"549492.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking nighttime view of Niagara Falls. The image is dominated by the powerful and ethereal sight of the falls themselves, which are lit up by artificial lighting, creating a mystical blue glow that highlights the cascading water. The falls descend with great force, creating a mist that adds a dreamlike quality to the scene.\n\nIn the background, against a dusky sky, the skyline of a city is visible, illuminated by various lights. Notable among the city lights is a tall structure with a distinctive top, possibly a tower or observation deck, which stands out due to its height and illumination.\n\nThe composition is atmospheric and moody, with the dark outlines of the cliffs at the right framing the waterfall. The exposure used in this photograph allows for a smooth, flowing appearance of the water, contrasting sharply with the static and rugged cliff faces. The overall effect is serene yet dramatic, emphasizing the natural majesty and power of Niagara Falls at night.","title":"Night view of the american Niagara Falls looking toward the canadian side.
