{"path":"556750.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a close-up shot focused on an individual's left hand, which is holding a red pen and writing on a clipboard. The clipboard is holding a form or document with several neat rows and columns; some entries are already filled in with handwritten text. The paper on the clipboard lists several headers such as \"Driver,\" \"Address,\" \"Item and Quantity,\" \"Time Out,\" and \"Pickup and Date.\"\n\nThe hand visible in the picture exhibits signs of aging, with visible wrinkles and veins. The setting is likely indoors or inside a vehicle, hinted by the partial view of what could be a steering wheel at the left edge of the frame. The background is softly blurred and predominantly dark, helping to focus attention on the action of writing and the details of the clipboard. The lighting casts a gentle illumination on the hand and clipboard, adding clarity to the objects being handled.","title":"Driver makes a note of his next pickup address on a dial-a-ride radio dispatched door-to-door bus service in Haddonfield, New Jersey. The vehicles operated as zone buses during the rush hour then picked up people at their homes during other times of the day. Federal and state transportation departments funded the demonstration project which began in February, 1972, and ended in March, 1975. At its peak, the service hauled about 1,000 riders per day.","placename":"Haddonfield (N.J.)","location":"Haddonfield, New Jersey","nn1":["555241","546648","556007","548892","548163","556741","556264","546281","552381","548999","557830","552377","555392","552389","555516","557910"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["clipboard","hand","writing","wrinkle","vein","entry","steering","pen","document","aging"]}
