{"path":"545051.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape with a wide view of an agricultural field under a strikingly dramatic sky. In the foreground, there is a paved road running horizontally across the image. Along this road, a neat row of young, mid-sized, leafy green trees is visible, possibly lining the edge of the road. These trees are spaced evenly and lead the viewer's eye towards the background.\n\nIn the middle ground, beyond the trees, a broad expanse of golden yellow fields stretches across the photograph. The contrasting colors of the green trees and the yellow fields add a vibrant appeal to the scene.\n\nIn the far background, a significant smoke event is occurring. Large plumes of gray and light brown smoke rise and billow into the sky, indicating a large fire. The smoke plumes are centralized in the image, drawing the viewer’s attention. The sky around the smoke is partly cloudy with fluffy white clouds and patches of blue sky, providing a dramatic backdrop to the smoke plumes.\n\nThe overall composition combines elements of nature’s tranquility and sudden, disruptive events, capturing a moment of natural beauty alongside human or natural disturbance.","title":"Burning of grass-seed stubble in willamette valley","placename":"Salem (Or.)","location":"Salem, Oregon","nn1":["545025","545009","545048","544962","548594","548595","542712","557578","547673","548592","545975","548597","545042","548854","547728","545971"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["smoke","plume","field","road","event","appeal","occur","disturbance","tree","viewer"]}
