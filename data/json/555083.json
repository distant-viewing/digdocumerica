{"path":"555083.jpg","date":"March 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and striking silhouette against a deep blue sky. The image features a sharply outlined, rugged rock formation, towering at an angle and filling most of the frame. On the right side of the image, near the silhouette of the rock, a spider is strategically positioned against the sky. The spider appears to be suspended in mid-air, possibly hanging by a thread of its web. It is positioned just in front of a bright, glaring sun. The sunlight is captured with a distinct starburst effect emanating from the point where the sun and rock edges meet, creating a visually arresting highlight in the composition. The overall mood is eerie and intriguing, focusing on the interplay of natural elements and light.","title":"Douglas fir seedling silhouetted growing in a burned clear-cut area of olympic national timberland, Washington.
