{"path":"543985.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring the Phelps Dodge copper smelter. The image is dominated by a large, vertical smokestack from which a thick plume of white smoke is billowing out into the sky. The smoke is carried to the right side of the frame by the wind, blending into the slightly overcast sky.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there are multiple industrial buildings that make up the smelter complex. These structures appear interconnected and vary in height and width, suggesting a complex series of operations within. The buildings are made of metal and concrete, typical of industrial constructions, and are equipped with several visible vents and smaller chimneys.\n\nThe landscape around the smelter is flat and barren, devoid of significant vegetation, indicative of a heavy industrial area that might not support much plant life. The ground is dusty and there is no sign of significant water bodies or greenery in the immediate vicinity.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, coupled with the vividness of the sky and the striking industrial elements, gives a stark visual impression of heavy industry and its environmental impact, marked by the prominent emission of smoke.","title":"Phelps Dodge Corporation's Douglas smelter","placename":"Douglas (Ariz.)","location":"Douglas, Arizona","nn1":["544777","546760","551052","550716","543005","543992","551060","544735","557218","548968","550981","550998","550869","549967","545236","548376"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","vent","width","vividness","emission","concrete","vicinity","billow","plume","chimney"]}
