{"path":"543097.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up and somewhat abstract view of sand dunes under low lighting conditions, possibly taken during the early morning or late afternoon. The texture of the sand is finely detailed, emphasizing the smooth, flowing lines and soft ridges formed by natural elements such as wind. Shadows play a critical role in this image, accentuating the curves and contours of the dunes and giving the sand an almost silky appearance.\n\nThe color palette is subdued, mainly consisting of dark browns, blacks, and shades of gray, which adds a sense of tranquility and mystery to the scene. The composition focuses on the natural, undulating forms of the sand, without any human presence or man-made objects, highlighting natureâ€™s sculptural beauty.\n\nThere are intricate patterns visible in the sand, including small ripples and larger, wave-like formations that provide a dynamic contrast to the otherwise gentle curves. The perspective and focus used give the dunes a monumental feeling, evoking a sense of scale that belies the actual size of the photographed area. \n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of natural serenity and artistic beauty, reflecting both the power and subtlety of natural forces shaping the landscape.","title":"Sand patterns","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550490","547717","545200","545199","545207","545203","553058","544415","548230","548906","547015","551553","549037","545855","544878","544873"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sand","dune","curve","black","serenity","mystery","force","ridge","up","contour"]}
