{"path":"555715.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a vast, deep blue ocean setting with calm waters, under a predominantly clear sky showing a hint of pastel hues. Central to the composition is a large, white boat moving swiftly through the water, creating expansive, frothy wake trails that spread out and shimmer in the sunlight, indicating its high speed. The boat, positioned towards the bottom left of the frame, is surrounded by the otherwise tranquil ocean that extends to the horizon, blending into the sky with a soft, seamless transition. The overall atmosphere is one of serene isolation, highlighted by the open sea and clear skies. Notably, there are slight imperfections visible on the photograph, possibly due to dust or age, adding an authentic, vintage character to the image.","title":"Tug with a barge of dredge spoils in the New York Bight, a unique coastal environment because of man's activities.
