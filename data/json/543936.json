{"path":"543936.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, picturesque sailing scene on a lake. In the foreground, there are multiple small sailboats actively participating in what appears to be a regatta. Each boat has sails that are brightly colored with various designs and numbers, adding vibrant contrast to the image. The sailors can be seen maneuvering their boats, likely trying to catch the best wind.\n\nThe background features a peaceful shoreline densely lined with tall, dark green trees. Just above the shoreline, there is a visible man-made structure, possibly steps or a small dock, that seems to lead up from the water's edge into the treed area. The overall atmosphere is serene, emphasized by overcast lighting conditions that soften the colors throughout the scene. The framing of this image, including the slight vignetting at the corners, draws the viewerâ€™s focus towards the center where the majority of the sailboats are clustered. This setting suggests a recreational or sporting event set in a natural, scenic environment.","title":"The fourth annual spring Sunfish regatta of the Louisville Sailing Club","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["552355","543994","547781","548555","547754","547757","549424","544669","552345","548510","552346","548526","544021","543941","552353","552351"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["sailboat","shoreline","regatta","sailor","sporting","boat","majority","sailing","framing","sail"]}
