{"path":"552761.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a city street scene, likely set in an urban residential area. The focal point of the image is a row of red brick houses, which share similar architectural features, including flat rooftops, white-framed double-hung windows, and stone steps leading up to white-framed doors. The houses are fairly tall and narrow, indicating they might be townhouses common in many American cities.\n\nIn front of the houses, there's a group of children and a few adults gathered, engaging in various activities, suggesting a sense of community or neighborhood life. The children appear to be playing or interacting with each other; some are standing while others are sitting on the stoops or steps of the houses.\n\nThe street is paved, and there's a sidewalk where the group is gathered. The condition of the buildings and the sidewalk suggests slight wear and aging, with some graffiti visible on the walls and other signs of urban life. The scene is bathed in natural sunlight, indicating it's daytime, and the shadowing provides a contrast that adds depth to the image.\n\nOverall, this image captures a slice of urban residential life, showcasing the architecture and the lively community interactions among the residents, particularly the children.","title":"Neighborhood youths repaving sidewalk in front of apartment buildings in north Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556170","552762","557287","552743","545397","548441","547433","555905","552742","545398","555900","552734","547946","555920","549287","555912"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["house","child","step","sidewalk","gather","stoop","townhouse","life","community","resident"]}
