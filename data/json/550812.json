{"path":"550812.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a polluted water scene, showing visible signs of environmental neglect. The foreground prominently features a murky body of water covered with floating debris, which includes multiple discarded items like styrofoam, plastic bottles, and metal cans. One metal can is particularly noticeable near the center, tipped over and resting partly submerged in the water.\n\nThe water's surface is interspersed with patches of algae and scattered plant material giving the area a neglected and unhealthy appearance. Surrounding the water are tall, dense reeds and grasses, extending out of the frame, indicating that the setting might be a marsh or wetland. These plants look unaffected by the pollution, contrasting starkly with the condition of the water.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image conveys a somber mood, emphasizing the impacts of littering and environmental degradation on natural aquatic ecosystems. The lighting suggests it might be midday due to the brightness and clarity of the visible objects and plants.\n","title":"Pepsi cans and other litter near the banks of the Wisconsin River at Merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550807","547524","544647","550352","555784","552127","547537","552811","551440","550806","547520","544175","550800","544810","547525","547907"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["plant","water","marsh","algae","reed","midday","can","degradation","bottle","metal"]}
