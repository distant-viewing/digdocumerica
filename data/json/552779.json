{"path":"552779.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"The photograph captures two men seated inside an open, small electric vehicle, indicating a casual yet business-related interaction possibly during an event or expo. The vehicle is red with a black interior and features a prominent label that reads \"SUNDANCER Electric.\"\n\nThe man in the driver's seat wears a blue pinstripe suit, pale blue shirt, and sunglasses, and appears to be engaged in a conversation. The other man, sitting in the passenger side, is dressed in a light brown jacket, beige trousers, and a patterned tie, and he seems to be either listening or speaking to the driver.\n\nBoth individuals wear badges, suggesting they are at a formal event, such as a trade show or corporate function. In the background, there is a glimpse of other attendees, one visibly in a tan suit.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, possibly near a building or a park, as indicated by the greenery and the walking paths visible. The mood seems professional yet relaxed, likely centered around the vehicle or technology they are in.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
