{"path":"555894.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene centered on a historic-looking, four-story residential building. The facade of the building features a faded, off-white color with ornate architectural details around the windows and a corner turret shape on the right-hand side. The building shows signs of wear and age, such as chipped paint and what appears to be some boarded-up windows, giving it a slightly dilapidated look.\n\nOn the ground floor, the building has commercial spaces, distinct with their red-painted walls. Each of the entrance doors on this level are arched and painted in dark colors, possibly black, flanking a central, closed, large garage-like door, suggesting mixed residential and commercial use.\n\nIn the foreground and adding dynamic motion to the scene is a blurred cyclist, who is captured in the middle of riding past the building. The rider, wearing a blue shirt and brown pants, is slightly bent over the handlebars, suggesting speed or exertion. The cyclist's presence adds a sense of everyday life and movement against the static backdrop of the building.\n\nThe street itself looks quiet with minimal traffic, and the road is marked with yellow lines. There is a clear blue sky above, which contrasts with the earthy and faded tones of the building and the street. No other pedestrians or significant activities are visible in the immediate vicinity, centering the focus on the building and the passing cyclist.","title":"Bicyclist passes an example of Brooklyn architecture on vanderbilt avenue in New York city.
