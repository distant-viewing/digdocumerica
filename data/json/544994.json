{"path":"544994.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a man standing in a river that cuts through a rocky landscape. The man appears middle-aged and is dressed in outdoor clothing—a plaid shirt, dark pants, and a cap. He stands with a confident posture, looking directly at the camera, and appears to be wading slightly in the water.\n\nThe riverbank where the man is standing is covered with small to medium-sized stones, indicating a stony or gravelly riverbed. This section of the river is narrow, suggesting it could be either a smaller river or a tributary. To the right of the man, the bank slopes upward into two large mounds of similar stones or gravel, perhaps indicative of dredging or other human alterations to the landscape.\n\nThe background shows a variety of trees, primarily deciduous, suggesting a temperate climate. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, which accentuates the muted, natural colors of the environment—greens, grays, and browns dominate the color palette. There are no buildings or other structures visible, giving the impression of a remote or rural setting. The overall mood of the photograph is one of solitude and tranquility, juxtaposed with the human impact on the natural environment.","title":"Gary johansen on his cattle ranch.
