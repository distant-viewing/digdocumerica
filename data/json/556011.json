{"path":"556011.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a wide expanse of lush, multicolored vegetation stretches across the frame, exhibiting different shades of green, brown, and red, possibly indicating various types of dense grasses and wild flora.\n\nIn the middle ground, a row of figures is seen laboring along a narrow path or a low railway track. Each figure is spaced out evenly, and they appear to be engaged in some form of manual work or inspection as they are bent slightly over or reaching down as they walk.\n\nThe background is minimalistic, blending seamlessly into the horizon with a glimpse of a calm, flat body of water, likely a lake or sea, softly touching the sky line. One utility pole is visible towards the right side, which aligns with the track or path, adding a rustic element to the pastoral scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a calm, rural work scene surrounded by natural beauty, emphasizing tranquility and the simplicity of outdoor labor.","title":"Railroad work crew improves the tracks and bed of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad near Bellefont, Kansas although Amtrak is responsible for most intercity service in the U.S., it leases the tracks from the nation's railroads which are responsible for their upkeep.","placename":"Bellefont (Kan.)","location":"Bellefont, Kansas","nn1":["556856","545040","551332","555567","544888","549141","544678","555821","555641","557087","557478","555603","557659","551304","549261","549236"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["track","path","figure","inspection","work","flora","railway","simplicity","labor","utility"]}
