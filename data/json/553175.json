{"path":"553175.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of an interesting and thought-provoking display. The main components are an old brown felt hat on which rests a small American flag. The flag, flapping to the right side of the image, is attached to the hat by a thin stick. Attached to the front of the hat is newsprint paper scrunched up and shaped to resemble a human face. The print on the paper includes various texts and advertisements that are not fully legible but suggest common newsprint content.\n\nThe hat and its adornments are isolated against a dark, almost black background. This isolation emphasizes the items and suggests a symbolic or memorial nature to the arrangement, potentially alluding to themes of identity, patriotism, or commentary on news and information. The lighting is focused on the hat and the paper face, which further accentuates their details and textures, while creating dramatic contrasts of darkness and light.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: sculptured figure at the student art show, a part of the elder high school's 50th anniversary celebration","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553174","548577","548225","553710","557707","549730","548226","547437","557048","556268","544423","548236","554361","543864","549199","558271"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hat","paper","flag","attach","allude","patriotism","flap","identity","provoke","commentary"]}
