{"path":"545131.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a towering cooling tower likely from a nuclear power plant. The cooling tower is the central feature of the image; it's a large, cylindrical structure that tapers at the top, resembling a giant inverted funnel. The exterior of the tower is textured and made of a light-colored material, likely concrete.\n\nThe tower is situated near a river bend, with the water body occupying the left side of the image. The river appears wide and bordered by lush, green banks. A small part of an aircraft (maybe a wingtip) can be seen on the bottom-right corner of the photograph, indicating that the photo is taken from inside an aircraft.\n\nAround the cooling tower and its base, several construction-related elements can be observed. This includes what looks to be construction machinery, parked vehicles, and stacks of materials, perhaps for ongoing work at the site. Behind the cooling tower, industrial or support buildings with flat roofs are visible. The landscape beyond the site features green, forested hills under a sky filled with thin, wispy clouds.\n\nOverall, this image documents an industrial facility, likely focused on energy production, set against a natural, green landscape, offering a contrast between technological development and the natural environment.","title":"The controversial trojan nuclear power plant on the Columbia River","placename":"Prescott (Or.)","location":"Prescott, Oregon","nn1":["545127","551184","553885","545171","548039","553829","551175","548211","551155","548035","548043","548208","544966","551983","547255","551928"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["cool","tower","aircraft","funnel","taper","site","construction","material","production","river"]}
