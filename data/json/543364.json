{"path":"543364.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph portrays a complex, industrial structure situated along a rugged coastal area. The large structure consists of multiple buildings and frameworks made primarily of wood and metal, exhibiting various states of wear and age. The construction is supported by concrete pillars that extend into the ocean. \n\nDetailing the scene, the water surrounding the structures is turbulent, with waves breaking over rocks scattered close to and under the facility. The shoreline is rocky, and it appears to be a natural, untamed coastal environment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are multi-tiered with visible signs of corrosion and weathering, indicative of exposure to marine conditions. There are numerous walkways and external staircases connecting different parts of the structure. The facility looks functional yet aged, with rust and faded paint on metal parts and weathered wood surfaces.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a clear blue sky and a calm sea beyond the immediate area of rocky coastline and turbulent water. Overall, the image captures a scene of industrial activity set against the natural beauty and harsh conditions of a coastal environment. There are no visible people or moving machinery, suggesting a moment of inactivity or abandonment.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543320","543242","543405","543359","543288","551953","546083","543257","547040","547579","552135","544527","552167","547118","547575","546006"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["corrosion","wood","facility","staircase","pillar","weathering","metal","structure","condition","walkway"]}
