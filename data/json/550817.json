{"path":"550817.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This image captures a striking natural water scene, likely from an aerial or elevated perspective. It shows a large body of water with pronounced ripples and waves on the surface. A significant feature in the photograph is the extensive foaming or frothy substance spreading throughout the water, creating textures and patterns. The foam appears to be drifting and accumulating in distinct patches, reflecting variations in water currents or wave actions. The darker water contrasts vividly with the white and grey shades of the foam, enhancing the visual complexity of the scene. Overall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the dynamic interaction between water and its frothy formations, presenting a detailed study of these natural patterns.","title":"Scum forms on the Wisconsin river near the mosinee paper company","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["557252","550849","550815","550370","553388","543194","555322","545164","544854","547650","550651","547502","543563","545923","553348","557240"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["foam","water","wave","drift","accumulate","current","substance","variation","study","complexity"]}
