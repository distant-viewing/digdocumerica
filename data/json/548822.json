{"path":"548822.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an isolated, worn wooden trailer sitting in a desolate, arid landscape. The trailer is aged and weather-beaten with fading brown paint and visible signs of wear and tear. It has two sections, each with a door and a couple of small windows, some of which are equipped with shutters. Notably, the trailer has signs that read \"FOR RENT INQUIRE WITHIN\" and \"FOR RENT CALL SL8-4092.\" These quirky signs add a touch of dry humor, considering the trailer's dilapidated state and remote location.\n\nIn front of the trailer, there's a scattering of objects including a stack of wooden boards and possibly some other miscellaneous debris. The ground around is sandy and speckled with small rocks and sparse desert vegetation, indicating an arid region, possibly a desert. Off to the left side, there's a simple outhouse made of wood, adding to the rustic and abandoned feel of the scene.\n\nThe background features a relatively flat terrain with a few scattered shrubs and a rising hillside in the distance that appears rocky and barren. The sky is clear with just a few wispy clouds, suggesting a sunny and dry climate. Overall, the photograph captures a sense of isolation and decay, highlighting a stark and somewhat humorous contrast between the concept of renting and the reality of the trailer's condition.","title":"Old railroad car","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544576","543350","544809","543339","544137","543171","554707","542588","554561","552455","547782","550279","544465","556491","544149","551081"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["trailer","desert","concept","beat","scattering","sign","reality","tear","consider","shutter"]}
