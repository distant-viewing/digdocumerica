{"path":"551114.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The image captures a rustic scene featuring a weathered wooden structure poised on a sloped terrain. This building, showing signs of aging and wear with its uneven plank siding and a slightly disjointed alignment, dominates the left side of the image. Its raised foundation, partially supported by concrete blocks, suggests adaptation to a hilly or possibly flood-prone environment.\n\nTo the right of the wooden building, down a gentle slope that meets a dirt road, are four individuals engaging in casual outdoor activity. One child leads the group followed by an adult pushing a toddler in a stroller and another adult walking alongside. Their relaxed postures and casual clothing suggest a warm, community-centric atmosphere, reflective of a tranquil day-to-day life. \n\nThe surrounding environment is lush with dense tropical vegetation, indicating a location that benefits from a moist, warm climate. The rich green foliage that borders the scene and the overcast sky add a serene mood to the setting. Telephone or electricity lines visible at the top suggest some degree of modern infrastructure, despite the seemingly isolated or rural location. \n\nThis photograph likely captures a moment that blends everyday life with a backdrop rich in natural beauty, perhaps hinting at a community that, while technologically connected, still retains a close bond with its natural surroundings. It appears to tell a story of simplicity and community bound together in a less urbanized setting.","title":"Housing on Route 61 at Eagle in the Kanawha Valley region","placename":"Charleston (W.
