A motorboat is prominently seen traveling down the river towards the camera, creating a gentle wake in the dark waters. The river is bordered on one side by a dense congregation of buildings and residential homes, adding a cozy small-town feel to the image. These structures appear rustic and are interspersed with foliage, including various trees and bushes, summarizing a waterfront community vibe.\n\nOn the other side of the river, several wooden docks stretch into the water, some with smaller boats moored to them, indicating a common practice of boating in the area. The background features softly rolling hills with a covering of dense trees in various shades of green, suggesting this scene is set in a lush, forested region. The sky, a pale blue with overcast and wispy clouds, lends a tranquil overlay to the overall setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph showcases a serene waterway scene typical of a peaceful, natural setting enhanced by human habitation in harmony with its environment.","title":"The Riverside town of cathlamet boasts a population of 656","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551208","551066","551218","551148","551067","551221","548921","551209","551281","550989","551217","545197","548916","557972","551993","549458"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","congregation","covering","overlay","harmony","motorboat","boat","wake","practice","habitation"]}
