{"path":"558069.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene by a river with people engaging in water activities. In the foreground, a person is maneuvering a red kayak close to the muddy river bank. The kayaker is wearing a buoyancy aid and a helmet, and is holding a double-bladed paddle. Standing on the shore nearby is another individual watching the kayaker. This person is also dressed in a buoyancy aid over a light jacket and red trousers, suggesting readiness for water activities.\n\nIn the background, two canoes occupied by pairs of individuals are visible. The first canoe is a tandem kayak with both occupants wearing life vests and paddling. The second canoe, further back, carries similar paddlers, echoing the activity of the first. The backdrop is lush with dense greenery and trees, and there's a fallen log partially submerged near the shore, adding a touch of wild, natural environment. The overall mood is one of outdoor adventure and leisure, likely captured on an overcast day given the soft, diffused lighting.","title":"Members of the Keel Haulers Club on the Cuyahoga River north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland. The river is a favorite for canoeists and kayakers because it is largely unspoiled. It still meanders and lives up to its Indian name which means \"crooked\". The Cuyahoga lies within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreational Area, a 20-mile stretch of land located between the metropolitan districts of Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["554465","558071","558070","550661","558068","550657","550659","554468","554462","554469","544759","545734","552333","549996","550663","553333"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["canoe","kayak","aid","shore","paddle","readiness","occupant","vest","person","pair"]}
