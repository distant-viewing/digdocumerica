{"path":"556933.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a dense forested area intersected by several dirt roads and a larger paved road. The forest predominantly features coniferous trees, presenting a rich canvas of dark green hues. A major road, distinguishable by its wider and smoother surface, cuts horizontally across the top third of the photo, with intersecting smaller roads visible that link to this main route. \n\nIn the lower center of the image, a clearing in the forest can be seen, marked by exposed earth that stands out as light brown against the surrounding greenery. This clearing is crossed by a dirt road, suggesting possible forestry activities such as logging or a construction site for road expansion. The exposed earth makes the area look like a hub where several roads converge or start from.\n\nThe surroundings are devoid of any visible buildings or human activity, which emphasizes the image's rustic and natural environment. The photograph likely captures a remote or less-populated region, focusing on the interaction of infrastructure with the natural landscape.","title":"Aerial view of on of the navy's typical Bangor annex roadways.  Regrowth Douglas fir land lies adjacent to the road, and a gravel pit is seen in the lower left portion of the photo.  Extensive construction is planned in the area and will take place for several years before the navy finishes work on its base for the new trident submarines.  Humans and animals now living in the area will be affected by the expected population growth","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["548598","542835","556970","550567","556938","556918","556976","556922","542836","556935","542833","556934","557001","556996","550613","556914"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["roads","road","clearing","intersect","expose","earth","bry","canva","dirt","expansion"]}
