{"path":"549316.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph features a lively outdoor scene predominantly filled with a variety of motorcycles, which are parked on a grassy area. The motorcycles, some equipped with side bags and extra seating, vary in color, design, and make, presenting a diverse collection. Among these, the most notable are several with bright, striking colors like red and chrome embellishments. \n\nIn the background, behind the motorcycles, a row of vintage buses and a couple of older cars are visible, arranged along the road parallel to the motorbike display. The buses have distinct, colorful designs that are typical of mid-20th-century styles, suggesting a possibly historical or special event setting. \n\nThe setting appears to be a park or a similar public space, flanked by trees that provide a lush green canopy overhead. The overall atmosphere feels like a gathering or meet-up, possibly related to enthusiasts of motorcycles and vintage vehicles. There's no clear presence of people in the immediate area where the motorcycles are parked, perhaps indicating they are off-gathered elsewhere nearby. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus more on the arrangement of machines than human activity, gives it a somewhat static though visually rich character.","title":"Motorcycle parking near Battery Park in Lower Manhattan these machines belong to people who work in downtown offices.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558232","556719","546614","551383","544859","547495","557777","551382","554876","556790","548690","556206","545598","543727","553955","551443"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["motorcycle","bus","park","embellishment","enthusiast","seating","chrome","strike","vintage","up"]}
