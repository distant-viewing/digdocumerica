{"path":"543462.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts two women and a small child enjoying a scenic view by the sea. The child is being held up by one of the women, possibly to get a better view of the landscape. The composition of the image includes a striking, barren tree branch extending diagonally across the top left corner, adding a natural frame to the scene.\n\nThe child, held on the left, wears a dark jacket and jeans, while the woman holding the child is dressed in a patterned shirt and jeans. The other woman, to the right, wears a light sweater and striped shorts, standing slightly apart but engaged with the group as they look out towards the water.\n\nThe background features a calm sea and a cloudy sky, suggesting an overcast day. The ground is rocky with patches of green and red-hued foliage, giving the setting a rugged, natural feel. The overall mood is serene and contemplative, with the group absorbed in the natural beauty before them.","title":"Southern California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552295","544230","543499","553377","552280","548794","543372","543485","547676","551929","547124","548793","553376","548699","553496","554491"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","woman","jean","hold","sea","get","absorb","group","sweater","corner"]}
