{"path":"552753.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of five young men sitting and standing against a graffiti-covered urban backdrop. The setting appears to be an old, rundown building with a wooden door and covered windows. The walls are heavily tagged with graffiti in various colors, including names and marks.\n\nFour of the men are seated on steps leading up to the building while one is standing on the right side of the frame. Their attire is casual and varies from one individual to another, including elements of 1970s or 1980s street fashion, such as a red beret, leather jackets, patterned shirts, and high-top sneakers. The group portrays relaxed yet varied postures, ranging from a seated pose with legs crossed to leaning slightly forward while looking directly at the camera.\n\nOn the ground, there are some items of litter, like crushed paper and wrapper, indicating a possibly neglected urban environment. The overall tone of the image suggests a candid moment captured amongst friends in a distressed neighborhood setting, giving it a raw and authentic urban feel. The lighting implies it may be taken during daytime with natural, somewhat muted lighting conditions.","title":"Street gang members","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552973","545358","552752","555906","553172","553487","549865","556153","553166","545315","545331","551126","558193","553148","553155","555899"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["graffiti","sneaker","leather","friend","mark","litter","group","daytime","pose","step"]}
