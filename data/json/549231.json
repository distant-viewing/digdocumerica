{"path":"549231.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a bird's nest delicately placed among grass and twigs. The nest is roughly circular, woven from strands of dry and fresh grass, forming a compact and secure cradle. Inside the nest, there are several small eggs speckled with spots, suggesting they are likely from a wild bird species common in grassy or garden areas. The colors of the eggs are a muted white with shades of brown or grey spots.\n\nThe focus is centered on the nest and eggs, with the immediate surroundings slightly blurred, emphasizing the nest itself. The lighting appears natural, highlighting the textures of the grass and the detailed pattern on the eggs. The overall setting suggests a quiet, natural environment, possibly in a field or a backyard untouched area. The composition of the photograph, with the nest nestled among the grass, evokes a sense of peacefulness and the subtlety of natureâ€™s intricate designs.","title":"Nest in prairie grasses on a ranch in the Powder River Basin","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544513","553876","550471","548490","548493","548505","544505","544501","548497","544489","552696","548501","555010","544838","549115","544478"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["grass","bird","spot","strand","backyard","twig","peacefulness","specie","white","garden"]}
