{"path":"553014.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a construction scene involving the paving of a road. In the foreground, a freshly paved section of road is visible, covered in a thick layer of wet concrete. Embedded within the concrete are multiple parallel steel reinforcing bars, or rebar, which are exposed and laid out across the width of the road to likely reinforce the pavement.\n\nIn the center of the image, there's a large, heavy-duty construction machine, possibly a paving or road-laying machine, extended over the area being worked on. The machine is colored predominantly yellow and is equipped with several operational levers and platforms, suggesting it may be used to spread, smooth, and compact the concrete. Several workers are visible on this machine, wearing safety gear and actively engaged in the construction process.\n\nBehind the machine, the scene extends to an already completed section of road that bends slightly to the right. There are a few workers standing by the roadside, observing the process or preparing to engage in subsequent tasks.\n\nThe setting of the photograph includes a rural or semi-rural landscape, with lush green fields and trees visible in the distance, under a cloudy sky. The overall environment suggests that this construction might be taking place near a quieter, less urban area.","title":"Road construction, Interstate 55. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
