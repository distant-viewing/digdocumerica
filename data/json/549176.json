{"path":"549176.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a dramatically eroded landscape, showing striking geological formations. The image captures an area of multiple parallel gullies or ravines, suggesting a significant weathering and water erosion process. These formations almost resemble an amphitheater of serrated, terraced layers, receding into the distance.\n\nOn one side of the ravines, there's a body of water, possibly a river, meandering alongside these formations, contributing to the erosion of the landscape. The colors exhibited are mostly a blend of earth tones - greys, greens, and browns, hinting at vegetative cover, possibly grasses, on less steep areas.\n\nAdditionally, there's a clear presence of an infrastructural element, potentially a road or pathway, that cuts across the scene at the bottom, running parallel to the river. On the opposite side of the eroded formations, the landscape opens up into what appears to be a flat field or a plain, which marks a stark contrast to the rugged terrain dominating the photo.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph and the patterns of erosion provide a vivid illustration of the powerful natural processes shaping our planet's surface. It highlights both the beauty and the destructive force of water erosion in shaping geographical landscapes.","title":"Spoil piles left by burlington-northern strip mining operations 20 to 30 years ago","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555595","543977","545938","552690","550414","545794","544748","544752","551231","544745","545799","550395","552548","545802","542612","551232"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["erosion","formation","gully","illustration","process","shape","erode","weathering","recede","force"]}
