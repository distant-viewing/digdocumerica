{"path":"555530.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"The image captures a close-up of an elderly woman outdoors during what appears to be dusk, adding a soft lighting effect. She has deep-set eyes and a determined yet thoughtful expression. Her visible age is accentuated by fine wrinkles and gray hair. She is wearing a knitted scarf wrapped around her head and tied under her chin, featuring a traditional paisley pattern. Her apparel includes a heavy wool sweater striped in shades of blue and gray. The woman's hands are partially visible; one hand appears to be adjusting the scarf at her chin.\n\nIn her hands, she holds a wooden stick or a tool, suggesting she might be engaged in outdoor activity. The background is softly blurred with hues of green and hints of an early evening sky, suggesting a rural setting. A partial view of a building can be glimpsed in the distance to the left, reinforcing the bucolic environment. The focused and slightly upward angle of the shot directs attention to her face and upper body, emphasizing her facial expression and attire details.","title":"This woman lives on a dairy farm near Randolph center Vermont, that has been owned by the family for six generations low milk prices and increasing property taxes threaten her way of life","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["556594","554051","558319","551439","552398","543864","547385","544321","557157","553499","551438","557177","556487","542613","558323","544311"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["chin","scarf","apparel","hand","wool","wrinkle","wrap","expression","stick","woman"]}
