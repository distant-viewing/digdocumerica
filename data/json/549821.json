{"path":"549821.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene on a waterbody featuring three large barges loaded with a vast amount of garbage. The central barge is being pushed or pulled by a red-and-black tugboat adorned with the name \"J.P. McAllister\" visible on its side. Each barge is densely packed with various forms of refuse, predominantly featuring large amounts of unidentifiable mixed waste, which includes things like common household trash and pieces of larger debris.\n\nThe barges are large, rectangular, and robust, marked with numbers \"US 61\" and \"US 39\" on their respective hulls, identifying them as part of a numbered fleet. The water around the barges is ruffled, indicating movement and the operation of the tugboat. The composition of the photo emphasizes the large scale of waste management and transportation, set against the dark waters which fill the background of the image. The angle of the shot is from an elevated perspective, possibly taken from a bridge or another high vantage point, looking down on the barges and tugboat. This situation likely depicts an industrial activity related to the disposal or recycling of municipal waste.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York city produces each day.
