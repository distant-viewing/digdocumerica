{"path":"551825.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features an older man seated on the edge of a curved concrete planter filled with vibrant, colorful flowers. The flowers vary in hue, with sections of yellow, orange, and red blossoms creating a visually appealing palette. The man, who is bald and wearing a dark coat, sits with his legs crossed, holding a clear plastic bag filled with what appears to be candies or small objects. His expression is introspective or possibly weary, as he gazes off to the side of the frame.\n\nThe setting appears to be a public, urban space, indicated by the presence of paving stones underfoot and the blurred forms of pedestrians in the background. The overall atmosphere suggests a busy city environment where the colorful planters provide a decorative and perhaps calming element amidst the urban setting. The image captures a moment of solitude or contemplation, contrasting the vibrant energy of the flowers with the more subdued demeanor of the man.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
