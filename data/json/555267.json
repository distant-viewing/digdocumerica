{"path":"555267.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image depicts an interior view of a storeroom or small storage area. The room is lined with tall, dark shelving units filled extensively with various types of items, all grouped and wrapped in clear plastic bags or containers. The shelves are densely packed and appear to be organized in a somewhat chaotic manner, with some bags overflowing and others tightly fitted to maximize space.\n\nThe items on the shelves seem to vary greatly, including bottles (which could be chemicals or liquids), boxes, and other packaged goods, suggesting a storage area possibly for a workshop, laboratory, or a specialized store. The floor is visible and is a basic, light-colored vinyl or linoleum, which shows signs of wear and dirt, consistent with an area of high utility.\n\nThe lighting is fluorescent and casts a bright, even light across the room, enhancing the visibility of the contents on the shelves. There are no visible windows, suggesting this could be an internal room without direct external access. The overall composition emphasizes functionality over aesthetics, focusing on the practical use of space for storage.","title":"Laboratory storage room for pesticides at an environmental protection agency facility in New York city","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555268","551588","555259","556369","552093","555253","552094","552096","553658","553763","555255","555244","544818","555237","555324","555953"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["shelf","room","storage","bag","package","shelving","maximize","specialized","item","fitte"]}
