{"path":"546211.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The image features a note pinned against a textured wall, primarily addressing complaints about the room. Directly above the note are two double electrical outlets framed in a beige plate that matches the cream color of the wall. The note itself is handwritten in a bold red marker on a lined page, having been torn from a spiral notebook, evident from the rugged left edge.\n\nThe message on the note reads: \"Sir, This is not one of our good room. This bed is bad. Watch out for the shower it seeps through the wall. The commode same times hangs. We did not have another room available. Maid.\" This candid message indicates poor room conditions and punctuates an apology for the lack of alternatives.\n\nThrough the display of the note and its surrounding, including electrical outlets, the image encapsulates a scene of simplistic communication and utility within what appears to be a budget accommodation environment.","title":"Message on a wall in the frio canyon lodge","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["553522","544368","556099","554158","557343","557342","557879","545810","552457","553527","552096","555392","553530","557695","555301","555416"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["note","room","outlet","message","wall","accommodation","notebook","pin","address","tear"]}
