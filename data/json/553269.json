{"path":"553269.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene in what appears to be an outdoor workshop or educational setting, likely focused on pottery or clay sculpting. The central activity involves a group of people, including children and adults, deeply engaged around a working area littered with various pottery tools and containers of clay.\n\nIn the foreground, several children are seated on the ground around scattered lumps of clay. A man, possibly an instructor, is on his knees, interacting closely with the kids as he either demonstrates a technique or helps one of them with their clay project. He wears a light purple shirt and dark shorts, with a focus that suggests he's guiding the activity.\n\nThe setting features a rough, unfinished cement floor, which sets an informal and hands-on atmosphere. Around the central group, other spectators, possibly parents or bystanders, watch the activities. Their attire, including casual shorts and summer tops, along with the presence of a camera hanging from one person's neck, suggests this might be a special event or a public demonstration taking place in a warmer season or climate.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its busy yet cohesive arrangement of people and materials, effectively conveys a moment of learning and engagement in a community setting, possibly during a festival, fair, or outdoor class focused on arts and crafts.","title":"'D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
