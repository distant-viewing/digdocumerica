{"path":"545487.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of a person's hand holding what appears to be a rough, irregularly shaped rock or mineral fragment. The object is quite textured and has an elaborate surface pattern featuring small, multi-faceted cells, which gives it a complex, honeycomb-like appearance. The colors on the object include shades of black, gray, white, and hints of brown.\n\nThe person's hand gripping the object is visible on the right side of the image, with their fingers partially encircling it, suggesting that the object is not very large. The background is unfocused and neutral in color, likely to emphasize the detail and texture of the object in their hold.\n\nThe image could be displaying a piece of volcanic rock or something similar, often used in various scientific investigations to study geochemical properties and natureâ€™s impact on different materials over time. The photograph is informative, aimed at highlighting the strikingly porous texture and complex structural composition of the object he is examining.","title":"Shrivelled and hardened lung of black lung victim.
