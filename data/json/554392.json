{"path":"554392.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"In this photograph, a young child stands next to a shiny green Porsche Targa. The car features a distinctive chrome door handle and a Targa badge just below the window. The model of the Porsche, \"911 S,\" is indicated on the silver hubcap on the visible wheel. The child, likely a boy based on the haircut and attire, is dressed formally in a dark navy blazer, light blue dress shirt, dark trousers, and white shoes with black details. He is also holding a clear plastic cup filled with a drink, suggesting the setting may be a social or public event, possibly a car show or a similar exhibition. The child is looking up, giving the impression of gazing intently at something out of frame, which draws attention away from the car momentarily and onto whatever has caught his curiosity. The flooring indicates a mix of green and dark carpet, and there is a glimpse of a reflective surface or a metallic object in the background, adding a sense of a well-lit indoor environment. The image has a slightly blurred, dreamy quality, characteristic of many photographs from the 60s or 70s, evoking a nostalgic feel.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554377","554376","557917","552412","557866","545328","552780","552787","555475","552790","557878","554372","557847","557874","554389","549143"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["child","60","haircut","car","flooring","exhibition","70","carpet","handle","blazer"]}
