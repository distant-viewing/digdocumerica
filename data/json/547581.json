{"path":"547581.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a decaying waterfront scene with an industrial backdrop. In the foreground, the shoreline is cluttered with assorted rocks and debris, including large boulders and assorted smaller stones of various colors and sizes, scattered haphazardly along the water's edge.\n\nThe body of water appears calm and reflects the muted, cloudy sky above. The middle ground features the remnants of an old, dilapidated wooden dock or pier system. There are numerous wooden piles, many of which are broken or eroded, sticking out of the water, hinting at the decay and disuse of the waterfront infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, industrial tanks or containers dominate the view. These large, white structures have a stark, utilitarian look, and their clean lines contrast with the disorderly natural elements and decaying wooden structures in the foreground. Additionally, there is a small architectural structure visible, resembling a silo or storage tank, which also contributes to the industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe scene portrays a juxtaposition of natural elements against industrial progress and neglect, creating a somewhat melancholic and introspective mood. The overall composition highlights themes of abandonment, environmental impact, and the passage of time.","title":"Providence river at bold point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547622","547582","547893","551985","547594","547584","549300","548105","551984","552240","547577","547572","547019","543320","549307","547575"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["assort","waterfro","decay","tank","erod","not","disuse","progress","boulder","dilapidate"]}
