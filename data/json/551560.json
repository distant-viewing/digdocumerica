{"path":"551560.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a polluted water body with visible oily sheens and floating debris. The water appears dark and murky, indicating severe contamination. The foreground shows the edge of the water with broken wooden planks and some vegetation on the muddy bank, while the water itself is filled with swirls of oil or chemical residues creating iridescent patterns on the surface.\n\nAdjacent to the polluted water, there is a background that depicts an industrial setting with several parked cars, mostly from the 1960s or 1970s era, judging by their designs. Beside the cars, a large, dilapidated industrial building is visible, marked with faded and peeling paint. The environment surrounding this scene is barren with patches of grass and a general lack of vibrant vegetation, possibly due to the industrial activity or pollution levels.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the environmental degradation and the juxtaposition of a neglected natural setting against the backdrop of industrial decay. The overall tone of the image is somber and serves as a stark representation of environmental pollution and its consequences on the natural landscape.","title":"The shipment of grain is a major activity of Duluth Harbor. As freighters are loaded, grain particles escape into the air, then settle on the surface of the water and, finally, sink and decay.","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["547493","551561","551562","547614","552127","551559","544175","544580","555851","547907","550812","544810","552019","555784","544779","547626"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","consequence","residue","contamination","swirl","water","sheen","representation","degradation","oil"]}
