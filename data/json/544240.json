{"path":"544240.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing in a lush, green garden environment. He is of middle age with dark hair, beard, and glasses. He is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless shirt and dark trousers, with sandals. The man is holding a small plant with a root ball in his hands, and appears to be either planting or attending to the garden.\n\nThe area around the man is somewhat cluttered and naturalistically overgrown. To his immediate left, there are large banana leaves and a few statues that appear to be cherubs, set amongst other potted plants and gardening supplies. Various items such as pots, overturned buckets, and metallic containers are scattered on the ground surrounding him.\n\nThe background is dense with foliage, suggesting this scene takes place in a garden that is either very well-tended or somewhat wild. The lighting indicates it's a sunny day, giving the greens a vibrant, lush appearance. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a casual, personal moment of gardening in a private, green space.","title":"Louisiana wetlands, south of Lake Borgne","placename":"Violet (La.)","location":"Violet, Louisiana","nn1":["544236","550760","544295","557681","544275","549298","551625","554797","546286","555300","551626","551628","546505","550059","553216","551490"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["garden","gardening","pot","plant","overturn","sandal","ball","root","attend","statue"]}
