{"path":"546883.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In this photograph, two young boys are playing outside on a sunny day. One boy is jumping to kick a soccer ball that is being sprayed by a stream of water from a hose held by the second boy. Both boys are shirtless and wearing swim shorts; the boy holding the hose wears dark blue shorts while the other sports a pair of light tan shorts. They appear to be playing on a grassy field, partially shaded and with patches of dried grass suggesting summertime.\n\nThe scene is set against a chain-link fence background, which is partially covered by an unkempt, bushy green hedge. The fence and hedge seem to enclose the area where the boys are playing. Beyond the fence, visible sections of a building can be seen, hinting that this location might be near residential buildings or a community park area.\n\nThe overall ambiance is playful and carefree, capturing a moment of childlike joy and activity under the refreshing mist of water in what looks like a warm climate setting. The grass, sunlight, and water spray add a vivid, lively feel to the moment being enjoyed by the boys.","title":"Children play with a lawn sprayer near the naval academy","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["552540","543991","555921","553448","551225","551857","544805","556136","553430","543677","555931","547176","543689","553512","550002","544221"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","hedge","short","hose","fence","spray","play","summertime","jump","refresh"]}
