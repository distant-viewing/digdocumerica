{"path":"547030.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a weathered two-story house situated close to a shore, where waves are washing onto the beach. The house is clad in white shingle siding, which appears aged and shows signs of wear and discoloration. There are three visible windows: one on the upper level and two on the lower level, all featuring a classic design with multiple panes and wooden frames. Notably, the side of the house facing the viewer is leaning slightly, suggesting either an illusion from the camera angle or actual structural settling or damage.\n\nClose to the base of the house is a wooden object, possibly a piece of dock or flotsam, and there's also a small, likely buoy-like, round object near this wooden piece. The sand beach in the foreground is partially covered by foamy sea waves, bringing in elements of natural motion and energy to the scene. The overall ambiance is quaint, somewhat desolate, and clearly reflective of a coastal lifestyle, potentially threatened by erosion or flooding. The lighting and saturation in the photograph give it a slightly vintage or dated appearance.","title":"Aftermath of flooding of lake Michigan in zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547085","547119","547040","547038","547645","547641","547633","543244","551963","543355","543242","547149","550307","547105","547118","545067"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["house","beach","wave","level","discoloration","piece","buoy","pane","flooding","wash"]}
