{"path":"550773.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape featuring a broad river. The image is imbued with a soft purple hue, suggesting it is either dawn or dusk, which adds to the tranquil ambiance. Dense forests flank both sides of the river, their outlines merging into a silhouette against the lighter sky. The water is calm, with gentle ripples reflecting the soft light.\n\nToward the center of the image, there is a small boat with a few occupants, moving gently along the river. The boat appears as a tiny element compared to the expansive nature surrounding it, emphasizing the vastness and quietude of the setting. The sky overhead is smooth, without visible clouds, contributing to the overall calmness of the scene.\n\nThe composition focuses on horizontal layers - the dark silhouette of the forest, the subtly reflective river surface, and the fading light sky, creating a harmonious and meditative landscape. The presence of the boat adds a human element, providing scale and hinting at leisurely or possibly livelihood-related activities taking place within this natural setting.","title":"The three hundredth anniversary of the Marquette-Joliet 1673 exploration of the Mississippi and its tributaries inspired a retracing of the 3000 mile route by seven men costumed in 17th century garb and paddling two 17th century type canoes. Here they are shown leaving the Muscoda campsite at 8 am. Unusually high water of the Wisconsin River covers sand bars and speeds the 20th century crew to Prairie du Chien where the Wisconsin joins the Mississippi River.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550989","551209","550831","543444","552318","557239","550769","550988","552597","551210","557106","557972","550324","547230","550845","550656"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","boat","silhouette","occupant","quietude","imbue","overhead","forest","calmness","merge"]}
