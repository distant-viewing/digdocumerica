{"path":"546679.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a bustling urban setting with several notable features and landmarks. The image centers on a large body of water, likely a river, with various boats docked along its edges, and is surrounded by multiple infrastructure elements. A prominent feature of the scene is a series of roads packed with vehicles; traffic appears heavy, suggesting either rush hour or a congested area.\n\nIn the background, the Washington Monument, a significant and recognizable obelisk, dominates the skyline. Its presence suggests that the photograph is of Washington, D.C. Near the monument, several large, classical-style government buildings can be seen, characteristic of the architecture found in many parts of this city.\n\nThe foreground shows an expansive parking lot filled with cars and a series of piers or jetties with more vessels moored, indicating a busy, multi-functional waterfront area. The overall composition conveys a dynamic, densely populated urban landscape, encompassing transportation, recreation, and landmarks significant in American history and governance. The lighting and cloud cover suggest either early morning or late afternoon, with a slightly overcast sky, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene.","title":"The two 14th Street bridges, looking north from Virginia to the District","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546692","547267","546570","546584","546693","546741","546585","547226","547228","546577","546740","553865","546578","548390","546613","546616"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["landmark","series","monument","government","jetty","encompass","rush","recreation","history","moor"]}
