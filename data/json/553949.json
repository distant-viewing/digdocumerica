{"path":"553949.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a striking close-up of a red hibiscus flower. The flower is vividly red and fills most of the frame, creating an intense and almost surreal visual impact. Its petals are broad with a slightly ruffled texture, and they radiate outward from the center where the stigma and stamens emerge. The stamens are topped with golden yellow anthers laden with pollen, adding a contrast to the deep red of the petals. The center also features a dark, possibly black, area providing a visual anchor for the flower's heart.\n\nThe lighting used in the photograph gives off a diffuse and soft effect, with gentle gradients of light and shadow playing across the delicate structures of the petals. This lighting contributes to the hazy, dreamlike quality of the scene.\n\nThe background is indistinct, possibly due to a shallow depth of field, which enhances focus on the hibiscus itself. It appears washed out and in hues of muted dark and light colors, serving to highlight the vibrant flower. The overall composition emphasizes the bloom, utilizing its natural symmetry and color to draw the viewer’s eye directly to the intricate and delicate details of the flower’s center.","title":"Hibiscus flowers thrive on all the islands","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["554116","553948","554117","554840","544891","543623","557586","557545","547815","550464","554114","554587","555035","545699","544875","551380"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","stamen","dark","ruffle","center","laden","radiate","symmetry","heart"]}
