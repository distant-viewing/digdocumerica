{"path":"556961.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting, likely taken during the early fall given the weathered look of the vegetation. In the forefront, there is a fenced-in garden area with what appears to be dried cornstalks, indicating the end of their growing season. The garden's fence is made from wooden posts connected by two or three rails, which are slightly worn and discolored.\n\nBehind the garden, there is a small, weathered red building that could be a storage shed or a small barn, followed by a white house with a red roof. The house has two visible add-ons or sections: a smaller one extending out the back with what seems to be patched roofing and a side porch on the main section. This setup is typical for rural homesteads set up for practical, functional use with modifications possibly made over time as needed.\n\nTo the left of the house, there's an open field bordered by a wooden fence and more dense vegetation, likely marking the boundaries of the property. The landscape gradually slopes uphill, leading into a dense forest that fades into the background under a cloudy, overcast sky, adding a sense of gloom and moisture to the atmosphere evident in the muted colors and wet surfaces shown throughout the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a serene, quiet rural life that is closely connected to the seasons and nature, underscored by the presence of mature trees, worn out wooden structures, and the post-harvest garden.","title":"House and garden adjacent to Luoto Road near naval installations.
