{"path":"550126.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene with several distinct elements. The foreground shows a busy street scene where people are walking and a variety of vehicles, including cars and a bus, are visible. One car, a white sedan, is particularly prominent, parked or stopped in the foreground.\n\nA large, open parking lot filled with cars occupies the middle ground of the image, serving as a barrier before the buildings behind it. The lot is bustling, indicative of a busy city area, possibly near a commercial or business district given the density of parked cars.\n\nIn the background, multiple high-rise buildings dominate the skyline. These include two large tower blocks that appear to be residential or office buildings under construction or renovation, as suggested by the incomplete exteriors and construction materials visible.\n\nStreet signs are visible; one reads \"BURKE AIRPORT,\" suggesting proximity to an airport, and another says \"DON'T WALK\" indicating a pedestrian crossing signal.\n\nThe overall scene captures a lively, urban environment with a mix of transportation modes and architectural styles, hinting at a scene probably from the late 20th century given the car models and general ambiance. The image may be a reflection of city life, possibly in a mid-sized American city, encompassing elements of daily commute, urban development, and the bustle typical of a cityscape.","title":"High rise apartment buildings in downtown Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549853","552711","546716","543961","555782","546743","549874","546723","551478","549886","555450","546708","551135","549849","548419","553276"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["car","lot","city","mode","renovation","bustle","commute","airport","crossing","encompass"]}
