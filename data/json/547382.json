{"path":"547382.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving two men engaged in a conversation, standing outdoors. The man on the left is sporting a dark beard and mustache, wearing sunglasses and a plaid shirt. He appears to be holding a clipboard and a pen, perhaps noting down or discussing something quite attentively. The man on the right, an older gentleman, is wearing a striped engineer's cap and denim overalls. He seems to be listening closely or explaining something, indicated by his slightly open mouth and attentive expression.\n\nThe scene is set outdoors with some green foliage and a blurred background suggesting a lush setting, possibly a garden or a park. Between the two men is a wooden worktable or tool bench strewn with various items like tools, a tin cup, and what appears to be components of equipment or machinery, possibly for woodworking or metalworking. Visible also are some parts of mechanical devices, possibly motors, which along with cables scattered about the bench, hint at some form of manual or craft work possibly being discussed or undertaken by the men.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment of either casual instruction or discussion, with an emphasis on craft or workmanship in a natural, serene environment.","title":"Looking over farm implements at the auction at Hickman, in the agricultural county south of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557079","549293","549292","542546","544969","546948","542562","555287","553153","545668","551386","553244","549291","557854","557143","554026"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["craft","bench","tool","man","gentleman","engineer","tin","clipboard","instruction","motor"]}
