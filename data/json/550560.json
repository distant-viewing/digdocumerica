{"path":"550560.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and atmospheric landscape, primarily featuring a river winding through a hilly terrain. The image is captured during either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the low light conditions, which add a moody and dramatic effect to the scene.\n\nThe river, which appears dark and reflective, curves gracefully through the landscape. Its banks are bordered by dense forests, and the trees are silhouetted against the lighter tone of the water, enhancing the contrast in the image. The surrounding hillsides are steep and cast in shadow, further emphasizing the river as the central visual element.\n\nIn the background, the river extends into the distance, and the perspective creates a sense of depth and scale. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the natural curvature of the river and the interplay of light and shadow, evokes a feeling of tranquility and the majesty of nature. \n\nNo human activity or man-made structures are evident in the photograph, further reinforcing the untouched and serene quality of this natural environment. The color palette is subdued, consisting mainly of dark blues and blacks, punctuated by the silvery reflections on the water's surface. This choice of timing and lighting conditions highlights the natural contours and textures of the landscape.","title":"A sharp Bend in the yukon river about three miles downstream from point where pipeline will cross the river.
