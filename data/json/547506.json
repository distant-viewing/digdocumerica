{"path":"547506.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of several cylindrical cans placed in a line along the top of a rugged stone wall. The image is slightly dim, suggesting either dawn, dusk, or overcast lighting conditions. The cans appear to be beer cans of different sizes and designs, some standing upright and others tipped over or lying on their sides.\n\nIn the background, a dense growth of trees and bushes can be observed, contributing to a somewhat wild and overgrown atmosphere. The wall, made of irregularly shaped and unrefined stones, gives a sense of rusticity or abandonment.\n\nForeground details include some patches of grass and dandelions, which hint at an outdoor, possibly wooded or rural area. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of quiet abandonment, evoking perhaps the aftermath of a gathering or a forgotten venue in a natural setting. The focus is primarily on the alignment and presentation of the cans against the backdrop of a natural environment.","title":"Beer cans were targets on this stone wall","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["556631","551246","556640","552512","543616","556616","548755","552937","550805","550806","544651","556614","547039","544640","548758","552529"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","abandonment","dandelion","stone","alignment","beer","forget","presentation","venue","wall"]}
