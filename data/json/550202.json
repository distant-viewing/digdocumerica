{"path":"550202.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a cityscape, predominantly featuring a mix of medium-rise and high-rise buildings. The most prominent building in the image is a tall tower with a pointed spire and clock near its top, suggesting it might be a historic structure or a central feature of the city.\n\nThe surrounding buildings vary in size and architectural style, with some appearing to be more modern and others more classic. The area is densely urban with little visible green space, except for a few scattered trees mostly aligning the streets. The streets themselves are visible with a few cars, implying this is taken on a normal day without any special events or heavy traffic.\n\nThe photo also shows hazy skies, which may be due to weather conditions, time of day, or pollution. Near the horizon, the city extends toward an area that appears quieter and less densely populated, possibly transitioning into suburban zones or less developed land.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a broad overview of the city center, highlighting the architectural diversity and the urban setting.","title":"Looking west from the top of the federal building.
