{"path":"546373.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and chaotic scene on a roadway set in a mountainous area. There are large fires burning on the left side of the road, producing thick black and gray smoke that fills the air and partially obscures the forested mountains in the background.\n\nThe road is littered with debris and possibly remnants of vegetation, suggesting that the fires may be consuming piled-up waste or discarded materials at the roadside. The apparent violence of the blaze suggests an intense heat, as flames visibly leap and twist amidst the smoke.\n\nTwo vehicles, a sedan and a van, appear on the roadway, driving away from the nearest flames. The vehicles seem to be in motion, as suggested by their orientation and spacing. The vehicles’ presence adds a human element to the scene, indicating urgency or escape from the fire’s immediate danger.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is tense and urgent, capturing a moment of environmental and possibly human crisis, situated in a rugged and naturally beautiful setting. The contrast between the natural beauty of the mountainous area and the destructive human-induced fires creates a poignant and impactful visual narrative.","title":"Open garbage dump on highway 112, north of san sebastian","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["555157","548591","553843","548590","545731","553628","553127","548854","551243","548594","555481","555156","548597","555199","554155","553037"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","flame","roadway","consume","twist","crisis","vehicle","danger","smoke","urgency"]}
