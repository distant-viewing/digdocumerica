{"path":"554610.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene bustling with recreational activity. In the foreground, two vibrant canoes rest partially on the shore, one red and one yellow, both filled with gear like life jackets and oars, suggesting preparations for a journey or the wrap-up of a day's adventure. The calm lake water gently laps at their hulls.\n\nBeyond the canoes, a powerboat is in motion, featuring a classic wooden design with a visible name \"Volitant\" on its side. A person stands at the stern, steering the boat, while others can be seen enjoying the water, swimming near the floating dock that extends into the lake.\n\nThe background reveals a tranquil and picturesque setting with several other boats moored at a distance, bobbing lightly on the reflective water. Soft hills, possibly covered with lush greenery, rise gently under a hazy blue sky in the backdrop, enhancing the peacefulness of the landscape. This setting provides a glimpse into leisurely lake activities, popular in a setting that seems to escape the bustling pace of everyday life.","title":"Canoes loaded with backpacks ready for a trip on stillwater reservoir at stillwater landing, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546856","552982","543579","552316","543522","550674","557571","552297","551219","544031","549417","557562","546976","553442","554552","543548"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","everyday","oar","cove","pace","escape","canoe","steer","boat","stern"]}
