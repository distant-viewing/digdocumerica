{"path":"550297.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man standing on a wooden dock, appearing to be showcasing his fresh catch of fish. The man is dressed in a classic fishermen's outfit, consisting of a flat cap, a red and black checked shirt, dark trousers held up by suspenders, and rugged boots reflecting his active lifestyle. He holds large, flat, cleaned fish by their tails in each hand, displaying them proudly.\n\nThe background offers a glimpse into a rustic marine setting, featuring multiple wooden crates, possibly for storing fish, and rusty equipment scattered across the dock, portraying a day of hard work. Additionally, several seagulls can be observed in mid-flight above the dock, adding a dynamic, lively touch to the maritime scene.\n\nA group of boats, nestled in calm waters, is visible behind the man, anchored neatly along the wooden pier. These boats vary in sizes and are painted in different colors, suggesting a small, active fishing community. An overcast sky and tranquil waters provide a serene, natural backdrop, typical of a coastal environment. The cool, muted tones of the environment reflect a chilly, damp atmosphere, possibly characteristic of early morning or late evening fishing activities.","title":"Fisherman at malloch beach, campobello island, new Brunswick, canada","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["543232","543231","545180","543484","552323","552329","552298","543076","547562","544256","552274","554200","543033","545185","554523","552273"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","dock","boats","fishing","crates","fisherman","chilly","suspender","seagull","clean"]}
