{"path":"549082.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a dynamic sailing scene with several sailboats racing on a large body of water. The focus is on a sailboat in the foreground, angled sharply as it cuts through the water. On this boat, we see two individuals actively engaged in managing the sails; one at the stern and another at the bow. Both are wearing casual attire suitable for sailing.\n\nThe sailboat has its sails fully billowed, suggesting strong windy conditions. The words \"Cal 40\" are visible on the closest sail, hinting at the model of the boat. The hull of the boat is white with a red and grey stripe, and it appears to be quite active in the water, with splashes generated around its sides.\n\nIn the background, several other sailboats are visible, also with their sails up and in various positions of navigation, creating a sense of a competitive sailing event. The backdrop displays a mountainous terrain, perhaps indicating the regatta is occurring near a coastal area with significant elevation nearby.\n\nThe image communicates a lively, brisk atmosphere typically associated with yacht races, full of motion and natural beauty. The water is a deep blue, contrasting vividly with the white sails and the brownish-grey of the distant mountains.","title":"A good wind and a good sail on hoover dam's lake mead","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549426","549400","548526","549389","549425","549424","549406","547450","548513","549404","549394","549421","549405","548522","549423","544021"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","sailing","race","boat","regatta","stern","yacht","generate","navigation"]}
