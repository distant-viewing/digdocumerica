{"path":"548874.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man standing in front of a large agricultural combine harvester in a field. The man is wearing a wide-brimmed straw cowboy hat, glasses, and a red bandana tied around his neck. His shirt is a checkered pattern with predominantly blue and white colors. He is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression.\n\nBehind him, there's a combine harvester painted in bright red with \"CASE\" written on the side, indicating the brand. The harvester is equipped with long cutting mechanisms and wheels, typical of such agricultural machinery used for harvesting crops. \n\nThe setting is a vast, open field under a clear blue sky, and the ground shows signs of recently cut crops, presumably wheat, given the golden-brown stubble left behind. This scene likely captures a moment typical in rural, agricultural settings, emphasizing farming activities and equipment.","title":"Harvesting wheat in the Palo Verde Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547734","548876","549051","549046","549042","548981","554203","549259","555619","544250","548976","549036","548982","548985","547416","545087"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["harvester","crop","wheat","cutting","bandana","brand","cowboy","straw","mechanism","field"]}
