{"path":"543968.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an illuminated multi-tiered deck of a structure, possibly a boat or a waterside building, during what appears to be twilight or night due to the ambient light conditions. The architecture features a classic, somewhat aged appearance with wooden panels painted in a pale blue or gray color.\n\nThe composition mainly focuses on two individuals standing on one of the lower decks. To the left, a woman with long hair, who's attire is not distinctly visible due to the lighting and distance, peers out between two columns. Adjacent to her on the right, a man is photographed in the act of taking a photograph. This man is dressed in a light-colored jacket and dark slacks, and he is seen holding a camera up to his face, aiming it away from the viewer towards something off-frame.\n\nThe upper deck, visible in the background, seems to be mostly vacant with only the suggestion of a couple more individuals, faintly perceived through the barriers of the deck's railing, possibly engaged in social activities.\n\nThe deck is adorned with string lights that provide a soft, warm glow, adding a subtle festivity to the ambiance of the setting. The scene conveys a peaceful, leisurely evening atmosphere, possibly at a social gathering or public event.","title":"Bride and groom at wedding reception on the \"Belle of Louisiana\" steamboat","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["553194","552225","544483","552123","549373","547180","553304","547217","546392","547834","543465","551265","544306","549099","549493","554477"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["deck","suggestion","festivity","slack","string","peer","aim","act","night","twilight"]}
