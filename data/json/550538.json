{"path":"550538.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The image displays a vast expanse of a densely forested hilly landscape. The photo seems to have been taken from an elevated perspective, likely from an aircraft. The terrain is undulating, with rolling hills that stretch far into the distance. The entire area is heavily wooded with no visible clearings, structures, or roads, suggesting it is a remote or wilderness region.\n\nThe forest appears to be predominantly coniferous, with dark green hues dominating the landscape. There are patches where the tree density seems slightly less, allowing the underlying earth or scrubland to be slightly visible. The coloration of the foliage varies subtly, with some patches slightly lighter green, indicating either a different type of vegetation or variations in sunlight.\n\nThe topography features gentle slopes interspersed with a few sharper, more rugged hilltops. The higher elevations show signs of less vegetation, which could suggest a harsher climate or poor soil conditions at those altitudes. There are no visible water bodies in the immediate view, but the dense forest could be hiding small streams or ponds.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, with shadows cast by the undulating terrain suggesting that the photo was taken on a clear day with ample sunlight, enhancing the textural details of the landscape. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of serene isolation and untouched natural beauty.","title":"Summer colors on a hillside near prospect creek camp","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550578","550566","553567","553564","553570","550643","556906","557003","550541","555677","542821","556920","556931","552553","553594","550540"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["undulate","forest","hilltop","underlie","hide","coloration","topography","aircraft","sunlight","elevation"]}
