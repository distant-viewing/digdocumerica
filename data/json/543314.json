{"path":"543314.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene family scene set on a porch framed within a door's darkened outline, suggesting the image was taken from inside looking outward. Two adults—presumably a man and a woman—and a young child are seated closely on wooden chairs on the porch. The man is on the right, wearing dark glasses, holding what appears to be a newspaper or a magazine with his extended legs crossed, providing an engaged yet relaxed demeanor. The woman, seated beside the child to the man's left, is partly visible with her attention seemingly focussed on either the child or the man. The child, seated between the adults, is attention turned towards the man, creating a cozy and intimate familial gathering.\n\nIn addition to the group, the porch itself is rustic with visible wooden elements and has a welcoming feel with the presence of vibrant flowers. In the foreground, a bed of blooming pink flowers adds a splash of color and a sense of warmth to the setting. Above this, sunlight filters through, suggesting a bright day and enhancing the tranquility of the moment.\n\nThe framing technique used—in which the scene is viewed through the doorway—adds an intriguing layer of perspective, making the viewer feel like a discreet observer of a private, peaceful moment. The natural light and shadow play across the figures and the surrounding deck space enriches the scene's depth and texture, adding to the overall contemplative mood.","title":"California--Rocky Point","placename":"Rocky Point (Calif.)","location":"Rocky Point, California","nn1":["546209","557672","555580","547398","548312","552959","553498","546994","557362","557360","553500","551027","557933","553496","546547","556738"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","porch","seat","man","adult","flower","magazine","observer","addition","technique"]}
