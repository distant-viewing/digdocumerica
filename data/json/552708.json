{"path":"552708.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavy traffic scenario on a large bridge leading into New Jersey, possibly captured during a sunset or morning, evidenced by the warm, diffused lighting. Multiple lanes are filled with a dense arrangement of cars and trucks, showing only a few feet of space between each vehicle. The vehicles vary in design, indicative of a typical mix encountered in everyday traffic.\n\nThe scene is framed by several traffic signs, including overhead electronic signs that indicate lane directions and have red lights, suggesting that the traffic might be halted or slow-moving. One sign prominently reads \"2 LANES TO N.J.,\" which guides drivers towards their potential destinations.\n\nIn the background, the bridge's architecture includes large metallic beams, which form part of the bridge's structure extending into the distance, partially obscured by the haze or smog, contributing to the atmospheric perspective and underscoring the industrious environment.\n\nOverall, the composition encapsulates a common urban experience—busy traffic during peak commuting hours—captured from a perspective that emphasizes both the volume of traffic and the infrastructure managing it.","title":"Walt Whitman Bridge crosses the Delaware River at South Philadelphia, leads to New Jersey suburbs.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549861","552709","549879","549878","549887","549902","556194","549877","553726","548084","545884","546686","553727","547780","546629","553018"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["traffic","lane","bridge","commuting","smog","sign","volume","perspective","destination","foot"]}
