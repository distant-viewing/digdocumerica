{"path":"547327.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a large, densely packed parking lot filled with rows of cars exhibiting a variety of vibrant colors, including reds, yellows, blues, and greens. The cars are primarily from the 1960s or 1970s, judging by their design aesthetics such as the rounded bodies and prominent chrome bumpers.\n\nIn the background, there are two large ships moored at a dock. These ships are distinguished by their massive size and the iconic red and black funnels, suggesting they could be part of a well-known ocean liner fleet from the mid-20th century. The setting seems to be a bustling industrial or port area, as indicated by the presence of these ships and other smaller vessels, as well as infrastructure that appears to be related to cargo handling or ship maintenance.\n\nThe layout and composition of the image emphasize the contrast between the colorful, orderly parked cars in the foreground and the industrial maritime activity in the background. The photo provides a glimpse into a moment of daily life, where the world of automotive transportation momentarily converges with that of maritime travel.","title":"\"Mazdas\" await shipment","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["547928","547480","542633","546879","547469","546813","547826","556790","546900","556204","553303","553896","556721","554349","548015","548496"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["ship","funnel","car","bumper","chrome","handling","port","world","cargo","travel"]}
