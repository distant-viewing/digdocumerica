{"path":"542895.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene and picturesque landscape during what appears to be the twilight hours, showing warm and golden hues. In the foreground, a rustic wooden fence curves along the left edge of the image, leading the viewer's eye towards the distance. The fence is weathered and bathed in the glow of the setting or rising sun, suggesting an early morning or late afternoon time.\n\nFurther back, a dirt road parallels the fence, lined by a series of wooden utility poles that carry power lines. These poles stretch into the background, diminishing in size, enhancing the depth of the image. The road itself, while mostly straight, has a slight curve as it follows the landscape, offering a sense of calm and solitude.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features a flat, expansive field that reaches towards the ocean, visible at the horizon. This expanse is open and sparsely adorned, except for clusters of trees and a notable white building with a classic architectural style, which could be a lighthouse or some form of coastal guardhouse. This building adds a historical or maritime character to the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by the ocean, shimmering under the light of the sky, merging almost seamlessly at the horizon with the soft, faded sky. The overall lighting conditions suggest either dawn or dusk, contributing to a peaceful, near-silent atmosphere.\n\nNo people are visible in the shot, which adds to the stillness and untouched nature of the scene. The composition effectively uses lines—the fence, road, and power lines—to draw the viewer’s eye through various elements of the landscape, creating a harmonious and tranquil rural/coastal scene, typical perhaps of a less inhabited or visited location.","title":"U.S. 101","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543116","546154","543414","547404","549156","552521","554453","548220","554085","544678","553820","543660","547354","557529","557946","549261"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["fence","ocean","power","line","road","diminish","pole","curve","lighthouse","visit"]}
