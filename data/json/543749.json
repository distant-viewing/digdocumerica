{"path":"543749.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely involving the processing of timber, set against a rugged, hilly landscape. In the foreground, a large pile of logs is neatly stacked, displaying the fresh logging activity in the area. Beyond this pile, several industrial buildings and structures are visible, including what appear to be sawmills or processing plants.\n\nProminently, there are various chimneys and smokestacks within the scene, from which white and dark smoke are billowing into the sky, suggesting the combustion of materials, perhaps for energy production or as part of the processing activities. One of the structures has a distinctive cone shape, possibly a kiln or a specific type of furnace used in the processing of wood products.\n\nThe background includes a series of wooded hills, indicating the location is in a mountainous or hilly region. The overall setting gives an impression of an active industrial operation situated within a natural environment, highlighting interactions between industrial development and the landscape.\n\nThere appears to be no evident presence of people in the image, focusing instead on the industrial operations and the environmental setting. The atmosphere conveyed is somewhat heavy, possibly due to the smoke and the industrial nature of the activity depicted. The color palette is predominantly muted with greens, browns, and grays, emphasizing an overcast, possibly pollution-affected atmosphere.","title":"Air is polluted from \"tepee\" sawdust burner at lumber mill","placename":"Durango (Colo.)","location":"Durango, Colorado","nn1":["545260","546236","545256","545244","550349","550716","550340","542942","552162","551056","550711","545910","543005","542945","552185","543011"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["processing","furnace","pile","cone","smoke","process","logg","operation","timber","product"]}
