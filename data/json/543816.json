{"path":"543816.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scenery featuring a lake with a foreground of wet, dark rocks and some scattered pieces of wood. The lake is surrounded by rugged, mountainous terrain with patches of evergreen forests, suggesting that this might be a high-altitude lake. The mountains on both sides of the lake slope upwards, with some areas barren or lightly covered with shrubs, while others are densely forested.\n\nThe sky above the scene is partly cloudy, allowing for some sunlight to illuminate parts of the landscape, particularly the water surface and the mountain slopes. On the distant shore of the lake, a few small buildings, possibly cabins, can be glimpsed, indicating a human presence in this remote area.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the natural elements of water, rock, and mountain, combined with the subtle human elements, conveys a sense of tranquility and the grandeur of a wilderness area. The colors are vivid, with the blues of the lake, the earth tones of the mountains, and the greens of the trees blending harmoniously under the expansive blue sky.","title":"Settling pond of the Rico-Argentine Co. sulfuric acid mill officials claim the settling ponds, which contain iron oxide, will be cleaned up.
