{"path":"544761.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph presents a panoramic aerial view of what appears to be a long narrow causeway or bridge spanning across a vast body of water. This body of water displays a gradient of colors from dark blues and greens to light turquoise, signifying variations in depth or possibly the presence of sandy banks underneath. The causeway seems relatively straight, and is lined with lampposts that are visible at intervals along its length. There are no visible vehicles on the bridge, giving it a calm and uninhabited appearance.\n\nBoth margins of the photo extend into distant landscapes, with one side slightly more elevated, showing hazy mountainous outlines that suggest a backdrop of a valley or a coastal region. The horizon merges with a cloudy sky, casting soft, nondescript light that somewhat mutes the colors of the landscape. The overall composition and perspective offer a sense of serene isolation, juxtaposed by human engineering that cuts through natural elements.\n\nThe photograph's framing and the vantage point suggest that it was taken from either a high altitude or from another elevated point, possibly from an aircraft, focusing downwards towards the terrestrial and aquatic tableau below. There are no people or distinct man-made structures other than the causeway visible, emphasizing the vastness and the sparsely-inhabited nature of the area captured in the image.","title":"The union pacific railroad's causeway across the Great Salt Lake threatens the ecological balance of the lake","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["542804","548415","543087","552846","547703","547669","548401","543313","545024","558051","548918","543436","548777","546870","547828","546810"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["turquoise","inhabit","interval","bridge","lamppost","tableau","mute","signify","aircraft","engineering"]}
