{"path":"550541.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an expansive aerial view of a rugged landscape, seemingly pristine and predominantly natural. There are vast stretches of dense forest composed of countless trees that fill nearly the entire view, creating a sea of green textures. Scattered throughout these woods are several small bodies of water ranging from tiny ponds to larger lakes, reflecting the light and interspersing the vegetation with patches of blue.\n\nIn the distance, a series of mountains or hills, which have a gentle, rounded appearance and lack much vegetation, add a sense of depth and grandeur to the scene. These elevations are subtle yet significant in the composition, helping to frame the wilderness below.\n\nTowards the horizon, the sky is visible, featuring a mix of clouds, some thick and other wispy against a soft blue backdrop, suggesting a high-altitude perspective. The overall mood of the photograph is one of isolation and untouched natural beauty, highlighting an expansive, uninhabited wilderness seemingly void of human influence. This picture likely captures the essence of a remote, possibly northern geographical region, characterized by its raw and compelling landscape.","title":"Crossing the northwest tributary of the Ray River","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550642","553570","556906","555698","550611","550629","556931","550644","550643","556926","557003","553564","550604","550617","555712","555677"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["wilderness","influence","elevation","altitude","pond","grandeur","help","essence","lack","vegetation"]}
