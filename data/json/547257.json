{"path":"547257.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a wastewater treatment facility located next to a large, muddy river. There's notable sediment and possibly debris within the river. Surrounding the facility are several residential areasâ€”homes appear between patches of trees, and a curving road services the area.\n\nThe facility itself includes multiple circular tanks, some of which are open and appear to have water inside, likely functioning as settling or aeration tanks. There are also squared areas that could be holding or additional treatment areas. Several red-roofed buildings, possibly administrative or operational hubs, are interspersed among the tanks. The facility is structured with paved roads and sidewalks connecting various sections.\n\nOverall, the setting is green and suburban, with mixes of wooded areas nearby. The color palette of the image is dominated by earth tones with the green of the trees contrasting against the reds of the building roofs and the brownish hue of the river water. The layout suggests a well-organized facility designed for efficiency in processing wastewater before returning it to the river system.","title":"Aerial view of Occoquan water filtration plant.
