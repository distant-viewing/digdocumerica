{"path":"545124.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a panoramic view of a coastal area. The viewpoint is elevated, looking down over a dramatic coastline under what appears to be overcast or foggy weather.\n\nAt the forefront of the image is a cluster of densely packed evergreen trees which seem to characterize the area's natural vegetation. Part of the composition includes a solitary tree standing at the left edge, appearing somewhat bare compared to the thicker foliage around it.\n\nThe middle-ground of the photo reveals a sweeping view of a curved beach which is visibly populated with a scattering of people, indicative of activity despite the moody weather. The beach stretches along the base of a rugged cliffside, which forms the boundary on one side, serving as a natural barrier between the land and the sea.\n\nBeyond the beach, the ocean is visible, its surface shimmering slightly, suggesting either the presence of light penetrating through the clouds or the general reflective nature of water. The waves can be seen breaking onto the shore in gentle froths.\n\nFurther afield, encroaching mists or light fog partially obscure the horizon, blending the sky and water into a muted, seamless band. This gives the scene a somewhat mysterious or ethereal quality, enhancing its natural scenic beauty. Houses and possibly small roads or paths can be glimpsed through breaks in the trees, indicating human habitation and access in this picturesque location.","title":"Fog blankets the coast","placename":"Oregon","location":"Oregon","nn1":["545222","543090","557523","543088","553995","543300","545129","543085","543153","543080","545934","543061","543045","547697","545226","556982"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","break","froth","scattering","encroach","penetrate","elevate","shimmer","band","fog"]}
