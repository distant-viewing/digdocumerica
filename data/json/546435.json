{"path":"546435.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents a serene scene of a residential area. The image captures a multi-story brick house surrounded by lush vegetation. The house features multiple white-framed windows and a noticeable absence of decorations on the visible façade. Tall, leafy trees partially obscure the view of the house, casting intricate shadows across the scene, and adding a sense of quiet and tranquility to the atmosphere.\n\nIn front of the house is a meticulously maintained hedge running along a black wrought-iron fence, both enclosing a well-kept lawn, suggesting a boundary between the public space and private property. Various other homes can be glimpsed in the background, hinting at a well-established, neighborly residential area. The environment conveys a typical suburban setting, possibly indicating a devoted focus towards residential comfort and privacy. The atmosphere evokes a peaceful residential lifestyle, sheltered and calm, under a clear blue sky.","title":"A well-kept house along Franklin Street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557094","556426","549279","558153","556433","546441","557068","557326","545041","558149","556436","557668","546442","558035","558036","546439"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","hedge","privacy","comfort","iron","lifestyle","decoration","façade","property","absence"]}
