{"path":"554890.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a dense group of sheep. The sheep appear closely packed, and their woolly coats create a textured pattern that dominates the image. The majority of the sheep in the image have white and gray wool, except for some which show patches of raw, pink skin, perhaps from recent shearing.\n\nSeveral sheep faces can be seen looking in various directions; their expressions seem calm. Their features include distinctively large eyes and some visible ears, with most of their wooly bodies obscuring other physical details. The image focuses on portraying a sense of crowding and texture, emphasizing the mass of sheep rather than an individual character.\n\nThe background is blurred due to the close focus on the sheep, leaving it indistinguishable and ensuring that the viewer's attention remains on the tightly-knit group of animals. The lighting is natural, suggesting an outdoor setting, possibly during daylight, contributing to the overall pastoral feel of the scene.","title":"Sheared and unsheared sheep on a ranch near Leakey, Texas and San Antonio.
