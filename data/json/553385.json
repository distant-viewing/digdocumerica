{"path":"553385.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site where workers are involved in building what appears to be a large, circular concrete structure. The image shows a sunny day at a site where there is considerable ongoing work involving excavation and concrete work.\n\nIn the center of the image is a large circular pit reinforced with wooden forms to create a cylindrical concrete structure, possibly a foundation for a tank or similar installation. The wooden planks and rebar can be seen lining the interior of this mold to reinforce the concrete that will be poured, suggesting that the structure will bear significant load or contain fluids.\n\nThere are three workers visible in the photograph, each wearing construction safety gear including hard hats and boots. One worker, to the left, seems to be walking along a temporary wooden scaffold or walkway built around the top rim of the circular formwork. The other two workers are engaged in tasks around the other side of the form; one is bending down, possibly handling tools or materials, and the other is standing, likely overseeing or preparing for the next step of the construction process.\n\nThe background reveals a somewhat barren, dirt-filled landscape with additional construction materials scattered around â€“ wooden planks, blocks of concrete, and metal rods. It looks like a significant amount of earth has been moved as seen in the mounds of dirt and the rough texture of the ground, typical in heavy construction areas.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph effectively depict a moment in an intensive construction project, emphasizing the scale and the rugged, methodical work involved in creating substantial infrastructure.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction.
