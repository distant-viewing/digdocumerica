{"path":"558203.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a young male athlete in a football locker room setting. The athlete is seated, wearing a dirty football uniform with the number 51 visible on his dark-colored jersey, which also features broad, white numerals and shoulder stripes. He has football pads on, a neck roll, and his muddy, maroon pants suggest he has recently played. His messy blonde hair is damp, possibly from sweat or a water shower, and he has a broad, cheerful smile, giving the image an upbeat, victorious feel.\n\nThe background indicates a typical sports locker room environment with beige lockers, some open and some closed. On the top right, a partial view of another person and glimpses of additional football equipment, like a white helmet, can be seen. The setting is modest and utilitarian with visible signs of use, such as scratches and marks on the lockers.","title":"Football player from cathedral senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota, suits up for a game at johnson park.
