{"path":"555200.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a ground surface covered with various organic and inorganic materials. The dominant texture in the image is rough, with a mix of small and medium-sized rocks. The soil appears dry and is a deep reddish-brown color, indicative of iron-rich earth, possibly from a wilderness or arid area.\n\nScattered across the soil are multiple decaying pieces of wood or plant material. These pieces vary in color from dark brown to gray, suggesting different stages of decomposition. The organic materials are randomly oriented, intertwining with the rocky terrain, adding to the image's chaotic and natural aesthetic.\n\nNo human activities or animals are visible in the photograph, emphasizing a sense of desolation or abandoned natural space. The background and foreground are consistent, focused solely on the close-up view of the ground, showcasing the texture and natural elements in the environment. This composition leaves the impression of an uninhabited or wild area, possibly highlighting environmental themes or natural decay processes.","title":"Trees may never be able to grow in this spot again because of erosion in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553582","552420","554817","543549","544751","545724","554778","555793","545597","550395","554598","555610","544992","551233","555029","545534"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["material","soil","piece","iron","close","desolation","up","stage","texture","animal"]}
