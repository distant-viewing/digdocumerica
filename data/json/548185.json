{"path":"548185.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents a picturesque scene near a large body of water, possibly a river or a large lake. In the foreground, there's a vibrant, yellow-green sports car, a Chevrolet Camaro, with a trailer attached to it; the trailer is hauling a small, light-colored motorboat. The car is parked on a dirt ground near the water's edge, facing the camera. A man is seen near the car, partially inside the boat, possibly engaged in preparing the boat for a water outing or maintaining it.\n\nIn the background, there are floating docks extending into the water, devoid of boats. The sky above is vivid with a few light clouds and a large streak which could be a jet contrail. Dominating the sky scene is an airplane, captured in mid-flight just above the car and the man, flying from right to left. The sun, slightly obscured, casts a soft light across the scene, creating a diffuse glow and a light lens flare is visible near the plane.\n\nThe scene encapsulates a moment of leisurely activity, possibly suggesting preparation for a boating trip on a clear, pleasant day. The juxtaposition of the airplane and the leisure activities suggests a narrative of modern recreational life. The expansive view of the water and the distant shores, along with the clear skies, contribute to a sense of openness and tranquility in the photograph.","title":"Launching a small craft from the Columbia River bank","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551528","552121","552119","554485","554684","551236","548743","551219","544002","553133","547773","550649","548746","544389","544260","554683"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["airplane","trailer","car","boat","flare","water","jet","lens","plane","motorboat"]}
