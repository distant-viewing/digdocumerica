{"path":"556102.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view at Glacier Park, emphasized by a prominent, rustic wooden sign on the left that reads \"GLACIER PARK\" on a dark green background. The sign is mounted under the gable of a wooden structure supported by thick timber pillars, also featuring wooden planters with red flowers hanging from its beams.\n\nIn the background, a large, multi-storied lodge with deep brown exteriors and white trim windows dominates the view, set against a magnificent mountainous backdrop. The lodge features expansive balconies on each floor, allowing for an overlook of the lush greenery and distant mountains. The mountains themselves still carry patches of snow, suggesting either an early summer season or a high altitude environment.\n\nAdding to the natural scenic beauty, there are tall, deep green trees surrounding the buildings, and a clear blue sky above that adds a sense of calmness and serenity to the overall scene. Electrical wires run diagonally across part of the sky, subtly indicating the mixing of natural beauty with human settlement and activity in this park area.","title":"East Glacier Park, Montana, passenger train station in the foreground frames some of the gRandeur which attracts travelers to the area. This terminal is located at the edge of Glacier National Park, a scenic tourist spot. Since it assumed major responsibility for U.S. intercity rail passenger service in 1971, Amtrak has reversed a decline in riders that began after World War II.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543547","556101","552987","542592","543605","555657","555662","543724","543816","543569","543582","550641","544936","557989","555660","554249"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["lodge","planter","gable","serenity","mountain","timber","pillar","calmness","settlement","overlook"]}
