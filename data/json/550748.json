{"path":"550748.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene urban scene featuring a young woman and a fountain. The woman, wearing a bright red shirt and dark shorts, is sitting on a ledge beside a large, vigorous water fountain. Her posture is relaxed and contemplative as she is looking intently towards the fountain with her chin resting on her hand.\n\nThe fountain itself is a dynamic burst of water, creating a lively and refreshing atmosphere. It appears to be a warm, sunny day, as indicated by the bright sunlight and deep shadows cast by nearby trees which partially frame the scene.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes modern architectural elements, possibly office buildings, visible in the background. These buildings have a stark, utilitarian design typical of mid-to-late 20th century urban architecture. The presence of green foliage adds a touch of nature to the urban setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its depth of field focusing on the woman and the fountain, and the high contrast between the bright sunlight and deep shadows, contributes to a peaceful yet vibrant cityscape atmosphere.","title":"City hall plaza--refuge from the midsummer heat","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551468","552700","551484","551663","553224","551449","550747","551480","551647","553207","551793","557282","551858","551661","551772","551467"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","woman","refresh","burst","ching","ledge","sunlight","20th","shadow","office"]}
