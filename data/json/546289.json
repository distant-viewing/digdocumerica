{"path":"546289.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a pair of hands is captured handling a small collection of freshwater mussels over a white bucket filled with water. In these hands, there are visible bits of aquatic plants and muddy residue attached to the mussels, hinting at a recent retrieval from a natural water body. The hands are not clean; they're smeared with mud, emphasizing the hands-on nature of the activity.\n\nThe white bucket is partially filled with water, which also contains bits of grass, dead leaves, and other natural debris, likely scooped up along with the mussels. The background is softly focused but shows a natural environment with green grass and some nondescript brown earth or mud, reinforcing the outdoor setting of the activity.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a fieldwork or research scenario, possibly related to environmental or ecological studies, highlighting hands-on interaction with the natural environment. The framing of the image, centering on the hands and bucket, draws attention to the human interaction with aquatic life, possibly for scientific collection or conservation efforts.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory field trip.
