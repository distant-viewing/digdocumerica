{"path":"542630.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a single fox standing on sandy soil, surrounded by a natural environment. The fox is in the center of the frame, facing slightly to the right. It appears alert and attentive, with its ears perked up and eyes wide open. The terrain is rough with sparse vegetation, and the sand bears the texture of small rocks and footprints.\n\nThe image has a warm color tone, dominated by brown and orange hues, which could suggest a setting during either sunrise or sunset. The overall lighting is soft and natural, creating long shadows that enhance the fox's features, contributing texture to its fur.\n\nAdditionally, the background is relatively non-distracting and blurred, keeping the focus primarily on the fox. The simplicity of the surroundings highlights the animal's presence in its natural habitat.","title":"Planes (used by California farm commission) drop poisoned grain on active squirrel colonies in order to protect area barley crops.","placename":"Coalinga (Calif.)","location":"Coalinga, California","nn1":["550430","550431","550432","542629","550436","550468","544916","554621","543279","544738","542733","545902","551376","546163","558368","555668"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["footprint","ear","fur","sunrise","bear","keep","habitat","simplicity","texture","animal"]}
