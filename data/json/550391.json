{"path":"550391.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric landscape scene. The composition consists of a broad, open expanse which appears to be a tranquil body of water stretching across the middle of the frame, under a vast and evocative sky. The sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the image and is filled with a dramatic assortment of clouds, visible in a range of formations and shades, ranging from light to dark. These clouds hint at varying weather conditions, possibly at dusk, given the muted lighting and the pink and purple tones imbued throughout the scene.\n\nBelow the sky, the horizon is marked by a distinct, straight line that separates the water from the sky, suggesting a calm, flat sea or a large lake. The foreground is darker and less detailed, appearing as a silhouetted stretch of land which may be a beach or shoreline.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is subtle, with the main illumination coming from the sky. This lighting enhances the moody and somewhat mysterious quality of the image. Overall, the photograph conveys a tranquil and contemplative mood, emphasizing the beauty and vastness of the natural world. There are no visible people or man-made structures, reinforcing the isolation and untouched nature of the landscape.","title":"View south from the start of the pipeline route toward the Brooks Range.
