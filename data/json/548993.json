{"path":"548993.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a man, dressed in a striped blue and white shirt and dark trousers, closely examining a cow. The cow, primarily white with significant red-brown patches, has a distinct feature: a transparent, circular window inserted into its side, likely for scientific or medical observation purposes. The man seems engaged and focused on the contents visible through the window, leaning in for a closer look while holding the cow's head lightly.\n\nThey are situated in an outdoor setting with a clear sky and a barren landscape in the background, suggesting a rural or agricultural environment. The ground is dry and covered with scattered stones and dust, characteristic of a semi-arid region. The lighting suggests it's either midday or early afternoon, given the brightness and clarity of the surroundings.\n\nThis scene could be part of a scientific study or a veterinary health check, where the window installed in the cow enables direct observation of the digestive process or other internal functions without surgery. Such practices are common in veterinary science and agricultural research to study the health and science of livestock efficiently and humanely.","title":"On EPA's experimental farm; \"Big Sam\" the steer with the \"see through\" hole in his hide","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548960","548959","554950","554949","553107","552669","548952","552569","548957","554948","554917","548962","548966","551732","547396","548984"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cow","science","health","observation","window","check","livestock","midday","practice","study"]}
