{"path":"542857.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial or construction activity, likely at a logging site or a similar environment. The image features two individuals involved in the operation. The person in the foreground is standing on a platform or makeshift scaffolding made of metal and wood. He is looking down toward the ground, wielding a long pole, possibly used to maneuver objects or materials. This individual is dressed in a dark jacket and light-colored pants.\n\nIn the background, another individual is barely visible, somewhat obscured behind large, bulky items that resemble logs or heavy cylindrical materials. These objects are laden onto the back of a truck, suggesting they are either being unloaded or prepared for transport. \n\nThe setting includes several industrial or construction structures, with visible scaffolds and what could be storage or machinery sheds. The background is slightly overexposed, hinting at a bright day, affecting the clarity of distant elements but highlighting more immediate subjects like the two workers.\n\nThis scene is marked by an impression of manual labor and industrial logistics, with a focus on the handling and movement of large materials in an outdoor setting.","title":"Inventory of redwood arriving from the latest cut.
