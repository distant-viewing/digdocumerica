{"path":"545420.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man with a deep, thoughtful expression. He has a bald head and his skin shows signs of aging. The man is wearing a gray shirt and has nasal cannula, suggesting that he is receiving supplemental oxygen. To his left, a large green oxygen tank is visible, distinguished by its metallic knobs and faded paint, suggesting it is well-used. The tubing of the nasal cannula extends from the man’s nose, runs across his chest, and seemingly connects to the green tank in the background. The background is softly blurred but appears to be an indoor setting with warm, muted colors, providing a neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the man and the medical apparatus. The lighting in the photograph highlights the contours of the man’s face and the textures of his shirt and the tank, adding a deeply personal and intimate quality to the image.","title":"Mr. Robert B.
