{"path":"548302.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man in an outdoor setting, leaning forward slightly towards the camera with a warm, friendly expression. The man wears a short-sleeved red and white plaid shirt and a black cap. His appearance, tanned and rugged with noticeable lines on his face, suggests he may have spent a lot of time outdoors. \n\nIn the background, there are lush green trees and some foliage, indicating that the photo might have been taken in a park or a countryside area. Behind him, partially blurred, is another person dressed in a white T-shirt and yellow pants, who appears to be unpacking or arranging items inside the trunk of a parked car.\n\nOverall, the photo seems to portray a casual, possibly familial outdoor gathering or activity, with the man in the foreground being the main subject, adding a personal, human element to the scene. The soft focus on the background emphasizes his expression and demeanor, inviting a sense of connection and storytelling.","title":"Fisherman and wife at owl bayou on highway 51 between laplace and manchac","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548236","542613","547179","552103","552113","548224","553605","552871","546092","548251","554846","554521","554915","557138","549120","557713"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["countryside","spend","expression","man","park","demeanor","plaid","connection","lot","invite"]}
