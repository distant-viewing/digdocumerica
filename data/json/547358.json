{"path":"547358.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and cheerful indoor gathering, likely a social event or party. The focal point of the image is the interaction between two women positioned in the foreground. On the left, a younger woman stands leaning forward, dressed in a colorful, plaid patterned dress with long sleeves and a pronounced collar. She has blond hair pulled back into a style that falls at her shoulder, and she is smiling brightly towards the older woman seated across from her. \n\nThe older woman, sitting on a patterned ottoman, is wearing a sleeveless, v-neck dress with a light cardigan and a small check pattern. Her hair is short and curled, and her expression is one of joy as she looks up at the standing woman. She holds a plastic cup, suggesting refreshments are being served at this event.\n\nIn the background, several other guests can be seen. They are mostly older women, seated and standing, engaged in conversation and dressed in various brightly colored dresses and blouses. The decor includes a blue floral or paisley curtain and simple furniture, contributing to an atmosphere that seems casual and communal.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is lively and happy, capturing a moment of genuine interaction and enjoyment among the attendees.","title":"Members of Ladies Club hold monthly meeting at the Seward Civic Center, about 20 miles west of Lincoln.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547371","552624","557795","552646","547380","558288","556176","551279","551278","547392","551436","553761","557031","545496","556532","558342"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["woman","dress","v","guest","refreshment","check","event","cardigan","decor","hair"]}
