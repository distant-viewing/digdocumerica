{"path":"547440.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the golden hue and long shadows present in the image. The focal point is a charming white church with a prominent steeple, accompanied by several smaller buildings which could serve as utility structures or offices related to the church. Surrounding the church is a cemetery with numerous tombstones, neatly organized and scattered across the green landscape.\n\nIn front of the church and its accompanying buildings, there is a well-maintained road that runs horizontally across the photograph, reflecting the light and adding a gleaming stripe to the scene. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the church, the land is divided into various agricultural plots, showcasing a patchwork of earthy tones ranging from deep greens to browns and tans. These plots might be cultivated with different crops, contributing to the picturesque quilt-like pattern that dominates the rural landscape.\n\nIn the far background, the terrain flattens out into a vast expanse, where more agricultural fields can be seen stretching toward the horizon. The fields are interspersed with small clusters of trees and possibly other farm buildings, although these are less distinguishable due to the distance. The entire setting is enveloped in a tranquil atmosphere, underscored by the soft lighting and expansive views typical of agricultural heartlands. The absence of any visible people gives the scene a sense of stillness and undisturbed nature, emphasizing the pastoral beauty and peaceful solitude of rural life.","title":"Church and farmlands on the seward-saline county line","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547324","550287","547343","557758","547357","556480","546455","557952","554035","554819","557023","547428","549257","547309","556963","557951"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["church","plot","accompany","tombstone","flatten","steeple","cemetery","cultivate","charming","patchwork"]}
