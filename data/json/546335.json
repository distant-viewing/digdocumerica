{"path":"546335.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a woman standing in a body of water, seemingly engaged in an activity possibly related to environmental study or sampling. She is wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and her wet hair indicates she has been working in the water for some time. She is holding a small net in her right hand and a large plastic bucket labeled \"BIOLOGY DEPT\" with her left hand, suggesting she might be collecting specimens or conducting research.\n\nThe setting is a calm, expansive water body with a clear sky overhead. Surrounding the woman are tall, slender reeds, which slightly obscure her from view and add a textured layer to the foreground of the image. In the distance, a flat, tranquil horizon can be seen adorned sporadically with small groups of trees or shrubs, which punctuate the otherwise open landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural lighting and focus on both the subject and her environment, highlights a serene yet purposeful moment likely dedicated to scientific or educational work in a natural setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory biologist is dip netting for contaminated female shrimp, this is for a study of whether PCB is passed on to their offspring.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546347","546316","546300","546343","546331","554553","549059","551416","556991","548956","546342","546336","546340","549012","546320","552110"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["biology","sampling","specimen","overhead","reed","net","hand","study","woman","plastic"]}
