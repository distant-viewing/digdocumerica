{"path":"549558.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a majestic waterfall, likely one of the sections of Niagara Falls given the landscape. On the left side of the image is the Horseshoe Falls, identifiable by its curved shape and massive volume of water cascading down. The falls generate a significant mist that rises high above the water, creating a natural spectacle.\n\nIn the foreground, various features complement this natural arrangement. There is a large parking lot filled with cars, indicating the popularity of this site with visitors. Several roads and lush green park areas with pathways curve around the landscape, offering scenic views for pedestrians and vehicles alike.\n\nOn the right side and in the background of the photograph, the terrain is rockier and steeper, showing the rugged nature of the cliff faces beside the river. The river itself flows away from the falls, with a noticeable change in water texture from turbulent white near the falls to a smoother, darker blue downstream. Additionally, there are a few boats visible on the water, likely tour boats giving visitors closer views of the falls.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the grandeur of the waterfall and its surroundings, including human-made enhancements like parking and pathways that facilitate tourist activities. The use of an aerial perspective highlights the scale and beauty of the landscape.","title":"Niagara Falls seen from the air.
