{"path":"553669.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a rural landscape under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, there's a patch of rough, rocky terrain with sparse vegetation. Prominently placed in the middle of the image are two large signs.\n\nThe sign on the left is black with white lettering and reads \"ENTERING NEWLANDS IRRIGATION PROJECT,\" below which additional text states \"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF RECLAMATION.\" The sign on the right is more visually bustling and is an advertisement for \"SEO GREEN ACRES REALTY FERNLEY\" promoting a fishing and tackle shop. It includes details like \"SPORTING GOODS, TACKLE-MINNOWS, BAIT-ICE etc.,\" along with a phone number and a mention of Fernley, Nevada. The background style of this sign is white with black and red text, featuring a decorative green border.\n\nIn the distance, there are hints of residential or small industrial structures, roads, and lush greenery, likely part of the noted irrigation project. Farther back, the landscape is framed by a mountain range under the expansive sky. This setting suggests a mix of natural beauty with human habitation and commercial activity. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on signs against a natural backdrop, captures a juxtaposition of development and rural environment.","title":"Signs on route 95 near fernley.
