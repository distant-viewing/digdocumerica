{"path":"557839.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a mid-20th-century scene focusing on automotive maintenance and inspection activities. The setting appears to be a vehicle inspection or service station labeled \"NORWOOD SAFETY LANE\" prominently displayed on the large, open garage bay door. Above the entrance, there is a sign indicating \"CLEARANCE 12 FT.\"\n\nIn the foreground, there's a light blue station wagon parked diagonally on the street, facing the viewer's left. The car has noticeable trim and features from the era, like large headlights and metallic accents.\n\nTo the right side of the photograph, a man dressed in a light blue uniform (likely a worker at the station) stands leaning against a dark-colored car, possibly preparing to move it or having just completed some work on it. The man is partially shaded by the open garage building, suggesting a sunny day outside.\n\nThe background consists of residential homes and utility poles, typical of a suburban area. The houses have pitched roofs, and there is lush greenery visible around the scene, indicating it's a temperate climate.\n\nLighting in the photo suggests it was taken during daylight with ample natural light, which gives a clear view but casts some shadows around the vehicles and buildings. The overall composition gives a sense of quiet industry and daily suburban life from a bygone era, focusing on automotive maintenance and care.","title":"Car enters the safety lane at the Norwood, Ohio, auto emission inspection station. Located in a residential area a block away from Main Street, the building was an open-air market in the 1920s. All light-duty, spark ignition-powered motor vehicles in Norwood must be certified annually. If a vehicle fails the test for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, the owner is given a 30-day temporary sticker to allow time for repairs and retesting.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557836","557905","557885","557832","557850","557853","557893","557875","542763","557900","557906","553488","557884","557852","557902","557858"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["station","inspection","garage","maintenance","era","headlight","accent","care","wagon","trim"]}
