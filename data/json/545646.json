{"path":"545646.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a nighttime or twilight scene focused on an industrial setting by a large body of water, possibly a lake or coastal bay. The image has a subdued, dusky blue light casting a serene but somewhat haunting glow over the landscape, which is composed of sprawling hills or low mountains in the background. These hills are silhouetted against the sky, and their shapes are jagged, suggesting they might be part of a rugged terrain.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a considerable amount of activity centered around what appears to be a construction or excavation site. Key elements include a large crane, which is the most prominent piece of machinery evident. The crane, stationed near the water's edge, seems to be in a stationary position, suggesting ongoing work or perhaps a pause in activity.\n\nThere are various other smaller machines and equipment scattered throughout the scene, including lights that are illuminating specific areas vividly, providing a stark contrast to the dimly lit natural environment. These lights, emitting a stark yellowish hue, seem almost fiery against the cool tones of the evening.\n\nThe ground is rugged and uneven, littered with what could be building materials, debris, or tools â€“ details that suggest construction or an industrial operation of some sort. There are a few scattered figures visible near the machinery, likely workers, though it's difficult to discern their activities precisely due to the low lighting and distance.\n\nThe entire composition conveys a sense of isolation and perhaps the encroachment of industrial activity into a natural landscape. The contrast of artificial light against the fading natural light adds a layer of complexity, emphasizing the intersection between human endeavor and the environment. The mood is slightly somber and introspective, capturing a moment of transition from day to night in a place where natural beauty meets human enterprise.","title":"This log boom in Monument Valley, Utah, near the New Mexican border, was the site of intensive clean-up operations following a massive oil spill into the San Juan River. The boom contained the spill until flood conditions caused much of the oil and debris to overflow into Lake Powell. Crews worked round the clock in almost incessant rain. Shifts were relieved by helicopters based at the Oljato Trading Post.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["547102","544374","545100","545635","553027","550907","543004","545631","547702","544293","551140","546114","544378","552188","546118","547113"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["crane","enterprise","light","encroachment","machinery","pause","nighttime","construction","endeavor","hill"]}
