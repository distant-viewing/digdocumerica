{"path":"552548.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a rugged landscape dominated by undulating hills and a sinuous river. The topography features a mix of barren and vegetated patches, with notable variations in the color palette deriving from the soil and vegetation types. The hills in the background show striations, indicative possibly of geological layers, and are colored with shades of pale yellow, beige, and soft browns. These layers contrast with areas of darker vegetation.\n\nThe river, meandering from the top center and snaking downwards, visually bisects the scene with its darker, possibly water-laden channel surrounded by vegetative growth along its banks. This growth provides a stark contrast to the more arid regions, indicating riparian vitality amid the largely semi-arid terrain.\n\nThe immediate foreground features clusters of greenery, implying patches of denser shrub or woodland, providing a textural contrast to the smoother, lighter surfaces of the exposed hill faces. No man-made structures or persons are evident in this natural scene, suggesting a remote or untouched area. The overall image conveys an impression of a dry, possibly desert-like climate, interrupted only by the life-giving river that adds a dynamic element to the landscape's composition.","title":"Federal oil shale lease site in Piceance Basin","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552560","552908","544752","544744","550542","550597","543977","549456","545632","549455","552925","550392","543793","549081","550586","550393"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["growth","hill","laden","river","vitality","striation","layer","show","woodland","topography"]}
