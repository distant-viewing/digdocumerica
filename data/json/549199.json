{"path":"549199.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a man with a rugged appearance, prominently featuring a well-worn white cowboy hat that is stained and slightly bent out of shape, suggesting regular use. The hat's design includes a classic fedora-like dimple on the crown and a pinched front, typical of Western style.\n\nThe subject, a middle-aged man, wears a crisp white shirt with thin vertical stripes and a button-up front, sleeves rolled up just below the elbow. His pose is casual yet assertive, with both of his arms crossed over his chest. This stance, combined with his squinting gaze and partially sunlit face, conveys a sense of determination or contemplation.\n\nThe man's wrist is adorned with a large, noticeable watch with a dark strap and a round, slightly reflective face, which suggests its practical use perhaps related to his lifestyle or occupation.\n\nThe background of the photograph is nondescript and dark, likely to emphasize the subject's figure more than his surroundings. The lighting highlights the contours of his face and the texture of his hat, creating a vivid portrait that brings focus to the character and perhaps the lifestyle of the individual.","title":"Les best, a sarpy basin rancher, whose land covers rich coal seams.
