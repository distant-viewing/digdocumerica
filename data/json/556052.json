{"path":"556052.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph likely depicts a scene inside an Amtrak train dining car, capturing the laid-back essence of rail travel dining from a past era. The focal point of the image is a dining table covered with various items. At the forefront is a diner-style menu titled \"coffee companions\" and a secondary menu titled \"WORTHINGTON BOXCAR breakfast,\" presenting options like assorted juices, fruits, oatmeal, or dry cereal, among other items.\n\nTo the left of these menus is a stainless steel teapot, looking well-used and functional, positioned next to a white napkin or tissue with \"Amtrak\" written on it. Adjacent to these items is a salt shaker. The composed angle allows a peek at the background featuring a part of the dining car interiorâ€”specifically the curved dining booths upholstered in a patterned grey tone, and complementing them are tables that might be made of a dark formica or similar material.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests a casual dining experience amid the motion of a train journey, offering passengers a moment of relaxation and refreshment. The overall color tone and quality of light suggest that this photo may have been taken during the day, relying on natural light filtering through windows which are not visible in the shot. The vintage feel of the picture, grainy texture, and the style of the objects suggest it is possibly from the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"Menu on the table of the un-remodeled dining car of the Inter-American (train #22) enroute from Fort Worth, Texas, to St Louis, Missouri. Old passenger cars and an old engine also were a part of the train which was added to the Amtrak system in the spring of 1974. The U.S. Department of Transportation is authorized to designate one experimental route each year which will run for two years, then be reviewed.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555997","555980","555993","555999","555958","556781","556676","556094","555974","556088","556036","556061","547779","556835","555982","555994"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["dining","menu","title","item","train","table","upholster","refreshment","rely","option"]}
