{"path":"550724.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a large factory complex under a cloudy sky. The factory area, which is set against a backdrop of low-lying hills, features multiple tall smokestacks emitting white and dark smoke, suggesting heavy industrial activity. In the foreground, there is a large circular water treatment or settling pond with a mechanical arm or scraper moving along its perimeter, indicating ongoing water processing or purification efforts.\n\nTo the left of the pond, there is a massive pile of scrap materials, possibly metal, giving a sense of the scale of production or waste generated by the factory. Various industrial buildings, storage containers, and construction machinery are scattered throughout the scene, enhancing the busy and operational nature of the environment.\n\nThe central part of the image shows some construction or expansion activities with visible earthworks and a small crane. There are several vehicles, including trucks and a possible temporary office or worker's hut, which implies active construction or maintenance work.\n\nThe setting is bordered by patches of green vegetation, but the overall landscape appears largely utilitarian and modified for industrial purposes. The road in the foreground leading towards the factory underscores the accessibility and possible connectivity of the facility to other areas.","title":"Primary clarifier at the International Paper Company mill at Jay on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["546080","554630","552138","550716","546103","549508","548070","552246","546908","548196","551156","546087","544058","549968","548068","546005"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","pond","construction","hut","modify","settle","perimeter","connectivity","accessibility","expansion"]}
