{"path":"543859.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid and sunny outdoor scene where three children are engaging in a game involving marbles. The setting appears to be a rural or semirural area with a vast, open dirt field backed by a panoramic view of distant mountains under a clear, bright blue sky. \n\nOne boy on the left wears a light-colored baseball cap, with a name and logo, a blue shirt, and darker shorts. He is bending down, focusing on the marbles and perhaps waiting for his turn to play or observing the game. The boy in the center of the frame is actively playing. He wears a yellow shirt and brown trousers and is in the middle of making a play, as seen from his active, bent posture and the position of his arm and marble. The third boy, on the right, wears a red and white plaid shirt tucked into brown trousers with a belt. He is also bent over, watching the game intently, likely preparing for his turn.\n\nIn the background, there are a few more people, possibly other children, scattered across the field, suggesting that this area is a common place for local kids to gather and play. Overall, the scene depicts a moment of childhood play and interaction in a scenic natural environment.","title":"Children of migrant workers play marbles while their parents work in fields.
