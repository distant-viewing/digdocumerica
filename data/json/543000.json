{"path":"543000.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial area adjacent to a coastline. This industrial complex is large, featuring several sizable buildings and multiple storage tanks. A distinctly large chimney in the center emits white smoke, alongside other smaller sources of emissions within the complex. The area is well-connected with roads, and a dock extends into the calm, deep blue waters where a ship is moored.\n\nThe immediate surroundings of the complex are barren with patches of brown and sandy terrain, giving way to sparse greenery as the landscape extends outward. Beyond the industrial activities, the image captures the natural beauty of the coastline with waves breaking along the shore. The sea appears relatively calm with minor whitecaps visible under clear skies. The contrast between industrial activity and natural scenery is stark, emphasizing the impact of human infrastructure on coastal environments.","title":"Northern California--Humboldt Bay-Eureka area","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552193","549507","557464","546391","552181","555769","551183","547058","551574","546006","549495","552245","552191","549510","555776","551566"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["complex","coastline","whitecap","emission","source","ship","scenery","chimney","way","dock"]}
