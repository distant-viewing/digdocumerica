{"path":"555872.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a post-disaster scene with significant debris and damage. The foreground is cluttered with charred and twisted remnants of what appear to be vehicles and machinery, hinting at a violent force having passed through. A prominent feature in the middle of the image is a path made of hay bales, possibly laid down to assist in navigating the muddy and wet terrain. The ground is saturated with water, reflecting sunlight in some areas, and appears blackened in others, suggesting recent fires or spills.\n\nIn the background, the landscape contrasts starkly with the devastation in the foreground. There are tranquil snow-capped mountains stretching across the horizon under a clear blue sky, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the affected area. The openness of the setting and the distant mountains provide a natural backdrop that enhances the sense of desolation and aftermath witnessed in the foreground. The image captures both the immediate impact on human-made structures and the enduring, untouched natural environment, offering a powerful narrative of disaster and resilience.","title":"Straw bales and oil booms helped to separate acid water and oil in the five acre pond and guide the liquid to separate sites and removal along the dikes. It was treated and disposed of at a nearby site under supervision of EPA personnel. Cleanup operations were about half finished at this stage.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["555199","555207","555103","543769","556445","545254","557993","547868","550247","549119","547527","544466","545264","547653","555089","555870"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["spill","bale","hay","devastation","disaster","mountain","openness","aftermath","desolation","force"]}
