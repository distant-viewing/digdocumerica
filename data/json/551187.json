{"path":"551187.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of what appears to be an extensive excavation or construction site, possibly for mining or roadway construction. The image features several distinct layers of the earth exposed, with various shades of brown and grey soil. The presence of several heavy machines, such as bulldozers or earthmovers, suggests active work in progress. These machines are scattered throughout the site, working on different terraces of the excavation.\n\nIn addition to the excavation area, the image shows surrounding environments that include a dense forest area that borders one side of the excavation site, and a developed area with houses and a building that resembles a large home or small institutional building on the other side. There is also a neat road that curves around the forest and across the bottom of the picture, with vehicles visible on it, providing scale to the magnitude of operations at the site.\n\nIn the background, and more distantly, there appear to be more residential or rural structures, spaced apart among patches of treed areas, suggesting that this site might be located near a suburban or semi-rural community. The image captures the contrast between the natural landscape and human-induced changes for industrial or construction purposes.","title":"Gouging the land for road construction","placename":"Charleston (W.
