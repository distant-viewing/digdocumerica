{"path":"547037.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and industrial scene focused on a large, metallic lock gate partially submerged in turbulent water, which appears to be in motion, possibly due to the operation of the lock. The image is taken from a dock or similar solid structure, with the dock surface visible in the foreground. \n\nKey elements in the foreground include several bollards, one upright and another apparently broken, anchored to the concrete surface that shows signs of wear and water exposure. There are also some metal pipes or cylindrical objects laid on the surface of the dock, one standing upright.\n\nThe background is dominated by the churning, muddy water violently interacting with the massive lock gate. The water is splashing around the gate, suggesting strong currents or movement caused by the operation of the waterway lock system. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image features an intense interaction between human-made structures and the dynamic force of water, captured with high clarity and detail, emphasizing textures and the raw energy of the scene. The photo possibly depicts an industrial or navigational waterway, highlighting the engineering and mechanical elements critical to its operation.","title":"Pipe and cement transformed into ice sculpture by winter storm on lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547162","549303","551047","552928","556944","547238","543983","549053","551041","547890","548309","558014","558004","547242","542990","549304"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["lock","gate","upright","dock","operation","churning","bollard","splashe","water","surface"]}
