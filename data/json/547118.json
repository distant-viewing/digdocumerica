{"path":"547118.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph shows a dramatic seascape with a rugged coastal environment. The central focus of the image is a large, wooden two-story building positioned right on the edge of a choppy and tumultuous sea. The building appears to be a pier or dock structure, part of which extends into the water where waves are crashing against the pilings dramatically, creating splashes. This structure includes antennae and a porch-like extension, suggesting it may serve a specific functional or observational purpose. \n\nIn the foreground, there is an expanse of eroded shoreline with jagged rocks and debris indicating recent or ongoing coastal erosion. A notable feature is a large, uprooted tree trunk lying across the rocks, testament to the powerful natural forces at work in this area.\n\nTo the right of the image stands a lone figure, possibly observing the scene or contemplating the power of nature. This person adds a human element to the scene, providing scale and emphasizing the rough conditions.\n\nThe sky is overcast, with clouds filling the background, contributing to a moody and somewhat ominous atmosphere that complements the turbulent sea and wind-swept landscape. Overall, the photograph captures a sense of isolation and the enduring struggle between man-made structures and the relentless force of nature.","title":"Fierce waves wash away the sand from this rocky shore.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["551963","543288","543242","547155","551953","552955","543291","547040","543153","547119","543359","543307","543320","547131","547068","543092"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["force","antennae","struggle","testament","piling","sea","extension","seascape","rock","splash"]}
