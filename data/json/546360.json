{"path":"546360.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In this photograph, a person is engaged in an activity on a sandy lakeside beach. The person, appearing to be a man with shoulder-length brown hair, is crouched over and examining a long, wide fishing net that is spread out on the beach. He is wearing a horizontally striped black and white t-shirt and navy blue trousers.\n\nThe net is filled with a mixture of seaweed, small debris, and several small fish, suggesting that it has just been pulled from the nearby lake. The person's hands are busy as he appears to be either removing the fish or untangling the net.\n\nIn the background, the lake stretches across the horizon with calm water visible under a cloudy sky. Beyond the lake, a distant tree line, likely a forest, borders the lake, enhancing the serene and secluded natural setting. The beach area itself is desolate with minimal details aside from patches of grass and driftwood scattered around, emphasizing a wild, natural environment. The overall scene combines elements of human activity and natural landscape, giving a glimpse into aquatic or fishery work in a peaceful outdoor setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: field trip to Tom King Bayou.
