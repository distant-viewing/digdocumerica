{"path":"552281.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene aquatic and mountainous landscape. The foreground is dominated by a large body of water with a slightly choppy surface, reflecting shades of deep blue. On the water, a group of ducks swims peacefully, scattered throughout the lower portion of the image, adding a sense of life and movement to the scene.\n\nFurther into the middle ground, a solitary small boat is visible, sitting idle on the water. It's a simple, small craft, likely used for fishing or leisure.\n\nThe background features an expansive view of a distant shoreline dotted with buildings of a coastal town. Beyond the town, towering snow-covered mountains rise majestically, filling the upper part of the composition. These mountains, bathed in sunlight, contrast starkly with the darker tones of the water and the skyline, creating a striking natural backdrop.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a tranquil yet vibrant natural setting, combining elements of wildlife, human activity, and dramatic landscapes. It conveys a sense of calm and vastness, emphasizing the beauty and scale of the natural world.","title":"Black brant geese rest on the waters of puget sound at alki point during their annual migration between mexico and the arctic circle.
