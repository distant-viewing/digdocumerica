{"path":"556901.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of railway maintenance and construction. The primary focus is on a large, complex piece of machinery, which is likely a track-laying or repair machine, painted in bright red with visible signs of wear and rust. The machine has various mechanical components, including pistons, levers, and a platform where a worker can be seen operating or steering it.\n\nIn the foreground, two workers wearing safety helmets are present. One worker, facing away from the camera, is walking towards the machinery, while another worker is looking down, possibly adjusting or checking something on the track. Both are dressed in work-specific clothing that includes overalls and boots.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor railway track environment. The ground is covered with railway ties and gravel, typical of railway infrastructure. Vegetation and trees can be seen in the background, suggesting a rural or semi-rural location. The lighting and color tone of the photo, possibly indicating an overcast day, contribute to the industrial and gritty feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of labor and industry focused on railway maintenance, highlighting both the machinery used and the workers involved in the process.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way workers and machinery. The machine jacks up the rails, pulls out the old crossties and places new ones, tamps the ties into place, then drives spikes to hold the rails in place. The company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in 1974 on track maintenance. That year Southern had an average of four crews of 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556872","556861","556871","556883","556881","556875","556887","556878","556862","556898","556899","556894","556870","556879","556860","556869"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["railway","worker","track","machinery","machine","maintenance","lever","overall","repair","gravel"]}
