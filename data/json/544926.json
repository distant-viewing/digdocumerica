{"path":"544926.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, arid landscape dominated by a small, gnarled tree in the foreground. The tree, which appears to be a type of pine, is situated on a flat, rocky platform, likely sandstone, displaying a rich red-brown color typical of desert environments. The ground surrounding the tree is rough and uneven, with patches of sparse vegetation.\n\nIn the background, the scene extends to reveal a cliff composed of stratified rock layers that exhibit various shades of red and brown, contributing to a textured, weathered appearance. On the cliff face and the ledges, small shrubs and trees can be seen clinging to the rocky surface, showcasing the resilient flora typical of such harsh environments.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests a bright, clear day, as the shadows cast by the tree are sharp and short, indicating strong sunlight, possibly near midday. The overall composition focuses on the interaction between the resilient tree and its harsh, yet strikingly beautiful environment.","title":"Pinon pine growing out of rock","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544921","555573","545754","545724","544889","543722","545789","544887","544440","545579","544401","545797","545804","543718","552551","546157"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cliff","tree","sandstone","cling","ledge","pine","midday","flora","platform","desert"]}
