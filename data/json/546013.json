{"path":"546013.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime scene featuring multiple bonfires. The fire provides a bright, intense orange glow that contrasts sharply with the dark surroundings. There are several silhouettes of people standing and moving around; these figures are backlit by the flames, rendering their features indistinguishable. The biggest fire appears to be built from a stack of what might be wooden pallets or large pieces of wood arranged vertically, creating a tower-like structure that is vigorously burning. The environment is otherwise dark, hinting that this activity could be taking place in an open field or outdoor area away from city lights. The atmosphere evoked is one of a communal or ceremonial gathering, possibly a celebration or event centered around the fires.","title":"One of the Christmas Eve bonfires which take place every year in the communities along the Mississippi River levee, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
