{"path":"545583.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph displays a desert landscape, predominantly featuring a sandy, rocky terrain with scattered vegetation. The ground is covered in red-orange sand, and is uneven and studded with a variety of rocks and sparse clumps of grasses and shrubs. Several small, bushy plants add slight greenery to the otherwise arid, earth-toned scene.\n\nIn the background, large red rock formations rise imposingly. These formations are characterized by horizontal stratification and have a smooth, eroded surface, typical of desert sandstone landscapes. The sky is a clear, vivid blue, suggesting bright, sunny weather without any visible clouds.\n\nThis scene likely captures a typical day in a desert environment in the American Southwest, known for such red sandstone formations and arid vegetation. The absence of any animals or people in the image emphasizes the solitude and untouched nature of the landscape.","title":"Newly incorporated into Canyonlands National Park, the Maze is aVailable to grazing cattle for the next few years.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545789","545804","545754","544401","544027","545575","545843","545771","545748","552923","544016","545800","555573","544397","545797","545579"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sandstone","desert","formation","stratification","clump","erode","rock","know","absence","animal"]}
