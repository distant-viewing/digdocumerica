{"path":"552513.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a quaint rural scene featuring a small, weathered building identified as \"Bill's Fish Market.\" The building has a steeply sloped roof and is partially constructed with rusted corrugated metal and wood siding. A large sign above the door reinforces the identity of the market. Adjacent to the building, there is an old red pickup truck, adding to the rustic charm of the scene. The truck has logos and text indicating it belongs to the same fish market.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a Royal Crown Cola cooler beside the pickup truck, suggesting that the market also served refreshments. The ground around the building is unpaved and includes a variety of items that give a sense of untidiness or disuse, including an old tire, a broom, and what appears to be a pile of logs or wooden debris.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the market is flat and expansive, hinting at an agricultural setting with wide open fields visible in the background under a muted sky. This setting provides a tranquil countryside atmosphere, characteristic of a small, locally-run business. The overall composition of the photograph, with its elements of rural life and decay, evokes a sense of nostalgia and the simplicity of small-town commerce.","title":"Fish market at intersection of Illinois 100 and U.S. 36","placename":"Winchester (Ill.)","location":"Winchester, Illinois","nn1":["556368","552454","555377","552517","546973","554561","550279","551079","556330","546183","555640","552518","552997","554784","554694","546051"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["market","pickup","truck","fish","broom","cooler","refreshment","run","identity","countryside"]}
