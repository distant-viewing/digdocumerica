{"path":"543820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scenic view featuring railroad tracks and a mountainous landscape. The foreground prominently displays three sets of curving railroad tracks that lead into the distance towards a group of industrial structures. The tracks create a leading line towards a central mill or mining facility, characterized by large, metal frameworks and several levels of construction.\n\nThe mill is positioned on the slope of a mountain, with part of a bridge visible extending over a body of water. Surrounding the industrial site, the landscape features partial snow coverage and sparse vegetation, indicating a colder, possibly alpine environment.\n\nIn the background, a mountain rises steeply, with patches of snow scattered across its surface, indicating either late winter or early spring conditions. The sky above is bright and partly cloudy, suggesting a crisp day.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, emphasizing the solitude of the industrial setting within a natural environment. The overall composition blends elements of industrial activity with the ruggedness of the natural, mountainous terrain.","title":"Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. feldspar mine on Monarch Pass (infrared photograph)","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543725","543826","556382","549131","554632","544706","550974","548135","556851","552349","547999","547528","545378","556424","542592","543717"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["mill","track","railroad","snow","coverage","ruggedness","mountain","set","framework","winter"]}
