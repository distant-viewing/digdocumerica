She holds a plush yellow bird in one arm.\n2. A man in the center, standing slightly behind the first woman, wearing a dark suit and a white hat. He appears to be older, with glasses, and is looking off to the side, smiling.\n3. Another woman on the right, who appears to be mid-conversation or observing something intently. She has short, dark hair and wears a sleeveless pink blouse. She is holding several stuffed toys and a small white bag.\n\nThe background is lively and blurred with multiple lights, suggesting a bustling atmosphere typical of a nighttime event at a fairground. Various stalls and the crowd add to the busy, festive environment. The overall mood of the scene is cheerful and vibrant.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545464","545460","553304","545459","558285","551689","551298","545444","558295","551688","553761","551299","547371","553210","553331","551808"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["fairground","smile","woman","toy","curl","nighttime","festival","stall","hair","night"]}
