{"path":"546280.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, an older man is pictured holding a large, open map. He is wearing glasses and a plaid, yellow-toned shirt. His expression is focused and he appears to be engaged in his task, possibly explaining or studying the map. The setting seems to be an indoor office or study area, characterized by shelving with books and other items in the background which suggests a scholarly or professional environment.\n\nThe map is large and detailed, covering a portion of a landmass with coastal areas visible and various red markings that may denote certain locations or points of interest. The detail on the map suggests it might be used for navigation or geographical analysis. The man's hand placement on the map indicates he might be pointing out something of significance.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo—with its focus on the individual and the map—emphasizes themes of study, planning, or geographic exploration. The background elements are softly blurred, directing attention to the man and the map he is examining. The lighting is soft and natural, contributing to the contemplative mood of the scene.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: Dr. Phillip Butler, research biologist","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556755","552390","552388","548443","556383","555430","551915","542690","551916","548769","551898","551897","551904","556822","552392","552366"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["map","study","analysis","landmass","navigation","placement","planning","marking","significance","book"]}
