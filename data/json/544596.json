{"path":"544596.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a small island situated in a body of dark blue water. The island is densely covered with lush green vegetation. On the edge of the island, there is a building structure with a flat roof, accompanied by a small dock that protrudes into the water. The building appears to be a residential or possibly a recreational retreat, surrounded by natural beauty and providing a sense of isolation. The overall composition highlights the contrast between the natural environment of the island and the man-made structure. The surrounding water has a textured appearance, suggesting it might be a breezy day. Boat traffic or other human activity is not visible in the immediate area, emphasizing tranquility and seclusion.","title":"Private vacation home","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548605","550358","552919","548630","550749","548786","544557","548634","548785","550360","552887","550359","548604","551573","544554","549520"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","retreat","seclusion","accompany","protrude","water","dock","situate","traffic","surround"]}
