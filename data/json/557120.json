{"path":"557120.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This image depicts a natural, outdoor setting with two geese captured amidst thick vegetation. The foreground and the entirety of the background are densely filled with wild, brown and green grasses which create an overall textured appearance.\n\nOne goose is prominently in view towards the right, facing left with its head turned slightly to the rear. This goose is mostly in profile, displaying its distinct black head, white cheek patches, and brown-grey plumage, which is characteristic of many goose species, like the Canada Goose. \n\nThe second goose is less visible and only partially shown at the left side of the photo. It is facing forward but largely obscured by the dense grasses, making parts of its body and head discernible but not as prominently as the first.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears to be natural, indicative of outdoor photography, highlighting the rich browns and subtle greens of the environment. This rural or possibly wetland habitat conveys a calm, undisturbed wildness, typical of birdwatching or nature observation scenes.","title":"Flocks of blue geese and snow geese stop at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state.  The refuge is approximately 6,000 acres in size and is a major stopover on the Mississippi flyway for migrating shore birds.
