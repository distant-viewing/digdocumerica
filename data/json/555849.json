{"path":"555849.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and slightly surreal scene, likely at a junkyard or a dumping ground, featuring multiple submerged and partially-submerged cars in a large pool of water. The foreground contains several prominent vehicles, with various parts like doors and hoods either open or missing. Rust, degradation, and peeling paint are evident on the cars, highlighting their worn-out condition.\n\nThe water reflecting the sky adds a serene element to the otherwise decrepit scene, creating mirror-like reflections of the cars and the sky above. This adds a layer of visual interest and complexity to the image.\n\nBeyond the immediate scene of abandonment, the background presents a stark contrast with a beautiful, distant mountain range that appears snow-capped. The mountains are set against a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds, offering a breathtaking backdrop that contrasts sharply with the foreground's theme of decay.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a poignant juxtaposition between the themes of natural beauty and human neglect. The image is evocative, prompting thoughts on the environment, the passage of time, and the lifecycle of man-made objects.","title":"Abandoned autoMobiles and other debris clutter an acid water and oil filled five acre pond, it was cleaned up under epa supervision to prevent possible contamination of Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge nearby","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["555850","555853","543680","547132","547835","547911","547605","546173","545365","552072","555851","544433","547481","551547","546315","555871"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["prompt","lifecycle","car","junkyard","theme","miss","mountain","hood","dump","degradation"]}
