{"path":"548870.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a striking natural and architectural scene. In the forefront, the focus is on a body of serene blue water, possibly a lake or river. Lush green foliage, perhaps shrubs or small trees, frames the bottom and right side of the image, emphasizing the untouched nature of the location.\n\nAt the center and stretching across the background, there is a large, concrete structure spanning the water. This structure, possibly a dam or bridge, features several arches and rectangular openings, giving it a robust and functional appearance. The construction looks solid and substantial, indicating its significance in water management or transportation.\n\nThe terrain surrounding this concrete structure is rugged and arid. Bare, rocky hills or mountains can be seen rising up behind the structure, presenting a stark contrast to the dark blue of the water. The sky above is clear and predominantly blue, suggesting a sunny, calm day. The natural light highlights the textures and colors of the landscape and the man-made structure, enhancing the visual impact of the scene.\n\nThis composition blends elements of human engineering with natural beauty, creating a powerful yet serene vista that invites reflection on the interplay between human activity and nature.","title":"Parker Dam on the Colorado River supplies power to Los Angeles.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["544166","544151","549486","550654","553828","548947","544141","549024","542734","553137","548150","549469","548097","551519","549540","548013"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["structure","dam","opening","engineering","significance","arch","water","forefront","management","interplay"]}
