In the foreground, there's a large yellow bulldozer with a front blade attached, actively operated by a person wearing a green hard hat and dark clothing. Just behind and to the right of the bulldozer is a large crane with a long red boom, also seemed to be operated by a person inside a small cabin at its base. These machines appear to be working in a muddy area filled with debris or scrub material, which they might be clearing or moving.\n\nTowards the middle ground, there's a structure resembling a small, box-like building with a yellow and red exterior, possibly a temporary office or storage shed for the construction site. The background is dominated by impressive rock formations, characterized by horizontal stratification, suggesting a desert or arid environment typical of canyon regions. These steep cliffs and flat tops provide a stark contrast to the mechanical activity in the foreground. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the entire scene, enhancing the gritty, industrial feel of the image.","title":"Dragline scoops up oil-laden debris on the San Juan river following massive oil spill from broken pipeline 200 miles upstream near Shiprock, New Mexico.
