{"path":"557280.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph showcases the close-up view of a modern building with a distinct glass facade. Each pane of glass reflects fragments of the surrounding architecture and sky, creating a series of distorted images across the grid-like structure of the windows. The reflections visible in the windows appear to warp and twist the buildings and sky, resulting in a collage of abstract, wavy forms and patterns. The colors are predominantly blues and whites, corresponding to the sky and other buildings in the vicinity that are being reflected. \n\nThe emphasis on reflection and the visual impact of the distortion play with the viewer's perception, making it an interesting study of light, glass, and urban environment interaction. The rows of windows are neatly aligned, contributing to a structured and organized aesthetic, while the reflections present a contrast with their varied and unpredictable shapes. The overall composition is geometric and rhythmic, with the visual effect of the reflections introducing dynamism and artistic intrigue to the photograph.","title":"Reflections of other buildings at Gateway center.  This area was part of the urban renewal renaissance program in the early 1950's.  Park-like settings of various kinds of plantings, sculpture and pools were added to complement the towering office buildings and give a sense of human dimension","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["555329","553220","545885","546521","550123","545380","557318","549880","555326","548648","557333","549864","549997","555278","551493","550007"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["reflection","glass","reflecte","window","dynamism","twist","abstract","pane","introduce","whites"]}
