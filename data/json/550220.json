{"path":"550220.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts two persons navigating through a heavily debris-laden body of water in a small boat. Both individuals are wearing hats for protection, one in a yellow hard hat and the other possibly in a similar protective hat. The person in the back is seated and operating the boat with a long pole, while the other individual stands at the front, stabilizing themselves with a hand on a piece of wood, suggesting they might be moving debris or steering.\n\nThe body of water is covered heavily in green algae and layers of floating vegetation, making it look quite dense and likely difficult to navigate through. Surrounding the area, there is an abundance of fallen tree branches, logs, and various other types of natural debris cluttering the water, contributing to a sense of unkept wilderness or aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\nThe background is densely wooded with trees and foliage that appear healthy and unaffected by the condition of the water, contrasting starkly with the devastation in the aquatic environment. The scene suggests a conservation effort or cleanup operation in response to environmental degradation or a storm. The overall atmosphere is one of calm yet challenging labor, set in a natural yet disturbed waterway.","title":"Cleanup at Rocky River dam by members of the Columbia game club","placename":"Columbia (Ohio)","location":"Columbia, Ohio","nn1":["545659","545669","550224","548882","544758","544226","545654","552820","544646","546331","551529","545663","551226","545666","544532","550209"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["navigate","hat","debris","cleanup","response","abundance","stabilize","clutter","devastation","algae"]}
