{"path":"556236.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a religious ceremony inside what appears to be a church. The central figure is a middle-aged man wearing glasses and priestly vestments, which include a grayish cassock with a white surplice over it. He is focused attentively on offering communion, holding a golden chalice in one hand and using the other to place the Eucharist (communion wafer) into the mouth of a woman kneeling before him.\n\nThe woman, who is dressed in a light-colored coat, is looking up towards the priest with a calm and respectful expression. Her posture and the act indicate that she is receiving communion, a significant part of the Christian liturgical service.\n\nIn the background, another priest wearing similar vestments is visible. He seems to be preparing or possibly assisting in the communion distribution, holding another chalice. \n\nThe setting suggests a solemn and respectful ambience typical of a church service, with an emphasis on the sacrament of Eucharist. The lighting is subdued, and the photograph overall exudes a quiet, devout atmosphere dedicated to religious worship.","title":"Holy angel catholic church on Chicago's south side.
