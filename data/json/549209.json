{"path":"549209.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an oil field featuring multiple pumpjacks (often referred to as oil horses or nodding donkeys) spread across a somewhat barren landscape. The foreground shows a prominent pumpjack painted in black and red, which is actively engaged in extracting oil, as suggested by its mechanical up-and-down motion. Surrounding this pumpjack are others in varying sizes, placed at different distances and seemingly on different terrain levels.\n\nThe landscape is rough and primarily grassy, with some areas showing exposed soil and rock formations, giving the image a rugged, industrial feel. The scene is set against a backdrop of a slightly overcast sky, with patches of blue and cumulus clouds visible. Near the horizon, minor elevation changes can be observed, possibly small hills or mounds, which are common in some oil field regions.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes industrial activity within a natural setting, highlighting the coexistence of mechanical operations and their environmental context. The variety of pumpjacks, their repetitive structures, and the expansive setting relay the scale of oil extraction activities in this area. The photograph likely aims to capture both the functionality of these machines and the environmental impact of their operation.","title":"Oil wells near Teapot Dome, Wyoming","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549207","546182","549208","546135","549211","545827","546179","544272","555634","542632","555633","544390","544512","546064","544511","545815"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["oil","refer","cumulus","extract","operation","extraction","field","coexistence","aim","horse"]}
