{"path":"542660.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity, with a focus on environmental impact and recycling processes. In the foreground, there is a large pile of discarded automobiles heaped in a disorganized manner. These cars, which vary in model and color, show significant damage and aging, indicating they are likely destined for recycling or scrapping.\n\nA prominent feature in the image is a crane positioned to the left side, with its boom extended and seemingly in the process of moving or organizing the scrapped vehicles. The crane's presence underscores the ongoing activity and purpose of the site.\n\nThe background presents a contrasting scene of industrial prowess: a complex of factories with several tall smokestacks releasing emissions into the sky. The factories, dense with structural detail, depict an active industrial backdrop, possibly related to the steel or manufacturing industry given the context of the scrapyard.\n\nThe overall composition uses a vivid color palette despite the ostensibly grim subject matter, with the rusts, reds, and blues of the junked cars vividly standing out against the muted colors of the industrial structures in the distance. The image likely aims to provoke thought on themes such as industrial waste, recycling, and the environmental impact of human activities.","title":"Pile of wrecked autos at Klean Steel Co.","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["547610","554320","547621","545059","547611","546172","546267","551521","545545","554318","553011","546253","553012","552765","554352","554301"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["recycling","factory","crane","process","scrapyard","matter","impact","boom","automobile","aging"]}
