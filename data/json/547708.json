{"path":"547708.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of several speedboats racing or maneuvering rapidly on a body of water, likely the ocean or a large lake. The deep blue water forms a vast background that contrasts starkly with the white foamy trails left by the boats. There are four main boats in the image, each producing long, curving wake patterns as they move. Some boats are closer to the left side of the frame, while others are positioned more centrally or to the right.\n\nThe foremost boat on the lower right is moving diagonally from the bottom right towards the center, leaving a pronounced, swirling trail behind it. Another boat, just ahead of this one, is trailing a straighter wake as it moves horizontally across the frame. Further up, two more boats positioned towards the left side also streak across the water; the closest one to the viewer has a marked wake that curls dramatically.\n\nAll of the boats vary slightly in color and size but are generally sleek and designed for high speeds, as indicated by how they cut through the water with sharp, streamlined shapes. The overall scene is dynamic and full of motion, suggesting a competitive or recreational high-speed boating event. The photograph captures the thrill and speed of the activity, emphasizing movement through the stark patterns of the wakes against the calm blue of the water.","title":"Speedboats on lake mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["542697","550879","550840","556911","549731","548926","549085","549733","546049","548520","547685","555785","545156","547674","548736","549732"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["wake","boat","speed","trail","one","move","speedboat","thrill","race","curl"]}
