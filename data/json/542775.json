{"path":"542775.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a human hand interacting with numerous small insects on an outdoor surface. The hand, which appears to be that of an adult based on its size and skin texture, has a wedding ring on the ring finger, suggesting that the person is married. The skin on the hand is light-toned.\n\nThe insects gathered on and around the hand are small and black. Many of them are also congregated on what looks to be a crumpled piece of white paper beside the hand. This paper is dotted with the insects, some of which are moving onto the hand itself.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors given the glimpse of what might be asphalt seen in part of the frame, suggesting an urban environment or a hard, man-made surface. The focus and close framing on the hand and insects draw attention to the interaction and provide a detailed look at the insectsâ€™ distribution across both the hand and paper.\n\nThe overall composition highlights a moment of human and insect interaction in a detailed and vivid manner.","title":"Cryptolaemus lady beetle being used to desTroy infestation of Comstock mealy bug","placename":"Porterville (Calif.)","location":"Porterville, California","nn1":["557585","546350","554842","545630","543916","546319","557543","553872","545891","557544","543905","546312","546890","544188","544590","555062"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["insect","hand","ring","paper","skin","finger","distribution","asphalt","manner","framing"]}
