{"path":"549900.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene featuring a large body of water with a ferry moving from left to right across the frame. The ferry is predominantly orange and blue and appears to be a two-tiered vessel, indicative of passenger transport services. The water exhibits gentle ripples, suggesting a calm day.\n\nIn the background, there is a hazy yet distinguishable city skyline, marked by several tall buildings and towers stretching across the horizon. The ambiance is slightly obscured by mist or smog, lending an atmospheric quality to the urban backdrop. The color palette of the scene is muted, with deep blues and grays dominating, evoking a serene but murky day, possibly in the early morning or late evening.\n\nThis setting is most likely a coastal or riverside city, with the ferry serving as a mode of public transport connecting different parts of the city or surrounding areas. The overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and somewhat somber, highlighting the everyday yet scenic beauty of urban life by the water.","title":"Staten Island ferry with smog-obscured skyline of lower Manhattan in background.
