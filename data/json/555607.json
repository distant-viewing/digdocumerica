{"path":"555607.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed and close-up view of a large mechanical digging bucket from an excavator, engaged in moving material, likely in a mining or construction setting. The bucket is a robust, metallic structure painted in bright orange with noticeable signs of wear and rust, indicating heavy use. It is partially filled with earth or rubble, highlighting its function in excavation or earth moving operations.\n\nThe background is a chaotic arrangement of stones and debris, predominantly shades of grey, suggesting a rugged terrain typical of extraction sites. No sky or distinct features are visible beyond the immediate operation area, emphasizing the focus on the industrial activity. The image itself is characterized by a gritty, workaday atmosphere intrinsic to industrial or construction sites, where heavy machinery is pivotal.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo centers on showcasing the power and size of the machinery in relation to the landscape it is altering, underscoring the scale and impact of human industrial activities on natural or developed environments.","title":"Coal company power shovel scooping earth in its search for solid fuel off Route #800 near Edgewater Park, Ohio, and Barnesville","placename":"Edgewater Park (Ohio)","location":"Edgewater Park, Ohio","nn1":["552419","544098","552418","544099","547583","555644","544138","547243","552417","555638","554826","544135","555593","544134","547225","545831"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bucket","relation","earth","machinery","site","excavator","construction","alter","operation","dig"]}
