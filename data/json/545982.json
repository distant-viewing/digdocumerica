{"path":"545982.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph presents an intriguing juxtaposition of elements, blending nature with industrial decay. In the foreground, an arrangement of industrial machinery, possibly parts of a pumping mechanism, dominates the view. These mechanisms are characterized by metallic textures, intricate bolted joints, and a visual complexity suggesting functional obsolescence or abandonment. The machinery, coated in pale silver-gray paint, shows signs of weathering, and it is intertwined with bare, thin branches, enhancing the sense of neglect.\n\nIn the background, slightly obscured by the machinery and branches, stands a dilapidated building. The architectural style, with its large openings and evident columns, suggests it may have been a house or small public building. The roofing of this structure is severely damaged, with parts appearing to have caved in, contributing to an overall aura of decay. Taller, leafless trees loom around the building, indicating a season possibly of winter or an environment of general neglect.\n\nThe setting appears to be a rural or semi-rural area, given the wild vegetation and the lack of visible modern infrastructure. The light in the photograph is dim and overcast, casting soft shadows and contributing to a somber, desolate atmosphere that envelops the scene. This image captures a striking contrast between human-made industrial constructions and the natural process of decay and reclamation by the environment.","title":"Madewood, an antebellum plantation left to the destruction of the elements and vandals, is surrounded by a petro installation.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["545978","556351","554565","543687","543258","556324","556352","550255","549555","552091","543354","542585","546757","546067","544281","554799"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["decay","mechanism","machinery","obsolescence","reclamation","neglect","cave","bolt","branch","aura"]}
