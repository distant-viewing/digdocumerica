{"path":"544440.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, rocky landscape likely captured during a time when sunlight is casting long shadows and rich, warm hues. In the center of the image, a small, vibrant yellow-green shrub grows from a narrow crevice between two large, rugged boulders. The boulders themselves have textured surfaces covered in patches of lichen, adding a variety of colors including grays, oranges, and whites. Smaller rocks and pebbles are scattered around the base of the boulders and the foreground, which is shaded and appears more muted in color compared to the illuminated portions of the scene.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph highlights the rugged textures and the contrast between the harsh, stony environment and the delicate, lively bush. The environment implies a harsh, possibly mountainous terrain that manages to support small patches of vegetation. This scene captures a moment of resilience and natural beauty in a seemingly inhospitable place.","title":"Texas--near lake Austin","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["554596","545724","544451","544921","544435","544887","555884","549228","555029","544894","555886","551520","545797","550483","544926","545754"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boulder","bush","crevice","orang","illuminated","pebble","whites","grow","resilience","patch"]}
