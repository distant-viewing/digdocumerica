{"path":"543964.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene on a river, featuring two traditional paddle steamboats. The boat in the foreground is named \"Belle of Louisville,\" prominently displayed in elegant lettering across its side. The boat is painted white and has two decks adorned with decorative railings and red trim. A red paddle wheel at the stern of the boat is actively spinning, creating a dynamic splash of water. Dark smoke is rising from a small stack, suggesting the steam engine is at work.\n\nBeside, slightly in the background, is another paddle steamboat named \"Delta Queen.\" It shares a similar design aesthetic with multiple decks, ornate railings, and a large red paddle wheel, which is also in motion, churning water vigorously. This boat has a more complex structure visible on the upper deck, which includes additional red and white decorations and possibly an upper control room or wheelhouse.\n\nBoth boats are full of passengers, evident from the figures seen standing along the rails and decks, likely enjoying the ride or participating in a riverboat race or rally. The backdrop features lush greenery along the riverbank under a bright, clear sky, enhancing the picturesque and festive setting of the scene. The overall atmosphere is nostalgic and lively, reminiscent of historical river travel and leisure.","title":"The \"Belle of Louisiana\" on the Ohio River.
