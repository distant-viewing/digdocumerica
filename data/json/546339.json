{"path":"546339.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural setting centered around water activities. It features a blue and white motorboat in the foreground prominently labeled \"EPA\" with the United States flag design on its side, indicating that it's a vessel used by the Environmental Protection Agency. Inside the boat there are numerous life jackets and some equipment, suggesting it is prepared for operation or safety measures.\n\nIn the background, the picture captures two individuals engaging in water skiing. One skier is visible further in the distance, while another is closer to the foreground, both being pulled by a separate boat, skimming along the water's surface. This activity highlights the recreational use of the water.\n\nThe environment is richly adorned by tall trees heavily draped with Spanish moss, a feature that suggests a location in a southern U.S. wetland or swampy area. The trees loom over the scene, providing a lush, green canopy and casting shadows onto the water, enhancing the natural, tranquil feel of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on environmental and recreational elements, conveys a narrative of human activity within a distinctly American natural landscape. The presence of the EPA boat suggests a possible intersection of environmental oversight with leisure activities in this natural setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory personnel are seining for contaminated female shrimp.
