{"path":"551864.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively yet tranquil street scene, likely taken at dusk or during a cloudy day, given the illumination from street lights and the wet, reflective pavement. The setting is an urban street lined with well-maintained, ornate buildings featuring traditional European architecture. The buildings have multiple stories, with the lower floors visible as commercial spaces, showcasing brightly lit shop windows.\n\nIn the foreground, a street lamp distinctly stands out with its classic design, next to what appears to be part of a bicycle rack or street furniture. The street itself is paved and seems freshly wet, possibly from recent rain, enhancing the reflection of city lights and making the scene more vivid.\n\nThe photograph captures a motion blur of cyclists traversing the street, creating a dynamic element within the otherwise serene environment. This blurring effect adds a sense of movement and life, contrasting sharply with the static and structured surroundings. The cyclists are indistinct, emphasizing speed and motion rather than individual identities.\n\nFurther down the street, various other figures can be seen walking or possibly interacting, but they are too distant to discern clearly. Decorative flags or banners hang across the street, contributing to the festive or ceremonial feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a blend of historic charm and contemporary vibrancy, typical of many European city centers. The composition cleverly uses lighting, reflection, and motion to create a rich, multilayered visual narrative.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On this rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["549659","551788","551790","557656","543360","549681","551866","551786","551862","550031","551849","549662","556983","551493","550107","555446"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","cyclist","motion","reflection","identity","rack","banner","city","blur","furniture"]}
