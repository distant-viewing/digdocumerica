{"path":"549445.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This atmospheric image captures a serene silhouette landscape, dominated by a mirror-like body of water enclosed by mountain ridges on either side. The photograph, taken during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, portrays a tranquil and somewhat mystical scene. The sky, with a blend of light and clouds, reflects beautifully on the water, creating a symmetrical duplicate image where the dividing line is almost indistinguishable.\n\nThe mountains are dark, creating a sharp and striking contrast against the lighter sky reflected in the water. The stillness of the water further enhances the mirror effect, giving the impression of a complete circle at the center where the tips of the mountains and their reflections almost meet. The visual trickery slightly distorts perspective, suggesting a landscape both vast and intimate at the same time.\n\nOverall, the photograph elicits a sense of calm and solitude, capturing a moment of natural beauty where the elements of sky, water, and earth converge in a quiet display of symmetry and reflection. There are no visible human activities or structures, emphasizing the untouched and pristine character of the environment.","title":"Tranquil stretch of the snake river in hells canyon on the Idaho-Oregon state line.
