{"path":"554580.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a yellow flower, possibly a type of orchid, with a distinctive shape and color. The flower's petal is bulbous and vividly yellow, featuring intricate details such as small, reddish-brown speckles inside the bloom which add a subtle touch of contrast to its primarily yellow color. The flower appears to be in the process of opening or blooming, characterized by its slightly unfurled petals that exhibit a smooth and shiny texture.\n\nThe plant's stem and other floral parts, visible in the image, have a greenish-brown color with a slight sheen, suggesting health and vigor. These parts are slender and curve gently, supporting the flower itself and contributing to the overall delicate appearance of the plant.\n\nThe background of the image is deeply blurred with dark hues of green and black, focusing all attention on the flower itself. This depth of field creates a striking isolation effect, making the yellow of the flower pop against the dark, nondescript backdrop.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a detailed and intimate look at a unique flower, emphasizing its vibrant colors and delicate structures through a focused and artistic composition.","title":"Yellow lady slipper (Cypripedium pubescens), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554581","545699","555033","554840","543596","554586","554844","555189","551369","549230","548027","544875","543623","557487","554112","557545"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","speckle","pop","health","sheen","stem","bloom","plant","opening"]}
