{"path":"543798.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a wide, open landscape characterized by its geothermal activity. In the foreground, there is a mix of dry grass and green vegetation, typical of a scrubby terrain. This area slopes down toward a central geothermal field shown as a flat, expansive area with mud and areas of standing water, giving a somewhat barren, otherworldly look. Steam can be seen rising from several points in the geothermal field, indicating active hot springs or fumaroles.\n\nA dirt path appears to wind through the middle of the geothermal zone, outlined by small fences in some sections, which might be used to keep visitors from straying into dangerous areas. The background is dominated by low, rolling hills which are partially covered in greenery, contrasting with the starkness of the geothermal field. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or damp climate, which adds to the subdued color palette of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph emphasize a juxtaposition of natural beauty and the stark, almost lunar landscape created by geothermal activity. It captures an atmosphere of quiet, natural power and the delicate balance ecosystems must maintain in such harsh conditions.","title":"Union Carbide uranium mill near the Colorado River","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["555158","554137","555885","546110","552423","549179","554090","554141","543644","552420","545656","551520","550397","550598","549183","550492"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["field","starkness","mud","balance","visitor","ecosystem","steam","spring","climate","zone"]}
