{"path":"543930.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial setting, possibly a power plant or a factory, with several large structures visible in the background. Prominently featured are two large towers with red and white striped tops, possibly chimneys, which are common in industrial facilities for venting gases. Between these towers, there are multiple large, gray metallic structures, likely part of the machinery or processing units used in the plant. Additionally, there is a distinctive water tower with a red and white striped design similar to the chimneys.\n\nIn the foreground, a person's hand holding a compass is prominently shown. The compass, which appears to be a standard portable type used for navigation, is captured in focus with its needle pointing toward the center of the dial. This inclusion of the compass might suggest themes of direction, navigation, or metaphorically, indicating the need for environmental or ethical direction considering the industrial context.\n\nThe setting includes a body of still water, which reflects the industrial structure beautifully, adding a serene yet somewhat contrasting element to the highly industrialized backdrop. The sky is blue with some clouds, suggesting clear weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph cleverly juxtaposes the industrial elements against natural ones (water, sky), enhanced by the visual anchor of the compass in the foreground, potentially serving as a symbolic reminder of environmental direction against the industrial development.","title":"Worker checks temperature of water discharged from the turbines of the P.H.
