{"path":"557823.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"","caption":"This is an image depicting a wooded scene with a bubbling, rocky creek flowing through it. The photograph captures a small, rugged stream as it cascades over various sizes of rocks and boulders, creating white, foamy water as it tumbles downstream. The surrounding landscape is densely filled with trees, displaying a mixture of autumn colors among the leaves, ranging from green and yellow to hints of orange and brown. This suggests that the photo was taken in fall. The trees are thick and lush, covering much of the upper part of the image, with their branches and foliage forming a canopy over parts of the creek. The overall atmosphere is serene, reflecting a quiet, natural setting that is typical of a forest environment. The lighting appears natural and somewhat dim, hinting that the photo may have been taken either in early morning or late afternoon, adding a softness to the scene with gentle shadows cast across the creek and stones.","title":"Rocky Mountain stream typical of those in the area near the Flume, a natural 800-foot long chasm formed before the Ice Age, in the Franconia Notch State Park, south of Franconia, New Hampshire. Other attractions in the state park include an aerial tramway that carries passengers to the top of 4,200-foot Cannon Mountain, and the Old Man of the Mountain, a 40-foot profile made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The area is part of the White Mountain National Forest.","placename":"Franconia Notch State Park (N.H.)","location":"Franconia Notch State Park, New Hamshire","nn1":["554747","554748","554407","551351","546171","558085","554406","543869","555211","555218","552692","550351","544867","546896","553434","555153"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["creek","softness","boulder","fall","mixture","stream","autumn","orange","photo","canopy"]}
