{"path":"544672.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene. The image features a large body of calm water with a visible pier in the foreground, hosting vertical wooden posts and a fragmented wooden structure submerged in the shimmering water. On the right, the pier extends into the water but is incomplete, suggesting it may be under construction or in disrepair.\n\nDominating the mid-ground of the image are two prominent ships moored near each other. The ship on the left appears to be a smaller, white vessel, possibly a coastguard or research ship, while the ship to its right seems to be larger and more of a cargo or industrial type. Both ships exhibit a slightly faded appearance, which might be due to the image's vintage look or the lighting conditions.\n\nIn the distance, small boats with sails raised can be seen further out on the water, adding a leisurely or sportive ambiance to the scene. Above this tranquil marine setting, the sky is dramatic, with storm clouds gathering on the horizon, casting a muted light that bathes the entire scene in a kind of ethereal glow. The encroaching weather adds a dynamic element to what would otherwise be a peaceful seascape, hinting at the transient and ever-changing conditions at sea. The overall tone of the image, likely influenced by the lighting and film used, carries a nostalgic or historical feel, evoking a sense of quietude and the grandeur of maritime life.","title":"White fog","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544657","548247","548235","542903","545015","546939","550034","545170","546998","555721","552010","542907","545277","545005","544234","550293"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ship","pier","marine","quietude","seascape","storm","kind","disrepair","sail","water"]}
