{"path":"544970.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an entrance to the Dixie National Forest's administrative site in Panguitch. The setting is slightly misty or foggy, which adds a serene and somewhat mysterious tone to the image. In the foreground, there is a dirt road leading towards a traditional, single-story white house with a green roof. This house is flanked by lush green trees, and the environment appears calm and natural. \n\nCentered in the image is an American flag mounted on a tall pole, waving in the breeze, suggesting a sense of patriotic pride and official presence. Just below the flag, at the entrance of the site, there are two stone pillars with wooden signs attached. The left pillar has the U.S. Forest Service logo painted on it, while the right pillar bears a sign that broadly welcomes visitors to the Dixie National Forest, specifying that it is an administrative site. The bottom of the sign mentions that the site is managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe entire scene is enveloped in a fog, which softens the details and gives a peaceful, secluded feel to the location. The composition of the photograph is balanced with natural and man-made elements that represent the interface of environmental management and forest conservation.","title":"Smoke from lumber mill's \"teepee\" burner obscures administration building","placename":"Panguitch (Utah)","location":"Panguitch, Utah","nn1":["542789","544913","543724","542567","542568","549626","556943","544860","543580","556976","554461","544522","545262","542849","543599","547178"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["pillar","site","flag","entrance","specify","pride","interface","foggy","sign","pillars"]}
