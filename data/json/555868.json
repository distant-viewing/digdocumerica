{"path":"555868.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a worker, possibly involved in an environmental cleanup operation, trying to manage a situation with polluted water or oil spill. The worker, an older male, is seen from the back and wearing a cap, dirty, long-sleeved, checkered shirt, and suspenders over his trousers. He has on gloves and is using a long tool, which resembles a rake or a pole, to either skim or stir through a dark, viscous liquid that shows reflections of a contaminated or oily sheen.\n\nThe surrounding area appears to be an outdoor environment, with natural rocks visible in the immediate background, suggesting that this might be near a shoreline or a bank of some water body that has been polluted. The surface of the water is covered almost entirely by the slick, swirling patterns of the oil, reflecting some light and showing different textures within the pollutant itself. The overall scene communicates a sense of urgency and environmental concern, highlighting human intervention in an ecological crisis.","title":"Pumping operation underway which removed some 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil from the five-acre pond. The liquid was neutralized after removal and trucked to a nearby site for disposal. The pond was cleaned up under EPA supervision to prevent possible contamination of nearby Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["555867","545663","553650","545074","545076","554535","543804","545669","545659","557243","555562","551226","552085","545032","546892","551925"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["oil","worker","rake","crisis","slick","try","stir","cleanup","suspender","urgency"]}
