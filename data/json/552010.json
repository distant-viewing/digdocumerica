{"path":"552010.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil maritime scene with a prominent contrast of vessel sizes, set against a dynamic sky. In the foreground, on the left side, there are two leisure sailboats anchored near a dock, one closer to the frame and the other slightly behind it. Both sailboats have their sails lowered and appear serene on the water.\n\nIn stark contrast to the small sailboats, a massive cargo ship dominates the center and right of the frame, suggesting an active commercial waterway. This large vessel appears to be a tanker, given its size and the structure on its deck. It is moving through the waterway and creates a slight wake behind it, indicating its recent passage.\n\nThe backdrop features a wide expanse of water leading up to a distant shoreline that appears flat and lightly vegetated. Above, the sky is filled with fluffy, cumulus clouds, suggesting good weather but with signs of potential changes. The color palette of the scene is a mix of blues and whites with the rusty red of the tanker adding a contrast to the natural hues.\n\nOverall, this is a snapshot of daily activity and contrast in a maritime environment, where leisure and commercial shipping coexist against a naturally scenic backdrop.","title":"Sailboats ride at anchor at the raritan yacht club in perth amboy, where the raritan river joins the Arthur Kill.
