{"path":"544957.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a young Caucasian man working within a rustic, wooden structure, possibly an outdoor booth or a small kiosk. The man has curly, light brown hair and is dressed in a light gray or khaki short-sleeved shirt. He is leaning forward, looking intently into a large, murky water tank that occupies the lower half of the image.\n\nThe tank appears to contain several eels or snake-like creatures, swirling in the unclear water. There is an intriguing pattern on the glass, possibly reflections of the creatures inside the tank or marks on the glass. The wooden frame of the tank looks weathered and aged, adding a rustic feel to the image.\n\nIn the upper right corner of the frame, there is a pulley system with a metal hook, suggesting that this setup may be used for feeding or interacting with the creatures in the tank.\n\nThe background is softly focused, showing lush green foliage, which indicates that the booth is located in a green, possibly forested area. The overall ambiance is that of a natural, somewhat primitive setting, evoking a sense of casual, hands-on interaction possibly at an ecological or nature reserve.","title":"Jellyfish, and their ability to fluoresce, is the project engaging this graduate student at the marine biology laboratory of the University of Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553657","551589","545206","546270","545211","546353","544961","545202","545198","549346","551596","552273","553650","551598","543181","553095"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["creature","tank","booth","pulley","kiosk","hook","reserve","glass","snake","mark"]}
