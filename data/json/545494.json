{"path":"545494.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene of urban neglect or a momentary lapse in public sanitation services. A massive pile of garbage dominates the foreground. The garbage includes numerous plastic bags, loosely filled and some ruptured, spilling their contents. Cardboard boxes, discarded papers, and various other debris are scattered among the bags, contributing to the disorderly and neglected appearance of the scene.\n\nAbove the chaos of the garbage, a banner hangs between two poles, fluttering slightly with a message that reads \"BOROUGH OF ALLENTOWN SCOUTING FOR SCRAP BRING YOUR SCRAP TO THE HIGH SCHOOL.\" The ironic juxtaposition of a civic appeal for community cleanliness or recycling against the backdrop of uncollected trash provides a potent visual commentary, perhaps on civic responsibility or the failures thereof.\n\nThe background reveals a more serene urban environment with a street extending into the distance, lined by trees and lampposts. It appears to be either early morning or late evening given the soft, dim lighting and the empty street, suggesting a quiet moment in what might normally be a busier urban setting. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes themes of community, responsibility, and the challenges of urban waste management.","title":"Uncollected trash spills over into this street on the outskirts of Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545502","549840","549833","548214","545506","549746","549839","553039","547878","549957","547827","549752","549747","547983","545299","551247"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","responsibility","scrap","bag","sanitation","recycle","neglect","lamppost","cleanliness","flutter"]}
