{"path":"556145.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This is a tender and intimate photograph that features a young African American child being held by an adult, likely her mother. The child, a little girl, is dressed in a peach-colored dress with ruffle detailing and a large, white lace bonnet embellished with a peach ribbon. Her hair is styled with small twists, some adorned with pink clips. She gazes away from the camera with a thoughtful, serene expression.\n\nThe woman holding her wears a soft pink shirt with a delicate white-lace collar. She is looking at the child with a gentle, loving gaze, and holds the child's hand in a caring manner. Her expression conveys warmth and affection. Her dark hair is parted to the side and falls freely.\n\nThe background of the image is softly out of focus, with hints of other individuals, suggesting the setting might be a public or communal space. The overall mood of the photo is very warm and affectionate, capturing a moment of maternal care and gentle connection between the child and the adult.","title":"A black mother and child, part of the 1.2 million people of their race who make up over one third of Chicago's population.
