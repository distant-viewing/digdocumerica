{"path":"554366.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view through a car windshield. Prominently displayed inside the car are two decorative objects. On the right, there is a small figurine of Mickey Mouse, a classic cartoon character recognized by his large ears, gloved hands, and cheerful expression. He is standing upright and is colored in a traditional palette of black, red, and white. On the left side of the dashboard rests a small, slightly curled American flag, oriented horizontally.\n\nThe dashboard itself has a textured surface, and various vents and compartments are visible through the windshield. The glass shows reflections of clouds and hints of a blue sky, adding a soft, somewhat dreamy overlay to the scene captured inside the car. The edges of the windshield frame the photo, creating a sense of looking into a private, personal space within the vehicle. The overall mood is nostalgic and whimsical, shaped by the iconic character and the subtle patriotism of the flag.","title":"Windshield emblems","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545335","552799","557847","555477","554365","548999","554361","556198","549854","547494","551251","554384","553288","550152","554368","554362"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["windshield","dashboard","flag","character","patriotism","overlay","cartoon","car","vent","ear"]}
