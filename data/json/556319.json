{"path":"556319.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from inside a mining environment. It depicts a miner standing in a dimly lit underground tunnel. The light in the tunnel primarily emanates from a single, bright spot near the miner, casting the rest of the tunnel into deep shadows. The ceiling and walls of the tunnel appear rough and uneven, characteristic of mined-out areas.\n\nThe miner, partially silhouetted against the bright light, is standing next to a set of tracks that suggest the presence of mining carts or similar equipment used to transport materials within the mine. He seems to be inspecting or working on a device or object near the tracks, although his precise activity is not clear due to the lighting and distance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of isolation and hard labor, emphasized by the surrounding darkness and the miner's solitary figure in this subterranean setting. The photo uses natural and artificial light to create a stark contrast between the illuminated and shadowed areas, highlighting the miner's figure and activities.","title":"General scene underground in the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia.
