{"path":"547490.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of construction or industrial activity under a newly built overpass. The overpass is large with a modern design, visible through its clean lines and sturdy grey concrete walls and pillars. The bridge itself is supported by tall, angular abutments, and it features a sleek, red barrier along its side which contrasts sharply against the grey tones of the concrete.\n\nUnderneath the overpass, a large, yellow dump truck is in motion, depicted just as it leaves a dust trail behind while transporting a load of sand, indicated by the pile visible in the truckâ€™s open-box bed. This indicates ongoing construction or landscaping activity in the area.\n\nThe ground beneath the overpass and around the truck is uneven and appears to be a mix of dirt and gravel, suggesting recent or ongoing groundworks. The surrounds of the overpass are open and somewhat barren, with minimal vegetation, which is common in construction zones before landscaping has been completed.\n\nThis scene is set against a backdrop of a clear sky with a few clouds, suggesting a dry, sunny day which facilitates outdoor construction work. The overall composition of the photograph captures a moment in the development of infrastructure, hinting at progress and the expansion or maintenance of transportation routes.","title":"Major highway is being cut through northwest corner of putts bog, a previously undisturbed natural area","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551966","549861","550274","553277","546252","546139","553124","549913","551186","547922","555746","542538","551098","549878","545876","550954"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["overpass","construction","landscaping","truck","grey","concrete","pillar","expansion","complete","dump"]}
