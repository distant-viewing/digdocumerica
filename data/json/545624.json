{"path":"545624.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic natural landscape likely captured in a desert environment. In the foreground, there is a sign with the words \"ROAD CLOSED SCENIC RESTORATION\" mounted on a wooden post and prominently displayed. Blocking the path, which appears as a dirt trail leading into the distance, is a barrier made of twigs and branches.\n\nThe surroundings of the trail are characterized by arid vegetation, predominantly shrubs and sparse grass, which cover the red-brown earth typical of desert terrains. The background features a series of remarkable rock formations and mesas stretching across the horizon under a blue sky with a few scattered clouds. These geological structures have layered appearances and rounded tops, suggesting significant weathering and erosion over time.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the closed road and restoration sign, might imply a conservation effort to preserve or rehabilitate the natural environment showcased in the image. The setting and natural elements suggest a remote, undeveloped region perhaps in a national park or protected area known for its unique landscape and geological features. This image evokes a sense of tranquility and untouched wilderness, with an emphasis on ecological preservation.","title":"In the Needles and Maze areas of the Canyonlands, the park service is attempting to eliminate unnecessary roads and restore the natural landscape. A major environmental hazard is the off-road use of vehicles. Because of thin ground cover and scarce rain, tracks remain visible for many years.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545620","555582","555628","554789","555647","545109","545746","545575","545764","552549","556943","545604","554802","544245","545760","544845"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["restoration","trail","desert","mesa","preservation","twig","weathering","conservation","emphasis","word"]}
