{"path":"549347.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an underwater scene where three divers are visible in an expansive body of water, seemingly in the midst of a diving activity. The top part of the image shows the calm, dark blue waters of the ocean.\n\nTwo of the divers, in the center and right, are wearing orange inflatable vests designed to aid their buoyancy on the surface. These vests are bright against the darker backdrop of the water. Each of these divers is equipped with full scuba diving gear, including breathing apparatus (likely containing a regulator and mouthpiece), masks that cover their noses and eyes to facilitate underwater vision, and fins to aid swimming. The third diver, to the left, has similar gear but doesnâ€™t have a visible buoyancy vest.\n\nThe divers are not above the water surface but immersed in water up to their heads, indicating they could be preparing to dive deeper or possibly finishing a dive. The photograph captures them right at the surface; bubbles and ripples are visible around them, suggesting recent movement or activity.\n\nThe entire atmosphere conveyed is serene yet adventurous, focused on the sport of scuba diving and exploration beneath the ocean surface. This open-water setting lacks any visible landmarks or definite structures, emphasizing the vastness and freedom associated with deep-water diving.","title":"Scientists with the Ruder Boskovic Institute dive into the Adriatic Sea from the hydrobiological research ship the Vila Velebita II.
