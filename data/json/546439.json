{"path":"546439.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures a quaint, multi-story house decorated in a classic style, with distinctive architectural elements suggestive of Victorian design. Its color palette mainly consists of muted greens and whites. You can observe detailed wood carvings on the edges of the eaves and around the windows, adding character to the house's appearance.\n\nOne side of the house features a prominent three-window bay with smaller windows, all uniformly painted and trim with dark frames accentuating them. Adjacent to it, in a slight diagonal alignment, is a taller section of the structure highlighted by a single window on each visible story.\n\nIn front of the house, there's a well-maintained lawn with some foliage and tall grass borders. Close to the scene, a wooden clothesline is erected, hinting at domestic life and household chores being performed. A person appears near this clothesline, partially obscured by the house, engaged in what looks like hanging or removing clothes. This figure adds a lived-in, personal touch to the otherwise static architectural presentation.\n\nIn the background, glimpses of green trees and a hint of another light-colored outbuilding complement the clear, bright sky that bathes the entire scene in natural light, creating a peaceful, serene residential setting.","title":"Wash hangs alongside old home on Chestnut Street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546434","558156","557076","558159","557092","558160","546438","557094","548664","548662","557068","548667","558153","546429","542816","557746"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","clothesline","window","eave","carving","outbuilding","alignment","presentation","household","border"]}
