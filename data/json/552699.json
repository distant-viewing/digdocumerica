{"path":"552699.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a striking and rather gloomy scene. It shows the lifeless body of what appears to be a deer, lying on its back in a sparse, rocky landscape. The deer's pale underbelly and legs are exposed, pointing upwards, with its legs stiffened in an unnatural manner suggesting rigor mortis. The fur around its belly is darker, and its head is turned to the side, resting on the ground which hints at a peaceful final resting pose despite the awkward body position.\n\nThe background is a barren field with little vegetation apart from a few small, dried plants near the foreground. A barbed wire fence runs through the middle portion of the photo, partially intersecting with a rough, weathered wooden post, emphasizing the rural, deserted setting. The ground is mostly bare earth with scattered small rocks, contributing to the desolate atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the imagery and composition convey a somber, almost melancholic tone, portraying a stark facet of nature and wildlife.","title":"Deer entangled in a barbed wire ranch fence in Piceance Basin","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543786","545816","554676","552992","558368","551122","557015","544623","547947","546241","552697","545898","557576","544571","552691","549219"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","leg","resting","imagery","fur","manner","wildlife","position","wire","post"]}
