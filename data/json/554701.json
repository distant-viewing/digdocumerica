{"path":"554701.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a historic setting featuring an individual standing near a large tree. The mature tree dominates the foreground and is quite unique with pots or pans embedded into its trunk, somewhat naturally blending with the tree. It has thick, weathered bark, suggesting its considerable age, and splits into multiple large branches that extend upward out of the frame.\n\nOn the tree, there is a prominent historical marker sign in a rectangular shape with gold trim and black lettering. The sign reads \"Concord's 'Liberty Tree' - Beneath the branches of this magnificent White Oak, the ‘Suffolk Resolves,’ which declared support of the Boston Tea Party and inspired the First Continental Congress of 1774, were read and ratified,” attesting to the tree's significance in American colonial history.\n\nThe person next to the tree appears to be a young man, wearing a green jacket over a red or dark shirt, blue pants, and carrying a brownish object, possibly a small bag or camera. He seems to be reading the historical marker, showing an interest in the history denoted by the sign.\n\nAdjacent to this tree setup, there is a building that features traditional architectural elements. It has a vibrant red facade with white shuttered windows and a dark weathered door at the side. A small American flag is positioned at the angle of the building, hinting at the patriotic significance of the location.\n\nThe overall setting is very serene with a clear blue sky and a hint of autumnal colors in the trees in the background, which adds a beautiful contrast against the red building. The photograph captures a moment of historical reflection, blending nature, and history in a quiet, educational setting.","title":"Giant elm tree beside the Elm Tree Inn","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551328","542723","557931","554099","543198","542728","554995","542721","558105","549626","543446","543448","551962","544942","543239","543488"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["history","marker","tree","significance","read","pan","denote","branch","inspire","embed"]}
