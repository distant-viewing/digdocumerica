{"path":"546369.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid and contrasting urban landscape. In the foreground, a dense cluster of makeshift houses with corrugated metal roofs in various states of rust and disrepair dominates the scene. These residential structures are closely packed, suggesting a tightly knit community living in conditions of economic hardship. The houses are painted in different bright colors, which adds a patched, vibrant look to the area.\n\nThere is a notable lack of green space within the immediate vicinity of these homes, indicating the urban density and possible lack of public parks or gardens. A few clotheslines with laundry are visible, hinting at the daily life and domestic activities of the inhabitants.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features modern high-rise buildings that represent commercial or possibly residential apartments, depicting a more affluent, developed part of the city. These buildings are taller, well-maintained, and uniform in appearance, highlighting the socioeconomic disparities within the same urban area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the shanty town in the foreground and the modern skyscrapers in the distance, powerfully illustrates the social and economic divisions within the city. The image captures both the resilience of those living in less favorable conditions, and the development that looms nearby, potentially out of reach for the residents of the makeshift community. The clear blue sky suggests good weather, contrastingly highlighting the harsh living conditions on the ground.","title":"Modern buildings tower over the shanties crowded along the Martin Pena Canal.","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546368","552725","549958","546776","549766","556179","552757","548374","555720","553557","550277","557283","549777","552728","549971","555951"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["lack","hardship","reach","condition","clothesline","inhabitant","laundry","division","house","community"]}
