{"path":"543250.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque coastal scene. The foreground features a large, rugged rock, sharply angled and jutting out from the sandy beach. The rock's surface is uneven and weathered, indicative of long-standing exposure to the elements. The beach itself is sandy, with waves crashing gently onto the shore, creating white foam along the water's edge.\n\nThe ocean in the background is a vibrant blue, with moderate wave activity suggesting a breezy day. Further into the distance, a scenic view of a mountain range is visible. These mountains gradually rise from the coastline, their surfaces appearing smooth and mostly devoid of vegetation, which gives them a barren, yet majestic look.\n\nThe sky above is clear and bright, suggesting it is a sunny day, and the lighting accents the natural colors of the landscape, enhancing the blues of the ocean and the earthy tones of the rocks and mountains.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its emphasis on the dramatic rock formation and the expansive view of the ocean and mountains, creates a sense of untouched natural beauty and tranquility.","title":"California--Garrapata Beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543289","545126","545173","545130","545106","543295","543309","545122","553805","553775","543061","543432","545226","543300","543092","543328"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","mountain","rock","wave","beach","blue","accent","foam","emphasis","coastline"]}
