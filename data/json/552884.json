{"path":"552884.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a large collection of old and rusty metal barrels scattered haphazardly in an outdoor setting. The barrels appear in various states of decay, with some showing large rust holes, dents, and peeling paint. Many of the barrels are stacked on top of each other, while others lie on their sides or upright with lids missing or askew. The surface of some barrels has labels and markings, although they are largely obscured by rust and wear.\n\nThe contents of some barrels are visible; one contains a yellowish liquid, and another shows solidified or semi-solidified material. The composition creates a sense of cluttered abandonment and environmental neglect.\n\nIn the background, natural light suggests a daytime setting, and there are hints of green foliage, indicating that this area might be on the outskirts of an industrial or rural area. The overall impression is one of industrial waste or pollution, possibly a dumping ground for chemical or industrial waste. This scene likely raises concerns about environmental damage and the proper disposal of industrial materials.","title":"About 3,000 drums containing hazardous industrial wastes have been stored for six months in this swampy field near Ville Platte. Wastes were trucked in from industrial sites in the Houston-Beaumont (Texas) area by a company called B.W. & S., Inc. A court injunction has prevented the company from burying the drums at another location near Mamou.","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546000","552885","552883","543806","543762","542494","546004","553433","556324","550301","552248","553045","549307","547896","552102","556640"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["barrel","rust","waste","dent","lid","hole","show","disposal","liquid","material"]}
