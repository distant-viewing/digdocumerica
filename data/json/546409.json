{"path":"546409.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene seemingly viewed through a natural frame of dense foliage. The foreground prominently features a variety of tropical plants; large leaves from possibly banana and palm trees dominate this natural arch. Along with their lush green tones, the fronds and leaves are scattered with small specks of light, likely due to sunlight filtering through the foliage.\n\nIn the background, the contrast moves from the organic to the man-made as a factory structure becomes visible. This factory includes a tall smokestack from which a plume of smoke or steam is emanating. The smoke rises against a slightly clouded sky, hinting at an active industrial process. The factory building, though partially obscured by the dense foliage, appears extensive with a grayish color tone.\n\nBehind the scene, a gentle hill rises, adding a distant horizon line that suggests a valley setting. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either midday or early afternoon, given the bright sky and the sharpness of the sunlight penetrating through the leaves.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph is carefully crafted to juxtapose the lush, vibrant natural foreground with the stark, utilitarian aspect of the industrial backdrop, creating a narrative about the interaction between nature and human activity.","title":"Sugar cane and refinery near aguada","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["550995","557377","543013","545053","551059","554630","557225","543813","546394","543009","545989","550997","551112","545113","545035","543011"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["foliage","leave","clouded","fronds","penetrate","sharpness","grayish","smoke","emanat","midday"]}
