{"path":"556770.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a man operating a train, taken from inside the train's cab. The man, likely a train driver, stands on the right side of the frame dressed in casual work attire consisting of a striped green and white short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a white cap. He is focused on the controls in front of him, handling what appears to be a lever while looking intently out of the window to his left, which shows a blurred view of the outside, suggesting the train might be in motion or the driver is actively navigating.\n\nThe cab's interior has a utilitarian design, with metal walls and a diamond-plate metal floor that suggests durability and frequent use. On the left side of the frame, another window shows part of a train or track structure outside, indicating the setting is in a railway environment. The scene conveys a sense of everyday operation and the focused responsibility of the man driving the train. The lighting in the cab is soft and natural, coming from the windows, highlighting the details of the cab's interior and the driver's concentration on his task.","title":"Engineer operates a southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority (septa) train in the suburbs northwest of Philadelphia.
