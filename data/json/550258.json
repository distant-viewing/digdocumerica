{"path":"550258.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an extensive outdoor area littered with a large amount of garbage, highlighting the issue of pollution and environmental neglect. The scene includes a mixture of various discarded items such as papers, plastics, wooden pieces, and other indistinguishable debris scattered across the ground, alongside overgrown vegetation.\n\nProminently featured in the composition is a sign that reads \"NO DUMPING CITY OF CLEVELAND,\" which stands ironically amid the waste, suggesting either disregard or the aftermath of illegal dumping activities. The setting appears to be on the outskirts of an urban area, near a body of water which is visible in the distance under a grey, overcast sky, further emphasizing a gloomy, polluted atmosphere.\n\nSeveral individuals can be faintly seen in the background, giving a sense of scale and the extensive spread of the debris. These people appear to be walking or standing apart from each other, possibly inspecting or navigating through the littered area. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is somber, drawing attention to environmental issues and the consequences of human actions on natural landscapes.","title":"No dumping?
