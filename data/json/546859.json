{"path":"546859.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a drawbridge, where traffic has been halted due to the bridge being raised. On the left, there's a yellow diamond-shaped traffic sign indicating \"DRAW BRIDGE\" with a directional arrow pointing left, suggesting motorists should be aware of the bridge operation. The middle and right of the photo show several individuals and vehicles stopped on the bridge, waiting for it to lower.\n\nIn the immediate foreground on the left, a person appears to be walking away from the camera along a sidewalk beside the bridge. Further back, two more individuals, one of whom is on a bicycle, are also on the sidewalk, approaching the point where a barrier gate, red and white in color, blocks further passage. The gate indicates that pedestrians and cyclists must also wait.\n\nThe center and right of the image are dominated by the raised bridge section and a line of assorted vehicles from the era, including cars and at least one van, all halted and facing towards the raised section of the bridge. In the very background, the control tower of the bridge is visible, where presumably the operations for the bridge mechanics are managed. Some people are seen standing beside the stopped cars, possibly waiting or looking towards the raised bridge segment.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere seems calm, with people resigned to the wait, depicted under an overcast sky. The setting appears relatively urban, hinted by the visible infrastructure and variety of vehicles.","title":"Boat dock at the Olin Chemical Plant on Curtis Creek in Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549878","546724","549861","552709","552708","546791","549879","548401","544210","548341","550986","546773","548693","548413","551236","552262"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["bridge","gate","sidewalk","traffic","vehicle","cyclist","mechanic","diamond","pointing","arrow"]}
