{"path":"543911.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph shows a scene outside the Louisville Memorial Hospital, where a group of men, possibly police or military personnel, are wearing uniforms and helmets. They are seen from the back as they ascend some steps toward the building's entrance. One of the men near the bottom of the frame slightly faces the camera. A hand-drawn sign reading \"COMMAND POST\" is prominently displayed in the foreground on a pedestal, indicating the location's temporary use for coordination or command purposes during an event or an emergency. The surroundings include a stone facade of the building and parts of an entrance, visible in the background where another person in civilian clothes can be partially seen observing the scene or possibly coordinating activities. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal and organized response to a situation, with the location marked clearly for participants and possibly for the public as well.","title":"Police and national guardsmen maintain law and order during the evacuation.
