{"path":"545668.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph shows two men engaging in a conversation in a rugged, natural outdoor setting. The first man, to the right, is wearing a yellow jacket and light gray trousers. He appears to be in his middle ages, with short dark hair, partly gray, and is holding what looks like a microphone or a recording device in his right hand. He seems to be either interviewing or having a casual talk with the second man, who is on the left. \n\nThis second man, facing the first, holds a camera up to his face, suggesting he is filming or preparing to film. He is dressed in a dark jacket, and his focus is directed towards the man he is speaking to.\n\nThe background features a rocky landscape with sparse vegetation, typical of a desert or semi-arid region. A body of water is visible, contributing to a sense of barren yet scenic wilderness. There are a few people and possibly some equipment in the distance along the shoreline, indicating some form of activity or gathering in the area. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, and the colors in the photograph suggest it might be from an earlier decade, given the slightly faded and grainy quality typical of film photography from past years.","title":"Dr.  George rice (in yellow jacket) was epa's on-scene coordinator for the clean-up of the San Juan river oil spill.  285,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a burst pipeline and flowed 200 miles downstream before it was contained by a log boom.
