{"path":"552338.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque sunset over a landscape featuring water and forested areas. The main element of the image is the vibrant and partially eclipsed sun settling down near the horizon, casting a gradient of warm hues ranging from deep purple to reddish-orange across the sky.\n\nBelow the sky, the scene is dominated by layers of nature and water. The foreground shows dense silhouettes of trees which provide a dark, contrasting frame to the lighter colors above. Behind these trees, there appears to be a calm body of water that reflects the colors of the sunset on its surface, enhancing the depth of the scene. This layer of water separates two masses of land, both covered in dense forests, where further reflections of light can be observed.\n\nIn the distant background, another landmass visible across the water adds to the layering effect in the photograph. This part of the landscape slightly obscures the setting sun, making the scene dynamic and adding a sense of depth and distance.\n\nThe overall composition, with its blend of water, land, and the twilight sky, offers a peaceful, tranquil setting often sought in nature photography. It reflects an effective use of natural light and landscape elements to compose a visually soothing and balanced image.","title":"Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands at sunset, seen from overlook at Larrabee State Park.","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552335","557447","550646","552294","547719","554731","552277","554404","548182","554759","543415","557497","547731","542618","552230","543144"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","water","masse","layer","sun","landmass","land","photography","depth","purple"]}
