{"path":"542812.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant red and yellow wooden building, prominently labeled \"Gear Shed\" and \"Baitings\" on its fa√ßade. The building serves multiple purposes as indicated by the various signs and advertisements on its walls, offering services and goods such as \"Off Shore Surf,\" \"Liquor,\" \"Redwood Gifts & Tackle,\" and \"Trips Information Center.\" It seems to cater to both fishing and tourist needs.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an uneven dirt path leading to or from the building, bordered by sparse grass and weeds. A simple wooden bench is located to the left of the building's entrance, suggesting a place for visitors to rest. The area appears rural, and somewhat utilitarian, indicating that this might be a service point for both locals and visitors in a less urbanized setting.\n\nIn the background, a calm, clear sky dominates the top third of the frame. The horizon shows a modest rural landscape with scattered houses and vehicles, typical of a small community. The presence of electrical poles and clear roads adds a touch of modern infrastructure to the otherwise natural and rustic environment. There is a mix of trees and open spaces, providing a backdrop that implies a blend of residential and possibly agricultural land use in the vicinity. The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a functional, community-oriented locale, probably close to a body of water given the emphasis on fishing and surf gear.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["545154","551079","552513","552809","543409","544824","543210","552517","543108","545962","548229","545061","542914","555377","545951","545005"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["visitor","service","fishing","local","surf","cater","weed","community","locale","third"]}
