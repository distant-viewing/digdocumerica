{"path":"548355.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban scene, likely taken in a mid-20th century American city due to the architecture and vehicle designs visible. The scene is set on a street lined with multi-story buildings featuring a mix of residential and commercial spaces, including visible signs for \"Lenox Cleaners.\"\n\nThe street itself is crowded with vehicles, including large sedans typical of the 1960s or 1970s American automotive design, showing features like prominent grilles and large body styles. These cars are in various states, with some appearing to be parked while others are in traffic.\n\nThe focus of the scene is a group of people gathered in the middle of the street around a car that has suffered a minor accident, indicated by a damaged front-end. The group appears engaged in conversation or possibly assessing the damage. Among the individuals, there is a diverse representation of ages and genders, including a woman dressed in a light blue outfit who seems to be a central figure in the discussion. Other people are standing around or walking past the scene, adding a dynamic element to the setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere captures a moment of community interaction within the context of an urban environment, reflecting the social and automotive landscape of the era. The photograph serves as a vivid snapshot of city life, with elements indicating a sense of routine disturbed momentarily by a common urban incident.","title":"Traffic accident on a crowded street in harlem.  \"property damage only\"--small comfort to the car owner","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547706","549882","549872","556724","554297","548388","556709","550139","551324","548369","545216","556734","551135","554309","551913","554551"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","damaged","incident","accident","assess","gender","grille","disturb","city","representation"]}
