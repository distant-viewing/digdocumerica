{"path":"542989.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene captured during an ambiguous time of day, where the lighting suggests either early morning or late evening. The image is primarily dim but has some backlight bleeding through the haze in the background which casts a gentle silhouette effect.\n\nTwo men, presumably workers, dominate the foreground. They are dressed in safety attire typical for a construction or industrial setting, including bright orange jackets and white hard hats, suggesting a focus on safety regulations. The workers are observing something to their left, standing on what appears to be a large metal grate or platform.\n\nBeneath the platform, there is a substantial heap of coal, with the rugged texture of the coal heap distinctly visible, which spans much of the middle ground of the photograph. This suggests that the facility could possibly be involved in coal processing or energy production.\n\nIn the background, the scene extends to include what appears to be industrial machinery or structures. Visible features include tower-like structures and other framework, which are connected by cables or pipes. The structures have a functional, no-frills design typical of manufacturing or heavy industry facilities.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its industrial elements, workers in safety gear, and the sheer scale of the materials and machines, paints a picture of an active industrial operation. The photograph's exposure and use of natural backlight create a somewhat dramatic and moody atmosphere, emphasizing the industrial theme.","title":"Sewage treatment plant at sunset.
