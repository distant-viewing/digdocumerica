{"path":"545470.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a church during what appears to be a service or gathering. The people in the image are primarily women, predominantly dressed in vibrant and ornate hats and colorful clothing. Many of the hats are embellished with flowers, ribbons, and various adornments, creating an array of textures and colors. These include shades of yellows, pinks, blues, whites, and reds.\n\nThe individuals are seen from behind, seated on benches that are separated by what appear to be book holders. Most of the women are facing forward, and some are engaged in reading from sheets or books that they are holding.\n\nThe background features colorful stained glass windows that enrich the scene with blues, reds, yellows, and greens, casting a serene light into the space and contributing to the solemn yet vibrant atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and context suggest a church event characterized by a communal and spiritual gathering, highlighted by the expressive fashion worn by the attendees.","title":"Sixth Avenue Baptist Church","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556238","558407","545381","558239","558388","556241","558382","558389","558383","556239","552623","558401","546210","558404","558400","545377"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["church","book","yellow","red","holder","gathering","ribbon","blue","hat","sheet"]}
