{"path":"550337.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial scene centered around a large pile of wooden logs. The logs vary slightly in size and color but mostly appear to be freshly cut, showcasing tones of brown with the cut sections exposing lighter wood. At the center of the image, there is a large mechanical grabber, which consists of several metal forks capable of clasping and picking up multiple logs at once. This grabber is attached to a crane or similar machinery, suggested by part of the red structure visible at the upper left side, though mostly out of frame.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky dotted with a few wispy clouds, emphasizing that the setting is outdoors. The sheer volume of logs suggests this might be a logging site or a processing area connected to forestry or wood-based industry. The scene captures a moment of active work, likely involving the loading, unloading, or sorting of these logs for further processing or transportation. The image portrays a typical industrial environment focused on natural resource management.","title":"Pulp log and conveyer.
