{"path":"550168.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, marked by a collection of towering smokestacks and structural facilities typical of a large factory or power plant. The landscape is densely packed with various industrial and electrical infrastructures, including multiple high-voltage transmission towers running parallel in the foreground. These structures are constructed of steel and appear robust and towering, contributing significantly to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe environment is dominated by a muted color palette, primarily featuring shades of grey and blue, evoking a somewhat somber or intense atmosphere. Billowing smoke and steam are emitted from several large stacks, dispersing into the sky and forming thick clouds which blend with the natural clouds above, suggesting pollution and heavy industrial activity.\n\nForegrounding the image, there is a glimpse of a railway or similar track system, hinting at transportation means for either coal, raw materials, or finished goods pertinent to the industrial operations pictured. This element emphasizes the scale and logistical complexity of the operations.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is layered and dense, with each element—the smokestacks, electrical towers, clouds, and tracks—intertwining to create a visual narrative of industrial prowess mixed with environmental impact. The image serves as a powerful representation of mid-20th century heavy industry, likely highlighting themes related to energy production, manufacturing, and their ecological implications.","title":"'Republic Steel'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550982","557374","550172","550981","557294","543993","546884","557218","545447","549710","557373","545236","557225","557231","548376","550983"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["smokestack","cloud","tower","track","voltage","implication","transmission","operation","representation","coal"]}
