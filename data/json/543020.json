{"path":"543020.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene at night, portraying a large, dark structure with vibrant and dynamic activity. At the top of this ominous structure, a powerful eruption of sparks and fire bursts outward, projecting an intense orange-yellow glow. The light of the fire illuminates the billowing smoke and the myriad sparks that scatter into the dark sky, creating a beautifully dramatic and chaotic effect.\n\nThe structure itself is large, seemingly metallic, with a conical shape that tapers towards the top where the fire originates. It is studded with numerous bright, golden lights, which shine from openings or possibly windows, dotting the structure with points of light in stark contrast to its overall dark appearance. Additional light emanates from various parts of the structure, hinting at complex and robust activity within. \n\nThe entire scene is set against a dark, indiscernible background, focusing all attention on the fiery spectacle and the imposing structure. This image likely depicts an industrial furnace or smelter, associated with heavy industries such as steel or metal production, illuminating a night shift operation where raw materials are processed under extreme conditions.","title":"Wood chip burner","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["545528","557399","557395","545536","557397","543996","545532","557402","557400","544030","542591","547060","544045","544049","547702","557398"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["spark","fire","night","structure","originate","furnace","taper","illuminate","spectacle","burst"]}
