{"path":"544052.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial wastewater treatment facility in detail. The scene is filled primarily with multiple channels wherein water and waste materials are flowing. The channels are constructed from concrete and are visibly aged, with stains and residue along the edges.\n\nThere are various industrial elements visible, including a plethora of rusted steel pipelines and conduits running across the scene, some mounted with valves and flanged connections. Multiple pumps, which are also rusted and appear old and heavily used, are situated at different positions, including one prominently in the foreground.\n\nThe water in the channels is muddy and contains floating debris and residues, indicating pollution or the type of waste being processed. The channels themselves are configured in steps or tiers that guide the flow of water from one level to the next, aiding in the treatment process by allowing solid waste to settle or separating different types of effluents.\n\nAbove the channels, there are steel handrails and what appear to be maintenance walkways, facilitating access to various parts of the facility for monitoring and maintenance work.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a functional, if somewhat outdated, infrastructure dealing with the processing or treatment of wastewater or industrial effluent, underlining issues of environmental management and industrial maintenance.","title":"Iron leaching (separating) area of Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company's smelter","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["547568","548212","546895","550720","544040","548216","547257","549564","547260","543810","542990","553900","548196","543572","550708","545836"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["channel","treatment","wastewater","residue","waste","maintenance","steel","handrail","valve","stain"]}
