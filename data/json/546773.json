{"path":"546773.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a ferry or a bridge where cars and pedestrians share a narrow passage. In the image, a few people are shown standing and walking around the narrow pathway next to a line of parked cars. Two individuals are prominent: one wears a hooded sweatshirt and the other is dressed in a coat and beanie. It appears to be a cold or overcast day as everyone is dressed in warm clothing.\n\nThe cars are vintage models, suggesting the photograph may be several decades old. The cars are parked closely together, occupying the left half of the image, while a metal railing separates the vehicle area from the pedestrian walkway on the right, where the people are standing and moving.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but industrial features like large structures and what might be a communications tower are visible, creating an urban or semi-industrial setting. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber mood of the scene. There's a texture to the ground, indicating it could be made of wooden planks, typical of ferry or old bridge surfaces. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the human element and the vintage automotive presence, evokes a sense of everyday life during an earlier time period.","title":"Women unload autoMobiles from freight cars at the dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549857","549878","556734","557230","552711","556707","555944","546849","549905","551913","549920","556727","547185","556709","553718","546738"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["ferry","car","pedestrian","beanie","sweatshirt","bridge","communication","half","passage","walkway"]}
