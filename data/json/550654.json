{"path":"550654.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene at a dam with intense water action. The image foreground features a sloping grassy embankment, leading the eye towards the dynamic water flow. At the center and heart of the image, water forcefully gushes from three wide spillways of the dam, creating thick, frothy white waterfalls that demonstrate the power of controlled water release.\n\nThe structure of the dam itself is notable, possessing a somewhat industrial aesthetic with two main block buildings featuring rectangular and arched portals, suggesting utility and function. The color scheme of the dam, in muted grays and browns, stands in contrast to the natural green hillside background and the bright blue sky. \n\nIn the background, a green-forested mountain under a clear sky provides a serene backdrop to the industrial scene, underscoring a blend of natural beauty with human engineering. A metal truss bridge spans one section of the dam, adding another element of line and structure to the scene, and suggesting accessibility and connectivity over the rushing water below.\n\nOverall, this composition balances elements of nature and technology, highlighting the raw power of water controlled for human use against a picturesque, natural landscape.","title":"Aziscohos Dam in the Rangeley Lakes region in the mountains of western Maine","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["553137","549486","550701","550743","553372","553349","544166","548013","553828","553136","548870","548150","549004","548007","553654","548003"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["dam","power","water","spillway","heart","embankment","truss","connectivity","accessibility","waterfall"]}
