{"path":"557377.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set in a lush, verdant landscape. In the foreground, the calm waters of a river reflect the industrial structures and greenery surrounding it. Leafy trees at the edges of the frame partially obscure the view, lending a sense of being hidden or partially concealed within nature.\n\nThe central and main subject of the image is a large industrial complex. The plant features multiple tall structures, including silos and towers, with visible staircases and several layers of infrastructure suggesting a complex operation. The body of the plant is made up of dark and weathered materials, likely steel or similar metals, which contrast against the brighter, greener background.\n\nMultiple tall smokestacks extend upwards, with at least one emitting a stream of smoke, contributing to a sense of ongoing activity and operation within the plant. Additional features like water towers and large, industrial buildings fill out the complex. The overall architecture and layout suggest that this might be a factory related to heavy industries such as steel production or chemicals.\n\nThe background consists of rolling, densely wooded hills that encase the area, adding a natural frame to the industrial activity. The color palette of deep greens and grays highlights the juxtaposition of industry and nature. The overall scene is under a clear blue sky, implying a bright, sunny day, which casts clear light on the details of both the industrial structures and the natural environment. \n\nThis fusion of natural beauty with industrial development encapsulates themes of human impact, industrialization, and the persistence of nature, all set in a serene yet imposing landscape.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Emissions from the metallurgical plant were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975. The decrease occurred after agreement on a compliance schedule between Union Carbide and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
