{"path":"549987.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph features a line of quaint, traditional houses illuminated against a dark night sky. The houses, spread across the frame, appear to be located along a beachfront due to the visible expanse of sand in the foreground. Each house is distinctly styled with gabled roofs, and many have prominent front porches. Some of the houses have lights on, adding a warm glow and enhancing the architectural details. The prevailing darkness around them highlights their silhouettes and architectural elements. The beach is unoccupied and extends across the bottom part of the image, contributing to a serene and somewhat isolated atmosphere. The overall mood of the photo is quiet and peaceful, with the houses casting a comforting, small-town feel.\n","title":"House on fire.
