{"path":"544607.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a rural or natural landscape that includes a river or waterway and several small structures. The river bends and winds along the surface, flanked by various greenery that appears to be marshes or wetlands, indicating a hearty natural environment. \n\nOn the right side, close to the river, there are a few clustered structures that resemble traditional rural huts with what look like thatched or tiled roofs. There are also some defined fields or cleared patches of land next to these structures, possibly for agricultural use or as yards. \n\nOn the river itself, there is a small boat visible, suggesting that the waterway might be used for transportation or fishing. Alongside the riverbank, what appears to be a road runs parallel with several vehicles parked along it, enhancing the impression of human activity and accessibility in this area.\n\nThe overall scenery encapsulated in the photograph is rich with natural textures and gives off a serene yet vibrant rural life ambiance, where water and land are being actively utilized and inhabited.","title":"Indian settlement in Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556964","549260","552837","555575","548916","549089","551067","547990","555753","550623","548096","552838","548868","549262","550885","551218"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","waterway","hut","marsh","accessibility","land","wetland","yard","wind","scenery"]}
