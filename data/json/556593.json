{"path":"556593.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, four individuals (three women of varying ages and a young child) are gathered together, engaged in a gentle, intimate moment. The eldest woman on the left is wearing glasses and a patterned headscarf along with a dark blouse adorned with a geometric design. This woman is smiling as she looks on at the younger women and child.\n\nNext to her stands a middle-aged woman in a blue, button-up shirt and glasses, who gazes affectionately toward the child and the young woman holding her. She exhibits a soft, nurturing demeanor.\n\nThe young woman, in turn, is dressed in a dark, sleeveless top. She is holding a toddler, facing her, gently handling the situation as the child reaches out towards a small green ball held by the elderly woman.\n\nThe toddler, dressed in a light-colored dress with frilly sleeves and collar, looks intrigued by the ball, displaying a typical childlike curiosity.\n\nThe background is nondescript, with a soft focus that suggests an outdoor setting. This draws more attention to the subjects at the front, emphasizing the familial connection and the warm interaction among them.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of familial love and interconnectedness across generations, highlighted by calm expressions and the casual yet intimate arrangement of the figures.","title":"Three generations of coal mine wives and a baby, all residents of Cumberland, Kentucky.
