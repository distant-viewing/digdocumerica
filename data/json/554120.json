{"path":"554120.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil natural scene at a tropical beach. The foreground and midground of the image are dominated by a dense thicket of tall, slender palm trees. The palm trees have long, leaning trunks and are clustered closely together, their leaves forming a thick canopy overhead. Under this canopy, dark shadows create a contrast with the brighter areas illuminated by sunlight.\n\nThe scene also includes a sandy beach, visible along the bottom edge of the image. The beach curves gently and is lined with dark volcanic sand, which meets the gentle surf of the ocean. The waves appear small and soft, breaking lightly against the shore.\n\nOn the left side of the image, perched on a curved palm trunk that extends horizontally over the sand is a figure, possibly engaged in trying to climb or balance on the trunk. The person wears a patterned swimsuit, blending with the playful, carefree mood of the environment.\n\nThe overall composition and the use of natural light evoke a serene and secluded atmosphere, typical of a remote or less frequented tropical location. The image captures a moment of leisure and simplicity, surrounded by the lush beauty of a natural beach setting.","title":"Famous black sand beach at Kaimu, created by lava runoff, is a favorite tourist stop. Area around beach is due to be developed. In order to preserve beach, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to add a new foundation of sand under the existing layer. Critics argue this would change color of beach, causing it to lose its appeal.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554118","546387","547596","543296","554083","543303","543287","554159","545280","548757","554121","544554","547612","546970","543089","548706"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["palm","beach","trunk","canopy","sand","thicket","try","frequent","surf","swimsuit"]}
