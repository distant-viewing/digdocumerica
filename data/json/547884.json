{"path":"547884.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals engaged in fishing from a seawall or jetty. The scene captures the simplicity and tranquility of a leisurely day spent near the water.\n\nThe person in the foreground, appearing to be a young man with curly hair, is actively fishing. He is seated, wearing a light yellow t-shirt and blue jeans, actively casting his fishing rod. The individualâ€™s posture and the upward gesture of his arms suggest he is either casting the line or in the motion of a fishing technique. He appears focused on his task, looking upwards towards his fishing line.\n\nBeside him, partially visible, is presumably a companion who is also seated and seems to be engaged in conversation or watching the task. This person wears a dark colored top and light-colored pants.\n\nIn the background, beyond the blue expanse of the ocean, a clear sky with fluffy white clouds can be seen. The horizon is lined with a distant cityscape, indicating that the fishing spot is near an urban area. Various items such as a bag, clothing, and possibly bait or other fishing gear are scattered around them on the ground, suggesting a setup for an extended stay at the spot.\n\nThis photograph captures a moment of relaxed endeavor and enjoyment of nature, juxtaposed against a distant urban environment. It evokes a sense of calm and the pleasure of leisure activities.","title":"Plum beach, sheepshead bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552291","549935","546410","543222","553081","543240","548738","550851","551025","551024","552317","543232","554008","552116","550666","543231"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","spot","stay","bait","task","companion","pleasure","jetty","technique","spend"]}
