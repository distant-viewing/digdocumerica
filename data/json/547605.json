{"path":"547605.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking and somewhat somber scene involving a partially submerged, old, yellow car in a body of clear blue water, adjacent to what appears to be a dilapidated wooden pier or jetty. The pier, which extends into the calm blue water, is in a state of disrepair with its slats missing in places and overall structure looking rather unstable. The remnants of a chain-link fence tied to the pier suggest it might have been a secured area at one point.\n\nThe vehicle itself shows significant signs of decay and neglect, as the paint is faded, peeling, and parts of the car, like the trunk and hood, are rusting. It is surrounded by various debris including wooden planks, stones, and pieces of metal, indicating a possible abandonment or dereliction scenario. The background consists primarily of the tranquil water which reflects the sunlight, hinting that the photograph was taken on a clear day.\n\nThis image could evoke thoughts about environmental pollution, the effects of abandoning artificial objects in nature, or simply the decay and passing of what might once have been valuable or significant human possessions.","title":"Car abandoned on Seekonk River bank","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547911","547835","546318","547481","546315","547839","555850","547601","546173","547484","555849","547132","548752","547597","551497","555851"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["pier","decay","slat","jetty","miss","hood","chain","scenario","disrepair","thought"]}
