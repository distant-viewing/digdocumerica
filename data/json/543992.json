{"path":"543992.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged and barren landscape, likely a mining or industrial area, characterized by rocky terrain and minimal vegetation. The foreground of the image is covered with a variety of stones and rocks of different sizes, suggesting a setting that has been significantly disturbed, possibly by mining activities. There is a small pool of water in the lower part of the image, partially bordered by rocks, which could be a result of excavation or natural environmental features.\n\nThe midground shows a slope covered with similar rocky debris and scant vegetation, leading upwards towards the central focus of the imageâ€”a tall smokestack. This smokestack, located on the crest of a hill, is emitting a thick white smoke or steam against a clear blue sky, indicating ongoing industrial operations. The smoke disperses into the sky, creating a stark contrast against the natural landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on industrial activity within a natural setting, highlights the impact of human activities on the environment. No human figures are visible in the shot, adding a sense of isolation and focus on the interaction between industrial elements and the natural terrain. The clear sky suggests a sunny day, but the harsh and inhospitable appearance of the landscape conveys a rugged and possibly polluted environment.","title":"Phelps dodge corp.
