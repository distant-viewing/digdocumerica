{"path":"547671.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a complex display of electronic or mechanical components captured in a warm, amber-toned filter. The image is densely filled with various elements that are slightly obscured and overlaid, producing a textured and layered visual effect. Several gauges, dials, and metal elements are discernible, yet exact details are abstract due to the blurry and artistic photographic style.\n\nIn the upper part of the image, a label which reads \"ACCEPTED BY 46 DATE 8-25-11,\" suggests a technical or inspection approval. There are some visible alphanumeric codes and symbols, adding to the industrial theme of the image. \n\nThe photo also features a strong use of light and shadow, with the reflective surfaces of the components contributing a sheen that contrasts with the deeper shades in the background. The overall composition has a gritty, vintage feel, possibly referencing the inner workings of machinery or a component of a larger technical system. The aesthetic and presentation evoke thoughts of technology from a bygone industrial era.","title":"Time exposure of lighted calculator numbers at one of EPA's National Environmental Research Centers","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["542765","556389","557851","547743","553883","555332","558365","546932","547720","555330","546757","555374","543997","556353","547964","543158"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["component","code","working","gauge","presentation","dial","filter","sheen","inspection","symbol"]}
