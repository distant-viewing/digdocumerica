{"path":"551466.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of six women engaged in conversation outdoors. The setting appears to be an urban environment, indicated by a glimpse of a large building fa√ßade and a sidewalk.\n\nThe women sport a range of retro-styled outfits, typical of the late 20th-century fashion. One wears a horizontally striped short-sleeve shirt paired with a blue and white polka-dot skirt, while another dons a sleeveless white and green dress. A third, off to the right, is in a white knit top and a light purple skirt. Glasses and a shoulder bag complement her look. Next to her, a woman casually nibbles on a snack, dressed in a floral-pattern mini dress with short sleeves.\n\nMost of the women are engaging directly in dialogue, some turning towards each other, while a couple of them are seen listening intently. One holds a plastic cup, indicative of a casual or leisurely setting.\n\nThe mood is informal and conversational, captured in a candid moment that reflects social interaction and fashion styles of the time. The background, other than the hinted urban setting, remains out of focus, emphasizing the social engagement of the subjects.","title":"Navy office workers eat their lunch on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["546855","551444","557175","547772","548646","553761","553804","550082","556532","555906","551460","556805","551013","545231","551817","551436"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["skirt","woman","fashion","dialogue","sleeve","snack","don","retro","knit","cup"]}
