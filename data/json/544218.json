{"path":"544218.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts two young boys in a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The boys, who appear to be in their early teens, are engaged in water-based activities; one is kneeling on a small surfboard or bodyboard, navigating through the water, while the other swims nearby.\n\nThe setting shows a shoreline covered in dark, wet stones of varying sizes that transition into smoother, sand-like sediment in the foreground. The glistening wet rocks and stones are dappled with sunlight, creating reflections and highlights that enhance the textural details of the scene. The calm water around the boys reflects the blue skies above, and on the left, there is a visible portion of a green, rocky structure or embankment, hinting at a natural, somewhat rugged environment traditionally found on lake or river sides. Light ripples on the water surface indicate the gentle movement in the water, possibly caused by the boys' activities or a light breeze. The overall lighting of the photograph suggests it was taken on a clear, sunny day.","title":"Swimming in the Mississippi, near New Orleans and lake pontchartrain","placename":"Kenner (La.)","location":"Kenner, Louisiana","nn1":["553430","544805","553448","544196","553431","543689","544221","551160","544200","544270","553429","550231","544183","544204","546349","551165"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","surfboard","water","teens","stone","glistening","dapple","lake","embankment","breeze"]}
