{"path":"548120.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts two construction workers taking a break at a construction site. The workers are sitting on the ground, surrounded by dirt and rubble, indicating that they are possibly in a dug-out area or a part of the site that is in the process of being developed. Both men are wearing safety helmets, one yellow and the other red, along with casual work clothing that includes long-sleeve shirts and pants. They appear to be eating; one is holding a sandwich, while the other seems to be eating directly from a can.\n\nIn the background, multiple large buildings can be seen, which suggests an urban setting. This is further emphasized by the presence of towering cranes in the distance, signaling ongoing construction activity at the site. Notably, there are a few other construction helmets visible in the foreground, left resting on the ground, echoing the area's industrial nature.\n\nThe setting is well-lit by daylight, and the photograph overall captures a candid moment of everyday life for workers at a construction site, juxtaposed against the backdrop of urban development.","title":"Construction workers take lunch break at site of Expo '74 site overlooks the Columbia River.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553160","544828","556339","547989","549947","547218","556346","553636","556316","556643","554856","556335","556447","544969","551951","544159"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["construction","site","worker","helmet","sandwich","overall","rubble","can","break","safety"]}
