{"path":"542770.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a dense forest where forestry activities are taking place. In the foreground, a large tree has been felled and is now lying diagonally across the frame. The tree appears to be a conifer, judging by its thick, scaly bark and the remaining green branches that continue to hold needles.\n\nAt the base of this tree, a person, likely a logger or woodsman, stands looking up at the fallen tree. The individual is wearing a hard hat, suggesting that safety measures are taken in this logging operation. They are also equipped with a thick jacket, a tool belt, and boots, which are appropriate attire for forestry work. In the person's right hand is an axe, which might have been used for chopping or might just be carried as a tool.\n\nThe environment around the fallen tree is cluttered with tree remnants, including branches and foliage, indicating recent cutting activity. The background shows a mixture of standing trees, some of which are possibly marked for logging, given the context. These trees are tall and densely packed, typical of a mature forest.\n\nThe ground is covered with foliage and other detritus from the trees, blended with the earthy colors of the forest floor. The overall mood of the scene is one of human intervention in nature, with a clear focus on forestry as a form of resource management or extraction. The lighting in the picture, likely natural, is diffuse and suggests an overcast day, which softens the colors and details of the forest landscape.","title":"D.Jackson felling red fir tree","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542769","542773","542771","553602","542772","542788","542623","542787","542716","553608","553601","555472","542786","554419","554418","553599"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["forest","tree","fallen","forestry","tool","detritus","cutting","branch","logg","measure"]}
