{"path":"545214.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a scene of a young boy, approximately 10-12 years old, gently holding a medium-sized bird, likely a wild species. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly in a natural park or rural area, which is suggested by the blurred greenery in the background including some trees and bushes, basking in full daylight.\n\nThe boy is depicted in profile view with his attention focused intently on the bird in his hands. He has light blonde hair and is wearing a green button-down shirt layered over a light-colored T-shirt. His expression is soft and curious as he observes the bird, which appears calm in his grasp.\n\nThe bird seems to be relatively large compared to the boy's hands, with a plump body and a noticeable speckled pattern on its brown and white feathers. It has a stout build with a short beak, suggesting it might be a non-raptorial bird. The bird's eyes are closed or nearly closed, indicating it is either resting or unafraid.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of youthful curiosity and gentle interaction between a human and wildlife. The focus and composition emphasize the interaction, creating an intimate portrait of this moment shared between the boy and the bird.","title":"A young boy tries to save an injured seagull.","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544222","542542","544211","553876","544505","553064","544547","544833","550471","551022","555010","551378","557204","545307","544489","547318"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","boy","grasp","beak","feather","portrait","year","specie","hand","curiosity"]}
