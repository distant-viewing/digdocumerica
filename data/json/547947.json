{"path":"547947.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image displays a scene with earthy textures and muted colors, focusing on a dead bird lying on the ground. The bird, which has white and gray feathers, is on its side with its wings slightly spread. It appears to be in a state of decomposition. Surrounding the bird on the ground are various objects and natural debris: small stones, bits of glass, dried grass, and a rusted, curved metal rod. The environment suggests a nondescript outdoor area, characterized by dirt and sparse vegetation. The overall mood of the photograph is somber, emphasized by the lifelessness of the bird and the dull, natural tones of the surroundings.","title":"Dead gull near entrance to great kills park on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557576","552992","546241","546158","547039","552699","555854","557628","544547","543266","552056","551122","554601","551250","547915","550388"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","feather","wing","rod","dry","bit","spread","lie","state","ground"]}
