{"path":"551473.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate moment between a woman and a young child, framed through a unique perspective which seems to be partially veiled by soft, out-of-focus layers that could represent textiles or other thin materials. The central focus of the image is on the engagement between the two individuals, who are leaning closely together over what appears to be a small fountain or water basin.\n\nThe woman, possibly in her adulthood or senior years, is holding onto the basin and leaning slightly over it. She has short, light-colored hair, and is wearing a sleeveless top with beads or a necklace. There's a gentle expression on her face, indicative of a caring or instructional moment. Opposite her is a young child whose attention is directed towards the water in the basin. The child has light blonde hair and wears a shirt with visible hearts printed on it.\n\nThe setting itself offers few details of their background environment, focusing the viewer entirely on their interaction. The lack of other distinct objects or people gives the scene a serene quality, with the soft, blurred elements framing the two creating an almost dreamlike quality. This photographic choice both isolates and emphasizes the bond between the woman and the child, capturing a moment of connection and discovery. The overall composition with its use of natural light and soft focus surrounds adds to the emotional and artistic quality of the scene.","title":"At the fountain on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["543863","556299","553219","556144","553543","557632","556294","553496","551807","552935","550090","552931","550943","549985","556593","556145"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["basin","child","quality","woman","bond","lean","veil","discovery","necklace","heart"]}
