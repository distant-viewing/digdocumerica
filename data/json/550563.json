{"path":"550563.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a remote industrial site nestled in a dense forest. The vast expanse of greenery suggests the location is probably set in a large wooded area, possibly a forest or wilderness reserve.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a clearing with several industrial structures. The site appears to consist of two main sections, each featuring an assortment of buildings and vehicles. To the left, the larger section includes what looks like warehouses or large workshops and has a significant number of parked vehicles, indicating active usage. There's also a visible helipad, suggesting that the site can be accessed by air.\n\nTo the right, a smaller section includes similar industrial buildings, likely serving operational purposes for the site. A small pond or water body can be seen close to this area, which may serve as a water source for industrial processes or fire safety.\n\nA prominent dirt road snakes around the site, providing access to both sections and leading out toward both edges of the image, hinting at connections to other roads or locations outside the frame. This road appears to be an essential conduit for the logistical operations at the site.\n\nThe surrounding forest is thick and lush, suggesting minimal human intrusion apart from the industrial operation visible. The whole scene is an illustration of industrial activity within a predominantly untouched natural environment, raising possible discussions about the balance between industrial development and environmental conservation.","title":"Five Mile Camp, named for its location five miles north of the Yukon River.
