{"path":"557238.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat eerie and industrial river scene during what appears to be the early hours of evening or during a somewhat dimly lit time of day due to cloud cover or pollution. The setting includes a large, calm body of water with a surface that reflects the overcast sky. Prominently in the foreground, a foamy substance flows from the riverbank into the water.\n\nTo the right side, a figure, possibly a child or a short-statured individual, is seen crouching at the edge of this foamy stream. The person is actively engaged in catching or perhaps releasing this foam using a light-colored container, which can be a plastic jug or a bucket.\n\nThe background features industrial buildings with visible chimneys, suggesting the presence of factories or a similar industrial setup. This setting indicates that the foam could be a byproduct of industrial activity, possibly a form of pollution. The overall scene has a mixture of natural peace and industrial influence, creating a juxtaposition between the calmness of the water and the human impact visible through the foam and industrial architecture.","title":"Employee of the Pennsylvania state department of environmental resources takes a sample of water from an outfall at the irvin works of the united state corporation at West Mifflin near Pittsburgh.
