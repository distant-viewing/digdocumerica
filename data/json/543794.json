{"path":"543794.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged outdoor landscape featuring a field inundated with mud or ash. The foreground shows a patch of grassy vegetation struggling to grow amidst the muddy terrain. The middle ground is dominated by a makeshift irrigation system consisting of a long white pipe supported intermittently by stakes. The pipe has several sprinklers attached, spraying water diagonally across the scene, in an effort to irrigate or cleanse the area.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a broad expanse of similarly affected terrain, deepening in color to a dark gray as it stretches back. The horizon is lined with low hills or mounds. To the left, a glimpse of a water body or wetland area can be seen, providing some natural contrast to the mostly barren, mud-covered landscape. The sky is overcast, enhancing the somber mood of the environment, which appears to be recovering from a significant natural disaster or industrial impact. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of rejuvenation and struggle against adverse conditions.","title":"Irrigation of newly seeded ground on tailings pile, Union Carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["555559","545680","549118","549119","551231","554780","547661","553652","547778","544184","555610","546056","544180","544757","544734","549178"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["mud","pipe","struggle","ash","stake","irrigation","disaster","mound","wetland","terrain"]}
