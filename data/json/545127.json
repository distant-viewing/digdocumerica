{"path":"545127.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large cooling tower at an industrial site. The cooling tower is prominently displayed in the center, characterized by its significant height and funnel-like structure atop a wide, circular base. The outer surface of the tower appears slightly weathered and is made of concrete, marked by vertical streaks.\n\nSurrounding the cooling tower are various elements indicative of an ongoing construction or maintenance project. There are sections of exposed earth, various construction materials, machinery, and temporary structures scattered around the base of the tower. A paved road winds along one side of the tower leading to and from the site, with several trucks and vehicles parked alongside.\n\nThe background of the image features a serene riverscape. A river curves around the site, and lush green trees line the opposite bank, adding a contrasting natural element to the industrial foreground. The water of the river is calm, slightly reflective, and seems to enhance the sense of isolation of the tower from more populated areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a juxtaposition between industrial activity and natural beauty, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the industrial structure within a more serene, natural setting.","title":"The controversial Trojan nuclear power plant on the Columbia River","placename":"Prescott (Or.)","location":"Prescott, Oregon","nn1":["551184","545131","551175","553829","553885","548039","545171","548035","548043","548208","551155","548211","551983","544966","550856","547255"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["tower","site","base","riverscape","funnel","isolation","construction","streak","project","river"]}
