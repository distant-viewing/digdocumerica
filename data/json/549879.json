{"path":"549879.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image captures a busy multilane roadway, seemingly taken from a higher vantage point looking towards traffic flow. The road, populated with vehicles typical of mid to late 20th-century American make, such as sedans and a larger transport van advertising \"Apple Butter,\" suggests a period aesthetic and context. The road is framed by the steel architecture of a large bridge, contributing to a structured urban look. Traffic cones are visible, indicating possible roadwork or a lane partition on the right side of the image.\n\nOverhead, traffic signs are visible. One sign directs towards \"Palisades Parkway Keep Right,\" while an electronic message board instructs drivers to \"MERGE LEFT,\" suggesting some form of disruption or construction modifying regular traffic patterns.\n\nThe photograph has a slight graininess and color saturation typical of film photography from the 1970s or 1980s, reinforcing the historical context of the image. The sky is overcast and the environment appears slightly dim, hinting at either an early morning or an overcast day. There are no visible people or distinct activities other than the movement of the vehicles and the implied guidance of the traffic signs. This urban scene encapsulates a moment of everyday travel, marked by the interactions of transportation infrastructure and vehicle navigation.","title":"On the George Washington Bridge--driving across the Hudson River into New Jersey","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555437","549877","549890","552708","549919","549861","556194","549887","549857","545463","545455","547811","548084","549878","557230","553018"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","instruct","guidance","context","graininess","multilane","partition","vehicle","modify","cone"]}
