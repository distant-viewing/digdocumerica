{"path":"553643.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of intense physical labor in a logging environment. The main subject is a man, dressed in a white t-shirt and gray trousers, deeply engaged in the act of sawing a log with a large, one-man saw. His attire and gear suggest he is prepared for the hard work; he wears protective boots, and notably, his head is covered by a helmet that appears to be an old-style silver hard hat, slightly tilted as he bends over his task.\n\nThe setting is an expansive log yard where numerous cut logs are stacked up in rows in the background under a partly cloudy sky. Dark clouds loom over, yet do not completely obscure the blue sky, indicating variable weather conditions.\n\nThe man's posture shows exertion and focus; he leans forward, using his body weight to push the saw through the wood, which is already partially cut. This snapshot captures a moment typical of logging work, highlighting the physical effort and tools involved in processing timber.\n\nOn the ground surrounding him, wood chips and fragments scattered about indicate recent activity with the logs. The intense light and dynamic cloud formation enhance the dramatic effect of the scene, emphasizing the rugged environment and the tough nature of the task at hand.","title":"In august, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora, California salvage operations on acreage owned by the pickering lumber company of standard, California., began promptly.
