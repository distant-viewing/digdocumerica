{"path":"553206.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a man and a group of pigeons on a large, brick-paved plaza. The bricks are arranged in a concentric circular pattern, adding a structured texture to the expansive, open space. The man, who is dressed in a dark suit with a red tie, is walking across the plaza, looking slightly downward, possibly observing the pigeons or watching his step.\n\nThe pigeons are scattered across the frame, some pecking at the ground while others are walking. The overall mood appears serene and somewhat solitary, given the minimal activity and the vastness of the space surrounding the man and the birds. The lighting is soft, suggesting an overcast sky, which casts an even light without harsh shadows.\n\nThe image is shot from an elevated angle, looking down onto the scene, which emphasizes the isolation of the man and the random distribution of the pigeons. There are no other people or distinct objects in the immediate vicinity, focusing the viewer's attention on this quiet interaction between the man and the birds in this public space.","title":"Strolling among pigeons at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["546618","553292","553218","549742","549757","557208","547196","546759","551856","549988","551801","551858","551798","553176","546535","542542"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","bird","man","space","brick","distribution","tie","vicinity","step","suit"]}
