{"path":"547639.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene wetland scene, characterized by a vibrant blue water surface dotted with numerous dark green lily pads. The middle ground of the image features dense shrubbery and aquatic vegetation that appears lush and healthy, contributing a rich green hue to the otherwise predominantly blue and purple color palette. In the background, the view extends to a broader water body that suggests a lake or a large pond, surrounded by more sparse, dormant vegetation, including some dead trees sticking out of the water, which might indicate a swampy area. The sky is not visible in the image, which places the entire focus on the aquatic landscape and its various elements. The entire scene is immersed in natural daylight, enhancing the vividness of the colors and the peaceful essence of the wetland environment.","title":"The Great Swamp--grasses and lily pads","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["550786","550785","547488","542554","544592","555080","547509","547589","550670","544588","543598","543561","547532","550809","557498","545387"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["wetland","lily","pad","shrubbery","vividness","pond","essence","daylight","vegetation","water"]}
