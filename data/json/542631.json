{"path":"542631.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene featuring a smooth water canal stretching into the distance. The image is taken during the golden hour, giving it a warm tone. The sun is positioned low in the horizon, directly aligned with the canal, creating a beautiful reflection of the sunlight on the water's surface, enhancing the symmetry of the canal's path.\n\nThe surroundings are tranquil, primarily composed of a flat landscape with minimal vegetation. The waterway is bordered on both sides by low banks and sparse foliage. In the far background, there are outlines of distant trees and some minimal infrastructure, possibly telephone poles and wires stretching across the horizon.\n\nThe sky above is clear with a gradient of colors from golden near the horizon to deeper blues above. Tiny specks, possibly dirt on the photograph or small flying insects, are visible in the sky. These elements contribute to a peaceful yet slightly aged look of this picturesque setting, evoking a sense of quiet and simplicity. The overall composition is balanced and draws the viewerâ€™s eye straight down the center of the canal towards the setting sun.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544703","557447","552294","544707","547731","553080","544711","551215","552038","554404","543143","551206","548182","552263","550296","552277"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["canal","horizon","insect","sun","symmetry","telephone","speck","hour","gradient","simplicity"]}
