{"path":"557015.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a somber and impactful scene on a roadside. In the foreground, a dead black cow or calf lies at the edge of a tarmac road, showing visible signs of injury and distress, indicating it may have been struck by a vehicle. Its body is partially on the grassy verge and partially on the road, with clear damage to its limbs.\n\nIn the background, a red truck is captured in motion, blurred as it speeds down the road, moving away from the scene. This likely suggests the ongoing traffic on this road despite the presence of the deceased animal.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the road is a mix of open fields and rolling hills, overcast with a grey sky, enhancing the somber mood of the image. The road appears to be wet, possibly from recent rain, contributing to the bleak and mournful atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition underlines themes of roadkill, depicting the consequences of the interaction between wildlife and roadways. The speeding truck adds a dynamic element to the picture, contrasting with the still and tragic scene in the foreground.","title":"Colt killed on highway #3 at the Clear Creek intersection increased traffic on roads like this is expected when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby.
