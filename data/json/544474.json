{"path":"544474.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of water lilies floating on the surface of a calm body of water. The focus is particularly on several round and oval-shaped lily pads, some of which show rich, reddish-purple tones while others are a vibrant green. The waterâ€™s surface is visible and appears dark and reflective, subtly mirroring the underside of the lily pads.\n\nEach lily pad is distinct in appearance; some have sleek, smooth surfaces, while others have slight ridges or veins that create texture. A few droplets of water rest atop a couple of the pads, reflecting light and accentuating their waxy surface. Additionally, there are bits of debris or tiny particles caught along the edges of some pads.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows and highlights that suggest either early morning or late afternoon sunlight. There's a sense of tranquility and natural beauty conveyed through the interplay of light, texture, and color in the composition.","title":"Lilies","placename":"Tamiami Canal Number C-4 (Fla.)","location":"Tamiami Canal Number C-4, Florida","nn1":["554583","550809","554584","544592","544588","543598","555080","550808","547639","545387","558095","557587","555044","550775","543561","550786"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pad","lily","surface","underside","vein","particle","round","other","droplet","water"]}
