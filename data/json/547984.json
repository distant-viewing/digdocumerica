{"path":"547984.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph presents a scenic aerial view of a coastal town surrounded by a dense expanse of greenery in the foreground. The town occupies the middle ground with an assortment of colorful buildings, some with distinctive steep roofs and others with flat roofs, seemingly residential or possibly small commercial establishments. The town is densely packed but interspersed with patches of trees and open areas that add to the picturesque setting.\n\nIn the background, a large body of water, which appears to be a bay or estuary, dominates the scene. Notably, there are sandy beaches visible along the waterâ€™s edge and a thin strip of land stretching across the bay, which perhaps serves as a natural breakwater. This strip of land has sparsely scattered vegetation and seems to be a barrier between the open sea and the bay. The water itself is calm, with only a few small watercrafts visible at a distance, suggesting a peaceful coastal environment.\n\nThe overall composition is rich in natural colors with a clear contrast between the lush green of the trees, the varied hues of blue in the water, and the sandy browns of the beaches. The setting is serene, offering a snapshot that combines human settlement comfortably nestled within a natural coastal environment.","title":"Sandy Hook from the air","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554143","550363","554102","554057","554058","556953","545121","543427","543423","555688","557453","543362","542910","556979","553778","557429"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bay","town","strip","beach","breakwater","land","roof","settlement","establishment","assortment"]}
