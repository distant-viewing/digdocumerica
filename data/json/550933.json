{"path":"550933.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy beach scene populated with many cars and people, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, judging from the vehicular models and fashion styles. The scene is at a coastal area as evidenced by the sand under the cars and the distant haze that could imply sea mist.\n\nIn the foreground, a makeshift camping spot is set up with a blue tarpaulin and poles, under which several people are sheltering. Under the canopy, a group of individuals are seated around plastic and folding chairs, engaging in conversation or relaxing. Nearby, a woman stands near a makeshift table composed of barrels and planks; she appears to be either cleaning up or preparing food.\n\nThe background is crowded with numerous cars, ranging from sedans to station wagons, tightly parked alongside each other. Many other groups have set up similar canopies or shelters, utilizing parasols and tarps to shade themselves from the sun. The multitude of beach umbrellas and people scattered throughout the area gives the impression of a popular and bustling location for beach-goers to enjoy a sunny day outdoors. The overall atmosphere indicated by the photograph suggests a communal and festive environment, with people gathered for leisure and activity.","title":"Picnic in a car-clearing at Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island.","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["545857","550925","557475","550934","550922","550921","547478","545252","547499","546794","547495","550931","550928","547503","545237","546874"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["beach","canopy","people","goer","car","tarp","multitude","umbrella","camping","shelter"]}
