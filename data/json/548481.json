{"path":"548481.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"In this photograph, an elderly woman wearing a red coat stands staring upwards with her hands gently cupped around her mouth, as if shielding a call or shout. Above her, dominating the upper part of the frame, is a large airplane flying very low. The plane is captured at an angle where two of its jet engines and part of its undercarriage are visible against a light sky.\n\nThe backdrop features leafy green trees in full bloom, suggesting it might be spring or summer. The trees are set against a row of townhouses, typical of urban residential areas. The houses have visible architectural details, such as multiple stories and bay windows but are slightly blurred, placing the focus on the woman and the overhead plane.\n\nThe composition creates a striking juxtaposition between the calm, everyday scene on the ground and the dramatic, unusual proximity of the large airplane. The color palette of the photograph is subdued, with natural tones dominated by the greens of the trees and the red of the woman's coat, contrasting with the more industrial grays and whites of the airplane.","title":"Mary Bruno holds her ears against noise of jet coming in for a landing on runway 15R at Logan Airport. 39 Neptune Road, the Brunos' home, is the white-fronted building in the background.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548484","548485","548469","548446","548448","548447","553888","547247","542577","547231","548486","544606","550156","548881","544491","547824"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","plane","coat","woman","townhouse","jet","engine","bloom","mouth","bay"]}
