{"path":"556950.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a residential street lined with detached houses, captured during a time of day when the lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows cast across the scene. The houses are traditional, featuring front porches and decorated with siding, contrasting trim, and shingled roofs. Each house is accented by small front yards that appear maintained, though not currently lush, suggesting it might be either fall or winter.\n\nA prominent white picket fence runs along the left side of the image, partially enclosing the nearest house and adding a quaint, suburban aesthetic to the scene. The street itself is paved and shows no signs of recent precipitation, and there are no vehicles or people visible, enhancing a sense of quiet and stillness.\n\nUtility poles line the right side of the street, stretching into the distance and connected by wires that draw the eye into the depth of the image toward the vanishing point. The background boasts a clear sky with minimal cloud coverage, further contributing to the crisp lighting and visibility in the photograph. A few bare trees, their branches stark against the sky, suggest the photo is taken in a colder season. The composition and lighting imbue the image with a serene and somewhat nostalgic quality, reflective of a peaceful residential area.","title":"A row of exemplary houses on north wykoff avenue in Bremerton.
