{"path":"546668.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban scene, possibly from the mid-20th century. It shows a street bustling with a mix of transportation and architectural styles that suggest the era. On the left, there is an older model bus, painted with \"BASER\" and scenic artwork, and advertisements that include \"AC Conditioned\" text. To the right, a series of vintage cars are parked or in motion, including a prominent long station wagon and a sedate blue sedan.\n\nIn the background is a large, light-colored building with substantial archways on the ground level and rows of windows above. The facade of this building has a sign that reads \"BOONDOCKS\" above one of the arches, and below it, what appears to be a bar or restaurant entrance labeled \"Boondocks East - West Salon.\" There are other minor signage details that suggest commercial occupancy but aren't clearly readable.\n\nThe image captures a moment in time on an overcast day, possibly early evening, as suggested by the ambient lighting and shadows. There is a large leafy tree partially visible behind the bus, adding a touch of greenery to the urban setting. The composition elements like parked cars, moving traffic, and pedestrians suggest this is a central area in a town or small city. The atmosphere carries a nostalgic air, reflective of everyday life during the period captured.","title":"Blocked intersection becomes instant traffic jam","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556791","547814","556224","550139","556709","545216","549853","551135","551136","549831","549872","557705","554551","547369","546743","549891"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","archway","artwork","restaurant","bar","wagon","advertisement","arch","sedan","park"]}
