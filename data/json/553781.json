{"path":"553781.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and vibrant beach scene. It features several people engaging in various activities in a clear, sparkling turquoise water, possibly on a sunny day, given the bright lighting and the clear sky reflected in the water's surface.\n\nIn the foreground, a small, empty flatbed raft floats on the surface of the water. It appears to have a soft, perhaps cushion-like object laying on it, with a singular pole or stick standing upright from its center.\n\nIn the background, the shallow water extends to a white sandy beach fringed by dense green foliage, providing a natural backdrop and a sense of seclusion. Several people are visible; two individuals, likely adults, are standing and appear to be talking or enjoying the water close to each other, while other individuals are more spread out across the environment, some near the waterâ€™s edge on the beach.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the vibrant color of the sea and the clear blue sky, suggests a leisurely day at a beach destination, offering relaxation and recreation opportunities to visitors. It exemplifies a typical beach outing capturing the interaction between nature and human enjoyment in a serene setting.","title":"Koko Head Park in the Hanauma Bay Marine Life Conservation District is a popular snorkeling and skin diving spot.
