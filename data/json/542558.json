{"path":"542558.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor natural scene featuring a river environment. The foreground and center of the image show a river curving gently through the scene, bordered by a mix of green shrubbery and patches of stony pebble areas. The water appears relatively calm, with a brownish-green hue, reflecting a serene, undisturbed environment.\n\nTo the left and across the river, the bank is somewhat barren, covered with small rocks or pebbles, with sparse greenery emerging between the stones. This barren terrain contrasts with the lush, more densely vegetated areas directly adjacent.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features gently rolling hills with similar vegetation and rocky outcrops. These hills subtly rise from the level of the river, adding a gradual elevation to the scene. On top and across these hills, sparse, small-sized trees can be observed, dotting the terrain with intermittent shades of green.\n\nThe scene is open and expansive, conveying a sense of isolation and tranquility, without any visible human activity or structures that immediately draw attention. It exemplifies a rural or semi-wild environment where the natural landscape predominates. This setup is typical of a natural reserve or a less inhabited rural area, potentially useful for studying environmental conditions or simply for enjoying the natural beauty of an undeveloped river setting.","title":"Clear water of Merced River, showing (in dark circle) a salmon redd (spawning place).
