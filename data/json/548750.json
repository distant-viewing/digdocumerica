{"path":"548750.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"In the photograph, an older model car, appearing to be in a neglected or possibly abandoned state, is positioned in the foreground. The car's paint looks faded, primarily white, and features a visible canvas-like cover, which might suggest it is a convertible model. Its trunk lid is opened and seat headrests or backs can be seen peeping from behind the open trunk.\n\nSurrounding the car is a lush and dense forest, indicative of a tropical or subtropical environment. The forest features a variety of trees, some with noticeably lighter, possibly yellowing foliage, suggesting it might be a seasonal change or a feature of the specific tree species. The sky above is clear and blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, enhancing the vibrant colors of the forest.\n\nOverall, the setting appears to be quite remote, with no signs of urban development or other human activity visible in the image, giving it a somewhat isolated and serene atmosphere. The juxtaposition of a man-made object with the natural environment creates a striking contrast in this scene.","title":"Abandoned car in north key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548751","553008","546405","554920","553002","547747","544641","553010","546406","557116","553007","549107","550795","550797","548752","545540"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["forest","trunk","model","car","lid","canvas","specie","open","yellow","abandon"]}
