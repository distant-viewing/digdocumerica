{"path":"546476.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features the top section of a large, pointed, Gothic-style church roof covered with dark shingles. The architectural design includes a triangular gable with a prominent circular window that is not detailed but clearly visible. The roof is made of two intersecting planes, creating an interesting geometric pattern.\n\nA leaf-bearing tree, possibly in early spring due to its sparse foliage, is positioned in the foreground of the image. The branches of the tree are somewhat bare but have small, young leaves, indicating the onset of a new season. The tree partially obscures the view of the roof, adding a layer of natural texture in contrast to the solid, angular lines of the church roof.\n\nThe color palette of the image consists of muted earth tones. The sky in the background appears overcast, with light diffused evenly across the scene. There is no activity or people in the image; the focus is entirely on the architectural elements and the natural foreground. The composition of the photograph, with the positioning of the tree in front of the architectural structure, creates a serene and somewhat solemn atmosphere, typical of ecclesiastical settings.","title":"First baptist church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546472","557088","557082","550376","546455","558018","557083","558019","554207","546451","546466","558163","556480","552542","557093","558023"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["roof","church","onset","shingles","positioning","plane","gable","tree","leaf","bear"]}
