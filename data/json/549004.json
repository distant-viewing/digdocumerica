{"path":"549004.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a wide aerial view of a large hydroelectric dam and its adjacent areas. In the foreground, a massive dam spans across the image horizontally, partitioning a river from a large reservoir. The water in the reservoir appears calm and reflects the early or late soft light, suggesting the photo was taken around sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe river and reservoir landscapes are interspersed with numerous islands or peninsulas, covered in sparse greenery or shrubland, which add texture and variety to the water's surface. Surrounding the water are rugged, rocky terrains that vary in color from dark to light browns, indicating a possibly arid environment typical of canyon areas.\n\nOn the left side of the dam, there are infrastructure features visible, including roads that run parallel and perpendicular to the dam. These roads connect to various buildings and possibly control stations associated with the dam's operations. The area around the dam includes parked vehicles and small structures, suggesting human activity and operation facilities. To the right, the river continues its course beyond the dam, meandering through the landscape and fading into the mountainous horizon, which is softly silhouetted against a pale blue sky with gentle gradations of color.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the significant human engineering feat of dam construction within a natural, rugged landscape, highlighting both the majesty of nature and the impact of human intervention.","title":"Imperial Dam--on the Colorado River","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548007","548927","548936","548938","548947","548003","548013","548925","548024","544166","548920","548012","548975","551212","549024","548017"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","reservoir","river","partition","gradation","peninsula","parallel","course","operation","intervention"]}
