{"path":"546387.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and tropical setting, likely taken during early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft lighting. It shows a lush landscape dominated by tall palm trees, their fronds silhouetted against a light sky with hints of blue and pink, suggesting either dawn or dusk.\n\nIn the foreground, a crooked palm tree leans dramatically to one side, adding a dynamic element to the composition. Underneath this palm, there is an old, rustic wooden bench that looks handmade, suggesting a place for rest or contemplation within this natural setting. The bench is centrally positioned in the image, inviting the viewer's gaze.\n\nThe background is rich with more densely packed palm trees, creating a thick canopy of leaves overhead. The undergrowth is not very dense, allowing visibility through the trees, enhancing the sense of depth in the scene. The ground is covered with fallen leaves, small plants, and patches of grass, which are illuminated by natural light, giving the scene a vibrant look.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and secluded, evoking a sense of isolation and tranquility, typical of a tropical forest or garden. This image captures the beauty and calmness of a natural retreat, emphasizing the interplay of light, shadow, and organic forms.","title":"On the coast","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["554083","554120","546014","546947","554394","555368","554099","548672","551365","547546","554393","548756","555119","543145","542958","556473"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["palm","bench","handmade","fronds","retreat","undergrowth","calmness","leave","silhouet","contemplation"]}
