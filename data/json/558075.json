{"path":"558075.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is a close-up photograph focusing on a group of vibrant purple aster flowers. Each flower has numerous thin, elongated petals radiating outward from a central disc. The petals are deep purple, fading slightly as they approach the yellow and brown centers which seem to be filled with many small florets. The flowers are in various stages of bloom, some fully open while others are still partially closed.\n\nThe background is soft and out of focus, showing shades of green that suggest a natural, outdoor setting, likely a garden or a wild meadow. The lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon sun, as it casts gentle highlights on the petals and centers of the flowers, enhancing their vivid colors and delicate textures.\n\nThe composition of the image is dense and fills the frame with the floral subjects, creating a lush, textural look that draws the viewer's eye across the various elements of the flowers. The overall feeling is one of natural beauty and tranquility.","title":"Closeup of New England aster (novae anglicae) along Riverview Road at Snowville Road near Brecksville and Cleveland, Ohio. The flowers grow along the rim of the Cuyahoga Valley. The valley is a part of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land located between the metropolitan districts of Akron and Cleveland. Within the valley is the Cuyahoga River and remains of the old Ohio-Erie Canal.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555036","557167","547613","555024","545707","550462","542970","545695","543596","553366","544875","554574","554595","554843","555035","550793"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","radiate","meadow","approach","bloom","close","purple","up","garden"]}
