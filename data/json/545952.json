{"path":"545952.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts two men working within a room filled with electronic equipment. The room appears to be a control room or similar technical setup, suggested by the large racks of equipment featuring various dials, switches, and readouts. On the right, a man in a striped shirt and dark pants is bending over a piece of equipment, focusing on adjusting or examining it. Another man, wearing a cowboy hat and a light-colored trench coat, is sitting to the left, facing a panel that he is operating, possibly adjusting settings or monitoring the system.\n\nThe background shows a large window and a wall clock, indicating the time as approximately 11:06. The lighting is subdued, giving an emphasis on the tasks being performed with an overall tone of serious and concentrated work atmosphere. This setting has a vintage or dated feel, likely depicting a scene from several decades ago judging by the style of the equipment and the men's attire. The image captures a moment of technical operation, likely focusing on communication, broadcasting, or some form of data processing, evident from the complex electronic devices visible.","title":"Technicians work at the data control center for the LIMTV (Linear Induction Motor Test Vehicle).
