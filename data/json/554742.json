{"path":"554742.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image depicts a serene natural setting, featuring a pond surrounded by a meadow of tall, golden grasses. At the center of the photograph, a weathered wood stump stands prominently. The dead tree stump has an intricate form with jagged branches extending out, stark against the softer background. Each detail of the stump and the thin, desiccated branches are reflected clearly and sharply in the calm, blue water of the pond.\n\nThe water itself is a quiet mirror, doubling the image of the stump and the grass around it, creating a symmetrical composition that enhances the tranquility of the scene. The reflection is so vivid that it includes minor details of the stump and the surrounding grass.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright, indicating either a clear day or a time of day when the sun is high, illuminating the scene without obvious shadows. This lighting helps enhance the vividness of the golds and browns in the grass and the deep blues and greys in the water. The clarity of the air and the absence of any people or animals lend a sense of untouched wilderness to the scene.","title":"Large white pine stump in bog in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at Moose River Plains","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["555229","554776","543561","554603","546066","551352","544765","553465","550784","543611","547536","546963","554591","554623","550788","542554"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["stump","grass","pond","branch","meadow","gold","mirror","vividness","detail","clarity"]}
