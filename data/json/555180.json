{"path":"555180.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a natural scene featuring three bracket fungi growing on a vertical charred wood surface, possibly a tree trunk. The fungi appear at different heights along the trunk, with each shelf-like fungal body protruding horizontally. The fungi have textured, slightly irregular upper surfaces that suggest some layers or ridging, colored in shades of brown with lighter edges, possibly indicating age or exposure-related changes.\n\nThe wood itself exhibits a deep black color, indicative of having been burned, with a distinctly rugged and cracked texture that covers the entire background. These cracks vary in size and depth, creating a mosaic of charred wood pieces still adhering to each other despite the evident damage from fire.\n\nThere's a sense of resilience and survival in the scene, as the fungi continue to grow and thrive on the burnt substrate, adding a contrast of life against the backdrop of destruction. The overall composition of the image, with its natural elements and the story of regeneration it suggests, captures a compelling interaction between life forms and their challenging environments.","title":"Fungus growing on a stump burned with slash in a five-year-old clear-cut in olympic national timberland Washington.
