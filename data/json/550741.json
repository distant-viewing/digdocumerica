{"path":"550741.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a vivid view of an industrial scene dominated by a wide, tumultuous river in the foreground and a large red-brick factory building in the background. The river has a brownish hue with a sizeable white and foamy waterfall close to the bottom of the frame, creating a dynamic and chaotic texture in the water. The building in the background is identified with a prominent signage bearing the name \"Auerbach Shoe Company\" spanning the width of the center portion on the roof. This building exhibits characteristics typical of early 20th-century industrial architecture, including uniform rows of windows and distinct segmented sections for different operational needs. The area immediately surrounding the factory appears lush with greenery, indicating a riverside location. The overcast sky suggests a gloomy or rainy day, contributing to the dark and moody atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Androscoggin river falls viewed from the Brunswick-topsham bridge","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550673","550710","550854","548061","557295","546705","553462","553393","551156","554630","550818","550332","550856","557376","550684","552070"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["factory","rainy","foamy","gloomy","width","spann","need","identify","riverside","waterfall"]}
