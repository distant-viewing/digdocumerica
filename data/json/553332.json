{"path":"553332.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"In the photograph, a person is engaged in an outdoor activity by a river. The individual is partially visible from the back and side, focusing on their task. They wear a light-toned, long-sleeved jacket, brown gloves, and yellow pants. A strap crosses over their torso, possibly attached to a bag that isn't fully visible.\n\nThe person is managing a large net that is halfway submerged in the water, containing several fish caught from the river. The fish appear to be hanging and dripping water, suggesting they were recently scooped up from the river.\n\nThe background consists of a flowing river with white water ripples, indicating a moderate current. There are some bushes and trees along the riverbank, which are not in full focus, providing a natural outdoor setting.\n\nThe lighting is natural, with the sun illuminating the scene and enhancing the details of the water, the person's activity, and the surrounding environment. The composition captures a moment of interaction between the individual and the natural environment, highlighting an aspect of river or stream activity possibly related to fishing or ecological research.","title":"Water diversions of all kinds are enjoyed in the fresh, clean waters of the squannacook river.
