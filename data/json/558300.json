{"path":"558300.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Villalobos, Horacio","caption":"This photograph captures a residential scene from a mobile home park. The setting includes several mobile homes lined up side by side, each with a different color scheme, such as white with green trim, beige, and muted brown. In front of these homes, there is a row of 1970s era cars parked perpendicular to the camera's viewpoint. The cars showcase a variety of vibrant colors, including yellow, white, dark red, and dark blue, and they appear to represent typical American car designs of that era with long hoods and large trunks.\n\nThe environment is well-maintained, with short grass visible in the foreground and part of a paved road curving through the scene. No people are visible in the image, giving it a quiet, uninhabited feel. In the distance, there are bare trees and a hill, suggesting the location is in a valley or a rural area with rolling hills. The sky is clear, contributing to a calm and peaceful day. The scene appears to be captured during the late fall or early spring, as indicated by the lack of leaves on the trees and the overall dormant vegetation.","title":"Mobile homes in one of two Mobile home parks.
