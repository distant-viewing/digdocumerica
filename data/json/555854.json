{"path":"555854.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"In the photograph, a pair of gloved hands is shown holding a heavily tarnished and decomposing bird carcass. The hands wear leather work gloves, hinting at some sort of manual or fieldwork, likely related to environmental or animal study. The bird, with its feathers clotted and skin darkened, possibly due to exposure to an oily or polluted substance, appears lifeless and is held up against the sky, emphasizing its dire condition. The background is somewhat blurred, but light blue skies and faint natural elements can be discerned, suggesting an outdoor setting, likely near a body of water given the context of the bird's condition. This image might capture a moment from an environmental study or pollution assessment activity, illustrating the impact of contaminants on wildlife.","title":"Dead duck pulled from a five-acre pond filled with acid water, oil, and acid clay sludge. Unwary animals which came to the pond and were covered with the liquid were unable to survive. It was cleaned up under supervision of EPA.
