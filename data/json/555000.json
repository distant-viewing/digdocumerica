{"path":"555000.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense, lush forest scene predominant with various shades of green. In the foreground, a large tree trunk with deeply textured bark is prominently displayed. This trunk has a slight lean and is covered in patches of green moss, suggesting a moist, temperate environment. Out of this tree trunk grows a limb or smaller trunk that arcs gracefully to the right, also cloaked in a thick layer of moss.\n\nSurrounding the base of the tree are lush, green vegetation, including several types of ferns with vibrant and intricate leaves, adding to the richness of the woodland floorâ€™s texture. Small, broad-leaf plants can also be seen peppering the forest floor.\n\nIn the background, the scene remains heavily wooded with numerous other trees visible; these trees also exhibit rough, moss-covered barks and are enveloped in a somewhat misty ambiance, possibly indicative of a recent rain or a naturally foggy environment. This backdrop creates a serene and somewhat mystical atmosphere, typical of a mature, temperate rainforest. There is a notable absence of human activity or artificial structures, enhancing the sense of natural solitude and untouched wilderness in the photograph.","title":"Spruce more than 400 years old growing from a nurse log ground cover includes salal, bead ruby, braken and western sword/fern on a strip near the ocean in the pacific coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554975","555057","554958","545271","554999","554961","554972","555058","545285","555054","555043","554992","542958","554977","554957","547011"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","bark","moss","floor","rainforest","cloak","limb","arc","tree","richness"]}
