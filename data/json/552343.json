{"path":"552343.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil sailing scene during what appears to be sunset. The sailboat is shown in profile, gracefully gliding over calm water. The boat features a large sail that fills most of the frame, a spinnaker, which is partly inflated and displays bold colorsâ€”red at the bottom and white at the top with a graphical silhouette of a bird in black.\n\nThe main sail of the boat is mostly white and has some markings, including \"SLOEJ 39012\" near its top, and other smaller alphanumeric codes above a triangular logo towards the bottom of the sail. The hull of the boat is dark, contrasting with the gentle, orange-tinged light reflected in the water.\n\nOn board the boat, there appear to be at least two people managing the sails. The environment suggests calm weather with very light winds, considering the partial inflation of the spinnaker and smooth water surface. The background is subtly detailed, featuring a low horizon line that might faintly show some land or treeline, hinting at a large lake or calm sea area. The overall ambiance is peaceful, highlighted by the warmth of the setting sun casting soft colors over the scene.","title":"Competitor in an evening sailboat race on Puget Sound held by members of the Tacoma Yacht Club.
