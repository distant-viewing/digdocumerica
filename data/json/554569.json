{"path":"554569.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a signpost surrounded by large boulders. The sign itself is titled \"State Land\" and marked with the dates 1885 and 1935. It also reads, \"Leaving Forest Preserve. Acquired 1885 to 1925. A part of 2,370,000 acres of wild forest maintained for free public use.\" The background includes a dense tree line, suggesting that this sign marks the boundary of a forested area. The foreground is a gravelly surface with sparsely growing green plants, indicating a well-maintained trail or clearing. The sign is mounted on a single metal pole, and the overall setting appears to be a remote or rural area designated for public access and recreation.","title":"New York State highway sign describing the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548845","554038","548846","543724","544136","548836","554693","543637","543115","545045","544913","542789","544297","544522","547854","547850"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["signpost","date","sign","boulder","recreation","clearing","trail","boundary","access","pole"]}
