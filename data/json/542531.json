{"path":"542531.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a large accumulation of old and used tires piled up haphazardly in an open area. The tires vary in sizes and types, indicating they may have come from different vehicles such as cars, trucks, and possibly heavy machinery. The patterns on the tires suggest various states of wear, with some showing significant tread wear and others appearing less worn.\n\nThe scene is captured under bright daylight, casting strong shadows and highlights on the textured surfaces of the rubber, emphasizing the depth and density of the pile. The background is not visible due to the high pile of tires filling the entire frame. The color scheme is primarily black and shades of gray from the rubber, punctuated by the natural, stark light.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of abandonment or disposal, possibly indicating a dump site or recycling facility where these tires are collected for processing or environmental management.","title":"Burning of tire dump creates smoke hazard","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["547986","555521","549776","549773","543559","557973","546893","547517","546022","554335","554300","554320","552738","554334","549023","542656"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["tire","rubber","pile","recycl","disposal","dump","collect","trucks","accumulation","scheme"]}
