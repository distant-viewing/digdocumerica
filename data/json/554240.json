{"path":"554240.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a lively winter scene likely at a ski resort. The setting shows a group of skiers and a row of parked buses, most prominently on the right side, where a bus has several pairs of skis leaning against it. The skis are colourful and varied in design. The bus has a hint of snow on its bottom edges, complementing the wintry environment.\n\nThe people in the image are dressed in typical skiing attire of the time, such as colourful puffer jackets and knit hats, indicative of fashion from the mid-20th century. They are on a snow-covered ground, standing in line or moving about casually, some holding their ski poles. They appear to be either preparing for a day on the slopes or returning from skiing.\n\nIn the background, mountain slopes are faintly visible, bathed in sunlight and covered in snow, which suggests a cold but clear day. Also, there's a wooden railing that runs parallel to the line of people, possibly part of a queue system for the bus or a lift station leading to ski areas. The overall mood is bustling yet orderly, capturing a common scene in ski resorts during peak season.","title":"A free bus shuttles skiers between the Aspen and Snowmass ski areas.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554282","554262","554263","554238","554244","554235","554276","554242","554245","554279","554239","554275","554237","554243","554285","554234"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","bus","skiing","resort","snow","slope","skier","return","knit","lift"]}
