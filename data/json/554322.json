{"path":"554322.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image captures a moment during an indoor event, likely a conference, seminar, or lecture, given the setting. The photograph focuses on two men seated among an audience. \n\nThe man on the left is captured in mid-gesture, his fist held near his mouth, suggesting deep thought or concentration. He wears glasses and a patterned, button-up shirt. His tousled hair and focused expression contribute to a portrayal of engagement or perhaps skepticism towards the event.\n\nThe second man, to the right of the first, appears somewhat disenchanted or weary. His gaze is directed straight ahead, possibly at a speaker or presentation out of the frame. He wears a striped button-up shirt and a narrow tie, which, alongside his stern expression, adds to his no-nonsense demeanor.\n\nThe overall lighting of the photo is moody and dim, highlighting the subjects' faces in a soft glow while the background audience is less distinct, blurred and shadowy, emphasizing the depth of the room and the focus on the two main subjects.\n\nThis setting and the expressions of the participants convey a quiet intensity common in academic or professional environments where attention and contemplation are required.","title":"Citizens' meeting on transportation: a forum on \"Strategies for Clean Air\" put forth by New York City EPA","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557037","558393","557703","555234","557038","547367","555233","557856","556450","554332","557907","557033","557894","546550","557152","544318"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["audience","button","expression","subject","speaker","event","presentation","portrayal","require","participant"]}
