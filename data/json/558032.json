{"path":"558032.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an architectural study of a large, majestic building, likely historic, characterized by traditional design elements. It features a prominent wood-paneled structure painted in a subdued, light color, possibly white or pale gray. Notable architectural features include a variety of multi-pane windows, some of which are visible across different sections of the building.\n\nThe focal point is the elegant, octagonal bell tower that adorns the top, which is capped with a steep, pointed black roof contrasted by ornamental white details around the edges. It is visible behind the primary facade, indicating it may be centrally located within the building's layout. The bell tower appears to have openings with curved arches, typical of traditional Western architectural designs, and might house a bell visible through these arches.\n\nThe facade of the building includes an asymmetrical roofline with multiple gables and possibly dormer windows. The slightly slanted main roof suggests an old-style construction, complemented by a large chimney that is not entirely visible in the image. The grounds surrounding the building feature well-maintained grassy areas, some flowering plants, and mature trees, with autumn colors visible in the leaves.\n\nAn understated lamp post and a variety of shrubs, including a bush with red berries, are visible in front of the building, contributing to the serene and well-maintained ambiance of the scene. The building itself is marked with a sign that reads \"Vershire Town Offices,\" indicating its use as a municipal office which possibly retains historic importance in the community. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, rural setting with a focus on preserving historical architecture.","title":"Grange hall, located adjacent to the Boston township building in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
