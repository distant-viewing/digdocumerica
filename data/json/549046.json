{"path":"549046.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an agricultural scene centered around a man operating a large farming combine. The man, dressed in a traditional cowboy outfit including a wide-brimmed hat and a plaid shirt, is shown standing on the combine. He sports a red neck scarf which adds a pop of color to his attire. The operator appears engaged in adjusting or operating the machinery, with his focus directed towards the mechanics of the combine.\n\nThe combine itself is predominantly red and marked with the brand name \"CASE\" along its side, indicating the manufacturer. This specific model is identified with the number \"1060\". The machine is at work in a field, actively harvesting, as illustrated by the dust and debris visibly being thrown into the air around it, adding a dynamic quality to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense crop of golden wheat underscores the agricultural purpose of the scene. The background is faint but suggests a rural, possibly mountainous landscape with clear skies, contributing an expansive feel to the image. The overall atmosphere is one of hard work and productivity within a rustic, rural setting.","title":"Harvesting wheat in the Palo Verde Valley, 200 yards from the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548874","548876","548981","547734","548982","548976","549051","555619","548985","547730","547432","548964","549259","554203","549036","554204"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["combine","operate","wheat","case","productivity","mechanic","operator","pop","throw","scarf"]}
