{"path":"547044.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph displays a tranquil yet somewhat eerie seaside scene under what appears to be twilight lighting. The image captures the shimmering surface of a large body of water, which could likely be a sea, stretching into the horizon.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two prominent, leafless trees silhouetted against the water, framing the scene with their bare branches. Between these trees, there are remnants of an old wooden dock or pier. Several vertical posts remain, some still upright while others lean or have fallen, suggesting decay or damage. These structures cast shadows and add to the sense of quiet desolation.\n\nVisible on the shore is a small boat, also in silhouette, contributing to the nautical theme of the image. The ground is not clearly visible, but there seems to be a mixture of sandy areas and patches with scrub and underbrush.\n\nThe sky is a deep, dark blue, likely indicating either early morning or late evening light, with no visible clouds. The overall mood is serene yet melancholic, with the natural and man-made elements together evoking a feeling of solitude and the passage of time.","title":"Crumpled home in Zion, on Lake Michigan shore--aftermath of severe storm","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["542993","552142","552225","545911","543016","548241","552311","547143","557255","554147","543119","550777","547057","551311","543133","551312"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["scrub","desolation","damage","passage","remnant","mixture","pier","twilight","post","dock"]}
