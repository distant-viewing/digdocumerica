{"path":"552200.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showcasing a busy industrial port area. The image captures a portside scene dominated by a variety of operational and logistical elements typical of a shipping and cargo handling facility.\n\nIn the foreground, there are extensive piles of timber organized in neat rows, covering a significant portion of the area. This suggests the port may specialize in the timber trade, possibly involving the import or export of wood products.\n\nSeveral warehouse-like structures are visible next to the timber storage areas, likely used for storing goods and equipment necessary for port operations. A network of roads provides access throughout the facility, allowing for the movement of vehicles and machinery.\n\nAdjacent to the warehouses, two large cargo ships are docked at the waterfront. They are positioned alongside what appears to be cargo handling infrastructure, including cranes and possibly conveyor belts, indicating ongoing loading or unloading activities.\n\nFurther down the pier, another ship is moored, and additional cranes are visible, which helps illustrate the scale and capacity of the port's operations.\n\nThe broader setting includes a calm body of water surrounding the port, enhancing the strategic location necessary for such a facility, conducive to shipping and receiving goods. The overall composition of the photograph, with crisp details and a top-down perspective, effectively presents the complexity and industrious nature of a functioning port.","title":"Log storage at port of olympia.
