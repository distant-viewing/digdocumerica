{"path":"543581.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene woodland scene. The setting is lush with various shades of green, highlighted by sunlight filtering through the foliage. In the foreground, we see a patch of vibrant green grass peppered with yellow-green highlights, suggesting it might be sunlit or reflecting light. A small group of young, thin trees occupies the central area of the view; these trees have bright green leaves, which indicates it could be spring or early summer.\n\nThe background features denser, darker woods, providing a rich contrast to the brighter trees in the front. This darker area seems to absorb most of the sunlight, creating deep shadows which add a sense of depth and mystery to the scene. The overall composition is balanced, with the lighter, sunlit area creating a natural focal point amidst the surrounding darker tones.\n\nNo human activity is visible in the scene, emphasizing a natural, untouched aspect of the environment. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, suggesting a secluded location, possibly in a forest or a nature reserve.","title":"Meadow","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["555116","547643","545488","550791","554425","558012","555216","543615","558082","554718","555118","554393","547011","554394","558088","546947"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["darker","woods","pepper","lighter","reserve","absorb","denser","mystery","reflec","sunlit"]}
