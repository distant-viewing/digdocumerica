{"path":"544679.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and picturesque natural landscape that appears to be a large body of water, possibly a salt lake or an inlet, characterized by its shimmering surface under a soft, ambient light. The water exhibits varying shades of purple, pink, and blue, reflecting the light from the sky. These hues create beautiful, almost painterly stripes across the composition, highlighting the texture of the water's surface.\n\nThe foreground of the image does not contain any objects or activities, focusing solely on the natural scenery. Layered textures visible on the surface suggest gentle movements in the water. In the middle distance, there is a clear horizontal line where the water meets the sky, adding a sense of vastness and depth to the view. This line is slightly obscured by atmospheric haze, which gives the image a gentle, dreamlike quality.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains or landforms can be seen under a muted sky, which has a soft gradient from light violet near the horizon to deeper shades of blue above. The gentle illumination, combined with calm water and the distant silhouette of the mountains, creates a serene and contemplative atmosphere, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet and isolated beauty of this scene.","title":"Sunset on the leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["542994","555717","552916","544725","550735","557000","552894","552336","550391","549446","543058","549445","543643","544683","552904","552237"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","violet","inlet","appreciate","salt","surface","landform","mountain","obscured","illumination"]}
