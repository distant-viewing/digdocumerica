{"path":"547774.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a highway where the main focus is on a cement mixer truck in the foreground. The truck is mostly white, with visible dirt and wear, indicating frequent use. It has a large cylindrical mixing drum, which is central to its function, and other intricate machinery visible at the back, perhaps for loading and unloading cement.\n\nThe mixer is driving on what appears to be a broad, multiple-lane highway. The road curves gently to the right, with several other vehicles visible in the scene: cars and another large truck are seen driving in adjacent lanes. The image also shows a partly cloudy sky above, with puffy, white cumulus clouds set against a bright blue sky, conveying a daytime setting.\n\nIn the background, there are overpasses and bridges indicating a complex highway interchange. The infrastructure includes several layers of roadways stacked above each other, with various vehicles traveling across them. This suggests a well-developed, urban or suburban area.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, shot from a position close to the road surface, emphasizes the scale and presence of the cement mixer and creates a dynamic scene of everyday traffic and industrial activity. No people are discernible in the image, focusing all attention on the vehicles and the road infrastructure.","title":"Cement mixer travels east on l.b.j.
