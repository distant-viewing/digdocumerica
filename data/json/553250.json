{"path":"553250.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, outdoor scene involving several individuals engaged in an art installation or interactive activity involving large, geometric structures made of yellow canes or tubes, arranged to form a sphere-like shape. The focus of the image is on a man with a beard and a woman with long hair, positioned on opposite sides of one of these sphere-like structures. The man appears to be in his mid-30s and is wearing a brown T-shirt, while the woman, also appearing to be in her mid-30s, wears a light-colored top.\n\nBehind the central figures, other participants can be seen. One individual, partially visible in the background, wears a blue shirt and another, a woman, has an embroidered white blouse. The setting appears to be a sunny day, possibly in a public square or park, given the presence of trees and wooden structures that resemble market booths in the distance. The atmosphere is casual and the event seems to gather a crowd engaged in either constructing or interacting with the installation. The slightly faded quality of the photograph suggests it might be from a few decades ago, giving it a vintage feel.","title":"August brings the \"D'aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'aug Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
