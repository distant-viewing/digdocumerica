{"path":"552367.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a technology-laden vehicle or mobile workspace. The inside is crowded with various electronic equipment which include several racks filled with electronic devices featuring dials, gauges, wires, and screens. These devices are likely used for monitoring, data recording, or communication purposes, given their complex and industrial appearance.\n\nA man is partially visible at the far end of the vehicle, working or adjusting one of the machines. He is engrossed in his task, paying close attention to the equipment in front of him. The man wears a dark, long sleeve shirt, emphasizing his professional engagement with the technology.\n\nThe floor of the space is visible with scattered objects including papers, tools, possibly a reel of film or tape, and other miscellaneous items indicating active use and an operational environment. Natural light comes in from an open door or hatch, where the outdoors with trees and a natural setting is glimpsed, providing a contrasting backdrop to the technical and mechanical interior.\n\nThe intricate setup inside the vehicle suggests that this may be a mobile operation center for either broadcasting, surveillance, scientific research, or some sort of technical field work. The image captures a moment of concentration and practical engagement with sophisticated technology, set in a potentially remote location.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552380","549367","549378","551902","542765","551905","548880","542668","552382","551916","557851","547720","549625","551901","542659","551903"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["technology","device","engagement","interior","hatch","laden","recording","surveillance","reel","pay"]}
