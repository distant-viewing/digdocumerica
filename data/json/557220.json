{"path":"557220.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph showcases an industrial scene, captured from a distance and elevated vantage point. In the foreground, a series of barren trees line the top of a hill, indicating perhaps a winter setting as the trees are devoid of leaves. These trees serve as a stark contrast to the industrial activities occurring in the background.\n\nThe midground and background of the photo reveal a large industrial facility comprising numerous structures, including multiple large buildings and possibly silos. A prominent feature of the photo is a tall, cylindrical structure emitting a thick plume of smoke or steam, which rises prominently against the murky sky. This suggests the image is likely capturing some form of manufacturing or power generation process.\n\nAmbient lighting is dim and the overall color tones are cool, enhancing the industrial chill of the setting. The photo appears to be taken on either an overcast day or during twilight hours, which contributes to the somewhat bleak and moody aesthetic. A body of water and additional industrial infrastructure are faintly visible in the far background, suggesting the facility is located near a river or port, typical for industries requiring bulk transportation of materials.\n\nThe image is overall quite atmospheric, perhaps serving as a commentary on environmental impact, industrialization, or the stark beauty of human-made landscapes.","title":"Pollution hangs in the air over a United States Steel Corporation coke plant at Clairton, Pennsylvania, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh.
