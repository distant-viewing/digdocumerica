{"path":"550352.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental pollution where a large amount of assorted debris and waste is scattered alongside a body of water, likely a lake or river. The foreground is heavily littered with a variety of discarded items including rusted metal objects, broken furniture, miscellaneous household waste, and scattered natural debris such as branches and leaves.\n\nThe setting is a natural environment with dense forests surrounding the water body. The trees are mostly conifers and appear lush, contrasting starkly with the polluted area in the foreground. This juxtaposition highlights the impact of human waste on natural settings.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo suggests neglect and the adverse effects of improper waste disposal, creating a powerful visual statement about environmental degradation. The water body, which might once have been pristine, is now edged with rubbish, suggesting the creeping spread of human impact. The lighting and mood are somewhat somber, with overcast skies or the onset of dusk, enhancing the sense of deterioration and neglect.","title":"Town dump at Pembroke","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["551440","550687","547525","552080","555228","550800","552811","551247","547524","547907","550812","552098","552089","545945","556419","547897"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","neglect","onset","statement","rubbish","deterioration","impact","household","spread","conifer"]}
