{"path":"551192.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph features an aerial view of a large industrial complex situated beside a river. The complex is densely packed with numerous buildings, including long warehouses and tall, narrow structures likely to be smokestacks, from which white and gray smoke is billowing. This smoke blends into the sky, creating a hazy effect.\n\nThere's a visible contrast in the image where the industrial area meets the natural environment. Beyond the complex, the river is calm and reflects some of the structures. Opposite the complex, a lush green forested hill rises steeply. The hill is crisscrossed with what appears to be trails or small roads, and there are a few isolated structures among the trees. The topography suggests a juxtaposition of heavy industry with natural elements, emphasizing the encroachment of industrial development on the surrounding landscape.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, accentuating the focus on the infrastructure and environmental elements. The overall composition draws attention to the industrial activity and its environmental context, with an emphasis on the scale and impact of the industrial operations along the riverbank.","title":"Dupont Belle works on the kanawha river at Belle","placename":"Charleston (W.
