{"path":"556969.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view over a rural landscape rich in greenery and scattered residential areas. At the forefront, the image captures a series of tree-lined roads separating properties, each featuring houses with neat yards. Fields and patches of dense forest intermix throughout the scene, emphasizing a blend of structured residential living and natural environments.\n\nTo the middle-left of the photo, a sizeable cleared area, possibly a farming field or park, dominant with lighter green compared to the surrounding darker forested regions. Notably, a large rectangular sports field, possibly for soccer or baseball, is visible within this expanse, marked by the clearer boundary lines and the absence of any tall vegetation.\n\nThe background stretches out to a vast forest area that eventually meets a large body of water, creating a striking natural border. This body of water extends horizontally across the image and fades into the distance, implying a significant landscape feature in the region. From the perspective of the photograph, one can also discern smaller pathways or rural roads weaving through the trees and fields, integrating the various elements of this picturesque area.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively showcases a serene blend of human habitation and the expansive natural beauty typical of rural or semi-rural environments.","title":"Aerial view of the central valley quadrangle which is bounded by tracyton, illahee, brownsville and silverdale.
