{"path":"556171.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate and tender moment between a couple and their small dog. The couple is seated next to a window, allowing natural light to illuminate the scene. The man is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved polo shirt and dark trousers, while the woman wears a sleeveless cream top and a bright pink skirt. Both appear relaxed and affectionate, with the woman embracing the dog and resting her head against the man’s shoulder, who in turn gently holds the dog’s paw.\n\nThey are seated on a dark blue couch, with a textured throw blanket beneath them, adding a cozy touch to the setting. Visible through the window beside them is a narrow view of the street below where a car is parked. The overall ambiance of the photograph is one of warmth and casual comfort, suggesting a quiet and peaceful moment in their home. The background is simple and unobtrusive, ensuring the focus remains on the couple and their interaction with the pet.","title":"Black couple and their dog in their apartment in South Side Chicago.
