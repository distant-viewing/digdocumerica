{"path":"547078.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring a large pile of black coal. The coal is positioned next to a brick wall on which the word \"COAL\" is prominently displayed in white capital letters. At the right side of the image, a metal shovel with a wooden handle is propped against the coal pile, suggesting recent or ongoing work involving the coal.\n\nThe background includes parts of industrial or storage buildings, with visible windows and metallic elements. The setting appears to be a storage or supply area for coal, likely associated with an industrial or utility facility given the organized and functional layout.\n\nThe composition utilizes natural lighting, which creates sharp contrasts and highlights the textures of the coal and bricks. The focus and depth of field emphasize the rough textures of the materials and give a stark, utilitarian feel to the scene. The tone and elements of the photograph suggest it might be related to themes of energy, industry, or manual labor.","title":"Coal is delivered to rogers park, north side Chicago","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557403","555591","544386","549243","543642","547108","551043","556520","544375","551036","551039","556349","551040","554632","553013","556602"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["coal","supply","brick","pile","capital","storage","prop","shovel","utilize","word"]}
