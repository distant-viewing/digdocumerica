{"path":"545331.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene likely from an older urban neighborhood. Three main subjects dominate the foreground. To the left, a woman with long black hair wearing a bright yellow blouse and blue jeans is seen in profile as she walks past the camera. In the center, a shirtless young man with dark hair and shorts glances towards the camera with a somewhat guarded expression. To the right, another man is seated on a car. He also has long dark hair and is dressed in a white shirt, gesticulating with his left hand, possibly in conversation.\n\nThe background consists of a stretch of locally styled two-story buildings, appearing slightly run-down with visible wear and graffiti on certain walls. On the street, a few more people are seen engaging in various activities; for instance, a child is bending over near a car while another young person is seated in the distance.\n\nA pale blue early-model car is visible to the far left of the image. The street itself is littered with small debris, emphasizing a sense of everyday life. The setting sun casts long shadows and bathes the scene in a soft, dimming light, possibly indicating the time as early evening.\n\nOverall, the mood exudes a raw, candid feel, capturing a moment of daily life in a community setting. The architectural style, informal attire of the subjects, and the condition of the buildings suggest the photograph might be from a working-class area, possibly in the mid-late 20th century.","title":"El paso's second ward, a chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["545351","545350","548452","555905","551124","545326","555904","549916","555909","555895","552971","552965","551835","556214","551129","545353"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["hair","street","littered","sty","working","instance","car","glance","subjects","class"]}
