{"path":"548832.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and minimalist scene during what appears to be dusk, due to the orange and red hues that dominate the image. A single bird, possibly a wading species such as a sandpiper or similar, is standing in shallow water. The bird is silhouetted against the colorful glow of the background, emphasizing its delicate features and elongated beak, from which a small droplet is visible, suggesting the bird may have been feeding or drinking.\n\nThe environment around the bird is tranquil, with the surface of the water reflecting the birdâ€™s silhouette and contributing to the calm, almost mirror-like quality of the scene. The gradient background transitioning from a deep red near the top to a lighter orange near the bottom adds a warmth to the image, enhancing the sense of a peaceful twilight.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on simplicity and the natural beauty of the moment, capturing a quiet interaction between nature and light. The framing and focus on the bird amidst such a vast expanse of color create a strong visual impact, drawing attention to the subtle details of the bird and its reflection.","title":"Marshland fowl at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["550388","557495","553777","543063","557448","547726","553776","550387","551378","543922","543918","554069","547744","544539","547318","545991"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","beak","droplet","mirror","warmth","specie","framing","twilight","simplicity","glow"]}
