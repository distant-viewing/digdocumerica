{"path":"543919.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a lively classroom scene, presumably from a school setting in the mid-to-late 20th century given the style of clothing and decor. In the foreground, a group of at least seven students is gathered around a large rectangular piece of fabric or paper laid out on the floor. The majority of these students appear to be engaged actively in creating or completing an art project or a poster, which contains visible texts and graphics, including what appears to be a figure or silhouette painted in black, red, and white colors with accompanying text.\n\nThe art piece they are working on seems to feature a chaotic decoration, possibly involving papier-mâché or crumpled pieces of paper, as it's littered with white crumpled paper across its surface. These students, both boys and girls, exhibit various focused expressions and are dressed in typical casual attire of the period, such as t-shirts, dresses, and blouses.\n\nAround these children, the classroom is filled with other students who are seated at traditional school desks equipped with chairs, engaged in different activities. Some students seem to be watching the group on the floor, while others are occupied with their own tasks, possibly related to reading or writing.\n\nIn the background, educational posters can be seen on the walls, alongside other typical classroom decorations and materials that suggest a vibrant learning environment. There's an adult, presumably a teacher, standing at the back of the room, overseeing the activities. \n\nOverall, the photograph provides a snapshot of an interactive and dynamic educational environment where students are participating in hands-on learning activities.","title":"Public school students work on ecology project","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543920","546548","552946","548243","554838","544322","553269","544798","558214","558212","554332","548227","543928","551719","545547","544314"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["student","classroom","paper","poster","school","art","decoration","piece","teacher","text"]}
