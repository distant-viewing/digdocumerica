{"path":"553123.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures the facade of a two-story motel with a flat, straightforward architecture characteristic of many mid-20th century buildings. The structure consists of two levels of rooms, each with a balcony lined with simple white railings. The doors to the rooms are orange and each door features the room number prominently displayed in black. Above each door, there are individual air conditioning units. The windows next to the doors are curtained, and there's little other visible decoration or furniture on the balconies, suggesting a functional, budget-focused design.\n\nAt the top of the building is a modest-sized sign with the name \"Harrah's\" in capitalized letters, indicating the establishment is likely affiliated with or operated by the Harrah's brand, which is known for its casinos and resorts. The background is a clear, deep blue sky, highlighting the unadorned, utilitarian style of the building and giving the image a bright, airy feeling. The focus is solely on the motel's exterior, with no distractions or extraneous elements, emphasizing the architecture and layout of the motel.","title":"'Reno motel'","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["557660","554550","554183","549008","547799","549017","553119","549025","547790","556766","545881","545334","545359","557661","556420","553139"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["motel","door","room","balcony","capitalize","conditioning","distraction","resort","architecture","black"]}
