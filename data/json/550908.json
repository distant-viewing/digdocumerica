{"path":"550908.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image shows a large number of Volkswagen Beetles densely parked in a car lot. The cars are predominantly older models of the Beetle, characterized by their famous rounded shapes and rear engines. The scene is likely taken during daylight given the bright lighting and shadows underneath the cars. A diverse range of colors is visible among the cars, including shades of green, blue, red, grey, and beige.\n\nThe photograph is taken from an elevated angle, providing a slightly top-down view that showcases the curves and lines of the vehicles' roofs and bodies. The cars are closely packed, with each row tightly lined up against the next, accentuating the uniformity and mass production aspect of this vehicle model.\n\nThere's no visible activity or people in the photograph; it strictly captures a still moment of these iconic cars gathered in vast numbers. The background is minimal and primarily consists of the tops of the cars in the foreground, creating a repetitive pattern that draws the eye across the photograph. The visual effect is one of texture and rhythm created by the repeating shapes and varying colors of the Beetles.","title":"Shipment of autoMobiles on dock at the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550909","542634","542637","542638","553896","546813","542817","547742","547480","551912","546879","546900","542635","549696","553303","547686"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","model","number","rhythm","repeat","uniformity","mass","shape","engine","production"]}
