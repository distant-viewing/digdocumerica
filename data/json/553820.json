{"path":"553820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic, moody landscape at, presumably, dusk or dawn. The primary focus is a silhouette of a hill against a dark, overcast sky. On the hill's crest, a fencing line, constructed with repetitive wooden fence posts and strung with wired fencing, follows the hill's contours. To the left side of the image, there is a vehicle, also in silhouette, which could either be parked or in motion moving up or down the slope.\n\nThe sky is a gradient of dark blues and greys, blending into an ethereal light blue at the horizon, suggesting either the sun is setting or that a storm could be approaching. Power lines on the right-hand side of the image follow the hillâ€™s slope and extend into the distance, emphasizing the depth and open expansiveness of the scene. \n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of isolation and a slight melancholy, enhanced by the low lighting and vast, empty landscapes aside from the small, lone vehicle and fence line. The scenery might be interpreted as rural and somewhat remote, adding to the feeling of solitude.","title":"Approaching the Pacific at sunset.
