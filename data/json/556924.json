{"path":"556924.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a picturesque aerial view of a coastal landscape, likely taken from a high altitude. At the center of the image is a lush, green hill that is heavily forested. The hill slopes down towards a body of calm blue water. On the left side of the image, partially surrounded by the hill, is a small industrial area or port with several docks extending into the water. There are various buildings, some large containers or structures, and a few small vehicles or pieces of equipment visible in this area.\n\nIn the water, a large white ship is seen cruising away from the port area, moving towards the right side of the frame. The ship is brightly lit by the sunlight, making it stand out against the darker hues of the water. The background of the photograph features another landmass across the water, which appears less detailed but still covered in dense trees. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and natural, with human activity represented by the small industrial port and the moving ship.","title":"Aerial view looking northwest of the navy's Bangor annex hood canal waterfront.  The small boat handling facility is shown at the left center of the photo and devil's hole at the right.  Devil's hole is a manmade lake created by blocking an estuary with a causeway for a waterfront road.  The navy is building new facilities for a trident submarine base in the area.  Population growth is expected to affect the way of life for both humans and animals","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552000","545277","555810","552244","549520","556923","551990","556945","551609","556905","546828","555706","552195","545845","551574","555760"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["port","ship","water","landmass","move","hill","altitude","represent","forested","container"]}
