{"path":"557165.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, autumnal setting dominated by diverse vegetation. The foreground features tall grasses in varying shades of brown and beige, interspersed with small yellow leaves that have likely fallen from nearby trees. These grasses are dense and somewhat tangled, showing signs of transitioning into the dormancy of the colder season.\n\nMoving beyond the immediate grasses, the middle ground is populated with a mix of trees and shrubs. These trees showcase autumn colors in their foliage, ranging from deep reds to lighter yellows, suggesting a mix of different species. The composition of this area is dense and rich in color, providing a textural contrast to the smooth, elongated lines of the grass in the foreground.\n\nThe background, though slightly out of focus, continues the theme with more trees that have thin, bare branches reaching upwards. The sky is not visible in this image, and the overall lighting is subdued, implying either an overcast day or a setting where the sunlight is diffused by the density of the woodland canopy.\n\nThis photograph evokes a quiet, serene atmosphere typical of a forested area in the autumn. The focus on flora and the exclusion of any overt human or animal presence center the viewer's attention squarely on the natural changes occurring within this ecosystem. The composition and soft focus on the forest layers give a sense of depth and the passage of seasons in a temperate climate.","title":"Closeup of tall grasses being taken over by forest and sumac. A wave of pioneers cleared the native grasses and planted crops in the fertile soil. As a result only isolated patches of native tallgrass prairie survive. There is a bill in Congress which would make an area of Kansas a tallgrass prairie national park, but it has been stalled in committee for several years.
