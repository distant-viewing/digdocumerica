{"path":"546160.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of an industrial area featuring two large dome-shaped structures with a metallic, ribbed exterior. These domes are likely storage or processing facilities, suggested by their shape and size. There are several visible features:\n\n1. **Structures**: Two main dome structures dominate the scene. Each dome has a central apex point and is constructed of what appears to be corrugated metal material. Light reflects off these surfaces, indicating a shiny, possibly aluminum-based exterior.\n\n2. **Infrastructure**: A tall tower-like structure can be seen between the domes, equipped with what might be utility or communication devices at its top, hinting at some form of operational control or monitoring.\n\n3. **Vehicles and Equipment**: In the foreground and to the right side of the frame, industrial vehicles and machinery are visible. A forklift is seen to the right, indicating loading or unloading activities.\n\n4. **Fencing and surroundings**: A chain-link fence runs along the front of the scene, suggesting a secured area. This is an indication of restricted access typical for industrial or commercial properties.\n\n5. **Background**: Beyond the domes, there isn’t much visible detail that suggests the presence of other structures, which might indicate that these domes are somewhat isolated within their operational space.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is utilitarian, focusing solely on the industrial purpose of the structures and machinery present, without any visible human activity in this particular snapshot. The image’s perspective and composition highlight the industrial architecture and machinery, essential in whatever processing or storage function they serve.","title":"The domes are notorious for the lack of air circulation inside.
