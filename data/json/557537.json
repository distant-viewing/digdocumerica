{"path":"557537.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic mountainous landscape. The setting appears to be a valley nestled between multiple hills covered with dense vegetation. These hills display various shades of green, suggesting a mix of different types of plants and trees. A noticeable winding path or road is carved along one side of the valley, partially lined with barren trees, indicating a possible transition to less vegetated areas or seasonal changes. The mountains in the backdrop have less vegetative cover and appear more rocky, adding a rugged texture to the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be a cloudy or hazy day, as the overall tone of the image is somewhat muted, with soft light diffusing through the sky, casting gentle shadows on the hillsides. There are no visible people or animals in the photo, emphasizing the serenity and untouched nature of the landscape. The composition provides a sense of depth, with the rolling hills layered back towards the misty mountain ranges in the distance. The image evokes a feeling of tranquility and the majesty of natural landscapes.","title":"View of the Malibu Canyon area of the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County, but are threatened by development. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Several commissions have been set up to restrict coastal development.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548025","557557","553825","552553","555536","552695","555671","555130","544892","557558","554459","543569","554402","550441","554634","550478"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["valley","hill","majesty","serenity","carve","vegetate","hillside","change","nestle","diffuse"]}
