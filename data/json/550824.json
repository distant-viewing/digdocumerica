{"path":"550824.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor river scene with two motorboats. The boat in the foreground, labeled \"Capri\", is navigating slightly towards the left side of the frame, moving through the water with visible splashes at its bow. This larger enclosed boat is filled with passengers, most of whom are visible through the windows and appear to be tourists or sightseers, as they are dressed casually and seem relaxed, enjoying the ride. The boat has a dark-colored hull and a light-colored cabin top, and it's framed by dense, lush greenery in the background that indicates the location is likely in a wooded or forested area.\n\nIn the background, there is another boat, smaller and with an open design, which also contains passengers and complements the primary subject of the photo, illustrating a popular boating area or a guided tour setup.\n\nBoth boats are on a calm river, flanked by steep, rock-lined banks covered with thick foliage, emphasizing a tranquil, natural setting conducive to recreational trips. The lighting in the photograph suggests it is taken on a bright, sunny day, casting clear, hard shadows and enriching the colors of the natural surroundings.","title":"Boating on the Wisconsin river at Wisconsin dells, a popular recreation area","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550825","543945","548077","552316","551209","548058","543935","551208","549066","548080","551217","552292","546976","548736","549417","550769"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","tour","conducive","motorboat","passengers","casting","boating","trip","bow","enrich"]}
