{"path":"547360.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up profile view of an elderly man looking to the right. He is wearing a textured hat labeled \"TEXACO\" and glasses with thick frames. Reflected in his glasses, there is a scene which looks like a street view, possibly indicating he is near or looking at a busy area. His face shows signs of aging like wrinkles and he has a serious, contemplative expression. Due to the focus on the manâ€™s face and profile, the background is mostly out of focus, dark, and indistinct, directing the viewer's attention primarily to his features and the reflection in his glasses. The lighting is soft, primarily illuminating the side of his face and hat, creating a somber and reflective mood.","title":"Citizen of Utica, a small town west of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["556084","556133","547338","554857","554858","548218","547179","553091","552871","556149","548226","556452","552103","556563","543701","552561"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["face","profile","glass","wrinkle","hat","up","focus","reflection","man","view"]}
