{"path":"554683.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling and crowded outdoor scene likely at a boat launching area near a lake. The foreground of the picture shows various types of equipment scattered across the ground, including boat trailers and parts of machinery. The middle ground is densely packed with a variety of vehicles, notably several pickups, cars, and vans, many of which appear to be from the 1970s or 1980s given their design and color. A few boats can also be spotted among the vehicles, suggesting that this location is used for boating activities.\n\nBeyond the congested area of vehicles and equipment, the background reveals a body of water, which is partially bordered by trees and some foliage that seems to be in an autumnal state. Farther back, small hills or mounds rise gently against a cloud-covered sky, giving a sense of a vast, open outdoor environment. The setting is likely a public access area for water-related activities, given the mix of recreational and utility vehicles and the presence of boats and trailers.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its mix of natural landscape and human activity, suggests a day of active engagement in outdoor and possibly communal activities, emphasizing recreational use of the lake area.","title":"Cars, pickup trucks and empty boat trailers fill a parking lot at the Stillwater Reservoir and public boat landing in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
