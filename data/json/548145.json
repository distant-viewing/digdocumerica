{"path":"548145.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph showcases a hydroelectric dam in a desert or arid landscape. Prominent features in the image include a series of large transmission towers made of metal, dominating the foreground. These towers are connected by multiple electrical lines that stretch across the top portion of the image.\n\nThe dam itself is visible in the middle distance and spans horizontally across the image, with its large concrete structure positioned between two reddish-brown hills. The water behind the dam appears calm and adds a contrasting natural element to the otherwise industrial scene.\n\nThe background is composed of tall, barren hills that rise steeply from the dam's sides. The sky above is clear and vividly blue, emphasizing the aridity and the starkness of the surrounding landscape.\n\nOverall, the image captures the intertwining of human-made infrastructure with the natural environment, highlighting themes of energy production and environmental modification.","title":"The dalles dam on the Columbia River.
