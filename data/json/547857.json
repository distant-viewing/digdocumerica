{"path":"547857.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a young individual sitting on a red Honda mini bike by the side of a street. The person is wearing a white helmet and adjusting its strap with both hands. They are dressed in a horizontally striped sweater with shades of red, white, brown, and black, paired with blue jeans. This person is also wearing white sneakers with red accents.\n\nThe mini bike appears compact and robust, equipped with thick tires suited for rough terrains, though it's positioned on a paved road. The background features a suburban environment with a sparse line of medium-sized trees and grass patches. Across the street, there are parked cars and a building which is partially visible through the trees. The setting suggests a quiet neighborhood street with few distractions, focusing attention on the central figure and their activity.","title":"Young New Yorker ready to roar off on his Honda.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553515","557354","556418","554876","546967","544432","555501","554877","548690","553955","544422","554874","556206","545598","545328","551108"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bike","street","distraction","sneaker","strap","person","accent","tire","sweater","helmet"]}
