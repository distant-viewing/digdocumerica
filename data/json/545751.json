{"path":"545751.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The image captures two hikers in an outdoor setting during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as suggested by the warm lighting and long shadows. The terrain is rugged and composed of undulating rock formations typical of a desert landscape. The foreground features small, dense bushes while layered, sedimentary rock hills dominate the background, setting a serene and isolated atmosphere.\n\nThe hikers, one male and one female, are dressed in casual hiking attire. The male hiker wears a dark shirt and pants, while the female hiker, who is slightly ahead, wears a pink top, shorts, and carries a large red backpack. They are both wearing hats for sun protection and seem to be moving along a natural rocky trail, their bodies angled slightly indicating an upward climb. Their focused expressions and the way they traverse the rock suggest they are engaged in a strenuous hike.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses on the hikers while using the expansive landscape to provide context and a sense of the vastness of the area they are exploring. The natural lighting enhances the textures of the landscape and creates a contrasting interplay of light and shadows, highlighting the ruggedness of the environment and the adventurous spirit of the activity.","title":"Hikers Terry McGaw and Glen Denny on the trail to Delicate Arch in Arches National Park.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545772","545768","544301","544305","554503","545781","545700","544903","545762","554504","545785","543248","554558","544928","544089","554508"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","rock","female","spirit","hike","traverse","climb","protection","backpack","ruggedness"]}
