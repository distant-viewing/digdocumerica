{"path":"557058.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph portrays a woman dressed in traditional equestrian attire participating in a parade or equestrian event. The rider is smiling and looks directly at the camera, adding a lively and engaging touch to the image.\n\nShe wears a vibrant yellow blazer, matched with a black riding hat, white shirt/decorative tie, and black gloves. The striking yellow of her jacket contrasts vividly against the dark tones of her horse and hat. She has a badge or name tag on her blazer, although the details on it are not clear.\n\nThe horse is a dark-colored steed with a meticulously groomed mane. It is dressed in elaborate tack gear, including a decorated saddle blanket that appears multicolored and possibly embellished with fringe details. The horseâ€™s bridle is fitted with ornate elements that gleam slightly, capturing the sunlight.\n\nIn the background, spectators can be seen observing the event. They are casually dressed, indicating a laid-back, possibly outdoor setting. The environment suggests a park or a street lined with large trees providing shade.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of celebration and tradition, the bright colors worn by the rider drawing the viewer's eye, set against a backdrop of a leisurely public gathering and natural greenery. The scene exudes a sense of joy and community involvement in the equestrian activities.","title":"Rodeo queen on horseback during a parade through the town of Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia.
