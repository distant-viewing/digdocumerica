{"path":"546898.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a water body, apparently a small pond or river, heavily polluted with numerous dead fish floating on the surface. Additionally, there is a large amount of human-made debris scattered amongst the fish. This includes a dilapidated wooden structure that seems to be either a broken part of a dock or some discarded planks and wooden beams. Clearly visible are parts of a rusted metallic structure, possibly parts of an old, discarded mechanical device or container.\n\nSurrounding these central elements, the water itself is dark and murky, suggesting poor water quality. Among the fish and the debris, there are smaller pieces of litter, such as plastic bottles and other non-biodegradable materials, contributing to the overall sense of environmental degradation and neglect.\n\nThe composition of the image with the bright silver sheen of the fish contrasted against the dark color of the water creates a stark, impactful visual narrative, underlining the severity of pollution in this aquatic environment. The image is a powerful representation of environmental crisis, reflecting issues such as water pollution and the adverse impact of human activity on natural habitats.","title":"Dead fish are washed ashore at Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor, near Port Covington.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547687","552067","546930","550812","552811","555560","547737","546782","547537","547524","555784","546185","552127","555848","542985","550352"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","discard","pollution","crisis","severity","water","sheen","representation","debris","silver"]}
