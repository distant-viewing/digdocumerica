{"path":"542795.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene featuring a large wooden barn or farmhouse. The building is two-storied, has a steeply pitched roof covered in shingles, and appears weathered with visible signs of aging and discoloration. There are no visible modern fixtures or elements, suggesting the image might be older or the building is maintained in a traditional style.\n\nIn front of the building, there's a relatively wide patch of grass leading up to the structure. A group of goats, including several younger ones, is gathered around the bottom of the shallow wooden steps leading up to the building's entrance. Standing on the steps is a larger white goat or perhaps a small, light-colored dog, facing towards the camera.\n\nTo the left of the building, there's another smaller structure that appears to be a run-down shed or barn with part of its roof collapsed. The open grassy area around the buildings is enclosed by a simple wire fence visible in the background, and the setting suggests a farm or a rural homestead.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright blue, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day. This creates strong lighting that casts shadows from the building across the yard, adding contrast to the scene. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and pastoral, typical of a country setting.","title":"Farm scene","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542801","552537","543029","548065","556963","555577","549194","557747","550019","547658","556586","557991","552448","554767","557946","554560"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["goat","barn","step","building","wooden","farmhouse","discoloration","collapse","country","aging"]}
