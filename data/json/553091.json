{"path":"553091.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up portrait of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat. The man has a weathered face, indicating years of life experience, with wrinkles and a solemn expression. His hat is light gray, and he is clad in a denim shirt. The angle and close-up nature of the shot focus primarily on his face and the hat, showing detailed facial features including deep lines and a gentle, perhaps melancholic, expression in his eyes, which are partly squinted.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred and nondescript, mainly in soft neutral tones that provide a contrast that highlights the subject. The light suggests it may be daytime, with a diffused quality possibly indicating an overcast sky. The overall mood of the photograph seems reflective and carries a strong sense of individual character, emphasizing the man's rugged features and attire typically associated with rural or Western settings.","title":"Ted James, formal tribal chairman, a Paiute elder and rancher, is active in Indian affairs.
