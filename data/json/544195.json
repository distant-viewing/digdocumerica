{"path":"544195.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a scenic view of a peaceful lake surrounded by lush greenery. Centered in the photograph is a metal boat moving to the right across the water, creating a wake behind it. Inside the boat, there appear to be two figuresâ€”a dog sitting at the front, attentively looking out towards the water, and a person who appears to be controlling the boat, seated at the back.\n\nThe background is dense with various shades of green vegetation, indicating a rich, natural environment. Trees and bushes line the edge of the water, creating a secluded, almost hidden atmosphere for the lake. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting subtle overcast conditions, which diffuse the light and add a soft quality to the scene.\n\nThe surface of the water is depicted with small ripples, reflecting a subtle interplay of light and shadow. In the foreground, the left side shows a patch of water plants emerging from the water, adding a touch of detail and emphasizing the tranquility of the setting. The overall composition of the photograph offers a serene and somewhat nostalgic view of a simple boating activity in a natural setting.","title":"Fishing in Bayou Gauche, in the Louisiana wetlands","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543548","551680","549417","546976","553411","557253","557563","551207","557562","550324","552292","551216","544532","550674","550780","546070"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","water","lake","hide","wake","dog","emerge","diffuse","ripple","interplay"]}
