{"path":"557975.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a distant view of a train crossing a high bridge over a wooded valley. The bridge itself is an elevated metal structure consisting of two parallel trusses that provide support for the rail tracks. Multiple tall and slim columns support the bridge, which appears quite high above the valley floor. The scene is shot during twilight, adding a dim, serene mood to the image.\n\nThe surrounds are densely packed with a variety of trees and foliage. Hints of a river or body of water are visible through the trees, suggesting the valley's bottom is not far from a water source. The background shows rolling hills or low mountains, partially shrouded in the mist of the early morning or evening, which adds a layer of depth to the landscape. The lighting is subdued, mostly in shades of blue and gray, emphasizing the early morning or late evening time frame. This setting highlights the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment intersected by the man-made bridge.","title":"Ohio turnpike carries traffic over the cuyahoga valley and river as seen from riverview road near Cleveland.
