{"path":"549116.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a valley with various elements of both natural and human-made environments. Key features include:\n\n1. **Mountains**: In the background, large mountains dominate the landscape, providing a grand and powerful presence. These mountains appear to be partially covered with vegetation and feature gentle to moderate slopes.\n\n2. **Valley and Plains**: The valley spreads out below, interspersed with patches of dense, predominantly green trees. Open fields and parcels of farmland divide the region into a quilt of varying shades of green and brown.\n\n3. **Body of Water**: A large, narrow body of water is visible running parallel to the valley. It reflects light, suggesting it may be a river or a large lake.\n\n4. **Smoke and Industrial Activity**: Near the center of the image, there is smoke rising, likely from a factory or industrial facility. Nearby this smoke source, piles of what might be timber or other raw materials are visible, indicating logging or a related industry.\n\n5. **Built Environment**: A small town or rural community is observable with houses and other buildings scattered throughout. The buildings are small and modest, with roads running between them. The layout is fairly spacious, typical of rural settlements.\n\n6. **Roads and Infrastructure**: A main road cuts through the landscape, curving around the natural contours of the land and likely connecting the small community to other regions.\n\n7. **Forests and Wooded Areas**: The area is rich in dense forestation, which carpets much of the visible land. These forested areas are likely habitats for various wildlife and contribute to the region's natural beauty.\n\nThis scene is essentially a mixture of natural beauty with human intervention, depicting a balanced ecosystem where industrial, residential, and natural elements coexist. The photograph captures the essence of a tranquil yet active rural landscape.","title":"Early morning in the Columbia River Gorge between Hood River and Bonneville Dam near Cascade Locks.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548199","542998","552593","557726","556915","548172","545042","556907","556341","551049","551196","555685","543746","556919","551568","557379"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","smoke","region","parcel","quilt","forestation","parallel","farmland","community","land"]}
