{"path":"542724.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a large, ancient tree stump situated in a lush forest setting. The stump is massive, with its wide girth and weathered, rough surface indicating its age and the long history of the tree it once was. The top of the stump is flat, suggesting it may have been cut down. Surrounding the stump are bushy and dense green vegetation, and smaller trees provide a vibrant backdrop, casting patches of shade and sun across the scene.\n\nThree people are interacting around the stump, giving a sense of scale to its large size. On the left, one individual stands slightly apart from the stump, facing towards the camera, dressed in casual outdoor attire including a hat, possibly indicating a hiking or nature excursion. The other two individuals are closer to or inside of the hollow parts of the stump, exploring it more closely.\n\nIn the foreground, a fourth individual is seen from behind, walking towards the tree stump. This person appears younger and smaller in stature compared to the others, adding to the overall dynamic of the scene. The person is also casually dressed, suggesting that the group is engaged in a leisurely visit to this natural site.\n\nThe natural lighting, rich colors of the greenery, and the organic, somewhat rugged texture of the stump create a picturesque outdoor setting that invites exploration and appreciation of natureâ€™s grandeur.","title":"Tourists in big stump meadow","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["557589","543479","542728","557590","552453","543446","542721","542749","542732","550792","544743","555090","545290","555169","542570","554995"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["stump","excursion","visit","appreciation","hiking","explore","tree","history","person","grandeur"]}
