{"path":"553136.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph portrays a dramatic landscape centered around a river in a turbulent state. The river is overflowing with rushing, frothy white water that dominates the foreground, suggesting recent heavy rainfall or meltwater. In the middleground, a large, dark concrete dam spans the width of the river, partially obstructing the flow of water which contributes to the turbulence seen in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, rising directly from the near riverbanks, mountains slope upwards, shrouded in shadows that indicate either dawn or dusk light conditions. The sky above is filled with an expansive, dramatic cloud formation that is brightly lit by the sun, contrasting sharply with the darker tones of the water and mountains.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of natural power and energy at the dam, highlighted by the moody lighting and dynamic water movement. The scene is devoid of any human presence, emphasizing the scale and wildness of the natural environment.","title":"Derby Dam, on the Truckee River, is one of the facilities in the Newlands Irrigation Project.","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["550701","550742","550654","544150","553349","553137","544166","549486","542743","548925","553828","553372","549004","550698","548940","548007"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","river","obstruct","wildness","turbulence","overflow","rush","width","mountain","rainfall"]}
