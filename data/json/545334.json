{"path":"545334.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a view of a charming, old building with a distinct Southwestern architectural style, possibly an adobe construction. This is evidenced by its thick walls and the style of the window and door framing, indicative of this style seen often in regions like New Mexico or Arizona. The building has a light blue facade with a faded and slightly distressed appearance, indicating it has weathered over time.\n\nThere are three visible windows and one primary entrance door. The windows are framed with darker wooden sills and white trim, while the door is a deeper weather-beaten wood with a mesh screen, set within a recessed doorway painted a darker color than the main walls. Above the door, the address \"320\" is clearly visible, painted in white against the blue wall.\n\nThe roofline is flat with brick coping visible along the edge, which is common in Southwestern architecture, providing both aesthetic appeal and functionality. A single shadow from an unknown fixture extends onto the facade, adding depth to the scene. The sidewalk in front provides a clear walkway leading directly to the standing door, with only minor wear visible on the surface. \n\nThe bright blue sky with no visible clouds indicates a clear, sunny day, casting shadows that enhance the texture of the building and sidewalk. Overall, the scene encapsulates a quiet, serene vista likely situated in a sunny, arid location.","title":"Adobe structure at 4th and campbell streets in the spanish-speaking section of El Paso","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["545359","552966","555286","545324","556629","555340","549221","545355","557643","558128","557156","548656","544088","544911","544417","552968"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","wall","sidewalk","recess","sill","facade","beat","window","screen","style"]}
