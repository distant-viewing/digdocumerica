{"path":"557389.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene characterized by aged infrastructure and machinery. On the left side of the photograph, there is a long building with multiple large doors and windows, exhibiting signs of wear and aging, with a visibly rusted and weathered facade. Attached to this building are intricate, elevated metal constructions that appear to be part of a conveyor system or ventilation ducts, curving and interconnecting in various ways.\n\nProminently displayed in this industrial landscape is a structure with large, cylindrical objects, possibly storage tanks, covered with rusted metal sheeting, which extend along raised frameworks above the ground. These frameworks lead into more complex metal constructions that continue across the image.\n\nTowards the center and right side of the photo, beyond the main building, additional elements of the facility can be seen, including what looks like more buildings and machinery under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, adding a touch of movement and color to the otherwise monochromatic industrial environment, is a red vintage truck, which appears to be a mid-20th century model, driving on the facilityâ€™s road. The truck adds a sense of scale and everyday human activity amidst the large-scale industrial operations. The road itself is unpaved and dusty, fitting with the overall rugged, utilitarian setting of the scene.","title":"\"bag house alley\" with duct work going to cooling towers and bag houses at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant, between october, 1967, and september, 1975, annual emissions were reduced 97.7 percent from 113,252 to 2,649 tons.
