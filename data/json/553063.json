{"path":"553063.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a section of a large multi-story building, specifically focusing on its facade made up of numerous balconies. All balconies are aligned vertically and horizontally, creating a repetitive and symmetrical grid of guardrails and glass doors or windows. The overall color palette of the building facade is earthy, with brown and beige tones.\n\nOn some of the balconies, signs of personalization by the residents are visible. Notably, on one of the balconies towards the bottom of the frame, there are two flags prominently displayed. One is the American flag, recognizable by its red, white, and blue colors with stars and stripes. The other flag appears to be worn and is less distinct, but hints of red, white, and a darker color (possibly blue or black) are observable, suggesting it may also be a national flag. \n\nThe exact floor count visible in the photograph is not clear, but it shows a substantial vertical span of the building. No people are visible in this shot, and the focus is purely architectural, emphasizing the structure's utilitarian aspects contrasted with dots of personal expression through flag display.","title":"High-rise apartment building.
