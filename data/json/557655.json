{"path":"557655.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene in a charming, small town. The perspective is taken from a slightly elevated position at one end of the main thoroughfare, looking down the street lined with parked cars. The era appears to be from the 1970s or early 1980s, judging by the automotive designs that dominate the scene. The street is flanked with classic cars that reflect the boxy, sizable design popular during that period, with colors ranging from white, tan, and blue to a deep maroon.\n\nOn either side of the street, small businesses with red roofing and some homes are visible. The architecture has a quaint, cozy feel, featuring gabled roofs and some decorative woodwork. Peeking among the buildings is dense green foliage, suggesting a lush, verdant setting. The background shows rolling hills and more dense greenery, enhancing the small-town atmosphere.\n\nThe businesses seem to cater to both locals and visitors, with several storefronts and what might be a restaurant or café among them. A few people are visible on the sidewalks, adding a lively human element to the scene. They appear to be engaged in everyday activities, likely walking or shopping, although the distance makes these activities a bit difficult to distinguish clearly.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a softer light over the area, which might indicate either an early morning or a late afternoon timeframe. The atmosphere of the photograph is nostalgic, providing a snapshot of life in a simpler time in small-town America.","title":"Main Street traffic congestion in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The village's 1975 community growth plan calls for creation of an open air pedestrian mall in the area between the shops at the left and Georgia Highway 17/75 at the right. The town has experienced a surge of tourism and commercial growth by using a Bavarian alpine theme in the business district. A state financed growth plan notes that the town can save its local character, but has to beware of the pressure of commercialism.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554710","557155","557805","557705","556564","552601","551106","545614","556709","552526","556422","554551","552602","542586","542900","545610"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["town","street","business","timeframe","woodwork","maroon","café","local","thoroughfare","restaurant"]}
