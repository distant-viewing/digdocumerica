{"path":"547817.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in an urban setting, featuring an older man engaged in repairing a bicycle. The man is dressed in a dark coat and a fedora hat, sitting on a small wooden crate as he works on the bike, which is elevated on a makeshift stand. He appears focused and meticulous in his task, holding a tool in one hand. \n\nThe background of the image shows a partially visible commercial street scene. There is a shop with large windows and the word \"Kings\" written alongside the building's fa√ßade, suggesting it might be a store or business establishment. The architecture is modern, with neat, clean lines. In front of this building, there is a grassy strip and a paved area where the man is sitting. \n\nOn the pavement next to the man is another object, possibly a container or small open box, which might contain tools or parts. The area is well-lit, indicative of daytime, and the street is quiet with no visible pedestrians or traffic, giving a calm atmosphere to the scene. Overall, the photograph portrays a moment of everyday life, focusing on individual activity within a wider urban context.","title":"Street artist readies his gear","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["547400","558356","553656","557115","557683","547748","557535","548252","542497","553794","556177","547821","551463","548231","547389","556156"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tool","fedora","crate","man","bike","street","stand","pavement","establishment","bicycle"]}
