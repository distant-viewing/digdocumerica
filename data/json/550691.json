{"path":"550691.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene landscape scene defined by a broad river that takes center stage. The river reflects the overcast sky and is surrounded by lush greenery. In the foreground, dense shrubbery, possibly flowering bushes, add a touch of liveliness to the otherwise moody setting. The middle ground features a few isolated trees, steadily emerging from small islands or riverbanks, their reflections mirrored in the gentle waters.\n\nIn the background, a line of mountains stretches across the horizon, shrouded in a misty haze that suggests either a recent rain or morning moisture. The sky above is dramatic, filled with heavy, scattered clouds that hint at the potential for more rain. The overall lighting of the scene is subdued, with cool tones dominating, giving the landscape a quiet, almost somber feel.\n\nThe composition balances the elements of water, vegetation, and sky, inviting the viewer to experience a moment of calm and reflection. There is no visible human activity in this natural setting, which emphasizes the solitude and untouched beauty of the location.","title":"Androscoggin River just north of the Berlin town line","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550656","552318","542653","550839","557106","550680","554762","554616","554629","550700","550845","550560","546963","550581","552599","550562"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rain","potential","liveliness","reflection","shrubbery","moisture","island","river","calm","stage"]}
