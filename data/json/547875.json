{"path":"547875.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a playground, possibly on a sunny day given the bright lighting and shadows. The playground equipment includes a large red structure, prominently featuring a label that reads \"New York City Fire Department\". This structure resembles a fire truck and has various elements for children to climb and play on, including ladders and steering wheels.\n\nIn the foreground, a young child is seen peeking through one of the openings of the red structure. Additionally, there are two more children: one inside the structure appearing to play with a steering wheel, and another in the background who is walking away from the camera towards the right.\n\nThe ground appears to be either paved or covered with safety tiles common in playgrounds. In the background, beyond a chain link fence, an expansive open area with sparse grass is visible. This suggests that the playground may be located near a beach or similar open landscape, given the presence of sand and a distant horizon line where buildings can barely be seen under the blue sky. There are also other typical playground elements like swings seen further back, and a few benches where presumably parents or guardians could sit and watch their children.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests an urban recreational area dedicated for children's play, emphasizing safety and community engagement.","title":"A playground, sheepshead bay, south Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551725","549674","545867","555946","549666","555928","547871","552470","555931","551714","555901","551720","546562","556290","547188","556175"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["playground","child","steering","play","wheel","safety","parent","swing","ladder","climb"]}
