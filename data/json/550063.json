{"path":"550063.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant community garden scene set against a backdrop of residential buildings and mature trees. Within the garden, several individual plots are visible, some bordered by wooden frames or small fences. Each plot showcases a variety of plants, with notable bursts of brightly colored flowers and burgeoning shrubbery.\n\nIn the image, two individuals are engaged in gardening activities. A person in the foreground, dressed in a light-colored jacket and dark pants, is bending over, tending to the soil with a tool, possibly a hoe or rake. Another person, dressed in a red shirt and dark pants, is located further in the background, seemingly involved in a similar gardening task.\n\nThe garden itself is lush and well-maintained, indicating early to mid-spring, as evidenced by blooming flowers and trees. A tree with pink blossoms stands prominently on the right side of the frame, and another with white blossoms is visible in the background. The environment suggests a peaceful, communal setting for urban gardening, surrounded by a residential area with parked cars and greenery, creating an oasis within a cityscape.","title":"\"City farmer\" tends garden in the Fenway, administered by the 600-member Fenway Civic Association.
