{"path":"554548.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph showcases a rugged, natural scene, likely taken after some form of land disturbance such as excavation or a natural event. In the foreground, a dirt road with tire tracks is visible, suggesting recent vehicle activity. Alongside the road, there is a large pile of rocks and debris, including earth and gravel, evidencing some form of earth movement like construction or landslide.\n\nTo the right, several uprooted trees with exposed roots are prominent, indicating severe soil disruption. These trees, with an angled position and bare roots, add to the sense of disorder and upheaval in the scene. The soil at the base of these trees is fresh and loose, further supporting the idea of a recent earth movement or clearing activity.\n\nThe background features more trees that appear to be intact and stable, creating a contrasting backdrop to the disrupted foreground. In the distance, there is a partial view of a house or structure, partially obscured by trees, giving a hint of human habitation nearby.\n\nThe color and lighting in the image suggest it was taken during daytime with bright sunlight illuminating the scene, casting shadows and highlighting the texture of the disturbed soil and debris. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a narrative of recent environmental change, possibly due to human activity or natural forces.","title":"Cave-in along a road where bulldozers worked making swampy land fit for vacation homes near Eagle Bay, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549255","555199","545534","556445","554547","543112","554802","556456","555142","548807","555089","547523","545254","555136","555086","545138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["root","soil","earth","landslide","disorder","idea","form","tree","movement","disruption"]}
