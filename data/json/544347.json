{"path":"544347.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic and blurred scene of a river or stream, capturing the excitement of water-based activities, likely swimming or snorkeling. In the foreground, a person is seen mostly submerged in the water; you can distinctly see a gloved hand and what appears to be a snorkeling fin breaking the water's surface. The person seems to be wearing a dark wetsuit or similar attire, indicating the nature of the activity likely involves exposure to water for prolonged periods, possibly in a cooler environment.\n\nThe background is somewhat blurry, yet we can distinguish green vegetation and a rocky outcrop, which provides a sense of a rugged natural landscape, typical of a river setting in a forested or mountainous area. The overall dim lighting and shadows suggest that the photograph may have been taken during either early morning or late afternoon, adding a dramatic tone to the scene.\n\nThe focus of the photo is mostly centered on the water and the person, with the motion of water creating sparkling light reflections around the surfaces that are touched by sunlight, giving the image a vibrant and lively feel despite the blur. The composition and the blurred quality of the image add a sense of motion and immediacy to this adventurous moment.","title":"Cooling off at the Havasu Falls on the HavaSupai Reservation","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["548844","542561","550237","553336","552061","545882","554007","549447","553414","550843","553333","553335","546304","553416","548683","546306"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["person","wetsuit","water","immediacy","motion","fin","excitement","distinguish","outcrop","swimming"]}
