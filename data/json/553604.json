{"path":"553604.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man actively engaged in cutting a tree with a chainsaw in a forest setting. The man is wearing safety gear, including a yellow hard hat, which suggests that he is possibly a professional logger or forestry worker. His attire consists of a blue jacket over a dark colored shirt, and he is bending over the fallen tree trunk, focusing his efforts on sawing through the wood. Sawdust particles are visibly flying off the location where the chainsaw meets the tree, indicating the action of cutting.\n\nThe background is densely wooded with various trees and undergrowth, giving an impression of a natural, possibly secluded forest area. The lighting in the image is dim, suggesting either an overcast day or a setting sun, adding a somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene. The focus on the worker and the immediate action of cutting the tree, along with the somewhat blurred and dark forest background, emphasizes the intensity and ruggedness of the forestry work being performed.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" cuts down flame-damaged trees.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["542787","542785","542786","554414","554415","553602","553608","542788","542773","542769","553614","542771","555472","553601","553643","542770"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["chainsaw","forestry","forest","action","saw","sawdust","worker","cut","cutting","tree"]}
