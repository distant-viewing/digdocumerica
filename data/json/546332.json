{"path":"546332.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene, natural waterside scene. In the foreground, there is a gnarled tree adorned with Spanish moss, enhancing the image’s rustic, Southern charm. The tree’s rough, textured bark and sprawling roots are prominently displayed.\n\nIn the middle ground, a person is seen bending near the water's edge, seemingly engaged in an activity such as picking something up from the ground or possibly examining the shore. The person's presence adds a human element to the natural landscape, suggesting leisure or exploration.\n\nBeyond the person, the water extends towards the background, meeting a line of lush trees along the horizon that suggests a dense, forested area. The water appears calm, mirroring the sky and contributing to the peaceful ambiance of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a tranquil and somewhat timeless feel, inviting contemplation of nature and human interaction with serene environments. The blend of prominent, mature trees and the gentle water body speaks to a landscape that is both enduring and dynamic.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory personnel are dip netting for contaminated female shrimp for a study of whether pcb is passed on to their offspring","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["546963","545008","546985","550750","555637","546066","550844","550845","546057","551352","554603","550826","554717","554099","557254","554527"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["bending","person","waterside","enduring","root","pick","sprawling","tree","water","bark"]}
