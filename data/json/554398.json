{"path":"554398.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, natural landscape dominated by a series of overlapping mountain ranges receding into the distance. The foreground features a collection of dense, dark coniferous trees, adding a rich texture and a sense of depth. These trees gradually give way to the mountain slopes, each layer progressively fading in tone and detail which contributes to a sense of vast, expansive atmosphere.\n\nThe mountains themselves appear in soft focus, their outlines slightly hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions like mist or fading light, which adds a dreamlike quality to the scene. The ranges are shown in different shades of blue and purple, suggesting the photo was taken during either early morning or late evening, times when the light casts long, soft shadows and enriches colors.\n\nThere's a visible gradation in light and color from the dark, detailed foreground to the lighter, more ethereal distant peaks. This gradation helps convey the immensity and quiet solitude of the wilderness setting. No human activity or man-made structures are visible, underscoring the untouched and pristine nature of the environment. The composition is balanced, with the horizon situated roughly one-third from the bottom of the frame, following a traditional landscape photography rule that contributes to the peaceful and harmonious feel of the image.","title":"Mists of the high peaks region","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554402","555131","542923","544070","557000","557558","555110","546764","552173","550441","543582","553593","548025","542681","555130","552695"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["gradation","mountain","rule","distant","reced","fading","casts","enrich","photography","fad"]}
