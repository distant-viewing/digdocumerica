{"path":"544407.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts two children, one girl and one boy, sitting outdoors on a barren, rocky terrain. The children are smiling and appear to be engaging with the viewer. The girl is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved blouse and has long dark hair, while the boy is in a dark t-shirt. Both are kneeling on the ground.\n\nIn front of them is an expansive display of colorful bead necklaces meticulously arranged in rows on the sandy ground. The necklaces vary in design, featuring different patterns and beads of various sizes and colors. Some necklaces are particularly elaborate, featuring larger, ornate centerpieces. Small stones are strategically placed to either hold the necklaces down or to mark sections.\n\nThe background shows a wide, open landscape under a slightly cloudy sky, suggesting a desert environment. The horizon is vast, reinforcing the feeling of an open, outdoor setting. This scene is likely a setup for selling these handcrafted items to passersby or tourists in a remote, natural setting, with the children possibly assisting in the display and sale of the jewelry.","title":"Beads for sale","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["544403","542657","543612","545757","555990","544398","552591","544424","545509","544408","543538","544257","543855","545379","552332","543496"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["necklace","child","girl","boy","centerpiece","jewelry","passersby","sell","tourist","sale"]}
