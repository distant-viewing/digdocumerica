{"path":"555259.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures the inside of a storage area, likely a chemical storage room, with various safety and hazard elements visible. Here are the details from the scene:\n\n1. **Cabinets and Shelves**: In the background, gray metal cabinets with glass-fronted doors are partially visible. The cabinets are equipped with safety signs indicating they contain poisons, as evident by the prominent diamond-shaped poison symbols on the cabinet doors.\n\n2. **Safety Signs**: Two handwritten signs are placed at the front. One reads \"Keep Doors Closed at All Times - Please!\" suggesting a strict protocol for maintaining the doors closed. Another sign, likely attached to a cabinet, states \"It’s up to You to Work Safely,\" emphasizing personal responsibility in ensuring safety.\n\n3. **Chemical Containers**: Numerous bottles and containers are arranged in the foreground, most of them enclosed in clear plastic bags, possibly for safety or contamination prevention reasons. The contents are diverse, including bottles labeled as hazardous materials like 'Chloroform', 'Phenol', and other chemicals. Each container varies in shape and size, indicating a wide variety of substances stored.\n\n4. **Counter and Accessories**: A long, solid counter runs across the space in front of the cabinets, on which the chemical containers are placed. Green circular stickers are visible on the edge of the counter, possibly indicating status or levels of something, though their specific purpose isn’t clear from the image.\n\n5. **Lighting and Ambiance**: The room is lit by fluorescent lighting, creating a stark, functional atmosphere typical of a laboratory or storage facility designed for safety rather than comfort. The overall ambiance is strictly utilitarian.\n\nThe composition of the photograph and the elements within it strongly emphasize safety and regulatory compliance in handling potentially dangerous chemicals.","title":"Pesticides samples awaiting analysis by Environmental Protection Agency personnel in New York City","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555253","546303","555267","548859","555268","548865","555254","555245","548860","555244","553658","543834","546278","546275","551588","555243"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["cabinet","safety","chemical","door","container","counter","storage","bottle","sign","room"]}
