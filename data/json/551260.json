{"path":"551260.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large, modern resort complex nestled in a forested area. The composition captures multiple buildings varying in shape and size, mostly with flat roofs. Primarily noticeable is a large central building with a unique red-colored, curved facade and an extended walkway or bridge connecting it to another section of the complex. Surrounding this are several other rounded buildings with muted colors that blend with the natural setting.\n\nIn the middle of the resort, there is a brightly lit, circular pool area, which appears vivid against the dusky surroundings. The pool is surrounded by lounging areas, likely equipped with chairs and tables.\n\nThe area is surrounded by dense trees and the background extends into rolling hills, indicating a secluded or possibly hilly location. The lighting suggests it's either dawn or dusk, as the sky is quite dark and the artificial lights of the buildings and pool are prominent.\n\nParking lots filled with cars are visible, indicating the presence of guests or an ongoing event. The roads within the complex are subtly lit, creating a gentle contrast with the natural dark tones of the wooded area.","title":"\"Lodge of the Four Seasons,\" the newer of two very plush resorts on Lake Ozark, offers two golf courses, marina, dining, dancing, horseback riding, movies, shops, and luxurious accommodations.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["548022","554144","546702","544503","551261","558056","554145","548549","557426","544560","553744","552987","546473","542593","557989","543580"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pool","complex","resort","guest","lounge","building","surround","walkway","chair","nestle"]}
