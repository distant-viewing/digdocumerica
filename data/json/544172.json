{"path":"544172.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up of a large piece of machinery, most likely a part of a mining or industrial equipment. The main focus of the image is the central structure that has \"NAVAJO MINE\" printed in bold capital letters, alongside a circular logo with a Native American motif. This indicates that the equipment is used at or originates from the Navajo Mine, which may suggest a location in an area connected to the Navajo Nation or influenced by it.\n\nThe structure includes a high vertical wall that supports a network of metallic stairs, platforms, and railings, painted in a muted red and white color scheme. To the left and right, there are various mechanical components and supports that are part of the larger apparatus, possibly a crane or a drilling rig, indicated by the cylindrical and beam structures.\n\nOn the far right, within an enclosed operator cab that projects outward, there is a person visible through the window. The operator seems to be engaged in handling the machinery, evident by their focused posture towards the controls or the field of operation outside the cab.\n\nThe photograph captures the intricacy and worn condition of the industrial machinery, highlighted by rust and paint wear, emphasizing that it is heavily used. The background is not distinctly visible due to the focus on the machinery, hinting that it might be located in a large industrial or mining site. The lighting and color tone suggest it could be either dawn or dusk, adding a somewhat gritty and moody atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Dragline (used in strip mining) at the Navajo coal mine in northern Arizona","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["544156","554826","556505","543642","556325","555631","556322","555586","554764","543639","544134","553827","543848","544390","554828","556446"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["machinery","operator","cab","mining","rig","intricacy","capital","motif","equipment","stair"]}
