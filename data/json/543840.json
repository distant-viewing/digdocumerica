{"path":"543840.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a young donkey standing on a dirt path. The donkey, facing slightly towards the left of the frame, appears to be a juvenile, with soft, fluffy fur predominately in shades of light gray and subtle hints of brown. It has long, upright ears and dark, expressive eyes that slightly gaze towards the camera. A soft light highlights the left side of its face and body, possibly indicating either early morning or late afternoon sunlight.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus, suggesting a shallow depth of field was used when taking the photo. It shows an outdoor environment with hints of green grass and possibly bushes. The foreground consists mainly of the dirt path on which the donkey stands. The lighting and focus emphasize the donkey, making it the clear subject of the photograph. The overall composition and the soft, natural lighting contribute to a serene and gentle portrayal of this young animal in its natural setting.","title":"Young mule runs wild in mining district","placename":"Cripple Creek (Colo.)","location":"Cripple Creek, Colorado","nn1":["544916","550803","542629","543839","554621","543851","543029","557186","543279","543678","543682","550802","545902","546163","543783","553064"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["path","dirt","ear","fur","portrayal","face","gaze","animal","bush","brown"]}
