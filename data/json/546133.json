{"path":"546133.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a chilling scene inside what appears to be a butcher's cold room or meat processing facility. Several deer carcasses are hanging from metal hooks or ropes attached to the ceiling. The carcasses are in various stages of processing, with some skinned and others partially covered with hides. Most of the deer have their heads intact, and there are traces of blood on their bodies as well as on the wooden walls and the floor of the room, indicating recent butchering activity.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are large blocks of ice, possibly used to help preserve the meat by maintaining a low temperature within the room. The blocks are clear with visible chipping and frost on them, adding to the overall cold and functional atmosphere of the space.\n\nThe walls and the ceiling of the room are constructed from reddish-brown wooden panels, which appear soiled, possibly a result of repeated exposure to the elements involved in meat processing. The lighting in the room casts a red hue over everything, intensifying the visceral impact of the scene.\n\nThe environment suggests a setting commonly found in rural or wilderness areas where hunting and immediate processing of game are practices, possibly for both personal sustenance and commercial purposes. The pragmatic yet stark nature of the room underscores the utilitarian aspect of the space dedicated to meat processing.","title":"Deer storage","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["554676","552632","554675","554941","552633","552587","546094","552634","552699","546132","548867","554934","558256","554943","554944","552588"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["meat","room","processing","deer","block","ceiling","frost","hunting","hook","result"]}
