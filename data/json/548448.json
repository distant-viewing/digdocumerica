{"path":"548448.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This image captures a dramatic moment where a large airplane is flying incredibly low over a residential street. The airplane is depicted from a bottom-rear perspective, dominating the upper portion of the frame as it appears to almost graze the rooftops of narrow townhouses lining either side of the street.\n\nThe aircraft, possibly a commercial jet, features two engines mounted on its wings and extended flaps, suggesting it is in the midst of landing or taking off. The landing gear of the plane is visibly deployed. The scene conveys a tense juxtaposition between the everyday urban environment and the unusual proximity of the large aircraft.\n\nThe buildings in the photograph are typical townhouses with multiple stories, external fire escapes, and aligned, symmetric windows. They are closely spaced, creating a narrow street typical of dense urban areas. The architecture and the style of the buildings suggest an older residential area.\n\nThe image is rich with color, from the clear blue sky background to the varied colors of the buildingsâ€”painted in shades of green, beige, and blue. There are no visible people in the photograph, emphasizing the surreal and unusual nature of the moment captured. The setting could be near an airport where flight paths are in close proximity to residential areas, heightening the impact of this rare and attention-grabbing scene.","title":"Near Logan airport--airplane coming in for a landing over neptune road homes","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548484","548485","548447","548446","553888","548469","548486","550156","550160","547824","546178","542672","548481","542720","547810","547231"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["townhouse","landing","airplane","aircraft","proximity","street","heighten","deploy","flap","grab"]}
