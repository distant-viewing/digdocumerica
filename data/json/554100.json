{"path":"554100.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene and picturesque scene in a Japanese garden. In the foreground, there is a small pond that reflects the surrounding structures and trees. A prominent feature in the scene is a red Japanese gazebo with a traditional pagoda-style roof, positioned on the edge of the pond and connected by a bridge with red railings and dark stone steps.\n\nTo the left and in the background of the gazebo, there is a graceful stone bridge arching over the pond. The bridge's balustrades match the dark stone construction seen throughout the scene, suggesting a harmony in design.\n\nThe pond itself shows reflections of the gazebo and a distorted mirror image of the environment, reducing clarity but enhancing the water's textured appearance. Beside the gazebo, a small white statue stands as another decorative element, contributing to the peaceful and curated atmosphere of the garden.\n\nThe garden is lush with greenery, featuring manicured grass, neatly trimmed bushes, and a variety of trees, including weeping willows whose draping branches add to the tranquil and slightly melancholic ambiance.\n\nThere are people scattered throughout the garden, likely enjoying the peaceful environment. One person appears to be walking over the bridge while others might be engaged in quiet contemplation or leisurely walks, blending into the tranquil scenery without drawing attention away from the beauty of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph is balanced and harmonious, inviting viewers to appreciate the careful design and quiet beauty of this Japanese garden setting.","title":"In liliuokalani gardens","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["558094","551776","544561","553756","546505","557024","550784","551265","558095","553752","558015","546457","553355","557974","557783","554591"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["gazebo","garden","pond","bridge","stone","distort","balustrade","manicured","reduce","harmony"]}
