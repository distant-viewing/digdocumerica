{"path":"555390.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a Dairy Queen outlet on a sunny day, under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, a young woman is enjoying a vanilla ice cream cone. She has long, dark, wavy hair and wears a denim jacket over a patterned shirt. The focus on her face and the ice cream cone emphasizes a moment of enjoyment.\n\nIn the background, prominently displayed are two advertising signs. One is the iconic Dairy Queen logo on a red background mounted atop a pole. Below it, there's another sign with festive light bulb decorations around the edge. This sign carries a message about energy conservation, reading \"Correl, Our lights are off to save energy! Won't you help too?\".\n\nThe setting looks like a typical suburban commercial area with a spacious parking lot. Visible in the deep background are several parked cars and a portion of the Dairy Queen building with an extended roof that might cover an outdoor seating area. The overall composition combines a delightful personal moment with a broader environmental message.","title":"After the Oregon governor banned neon and commercial lighting displays, firms used their unlit signs to convey energy-saving messages which could be seen during the day.
