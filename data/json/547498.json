{"path":"547498.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor construction scene. In the foreground, two workers are engaged in physical labor. The person to the left, wearing a bright yellow raincoat and black boots, is using a long-handled shovel to move mounds of dark, muddy material. This worker is actively shoveling with a stance that suggests exertion, bending toward the ground.\n\nOn the right side, another worker, partly obscured and bending down toward the earth, assists or conducts a similar task. This individual is dressed in dark clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their attire details against the similarly dark and muddy backdrop.\n\nProminently featured in the middle ground of the image is a large yellow bulldozer. The bulldozer, positioned facing the camera, appears inactive at the moment the photo was captured, with its bucket resting on the ground. This construction equipment adds a strong industrial feel to the setting.\n\nThe environment appears to be a spacious outdoor area possibly a construction or excavation site, with an open sky and what looks to be a relatively barren landscape in the far background. The ground is muddy and shows tracks and disturbances consistent with construction activity.\n\nOverall, this scene conveys a sense of hard manual labor within an industrial or construction setting, emphasizing themes of teamwork and the use of heavy machinery in altering or managing landscapes.","title":"Cleaning up after an oil spill in Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545662","545665","557742","554856","555601","556939","545652","554544","544138","553138","545664","543105","543107","551262","552814","543760"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","shovel","worker","bulldozer","labor","bend","raincoat","ground","distinguish","exertion"]}
