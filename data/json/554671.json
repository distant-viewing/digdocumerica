{"path":"554671.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor gathering in a forested area during autumn. The background is filled with an array of trees boasting fall colors ranging from bright oranges to deep reds, and some evergreens. \n\nIn the center of the image is a wooden pavilion with a peaked roof, open walls, and supporting beams visible. It is situated in a clearing surrounded by the colorful trees.\n\nA large group of people, predominantly adults of various ages, is scattered around the pavilion. Some are standing in lines or small clusters, possibly involved in a community event or activity. The attire of the individuals suggests a casual outdoor setting, with many wearing jackets and hats suitable for cooler weather.\n\nThe ground appears to be a mix of grassy and dirt areas, with no paved paths visible. The overall vibe of the scene is communal and leisurely, with people engaged in conversation or waiting for an event to start. The clear blue sky suggests it's a sunny day, enhancing the vivid autumn colors in the trees.","title":"Dedication of a new hikers building and lot by Adirondack Mountain Club members in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554670","554667","558294","554669","556522","557939","551413","557207","557943","557028","554665","551764","554666","557005","542732","557985"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["pavilion","autumn","boast","evergreen","event","start","clearing","vibe","wait","beam"]}
