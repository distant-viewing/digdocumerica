{"path":"551936.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph portrays an urban street scene, likely captured in the earlier decades, given the style of clothing and vehicular designs. In the foreground on the right, a large, white street sweeper vehicle dominates the frame. It features hard edges, compact structure, and is painted white, with visible wear and dirt, exhibiting signs of frequent use in city maintenance.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a crowd of people gathered around a storefront beneath a black, flat canopy with \"SMY\" followed by partially obscured words that end with \"LISHED 18\". The crowd appears engaged in some kind of event or gathering, with many people standing and some in motion, possibly entering or exiting the storefront.\n\nIndividuals in the photograph wear clothing that suggests styles from the 1970s or early 1980s, including various colors and cuts of pants and shirts, indicating a casual and diverse urban crowd. Overhead, the sky is overcast, casting diffuse lighting over the scene which flattens the overall tonal contrast.\n\nThe architecture visible includes tall, dark windowed buildings and above the crowd, a single American flag, hanging limp, central and partially visible, adds a patriotic element to the scene.\n\nThe composition captures a moment of everyday urban life, focusing on a contrast between machinery used for city maintenance and the daily activities of its inhabitants. The street and sidewalks are wet, suggesting recent rain, which adds a reflective quality to the surfaces and a slightly grimy, wet atmosphere typical of busy city streets after rainfall.","title":"Even before the dignitaries have left the reviewing stand, the sanitation department starts cleaning up at conclusion of Lake Front Festival opening day parade.
