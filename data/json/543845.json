{"path":"543845.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a group of people, possibly farmworkers, in a large agricultural field. The sky occupies the upper half of the frame and is filled with large, billowing clouds suggesting a slightly overcast day. The landscape behind the field features distant mountains providing a gentle rolling backdrop to the scene. Between the mountains and the field, there appears to be a small community or collection of buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple individuals are scattered across a vast field that shows rows of crops emerging from the soil. The people, both men and women, are seen bending over or standing as they tend to the crops, possibly inspecting or harvesting them. They are dressed in casual, loose-fitting clothes suitable for farm work.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the expanse and openness of the rural setting, highlighting the relationship between the people and the land they cultivate. The image also subtly registers a moment of rural life and agricultural practices, hinting at themes of community, labor, and the environment.","title":"Migrant workers in field","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["557478","553659","549050","555874","546964","558245","554054","543862","554056","543157","543481","544548","549036","554017","554108","558106"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["field","crop","register","tend","cultivate","fit","harvest","relationship","community","mountain"]}
