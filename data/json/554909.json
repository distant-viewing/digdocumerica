{"path":"554909.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, two young women are captured in what appears to be an intimate or social moment outdoors. The setting is likely in a park or a wooded area, with trees and grass visible in the softly focused background which hints at a peaceful setting. Both women exhibit casual, summer-appropriate attire.\n\nOn the left, a woman with medium-length brown hair styled in braids and wearing a plaid shirt is seen looking towards her friend with an expression that could be interpreted as either concern or curiosity. Her mouth is slightly open as if she is speaking or reacting to her friend.\n\nThe woman on the right has long blonde hair, adorned with a pale blue headband. She is focused on lighting or puffing a cigarette, evident from her pursed lips directed towards her hand, which is holding a lighter and a cigarette close to her face. Her demeanor suggests concentration or momentary preoccupation with the task at hand.\n\nThe moment captured, along with their expressions and actions, suggests a snapshot of daily life and the leisure activities among friends, with a essence of the era possibly being from the 1970s or 1980s based on their hairstyles and fashion. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a candid and possibly spontaneous interaction between friends in a casual setting.","title":"Two girls smoking pot during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas.
