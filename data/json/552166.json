{"path":"552166.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a water body, showing distinctive features that suggest dynamic interactions between human activities and the natural environment. There are two main elements in the image:\n\n1. **Boat trails**: The image predominantly features prominent white boat trails crisscrossing over a dark aquatic surface. These trails vary in their alignment but appear to be made by boats, some of which may still be in motion, their wake causing frothy trails in the water. The paths created by these boats intricate patterns, implying some are recent while others have begun to disperse.\n\n2. **Water texture and color**: The water’s surface has different textures and tones, ranging from dark black to lighter grays, indicating varying depths or perhaps different water conditions. The pattern of the airstream and the water itself suggests a dynamic, possibly tidal area, where sediment or cycled nutrients may be affecting the water’s surface coloration.\n\nIn addition to these, the photo’s perspective being from an aerial viewpoint showcases the expanse of the water body and the impact of human activity on it. There aren’t any distinct landmarks or clear sky views; the focus remains solely on the interaction between the boats and the water’s surface. Given the absence of shorelines or other reference points, the specific location remains indeterminate in the image, focusing viewer attention on the environmental and human elements visible.","title":"Motor boats stir up foamy pulp waste","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551564","552269","555701","551991","544758","545043","542697","546317","547674","544142","545904","555785","547276","550638","546945","545123"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["trails","boat","water","remain","surface","reference","alignment","crisscrosse","cycle","landmarks"]}
