{"path":"549739.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image depicts a large, sprawling landfill, heavily laden with various types of waste that include numerous plastic bags, boxes, discarded food containers, and assorted debris. The landfill stretches broadly across the forefront of the image, covering most of the view with dense clutter. The predominant colors in the waste are muted, featuring earthy tones mixed with scattered patches of color from various discarded items.\n\nIn the background, towering high-rise apartment buildings dominate the skyline. These buildings are densely packed and have a distinctly urban architectural style, suggesting a landscape that contrasts starkly with the mess and disorder of the landfill in the foreground. This juxtaposition perhaps underscores a stark division between living spaces and waste spaces within an urban setting.\n\nAbove, the sky is partly cloudy, with signs of blue visible and ample sunlight illuminating the scene, casting shadows and highlights across the piling mounds of garbage. This mixture of natural light with the artificial and disturbed terrain creates a dynamic but distressing visual impression, possibly evoking reflections on urban waste management practices and environmental impact.","title":"Overflowing city dump is an offense to the residents of co-op city (housing development in background)","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549747","549762","549748","544799","547899","548210","549957","550256","553039","549823","545299","544637","550801","557307","543832","549750"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","discard","disorder","division","clutter","apartment","garbage","practice","space"]}
