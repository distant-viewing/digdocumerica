{"path":"549736.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a historical reenactment scene outdoors, likely reflecting a period gathering or festival. In the foreground, a woman dressed in 19th-century attire—including a dark dress with green and gold trim, a light blue apron, and a black bonnet—sits on the grass engrossed in reading a book. She gestures with one hand while holding the book in the other, and around her are various period-appropriate accessories like a white pillow and additional fabrics.\n\nIn the background, several other reenactors in period costumes interact and prepare their attire. To the left, garments are draped over a clothesline, hinting at the makeshift camp-like setting. Among these individuals, a woman adjusts her dress, a man in white pants and shirt sits nearby, and another person in a blue bonnet and white apron strolls in their midst.\n\nAdditionally, on the right, a young boy, dressed in striped contemporary casual clothing, plays in the grass, drawing a contrast between the historical theme and modern participation. The setting seems to be a grassy area surrounded by trees, establishing a peaceful, picnic-like atmosphere at a historical event.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, June 24, 1973, is held on the Greenfield Village green adjoining the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn.
