{"path":"557548.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a landscape dominated by terraced fields and a mountainous backdrop. The terraces are carved into the hillside, showing neat, linear strips of cultivated land that are distinct in color, possibly due to different soil types or crop stages. The colors range from deep browns to lighter, sandy tones. These terraces are characterized by sharp, angular forms that contrast with the natural curves of the surrounding hills.\n\nThe vegetation varies, with dense greenery covering the untouched portions of the hills, suggesting a mix of wild shrubs and trees. The foreground of the image is lush with wildflowers and grasses, showing hints of white, pink, and yellow colors which add a touch of vibrancy to the scene.\n\nIn the center of the composition, there is a hill that rises prominently, topped with what appears to be a small structure or group of trees. No clear paths are visible, but the structure and terraces imply human activity and agricultural use.\n\nThe horizon shows more hills, which fade slightly into a hazy sky, suggesting either distance or atmospheric conditions like mist. The light in the picture indicates it might be taken in the late afternoon, as the sky has a soft, warm tone.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a serene and cultivated rural landscape, carefully shaped by agricultural practices, yet still surrounded by natural beauty.","title":"Terraced hillside near Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains on the western edge of Los Angeles portends imminent development. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549175","553978","554059","553977","553973","554027","555618","549138","544768","543763","543673","553972","554030","545313","550437","545040"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["terrace","cultivate","hill","carve","vibrancy","wildflower","practice","hillside","strip","crop"]}
