{"path":"554254.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a wintry scene at a ski resort. In the foreground, a ski lift carries several skiers upwards, their bodies positioned comfortably on the lift chairs, contrasting against the snow-covered slope beneath them. The slope itself is populated by various skiers in motion, descending the hill at different angles and speeds, leaving graceful trails in the snow. These skiers are relatively small in the frame, emphasizing the vastness of the hill.\n\nDense groups of evergreen trees flank the sides of the ski run, adding a rich touch of dark green that stands out against the predominantly white and gray color palette of the snow and overcast sky. The landscape slopes upward from left to right, enhancing the sense of an expansive mountainous area.\n\nThe sky is filled with dramatic clouds, suggesting chilly, possibly blustery weather conditions, which is typical for a ski resort setting. The overall mood is vibrant yet serene, typical of a day spent enjoying winter sports in a mountainous landscape.","title":"Carefully engineered ski trails require judicious tree cutting","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554247","554248","554234","554236","554253","550017","554245","550004","554235","554292","554257","554251","554249","554239","554242","554252"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["skier","resort","snow","lift","upward","slope","wintry","descende","angles","trails"]}
