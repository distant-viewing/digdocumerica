{"path":"544307.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a gravestone. The stone surface is engrained with carved text that provides details about an individual. The visible text includes what appears to be a name, \"MARIS J. MARI,\" followed by two dates: \"MAR 13 1906\" and \"NOV 13 1969,\" which likely indicate the birth and death dates of the deceased. Below these dates, the age of the person at demise, \"AGE 63,\" is also inscribed.\n\nOverlaying the text, there is a dark-colored rosary hanging vertically on the gravestone. The rosary features round beads, and at its end hangs a crucifix. The color contrast between the dark rosary and the light-colored stone accentuates its presence in the image.\n\nThe overall composition focuses mainly on the central portion of the gravestone, with the rosary as a significant element denoting perhaps religious faith or practice. The lighting and shadows play subtly across the surface details, maintaining a somber and reflective mood apt for a memorial setting.","title":"Gravestone in East Picou Cemetery.
