{"path":"544268.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph shows a large industrial crane reflected in a still body of water, presumably a pond or a small lake. The crane, situated in an industrial setting with visible infrastructure, including steel frames and conveyor belts, towers over the scene. It is primarily dark-colored, possibly black, with some bits of orange and is equipped with various cables and mechanisms typical of heavy lifting machinery.\n\nThe body of water captures a crisp reflection of the crane, its arm, and some surrounding structures, creating a symmetrical composition between the sky above and the water below. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThe foreground of the image consists of verdant greenery at the water's edge, including tall grasses and a few clusters of small white flowers. This natural framing adds contrast to the industrial equipment in the background, emphasizing the interplay between nature and human-engineered elements.\n\nOverall, the image presents a juxtaposition between industrial development and the natural environment, highlighted through the reflection and the surrounding greenery. It encapsulates a calm yet stark reminder of industry's imposition on natural landscapes.","title":"Texaco rig near Bayou Gauche","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554545","545655","548773","548559","552040","551563","547223","547615","546974","545648","544157","549800","550874","545858","553027","545979"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","reflection","reminder","engineer","mechanism","conveyor","greenery","framing","lift","water"]}
