{"path":"542870.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal landscape under a muted light, possibly during late afternoon or early evening. The composition is layered with several elements that underscore a peaceful, natural setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a body of water, likely part of a bay or coastal inlet, shows two white and red buoys gently floating. Positioned near the middle of the water is a small, sturdy-looking boat with a cabin, appearing anchored or moored calmly.\n\nBeyond the water, the shoreline is lined with a variety of green vegetation, including dense clusters of trees that seem to form a protective barrier along the coast. A notable structure, possibly a dock or small pier, extends over the water, connected to a building that appears to be constructed on stilts, suggesting it might be a functional piece of coastal infrastructure, such as a boat dock or research station.\n\nThe middle ground reveals undulating fields and open spaces, patched with various shades of green and brown, indicating agricultural use or natural grasslands. This area is sparsely developed, with what looks like small buildings or farm units dotting the expanse, adding a touch of human presence without overwhelming the natural vista.\n\nThe background is dominated by rolling hills and mountains, lush with verdant hues, culminating in a smooth, rounded mountaintop that fades into the hazy sky. This mountainous backdrop adds a grand scale and sense of isolation to the scene, emphasizing the vast, open environment.\n\nThe overall aesthetics of the image are rustic and quaint, characterized by a saturation that suggests either the time of day or a vintage-style photo effect. The scene conveys a tranquility typical of secluded coastal regions, where human activity integrates minimally with the expansive beauty of nature.","title":"Scenic overlook slated for housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542918","555694","542907","542993","554102","552192","545277","550361","542910","554101","557508","543068","556923","542877","542908","544713"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["dock","stilt","buoy","vista","grassland","boat","coast","saturation","water","bay"]}
