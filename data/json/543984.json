{"path":"543984.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a bird's eye view of a rocky tidal pool, depicting an interplay of earthy tones and aqua blues. The scene is dominated by rugged, irregularly shaped rocks and stones, ranging in colors from deep brown to dusty red, all interspersed and surrounded by patches of water gleaming with a striking turquoise hue. These watery areas vary in depth and clarity, some appearing more opaque and sediment-filled, while others are crisp and clear, reflecting light.\n\nThe interstitial spaces among the rocks are filled with a variety of textures and colors, including areas of sandy beige and clusters of smaller stones, contributing to a richly textured landscape. The composition of the picture suggests it is taken from above and possibly during a time when the tide is low, allowing the water to settle calmly in the natural crevices formed by the rock formations.\n\nThere are no human activities or visible flora and fauna in this scene, highlighting the natural geological and aqueous elements of the tidal pool environment. The overall effect is a serene, untouched natural tableau that evokes a sense of tranquility and rugged beauty.","title":"Waste minerals in water stain rocks near the Phelps Dodge smelter and mine.","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["543183","543135","547471","550726","547486","543292","543186","543289","549353","555626","542583","545095","543309","543142","547638","543295"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["pool","rock","fauna","stone","crevice","tableau","tide","beige","sediment","flora"]}
