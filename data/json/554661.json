{"path":"554661.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene by a water body during what appears to be autumn, given the coloration of the trees in the background. Three individuals are engaged in activities related to a canoe by the side of the water.\n\n1. **People**: There are three people. Two men and a woman. The woman, standing on the left, is dressed in a striped, long-sleeve top and trousers, watching the activities beside her. The first man, in the middle, is wearing a red sweater and darker pants and is stepping into or stabilizing the canoe. The man on the right is clad in a brown jacket and darker pants and appears to be either adjusting something inside the canoe or preparing to step into it.\n\n2. **Canoe**: A wooden canoe that features a light varnished finish and is partly submerged in the water. The canoe seems well-crafted, with visible ribs and a wide beam, suggesting it is designed for stability and perhaps for carrying more than one person.\n\n3. **Background and Surroundings**: Behind the people is a waterfront cottage-style setting. The cottage has white trim and a classical porch-column design, painted in white, suggesting a cozy, rustic aesthetic. There are autumnal trees with leaves in shades of yellow and green, hinting at a temperate climate. The area directly around the people includes both rocky and built elements like a small constructed stone wall and wooden structures adjoining the water, which could be part of a private property or a recreational facility.\n\n4. **Activity and Composition**: The activity involves the preparation or maintenance of the canoe for entering the water, which could suggest a recreational or travel-related intent. The photographâ€™s composition centers on human interaction with the canoe and the natural setting, evoking a sense of leisure and outdoor enjoyment. The positioning of the people suggests a coordinated effort to manage the canoe, either unloading it from the shore or preparing for a ride.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene, picturesque moment of outdoor recreation, likely on a cool, bright day judging from the lighting and attire of the individuals.","title":"Loading an adirondack guide boat on lower ausable lake","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["544980","549996","550767","546880","553806","558072","552982","544759","544260","553403","547213","550659","550822","550978","551546","544770"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","step","prepare","adjoin","intent","people","stability","water","stabilize","unload"]}
