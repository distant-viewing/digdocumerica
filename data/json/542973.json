{"path":"542973.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic yet cluttered coastal environment during what appears to be sunset. The image is focused on a large accumulation of driftwood and assorted debris, which is piled up at the forefront of the image. This debris consists of a variety of wood in different shapes and sizes, some pieces markedly larger and longer than others, suggesting they might be from trees or sizable wooden structures. There are also smaller, unidentifiable objects entangled within this wooden jumble, possibly including trash or seaweed.\n\nBeyond the cluttered foreground, the photo opens up to a rugged coastline, featuring jagged rocks and outcroppings that jut into a turbulent, foamy sea. The water is in motion, indicating possibly strong currents or waves crashing against the rocks. The horizon is visible with a slight glow of the vanishing sun, diffusing a soft, warm light that contrasts with the shadowed foreground. The sky is a muted tone, suggesting dusk, with a general sense of calmness above the dynamic and somewhat chaotic scene below.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the natural beauty and ruggedness of the coastal landscape with the human-impacted scene of washed-up debris, possibly hinting at environmental concerns related to oceanic and coastal pollution. The image invokes a sense of serene desolation, with the absence of any human presence or wildlife in the scene.","title":"Rusty metal mixes with driftwood","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["550197","542889","545108","543052","543075","542890","543069","544989","547602","542888","545111","542886","542887","557573","548740","555468"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["debris","outcropping","vanish","seaweed","driftwood","crash","jut","wash","invoke","ruggedness"]}
