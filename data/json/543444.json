{"path":"543444.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and picturesque river landscape. The winding river is the central element in the image and is surrounded by lush greenery. Both banks of the river are lined with dense forests of tall pine trees, interspersed with some lighter green deciduous trees, enhancing the variety in the foliage. The river appears calm with a smooth surface, reflecting slight ripples and some sunlight.\n\nIn the river, near the center of the image, there are two people in a small boat, possibly a canoe or a kayak. It appears as though they are engaged in a leisurely activity, possibly paddling or fishing.\n\nThe backdrop features majestic mountains partially obscured by mist or haze, suggesting that this scene might be set in the early morning. The mountains loom in the distance, adding a sense of depth and grandeur to the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition is balanced and peaceful, with natural colors and lighting that convey a tranquil, outdoor setting ideal for nature lovers and outdoor activities.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550989","550988","550000","550656","554762","550773","551217","554471","551209","550839","544861","557972","555075","550208","550845","550680"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","ligh","kayak","paddling","canoe","winding","loom","mountain","ideal","forests"]}
