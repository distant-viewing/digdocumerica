{"path":"542791.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene, likely taken in a coniferous woodland. The composition is centered on a prominently featured tree trunk in the foreground which has a rough texture and visible patches of moss, indicating a damp environment. Notably, there's a distinct marking on this tree, perhaps a trail marker or natural discoloration, in a yellowish hue.\n\nBeyond the central tree, the background subtly reveals a densely wooded area filled with similar types of trees, predominantly conifers. These trees display rich, dark green foliage, contributing to a sense of lushness in the environment. The ground is strewn with organic debris, including fallen branches, twigs, and a scattering of rocks, suggesting a natural, perhaps slightly untamed forest setting.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears to be natural, likely filtered through the canopy creating areas of shadow and muted light, enhancing the woodland's mysterious and somewhat moody ambiance. This scene could be a part of a hiking trail or a protected natural area, given the untouched appearance of the surroundings and the trail indication on the tree. The photo does not include any human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing the tranquility and isolation of this forested area.","title":"The yellow \"X\" is to save the tree.","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["555116","554958","554999","542753","554976","546947","554961","555118","558082","558012","555057","554720","542725","554425","555000","554990"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trail","woodland","tree","scattering","lushness","discoloration","indication","twig","forest","conifer"]}
