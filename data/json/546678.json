{"path":"546678.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is a high-angle view of an urban area featuring prominent transportation infrastructure and diverse buildings predominantly in an urban setting. It captures a curved, multilane highway bustling with cars during what appears to be daytime. This highway, set on an elevated road structure, dominates the foreground and middle ground of the image, illustrating a major artery of the city transport system. \n\nTo the left, parallel to the highway, is a series of high-density residential blocks; these are typical of urban housing with repetitive, closely packed architectural patterns. Beyond the residential area, one can see an expansive water body, adding a natural element to the urban landscape.\n\nThe foreground on the right features a combination of smaller, red-brick buildings with gabled and flat roofs, characteristic of a more traditional architectural style, possibly serving commercial or administrative functions. These buildings represent a stark contrast in scale and style to the residential blocks.\n\nIn the distant background, amidst the dense tree coverage, notable landmarks such as a grand domed-building are faintly visible, serving as iconic symbols likely important to the cityâ€™s identity.\n\nOverall, the photo is rich in detail, capturing the bustling dynamics of city life and the meticulous urban planning of transport integrated with residential and commercial zones. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive overview of the urban landscape's structure and utilization.","title":"Southwest Freeway, looking west","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555743","555781","546617","547765","546707","549478","546574","548392","549476","553001","546726","553838","547764","550153","546713","555745"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","block","city","transport","multilane","serve","identity","bustle","overview","coverage"]}
