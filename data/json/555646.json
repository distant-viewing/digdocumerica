{"path":"555646.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a large, white barn prominently positioned in the foreground, bearing the name \"TWIN MAPLE STOCK FARM\" and \"F.D. CULBERTSON\" in black letters on the gable end. The barn is a classic structure with multiple doors on the front, all closed, and several windows near the roofline. There is a smaller white structure attached to the front left side of the barn, which might be an entry porch or utility shed.\n\nAdjacent to the barn, there's another building partially visible on the right-hand side, appearing to be a white house or facility, enhancing the functional farm atmosphere. \n\nThe barn is surrounded by a well-maintained green lawn, enclosed by a traditional white fence that parallels a gravel path or road. This idyllic rural setting includes a rolling hill landscape in the background dotted with several small trees and cattle grazing in the distance. The meadow extends to a tree line and a high earth mound, possibly a hill or mining site, visible in the distant background.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, contributing to the peaceful and serene farm view showcased in the photograph. Power lines stretching across the horizon suggest a connection to modern utilities despite the secluded setting. Overall, the image captures a rural farming operation, likely specialized in livestock judging by the title on the barn and the presence of grazing animals.","title":"Strip mined land owned by coal companies reaches the edge of this farm near Chandlersville, in southeastern Ohio","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["552537","549194","557991","550019","542801","548065","555635","542805","556963","552462","547304","555571","554806","547447","556586","555577"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","graze","farm","utility","specialize","judging","title","roofline","entry","cattle"]}
