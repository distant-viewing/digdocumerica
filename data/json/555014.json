{"path":"555014.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed and intimate look at a natural scene presumably on a forest floor. The focal point of the image is a large patch of bright yellow slime mold, which appears somewhat fluffy or sponge-like, growing amid the natural debris. Surrounding the slime mold are richly green, small, fern-like plants that are dense with intricate leaf patterns, adding a lively and fresh contrast to the scene.\n\nIn addition to the plants, there are bits of dead leaves and thin twigs scattered around, which provide a texture and underscore the natural, unmanaged aspect of the environment. The detailed texture and color variations—from the dark, earthy browns of the debris to the vibrant yellow and lush green—create a composition that speaks to the diversity and interconnectivity of forest ecosystems. The overall ambiance evokes a sense of quiet and the intricate balance of life within a forest setting.","title":"Fungus growing on dead alder leaves, and fir and hemlock needles on Green Mountain in Kitsap County","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557595","555026","558076","555183","555181","555018","550484","557624","554993","555093","554991","554571","551373","557620","543147","545271"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","addition","fern","twig","debris","leaf","plant","balance","diversity","variation"]}
