{"path":"547775.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene characterized by a disheveled environment. In the foreground, there is a large amount of household trash scattered on the ground. The rubbish includes a variety of items like food wrappers, cardboard pieces, cups, and other miscellaneous debris. There is also a large, overturned trash can among the litter.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's an old wooden building, seemingly a house, painted white with a porch. The house appears worn and somewhat neglected, with an overgrown yard. Behind the house, two vintage cars are parked. One is a 1960s or 1970s model, possibly a Pontiac, which is partially covered and looks to be in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe entire scene gives an impression of a low-income or economically neglected rural or suburban area. The presence of abundant trash suggests a lack of municipal services or an overflow situation, and the overall setting conveys a juxtaposition of domestic life amidst disorder. The scene could be evoking themes related to poverty, neglect, or environmental issues. There is a general sense of decline and disrepair, both in terms of the physical state of the vehicles and buildings, and in the uncared-for appearance of the surroundings.","title":"House in a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood town of Frisco, just north of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552102","556640","550264","549785","547988","552750","548131","546962","544809","551115","549786","557345","554536","547024","550246","549833"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["trash","disrepair","house","state","income","disorder","rubbish","decline","household","situation"]}
