{"path":"548931.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a broad landscape that appears to be in a cold, possibly winter environment judging by the presence of snow and ice. The central feature of the image is a large winding river, cutting through the terrain from the top to the lower part of the image. Along one side of the river, there is a significant human presence indicated by structured, orderly settlements, roads, and some industrial-looking areas with large buildings and storage tanks.\n\nNotably, large patches of land adjacent to the settlements are sectioned into rectangles, some of which are vivid red, suggesting either the use of infrared photography to highlight vegetation, or these areas are marked for certain agricultural practices or land use purposes. The terrain outside these developed and sectioned areas looks rugged and sparsely vegetated, with some areas covered in snow.\n\nThe image is captured from a high altitude, providing a comprehensive overview of the interaction between natural landscapes and human development near the river. The river itself acts as a natural boundary, with significant development on one side while the other remains more untouched and natural. The angular shapes of the parcels of land suggest purposeful division for land management or agricultural planning.","title":"The Colorado river feeds crops and vegetation (dark areas) town of needles in foreground","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548943","550392","550530","555685","547227","557506","547724","547990","549081","543735","550534","547995","555753","550861","550623","557420"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["land","settlement","river","parcel","snow","development","shapes","division","section","overview"]}
