{"path":"552430.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a muddy, wetland setting with distinct, colorful runoff streams. The foreground features a stream of water that has a reddish tint, appearing almost rust-colored. This stream winds its way through sandy, muddied ground that has patches of water and clustered vegetation. The majority of the vegetation is in the form of tall, thin reeds or grasses which predominantly have a dried, beige color, yet some maintain a green hue, suggesting a mix of live and dead plant matter. The background is dense with these reeds, forming a somewhat tangled mass that suggests a natural, untamed environment.\n\nThe sunlight or lighting conditions cast clear, sharp shadows, indicating that the picture was possibly taken during a bright day. There are no visible animals or human activity in the image, reinforcing the untouched, natural aspect of the scene. The composition and the vivid color of the water may suggest some environmental concerns, such as pollution or natural mineral presence affecting the water's coloration. The setting is secluded and portrays a raw aspect of a wetland ecosystem.","title":"After strip mining, a finely pulverized coal, or \"slurry,\" is left on the stripped land. Water that runs off from the slurry, and from the mining operation itself, can produce colorful, but often deadly, effects on the flora in its path, as in this scene near a mine in St. David, in Fulton County.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["544858","553434","550341","553427","555626","545513","545033","558009","552062","554778","551077","543819","544765","557498","546125","552055"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","reed","wetland","aspect","runoff","matter","mass","tint","majority","coloration"]}
