{"path":"554505.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of hikers on a rugged, rocky mountain summit. The foreground features smooth, weathered rock surfaces with subtle indentations and a greenish hue, possibly due to moss or lichen coverage. In the center of the image, a young woman is running towards the camera, appearing energetic, with a determined expression. She wears a sleeveless top, shorts, and hiking boots, accessorized with a headband, and is in motion, her hair caught in the breeze.\n\nIn the background, two other hikers with large, external frame backpacks are standing and observing. Further along the rocky expanse, two more individuals are walking away from the viewpoint, each carrying a backpack, suggesting a group trek. The sky is overcast, hinting at cool weather conditions, with a muted, cloudy background that evokes a sense of altitude and open space. The overall atmosphere is adventurous, with the hikers engaged in exploring or traveling across the challenging terrain.","title":"Backpacking church group at the summit of Mount Marcy, highest peak in New York State, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543382","543381","554508","545785","554509","554503","543383","543510","544305","545768","545700","545781","543385","554504","554672","554558"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","backpack","summit","headband","lichen","coverage","hiking","breeze","group","moss"]}
