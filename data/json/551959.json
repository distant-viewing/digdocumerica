{"path":"551959.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set against a bright, partly cloudy sky. The immediate foreground is a sandy shore curving along the edge of a body of waterâ€”perhaps a river or a lake. This waterfront extends to the left, leading to a distant industrial backdrop. On the shore, several figures are engaging in leisure activities. Some individuals are walking, while others seem to be involved in play or other beach activities.\n\nDominating the background is a large, imposing factory or power plant building. It is a large, block-like structure with a dark facade, featuring multiple tall smokestacks that rise distinctly against the sky. These stacks appear inactive as there is no visible smoke or steam. The industrial edifice contrasts sharply with the natural elements in the scene, juxtaposing human industrial activity with the calmness of the waterfront setting.\n\nThe overall composition suggests a narrative about human interaction with industrial and natural environments, hinting at possible themes of urban encroachment, environmental impact, or leisure in industrial areas. The lighting in the photograph gives a vividness to the sky and clouds, adding a dynamic and almost dramatic effect to the overall ambiance.","title":"Calumet park (far south side) on lake Michigan commonwealth edison stateline plant in background","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["544328","550937","552194","544527","551576","546083","552210","545996","552190","545979","549220","545013","551519","552179","546007","547539"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["waterfro","shore","leisure","encroachment","not","calmness","vividness","block","steam","smokestack"]}
