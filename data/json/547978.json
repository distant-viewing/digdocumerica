{"path":"547978.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a solitary vehicle axle and two tires left abandoned in a desolate landscape. The vehicle parts are rusty, suggesting they have been exposed to the elements for an extended period. The axle is upright, with one tire attached at each end, and it rests directly on the beige, sandy ground, which is speckled with small stones and patches of dry vegetation.\n\nThe background is a vast, flat expanse that stretches to the horizon, appearing almost uninhabited and barren. The sky is overcast, with a dull lighting that enhances the feeling of desolation in the scene. There are no buildings or other objects in the visible area, emphasizing the isolation and abandonment captured in this image. The overall mood is bleak and forlorn, highlighting themes of neglect and decay.","title":"Lonely auto axle cast off in landfill operation at spring creek, on Jamaica bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553009","544060","553007","545304","542590","543354","549107","547587","553010","552998","555882","545029","552997","552996","547979","545295"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tire","speckle","desolation","vehicle","abandon","end","abandonment","period","attach","feeling"]}
