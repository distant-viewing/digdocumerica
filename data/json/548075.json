{"path":"548075.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a bustling marina or dock area with a number of small boats and activities visible. The marina extends outward into the water from the left side of the image, composed of a long dock lined with boats on either side. The boats vary in size, design, and color, ranging from small white motorboats to larger, more colorful cabin cruisers.\n\nSeveral of the boats are covered with protective tarps or canvas, suggesting they are moored for storage or protected against weather elements. There's a cluster of buildings with red roofs located at the juncture where the dock meets the land, providing either storage or operational facilities for the marina. Beyond the docked boats, there are small watercraft occupied by people, actively moving through the water, either departing or arriving at the dock. \n\nThe background is dominated by the wider body of water, reflecting a grayish-blue hue which indicates cloudy or overcast weather. On the left side of the photo, a small piece of land juts into the water, where logs are piled, suggesting some logging activity or storage. The composition of the photograph, taken from above, provides a comprehensive view of the human-nature interface at a marine station, highlighting a vivid scene of maritime activity.","title":"Salmon fishing thrives on the Willamette River at Oregon City, right next to the pulp and paper mills of Publisher's Paper Company and Crown-Zellerbach Corporation.
