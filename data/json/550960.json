{"path":"550960.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity at a waterfront location. In the foreground, there is a large flat barge on murky water, laden with heaps of a black granular substance, which could be coal or ore. There are visible bollards on the deck of the barge, used for mooring lines. The water has a brownish color, suggesting possible pollution or sediment.\n\nIn the middle ground, powerful streams of water mixed with a white, steam-like emission are forcefully ejecting from two separate points in a concrete and earth barrier. This barrier appears to be part of a larger man-made structure for water control or waste management, possibly related to the industrial facility in the background.\n\nThe background features an extensive industrial plant structure with multiple levels of metal frameworks, pipes, and enclosed areas. The environment shows signs of heavy industrial use with no visible vegetation. The structures are somewhat aged and worn, which, along with the visible emissions, suggests an industry with significant environmental impacts.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a scene of industrial operation, focusing on the transportation of bulk materials and the management of water or waste, highlighting interactions between industrial activities and the natural environment.","title":"Hot water flows into the Kanawha River from the FMC Corporation's South Charleston plant.
