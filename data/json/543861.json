{"path":"543861.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large excavation site, likely a mine or quarry. The main feature of the photograph is a vast, irregularly shaped pit with steep, terraced walls. These terraces appear in a geometric pattern, indicating organized and systematic excavation activities. The pit dominates the center of the image, surrounded by darker and lighter areas, possibly representing exposed earth and shadows cast by the raised ridges.\n\nA broad road—separated by a thin divider—traverses the bottom portion of the image, running generally parallel to a curving boundary of the excavation site. Along this road, a few vehicles are visibly parked or in motion, suggesting ongoing operations.\n\nAdjacent to the excavated area, there is a collection of small buildings and possibly equipment storage areas. This setup suggests an operational base for the mining or quarrying activities.\n\nThe backdrop shows a contrasting landscape of lush greenery, including patches of forest and grassland, which provides a stark visual contrast to the stark, scarred earth of the excavation zone. This surrounding vegetation hints at the broader geographical setting being relatively rich in natural features.\n\nOverall, the image offers a clear visual representation of extensive human intervention in a natural landscape, typical of mining or quarrying operations seen worldwide, documenting the intersection of industrial activity and environmental impact.","title":"Strip mining at Peabody Coal Co","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543674","544498","544785","543857","544064","555614","550573","549148","555622","544111","550568","551187","544096","550572","544112","551204"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["excavation","pit","mining","quarry","earth","terrace","site","grassland","mine","operation"]}
