{"path":"553240.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor setting where two figures are present. On the left, there's a large, caricature-style inflatable figure. This figure has overly exaggerated features, with a white and pink color scheme. It features a distorted face with makeup and a pale complexion, a bulbous nose, pink cheeks, and projecting eyelashes. The figure wears a dress-like costume adorned with golden touches and a necklace, a top hat on its head, and has outstretched arms, possibly simulating a dance or dynamic pose.\n\nOn the right, a woman is seated beside this inflatable figure. She appears to be enjoying the scene, possibly watching a street performance or public event. The woman has long, straight brown hair, sunglasses, and is wearing a dark blue, casual outfit with a patterned cloth over one shoulder, typical of 1970s fashion.\n\nThe background suggests this scene takes place in a public, possibly urban, area filled with trees and possibly other onlookers or street furniture, though these elements are somewhat obscured and out of focus. The lighting indicates it's a sunny day, contributing to the vibrancy of the colors in the image.","title":"August brings the \"D'aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'aug Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people. This piece of \"sewn sculpture\" was carried through the downtown streets, attracting the curious to the square.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553266","553761","553200","558295","550079","553250","553309","556216","551689","551019","553251","549582","553321","551808","553231","553280"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["figure","public","cheek","complexion","costume","dance","necklace","nose","onlooker","cloth"]}
