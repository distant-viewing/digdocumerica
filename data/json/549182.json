{"path":"549182.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a rural landscape characterized by rolling hills and a vast expanse of open fields with minimal vegetation. The terrain is uneven and primarily covered with what appears to be dry grass or crop remnants, indicating possibly plowed fields ready for sowing or after harvest. Prominent in the scene are patterns on the fields created possibly by farming machinery, displaying parallel ridges that follow the contour of the hills.\n\nA single road winds through the landscape, its surface of gravel or a similar material contrasting with the surrounding muted earth tones. The road serves as a clear human-made element, leading the eye across the scene and dividing the frame visually. On the left side of the road, there are sporadic patches of denser vegetation and trees that offer a bit of greenery to the otherwise subdued color palette dominated by browns and dusty greens.\n\nIn the distance, tree-covered hills form a background under a partially cloudy sky. The clouds cast shadows over some parts of the hills, adding depth and variety to the illumination in the photograph.\n\nThis image projects a sense of serene desolation and highlights the impact of human activity on a natural landscape. The overall mood is quiet and somewhat melancholic, evoking a sense of isolation and the vastness of agricultural lands.\n","title":"Old spoil piles are flattened and planted in an attempt at reclamation.
