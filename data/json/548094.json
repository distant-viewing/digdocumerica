{"path":"548094.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a striking view of a majestic, snow-capped mountain dominating the frame from a middle to distant viewpoint. The mountain is covered prominently by snow patches interspersed with exposed dark rocky surfaces, showing typical signs of glacial formations and sharp ridges. The peak of the mountain is fairly conical with a pronounced steep slope.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a lush, verdant landscape with a rich tapestry of densely packed trees that vary in shades of green. Below the tree line, the area transitions into a more cultivated landscape, with clear patches of agricultural fields visible. Small structures that resemble farmhouses can be seen scattered throughout this cultivated area, with a few having noticeable reflective or metallic roofs catching the light.\n\nThe overall composition creates a rich contrast between the vivid greens of the forest and the stark whiteness of the snow on the mountain, providing a beautiful natural scene that is serene and powerful. The sky above the mountain is a clear, deep blue, enhancing the prominence of the mountain in the overall landscape.","title":"Hood river valley and the northeast face of mt.
