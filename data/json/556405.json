{"path":"556405.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and pastoral landscape, where man-made features integrate with natural surroundings. In the foreground and running through the center of the image is a highway, appearing freshly paved and featuring multiple lanes, which curve gently around a rise. A single red car travels on the road, providing a contrast in color and a sense of scale.\n\nTo the left of the highway, there is a vibrant red barn and a pasture delineated by a simple fence. The area around the barn shows a small patch of red soil, and a few trees dot the green field. Beyond the barn, several more agrarian structures are visible, including a tall white silo, additional outbuildings, and smaller silos, all indicative of a working farm.\n\nThe landscape on both sides of the highway is primarily open field, showing early signs of spring growth in the green grass. Trees line the horizon in patches and clumps, with some evidence of other distant buildings. The sky above is predominantly overcast with hints of blue peering through, suggesting a cool, peaceful day.\n\nThe composition of the photograph—with the road leading into the distance and the mix of natural and man-made elements—gives a feeling of serene rural life, intersected by the path of modern infrastructure. It evokes themes of travel, rural tranquility, and the intersection of human activity and the natural environment.","title":"Bluegrass Parkway in eastern Kentucky near Ashland and the border with West Virginia","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549257","547300","547354","549235","555635","555630","554800","547302","554070","554031","547316","554130","557748","554819","555818","558100"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","highway","silo","pasture","evidence","outbuilding","clump","field","intersection","road"]}
