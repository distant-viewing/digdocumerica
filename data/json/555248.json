{"path":"555248.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a science laboratory. On the left side of the frame, there is bulky lab equipment, which includes dials and buttons, and an attached paper roll apparently recording data or displaying output graphs. This device is marked with numbered scales and has several plots drawn across it.\n\nIn the foreground and atop this equipment, various scientific glassware items are visible, including flasks and a funnel, perhaps used for chemical experiments or sample analysis.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a man wearing a white lab coat is actively engaged in research. He appears to be handling a test tube or a small container, closely examining its contents. The man has a mustache and medium-length hair, typical of the styles from past decades.\n\nThe background is clean and simple, mainly consisting of a white wall with a touch of an industrial or functional look, indicated by the small segment of a blue panel or machinery.\n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a detailed and attentive scientific exploration or experiment is in progress, typical of a research or industrial laboratory setting. This vintage image captures the essence of scientific research from a time when technology was less digital and more manually operated.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency laboratory technician at the Mississippi Test Facility at Bay St. Louis spots pesticides samples on a \"thin layer\" plate to check them for contamination.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555249","549333","546284","549608","555250","542665","555280","555265","555281","546277","542666","546285","549612","546278","549604","555251"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["research","experiment","lab","laboratory","output","glassware","flask","funnel","science","test"]}
