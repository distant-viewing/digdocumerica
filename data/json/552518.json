{"path":"552518.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts the front of a rustic-looking country store with a vintage charm. The building features weathered wooden siding and a large glass window pane front. Across the bottom front of the building are several vibrant advertisements promoting drinks such as Pepsi and Frostie.\n\nAbove the promotional signs, the central part of the store includes two doors with wooden frames and glass panes. Various promotional and product posters are visible in the windows, including one for \"Dixie Better Feeds,\" and there seems to be a sign for bird seed as well. Another notable advertisement promises, \"We sell and recommend Wayne Pet Foods.\"\n\nNear the left door is a gasoline pump with the logo \"HP\" and a registration plate that reads, \"void after October 31, 1972.\" A large rectangular Pepsi advertisement clock hangs on the right side of the front face, showing the time as approximately 10:40. Below the clock, in the window, additional advertisements hint at the variety of goods sold, such as mechanical merchandise and animal feeds.\n\nSitting in front of the store is a humble wooden bench for visitors to use, inviting a pause or restful wait. The general atmosphere evoked is one of a bygone era of small-town commerce, invoking a sense of nostalgia and simplicity.","title":"Du Quoin gas station","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["557679","552517","555377","555640","556368","547805","546973","555517","552513","554784","544373","549870","554036","558281","547866","544113"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["advertisement","store","clock","pane","front","feed","seed","door","window","merchandise"]}
