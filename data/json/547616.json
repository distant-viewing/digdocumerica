{"path":"547616.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a rustic outdoor scene dominated by tall, dense grasses under low light conditions. The ambient light highlights the edges of the grass, giving it a reddish hue against a darker background. A central path, formed either by the passage of people or animals, creates a natural aisle that recedes into the distance through this grassy terrain. The lighting creates a contrast that emphasizes the texture of the grass while the path leads the eye through the composition. The background beyond the grass appears dark and indistinct, allowing the focus to remain on the texture and form of the grass along the path. The overall mood is somber and isolated, conveying a sense of quiet and solitude.","title":"Dune buggy tracks across the dune","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["557559","545069","552504","546154","557104","551370","552312","550489","545495","544884","553084","557191","557165","545588","546559","549233"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","path","aisle","recede","form","passage","remain","isolate","texture","animal"]}
