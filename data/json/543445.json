{"path":"543445.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scene set in a dense forest, dominated by large, tall trees which feature prominently. On the left side of the image, a massive tree trunk commands attention with its rough bark texture. The trunk is so vast that its entire width is not visible in the frame, highlighting the tree's grandeur relative to the human figures.\n\nIn the center background, a dirt path cuts gently through the forest floor, scattered with patches of sunlight that filter through the dense canopy above. This path leads to two figures, who appear small in comparison to the immense trees surrounding themâ€”emphasizing the grand scale and untamed nature of the environment.\n\nThe sunlight illuminates the forest scene with dapples of light, creating a play of light and shadows on the ground and the foliage, enhancing the serene and peaceful ambiance of a forest in full bloom. The overall composition is vertical and narrow, guiding the eye from the towering tree on the left towards the sky peering through the leafy overhead canopy.","title":"California -- Colwell Redwood State Park, near Santa Cruz","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550791","542725","554967","543446","546947","554966","555118","554393","554394","553574","542569","542931","553576","542958","554990","555120"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","canopy","trunk","path","comparison","tree","figure","width","bloom","sunlight"]}
