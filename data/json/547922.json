{"path":"547922.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene of soil excavation or possibly construction material handling. The main focus is a large blue dumping truck with its cargo bed lifted vertically, appearing to be in the process of offloading a mound of dark sandy soil. This load seems thick and clumpy, indicating that it might be somewhat moist. The truckâ€™s body is predominantly dusty and weather-worn, showing signs of heavy usage.\n\nIn the background, there's a smaller yellow bulldozer or tractor on the flat terrain, appearing to be stationed or possibly maneuvering towards the dumping site. To the right side of the frame, an individual in work attire can be seen walking towards the edge, likely overseeing the unloading process.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is open and flat, with extensive tire tracks crisscrossing the ground, suggesting frequent vehicle movement in this area. The ground is uneven and covered in similar dark soil, hinting that the location may be a construction site, quarry, or an area undergoing significant ground modification.\n\nThe overall environment lacks vegetation and buildings, giving it an isolated and utilitarian appearance suited for industrial operations. The light is a bit dim, possibly capturing the scene during an overcast day, highlighting the stark and functional nature of the activities involved.","title":"Tractors dump sand at Breezy Point to prevent shore erosion and protect homes of the Breezy Point Cooperative, a seasonal residential community on Jamaica Bay.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550270","542538","550266","555636","547232","547243","555638","544138","547104","545677","549956","544135","542539","544099","553041","555866"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["soil","dumping","truck","modification","quarry","process","site","unloading","construction","undergo"]}
