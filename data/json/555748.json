{"path":"555748.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from an urban setting, featuring a multilevel car parking facility in the foreground. Stacked on large, metal, yellow storage racks are various cars, displaying an assortment from different eras but mainly dating from the mid-to-late 20th century. The vehicles range in color and model, with one prominently featuring a logo \"GM\" on its side, suggesting it is manufactured by General Motors.\n\nIn the background, a series of old, weathered apartment buildings with multiple windows are visible. The architecture shows signs of aging and urban wear. In front of these buildings, a multi-lane road can be seen, though the traffic is light with only a few cars visible.\n\nThe setting appears to be under an overcast sky, giving the colors a muted, cold feel which enhances the industrial and somewhat gritty aesthetic of the scene. The area is devoid of visible greenery, emphasizing the urban environment. The photograph has a historic feel, reflecting a time when environmental and spatial challenges in growing metropolitan areas were addressed with pragmatic, industrial solutions like vertical car storage.","title":"The Bronx in Manhattan, New York.
