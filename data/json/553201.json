{"path":"553201.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures a lively outdoor scene featuring a group of people who are gathered in a plaza. At the center of the photograph is a modern concrete building structure with large windows, reflecting a typical urban architectural style. On top of this structure, there is a group of musicians performing on a balcony-like platform, visibly holding instruments such as drums and a guitar.\n\nFacing the musicians, a crowd of diverse individuals has congregated to enjoy the performance. The viewers stand on a spacious pedestrian area and appear engaged with the music, some looking directly at the band, while others chat among themselves. The attire of the crowd reflects a casual and perhaps seasonal fashion, with some wearing shorts, summer dresses, and light shirts.\n\nThe scene is framed by lush green tree foliage on the right side, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment. The atmosphere of the photograph suggests a warm, sunny day, likely conducive to outdoor activities and gatherings. The overall layout of the picture, with its focus on the interplay between the performers and their audience, captures a moment of cultural enjoyment and communal interaction in an urban setting.","title":"Rock group performing at fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553297","551656","550076","551770","553296","551708","553286","551012","553232","553264","553324","557264","551798","551771","550302","553287"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["musician","crowd","performer","congregate","guitar","chat","drum","music","plaza","audience"]}
