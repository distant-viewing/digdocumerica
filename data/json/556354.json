{"path":"556354.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The image depicts a dilapidated red metal structure, akin to a small shed or outhouse, situated in a natural, overgrown setting. The structure is boxy, possibly constructed from corrugated metal, and has a rough rectangular shape. It features a single door, which is slightly ajar, exposing the dark interior. The door is equipped with a simple metal latch. The structure's red paint is peeling and faded, suggesting age and weathering.\n\nThe surroundings of the structure are overgrown with wild grass, shrubs, and slender trees, indicating that the area does not receive regular maintenance. The ground is uneven and covered with leaf litter and vegetation, contributing to an overall neglected feel. Behind and around the structure, the terrain slopes gently upwards, densely populated with bare tree branches and underbrush, hinting at a forested or rural area.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a sense of abandonment and decay, with the red structure providing a stark contrast against the predominantly brown and green hues of a natural, untamed environment.","title":"A lock is still on the door of this structure which was used to hold explosives for a mine near Richlands, Virginia, that was abandoned in the 1960's.
