{"path":"547764.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a bustling urban landscape, likely taken from a high vantage point. The scene is dominated by a complex network of roads and highways that interlace and curve around each other, showcasing multiple layers of elevated expressways prominently in the foreground. These highways lead to a dense urban core visible in the middle distance, where several tall buildings and skyscrapers establish a downtown skyline.\n\nIn the surrounding area, the terrain is covered with various smaller structures that appear to be industrial buildings, warehouses, and some commercial areas, all interspersed with parking lots filled with cars, indicating active business operations. Scattered throughout are patches of greenery and trees, mainly lining streets or clustered around buildings, which adds a slight break from the otherwise gray and concrete-dominated scenery.\n\nThe background stretches out into a suburban landscape with similar low-rise structures, which gradually merges into the horizon under a clear sky dotted with a few clouds. The photograph encapsulates a vibrant city environment, highlighting major transportation routes and a mix of architectural styles that speak to both commercial and industrial uses.","title":"Central Expressway leading south into Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553001","549476","553016","547765","555743","553838","549478","547755","546617","553015","546726","553559","546616","546707","548392","555745"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","core","establish","downtown","route","merge","concrete","skyscraper","warehouse","speak"]}
