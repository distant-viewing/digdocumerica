{"path":"554558.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring three hikers trekking through a rocky, wooded area. The terrain is uneven and is scattered with large rocks and boulders. There are tall, mature trees lining the pathway, providing ample shade and a rich, green backdrop to the scene. The hikers, equipped with large, sturdy backpacks, appear to be navigating a small incline on the trail.\n\nThe hikers, two of whom are visible in full and one partially shown on the left edge of the photo, wear outdoor gear suitable for hiking. One of the visible hikers wears a hat, enhancing the rugged, outdoor aesthetic. The flora is lush, indicative of a well-watered area, possibly near a stream, as suggested by the wet-looking rocks and the overall moist ambiance of the setting. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight filters softly through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the hikers and the path. The setting conveys a sense of peaceful isolation and the beauty of nature, inviting the viewer to consider the tranquility and adventure found in such outdoor excursions.","title":"Constant use of a trail up Algonquin Mountain (second highest in New York) has worn it away to bedrock and causes it to become a stream during a rain, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544305","554508","554705","543388","554502","554509","554501","554503","545700","543381","554663","543387","545751","545768","543382","543385"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["hiker","excursion","incline","backpack","rock","hiking","boulder","flora","trail","adventure"]}
