{"path":"546507.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph exhibits a close-up view of what appears to be a sculpture or a part of a large statue, focused on an area that suggests the trunk of an elephant. The detailed texture is prominent, closely resembling the wrinkled, rough skin of an elephant, giving a sense of realism to the material used in the sculpture. The lighting brings out the depth and shadows of the wrinkles, adding to the lifelike quality of the image.\n\nThe composition cleverly uses negative space created by the sculptureâ€™s rounded forms and contours. The photo captures the trunk as it curves, with the tip of the trunk pointing upwards, towards the left side of the image. Behind it, through the hollow curve of another part of the sculpture, a portion of sky or a light-colored backdrop is visible, forming a crescent moon-like shape. This background is plain, ensuring the focus remains intensely on the texture and form of the sculpture.\n\nThis approach, focusing closely on part of the sculpture, invokes curiosity about the rest of the piece, its size, and its environment, potentially pointing to a larger installation or a detailed part of a significant artwork. The photograph is taken from such an angle and proximity that it fills the frame entirely with the subject, enhancing the abstract and artistic quality of the image.","title":"Henry moor's sculpture \"large arch,\" which was installed in the library plaza in 1971","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557616","553587","557621","542749","554974","545292","555101","555009","555841","544992","546508","558134","557626","558133","557581","554306"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sculpture","trunk","form","realism","moon","curve","part","pointing","wrinkle","artwork"]}
