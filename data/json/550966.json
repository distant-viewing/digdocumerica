{"path":"550966.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a robust, industrial scene featuring a large bridge spanning a river. The bridge, which is an intricate truss design, supports a railway track upon which a freight train is currently traveling. The train, visible at the top part of the bridge, includes a red cargo car clearly visible against the backdrop of the gray bridge structure.\n\nBelow and slightly in the foreground, the river appears calm, reflecting the infrastructure and sky above. Situated on both banks of the river are multiple industrial facilities characterized by storage tanks of various sizes. These tanks are likely used for storing oil, chemicals, or other industrial liquids, as suggested by the visible labels like \"UNION CARBIDE.\"\n\nThe background features a hilly landscape with industrial buildings scattered across, hinting at a heavily industrialized area. The lighting in the photo suggests it might be midday, with a partially cloudy sky that casts a soft light over the entire scene.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a dynamic industrial environment where transportation and storage facilities are crucial elements. The color palette is subdued, with dominant grays, blues, and the whites of the storage tanks, evoking a utilitarian and functional aesthetic typical for industrial zones.","title":"Union carbide plant behind kanawha river bridge","placename":"Charleston (W.
