{"path":"545479.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly couple standing in a living room, posed next to a medical breathing apparatus. The elderly man, thin and balding, wears suspenders over a blue shirt and dark pants, while the elderly woman wears a floral printed blouse and black pants. Both look directly at the camera with neutral expressions.\n\nThey stand close to each other, with the man's hand resting on the device, which includes a large, box-like base with various dials and buttons and metal tubes leading to a part that resembles an inhaler or respirator. The device is connected with a series of clear, flexible tubing.\n\nThe room’s decor includes a patterned carpet, a simple upholstered chair, and several framed achievements or certificates on the wall in the background. The setting suggests a cozy, personal space, likely the couple’s home, decorated modestly and showing signs of everyday life.","title":"Mr.  Robert b.
