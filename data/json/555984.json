{"path":"555984.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and bustling railroad station scene. In the foreground, a man in a red cap and white shirt, likely a porter, crouches beside a variety of suitcases, suggesting he is organizing the luggage for loading or unloading. The suitcases, varying in color from red to green, are neatly aligned on the platform, with some already placed on a luggage cart next to him, implying a methodical approach to his work.\n\nIn the background, there's a large, modern passenger train prominently displaying a bold blue, red, and white logo, which identifies it as part of the Amtrak fleet, popular for intercity travels in the United States. The train carriage features a row of windows, reflecting the busy environment and hinting at the interior's occupancy.\n\nFurther back, there are passengers moving about; a man in a dark suit walking towards the train, and a small group that includes a woman in white and two children. The setting suggests a warm, possibly summer day given the light and airy attire of the passengers and the bright daylight illuminating the scene.\n\nThe setting is utilitarian with a focus on the functionality of the space, which is reinforced by the concrete platform and the pragmatic arrangement of objects and people. Each element in the composition—the working porter, the gleaming train, and the passengers—converges to narrate a typical moment of departure or arrival, encapsulating the motion and transient nature of a train station.","title":"The Southwest Limited passenger train is halted at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on its trip from Los Angeles, California, to Chicago to pick up passengers and baggage. Most intercity passenger trains in the U.S. are the responsibility of Amtrak. The corporation is using airline methods and other modern techniques in an effort to upgrade train travel as an alternative to the auto.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556831","556045","556044","556074","556063","556026","556855","555960","556827","556041","556089","556091","556073","555967","556670","556021"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","passenger","suitcase","luggage","platform","narrate","station","arrival","departure","carriage"]}
