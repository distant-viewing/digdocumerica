{"path":"557555.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic view down a long, straight road, flanked by aligned and lush green trees on both sides. The road begins at a point between two white gateposts, suggesting an entrance to a private property or a park. The gateposts, possibly part of a wider fence, are visible at the front, one of which has a slight discoloration or damage near its base.\n\nThe road itself is paved, showing signs of wear and minor cracks, hinting at a well-used pathway but not recently maintained. It stretches directly into the distance, drawing the viewer's eye towards the vanishing point at the center of the image. The trees along the sides are tall, with dense foliage, casting partial shadows over the road, providing a blend of sun and shade which enhances the serene atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe grassy areas adjacent to the pathway are well-trimmed and maintain a healthy green color, indicating regular upkeep. Above, the sky is visible through the canopy of the trees, suggesting a clear and bright day which contributes to the vividness of the greens in the image.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a peaceful, inviting, and slightly mysterious ambiance, as the road leads to an unseen destination beyond the visible frame.","title":"Trees line a private driveway off mulholland drive in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles.  The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county.
