{"path":"553225.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph displays two young individuals, possibly in their late teens or early twenties, engaged in backpacking or travel-related activities in an urban environment. Both individuals are equipped with large backpacks; the female wears a blue backpack, and the male carries a red one. They appear to be closely inspecting something the male holds, likely a map or a travel guide, which suggests they might be planning their route or deciding their next destination.\n\nThe individuals are dressed in casual, practical clothing suitable for travel. The female wears a dark top and blue jeans with a belt, while the male is in a black shirt with long sleeves, also paired with blue jeans. Additionally, both travellers have sneakers on, optimal for walking long distances.\n\nTheir expressions seem concentrated and somewhat serious, implying they are deeply engaged in their discussion or decision making. The background reveals a portion of an urban area with nondescript, modern buildings having vertical elements and dark windows. They are standing on what looks like a tiled, public sidewalk, brightly illuminated by natural light contrasting with the shadowed backdrop which enhances their figures in the foreground of the composition. The overall ambiance suggests travel, navigation, and youthful independence.","title":"On trek across country, young hikers stop to take pictures in Fountain Square.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["543380","545768","554513","545493","543235","545751","545415","551816","545516","551502","554508","545784","554539","545527","544301","545758"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["travel","male","female","backpack","decision","twenty","making","jean","guide","teen"]}
