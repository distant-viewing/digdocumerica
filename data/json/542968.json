{"path":"542968.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene. The primary focus is a picturesque view of the ocean from a higher vantage point. The shoreline curves gracefully into the distance, edged by rugged cliffs that create a dramatic landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, there’s a cluster of small pink and white flowers, perhaps wildflowers or daisies, that add a splash of color and life to the scene. These flowers are slightly out of focus, perhaps deliberately to add a sense of depth, with the ocean and coastline serving as a vivid backdrop.\n\nThe ocean water appears calm with gentle waves washing ashore. Several rocks and islets are scattered near the coastline and in the water, contributing to the rugged and natural feel of the scene. The coastline extends into the distance, marked by distinct cliffs and small inlets or coves that suggest a remote, perhaps lesser-traveled location. Light plays over the water’s surface and the rocky formations, giving the scene a dynamic and textured appearance.\n\nOverall, the composition is tranquil and picturesque, focusing on the beauty of the natural landscape. The cool tones of the ocean and the cliffs contrast with the warm hues of the flowers, creating a harmonious color balance. There’s no human activity evident, which enhances the untouched, peaceful feel of the environment.","title":"Wildflowers grow above volcanic beach at Shelter Cove.","placename":"Garberville (Calif.)","location":"Garberville, California","nn1":["553805","554082","554081","543404","543066","543184","543199","542917","547592","543074","545101","543399","543346","543304","543080","543401"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","coastline","cliff","flower","cove","daisy","islet","inlet","wash","wildflower"]}
