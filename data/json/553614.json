{"path":"553614.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of manual labor in a rugged outdoor setting, likely a forest clearing or a logging area. The focus of the image is a man, possibly a lumberjack or logger, who appears weary or focused on his task. He is dressed in work-appropriate attire: dirty jeans, a sleeveless white shirt, and a safety helmet. He also wears heavy-duty boots and a bandana around his neck, perhaps to keep dust and debris away.\n\nThe man is handling a large, red chainsaw, which is currently inactive but seems to be a central tool for his work. This suggests that he may have been involved in cutting down trees or clearing heavy branches. His hands are firmly on the chainsaw, indicating readiness to resume work or adjusting the equipment post-use.\n\nThe setting around him is distinctly forested, with pine trees visible in the background and several fallen tree trunks nearby. The ground is rough and covered in dirt, sawdust, and small branches, suggesting recent logging activity. The environment looks somber with an overcast sky, adding a raw, gritty ambiance to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment in the life of a labor-intensive profession, highlighting the physicality of the work and the natural, albeit disrupted, landscape in which it occurs.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
