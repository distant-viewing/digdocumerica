{"path":"553936.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a suburban area with distinct residential and industrial zones. The foreground prominently displays a well-organized residential area with rows of houses having similar structural designs and reddish-brown roofs, contrasting against the green lawns and trees surrounding the homes. Winding through this neighborhood are paved streets, orderly and clean, leading towards a more densely constructed industrial area.\n\nIn the middle of the photograph, the landscape transitions to a cluster of industrial buildings characterized by larger, flat-roofed structures, most of which have gray or metallic hues. This industrial zone appears to be well-planned, with a grid-like road system providing accessibility.\n\nTo the right of the image runs a major freeway, filled with moving vehicles suggesting the time of capture during a less busy period of the day or relatively lighter traffic conditions. The freeway marks a clear boundary between the residential area and the extending open green lands, which show minimal development and are presumably either agricultural or undeveloped terrain.\n\nThe background presents a rural setting with rolling hills that gradually rise to mountains covered partly by dark, ominous clouds, suggesting an approaching weather system or typical mountainous weather patterns. The greenery of the hills offers a sharp natural contrast to the developed areas in the foreground, emphasizing the blend of urban and natural environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights human settlement, infrastructure development, and the interface between urban life and nature.","title":"Pearl city, on the west side of Honolulu, is the fastest growing area in all of Hawaii.
