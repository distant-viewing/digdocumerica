{"path":"548798.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows an individual lying in a red hammock outdoors. The person is almost entirely wrapped in an American flag patterned blanket, creating an intriguing visual blend of stripes and stars with their exposed legs and bare feet. Behind the hammock, there are several trees and a grassy area dotted with rocks, contributing to a peaceful, natural setting.\n\nIn the background, a vintage van painted in red and white, partly obscured by the foliage, parks near the hammock. The scene and objects suggest a relaxed, probably leisurely day in an outdoor, possibly rural or park-like environment. The presence of the flag-theme blanket also conveys a patriotic or festive atmosphere.","title":"American dreams at Little Duck Key. Commercial camping sites and travel trailer courts have sprung up throughout the keys. Even on the smaller keys like Little Duck, where no facilities have yet been constructed, camping is permitted by local authorities.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548799","544436","548800","542581","557147","544334","549452","554361","556292","548668","547340","554182","550152","548225","554480","552589"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["blanket","flag","park","star","van","foot","vintage","stripe","leg","blend"]}
