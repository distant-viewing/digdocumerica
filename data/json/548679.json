{"path":"548679.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant underwater scene on a coral reef. In the foreground, a large, spherical brain coral with a complex pattern of ridges and valleys dominates the view. Its surface is textured and appears slightly glossy, suggesting a healthy coral ecosystem.\n\nBehind the brain coral, the seascape continues with various forms of marine life and other types of coral formations. To the left and above the brain coral, a small shoal of fish, possibly a type of sergeant major due to their stripes, can be seen swimming near the feathery fronds of a sea plant which might be a type of algae or sea fern.\n\nFurther back, the reef is dense with foliage-like clusters of coral that have a bumpy and rugged appearance, adding depth and complexity to the underwater habitat. The colors throughout are muted, with teal, green, and brown hues, reflecting the typical visual tones found in such natural, aquatic environments.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests natural sunlight filtering through the water, illuminating parts of the reef and casting gentle shadows. The overall composition of the photo is rich with textures and forms, highlighting the biodiversity of the coral reef ecosystem and giving a serene yet intricate view of life beneath the sea.","title":"Coral and sea life in the john pennekamp coral reef state park at key largo is photographed at a depth of 12 feet","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548682","548678","548677","548676","548719","548721","548710","548712","548722","548711","548717","548723","548681","548718","548680","548713"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["reef","coral","sea","type","ecosystem","frond","teal","biodiversity","algae","fern"]}
