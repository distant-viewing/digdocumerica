{"path":"547672.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a wetland or marsh ecosystem, focusing on a group of slender, intriguing plants that are likely insectivorous. These plants, possibly sundews, are characterized by elongated stems and rounded leaves coated with sticky, dew-like droplets which serve to attract and trap insects.\n\nThe plants are vividly colored, with the stalks having a reddish tint and the glistening droplets reflecting hints of light, giving them a sparkling appearance. They are interspersed amidst other wetland vegetation, including tall dark green grasses, some with narrow leaves, and smaller, ground-level plants with intricately shaped green leaves.\n\nThe background and surroundings of the plants are filled with various shades of green and brown, suggesting a dense, lush habitat, typical of wet, nutrient-poor environments where such carnivorous plants often thrive. The light filtering through the vegetation implies that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, enhancing the glistening effect of the droplets on the plants. There is visible moisture on the plants and the surrounding ground, indicating recent rainfall or an inherently moist locale.","title":"Drosera intermedia (sundew), seen in a Tiverton marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["555046","544541","544585","555022","547631","550670","550783","557499","544593","543565","555044","544589","547509","547532","558077","555042"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","droplet","leave","wetland","trap","insect","dew","stalk","tint","stem"]}
