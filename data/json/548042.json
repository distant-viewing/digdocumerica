{"path":"548042.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image depicts a snowy outdoor scene with three individuals engaged in some form of scientific or environmental study in a forested area blanketed with snow. The trees around them are conifers, heavily laden with snow, creating a thick white canopy in the background.\n\nOn the left of the image, an older man is seated on a red chair attached to a sled. He is dressed warmly with eyeglasses and appears to be observing or supervising the activity. In the center and right part of the image, two other individuals are actively involved in drilling into the snow using a manual ice auger. Both are bending over the auger, physically engaged in the process. One of them, wearing a blue jacket and a hat, is holding the top of the auger, while the other, dressed in a checkered jacket, supports the effort by stabilizing the auger.\n\nThe ground is covered in deep snow, evidenced by the depth visible around the hole being drilled. The scene suggests a scientific expedition, possibly related to environmental studies such as snowpack measurement or sampling. The colder climate and heavy snow gear indicate harsh, wintry conditions, probably in a remote area given the natural and undeveloped setting.","title":"Members of the Crag Rats climbing club make winter snow surveys for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service at Tilly Jane Camp Ground on Mt.
