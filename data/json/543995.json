{"path":"543995.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph features a group of men gathered outdoors in an industrial setting. The backdrop is dominated by a large, cylindrical structure possibly made of metal, resembling a smokestack or part of an industrial plant. This structure extends upwards out of the frame and emits a plume of smoke or steam into the sky, contributing to a somewhat polluted atmosphere.\n\nThe men, numbering around eight, appear to be engaged in a discussion or receiving some type of briefing or tour of the facility. They are dressed in casual and slightly formal attire typical of the early to mid-20th century, featuring button-up shirts, slacks, and a variety of patterns and colors, including plaid and striped patterns. At least one individual is wearing a cap.\n\nThe ground around them is unpaved and covered with gravel, indicative of a typical industrial site. Some parts of additional industrial machinery and a conveyor belt carrying materials can be seen in the background, suggesting this site could be involved in manufacturing or processing.\n\nThe scene is illuminated by natural daylight, and the sky, while mostly clear, shows signs of pollution possibly related to the industrial activity at the site. The overall composition of the photograph portrays a moment of professional engagement in an industrial environment, emphasizing themes of industry, teamwork, and environmental impact.","title":"Members of the South Pine Association take a tour of the Kaibab Lumber Co.","placename":"Payson (Ariz.)","location":"Payson, Arizona","nn1":["546824","542607","542546","545672","544105","556600","546933","552180","545537","542989","556893","545442","557883","546884","550968","557373"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["site","slack","tour","receive","teamwork","discussion","button","gravel","belt","manufacturing"]}
