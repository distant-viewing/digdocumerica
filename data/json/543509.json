{"path":"543509.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a woman stands on a sandy ground, possibly at a beach or ski area, dressed for cold weather or a sporting activity. She is wearing a yellow sweater and black pants, accompanied by gloves which she holds in one hand while gesturing with the other. A blue scarf is knotted around her neck. She is also wearing sunglasses, suggesting bright conditions, either from sun or reflective snow.\n\nShe is equipped with ski poles, which suggests that the location might be a ski resort. Her footwear includes boots, which appear to be ski boots, with metallic-looking buckles, suitable for skiing. \n\nThe background is quite blurred, primarily showcasing sandy or granular ground that fills the majority of the frame. The focus is squarely on the woman, capturing her mid-gesture, possibly in conversation or examining her gloves.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives the impression of an active moment, possibly during a break in skiing or a preparatory moment before starting. Her attire and equipment hint at an outdoor recreational setting designed for cold weather activities.","title":"California -- mammoth mt","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["554261","554228","554275","554270","543377","554259","549989","554276","554242","548032","554262","554257","554272","554251","554267","557177"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","skiing","glove","boot","gesture","buckle","footwear","sporting","scarf","resort"]}
