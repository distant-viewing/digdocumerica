{"path":"550043.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This image captures a vibrant harbor scene under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a large yellow and black tugboat, named \"Bowman,\" is prominent at the dock. The boat has visible equipment on deck, including a large spool, possibly for ropes or cables. There's another tugboat just behind it, sporting white, black, and red colors.\n\nThe background is a mix of old and new architecture. Notably, a historic-looking tower with a sharp spire (reminiscent of late 19th or early 20th-century design) contrasts with two modern, tall, narrow rectangular buildings, possibly residential or office high-rises. The older building provides an interesting bridge between past and present urban design.\n\nThe dock area and the calm water in the foreground offer a tranquil but busy maritime setting, hinting at an area frequently used for transport and possibly commercial activities. The perspective implies a view from another boat or from across the water, giving a broad overview of the waterfront's interface with the city.","title":"New apartment towers on the waterfront- seen from Old Bridge on Northern Avenue","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["555798","546937","548403","550896","547061","550892","555800","549892","552262","546938","550906","547700","546925","551990","550894","546845"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Waterfront Development"],"terms":["tugboat","dock","interface","overview","spire","past","boat","harbor","design","cable"]}
