{"path":"558409.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a tender family moment inside what appears to be a church. In the focus of the image, seated in a wooden pew, is a young woman wearing a patterned red sweater with decorative appliqué detailing and a patterned skirt. Her hair is stylishly pulled back with a ribbon. She is cradling a baby dressed in a white outfit, presumably asleep. Next to them, another young child with blond hair is leaning against the woman, also dressed casually.\n\nIn the background, other people are visible, suggesting the setting may be during a public church service or event. Notably, a young girl in a blue coat and a red sweater is looking directly into the camera, adding a direct connection with the viewer. To the left, parts of other attendees are marginally visible.\n\nOn the floor next to the young woman, there’s a bottle and a pamphlet or leaflet — items that seem to be for the baby or part of the church service. The overall ambiance is quiet and peaceful, typical of a religious gathering, enhancing the sense of intimacy and familial bond in the scene. The soft indoor lighting contributes to the warmth and closeness depicted in the photograph.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The second largest denomination of churchgoers are Lutherans. A mother with her small children is shown attending a service at Our Savior's. This church has its own mixed choir and Sunday school, and holds baptisms after Sunday service.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556233","558405","553496","557368","553523","556235","550090","553544","556593","543863","556299","556144","556294","551473","553543","552935"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["church","baby","sweater","service","cradle","pamphlet","pew","woman","bond","ribbon"]}
