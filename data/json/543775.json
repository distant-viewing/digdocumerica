{"path":"543775.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a miner at work in an underground setting. The miner, wearing a light-colored jacket covered with dust and grime, is focused on his task. He wears a safety helmet equipped with a headlamp and is using a pickaxe to break up the rocky material in the mine.\n\nThe miner is sitting on the rocky ground, surrounded by dark, stone-textured walls which appear to be part of a narrow mine shaft or tunnel. The lighting is dim, but the headlamp casts a bright light on the area where he is working, making the rocks and his activities visible. Various small rocks and debris are scattered around the area where he is working, highlighted by the splash of light.\n\nThe background is shadowy and indistinct, emphasizing the confined and possibly deep underground environment. The photo captures a moment of solitary labor, illustrating the tough and gritty conditions faced by workers in such environments. The composition of the image, with the miner's bent posture and focused work, conveys a sense of industriousness and the challenging nature of mining work.","title":"Underground uranium mining","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["556357","556364","556358","556396","556367","556363","556397","556515","556359","556510","556319","556366","556360","556511","556517","556509"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["miner","headlamp","mine","work","industriousness","grime","shaft","tunnel","rock","splash"]}
