{"path":"546786.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a Coast Guard rescue operation in action. It features a Coast Guard boat prominently in the foreground painted in dark blue with the words \"COAST GUARD\" and an emblem visible on its side. Two Coast Guard personnel are on the boat, one of whom is leaning over the side while gripping a pole that extends into the water, appearing to aid in the rescue process.\n\nIn the water, a third individual, likely a person being rescued, is seen partially submerged. This person is wearing an orange life jacket and is close to the edge of a small overturned boat, suggesting a boating accident or mishap. The water has moderate waves, indicating possibly windy conditions.\n\nThe background shows a shoreline with lush greenery and trees, along with a few small buildings that resemble residential structures. The overall setting appears to be a river or a lake with a moderate current, surrounded by a natural environment. This scene conveys a sense of urgency and the critical role of the Coast Guard in maritime safety and emergency responses.","title":"Coast guard recovers a swamped boat in Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546798","545659","554445","549616","543948","546324","547156","545669","546758","547548","546339","550220","553335","547461","549313","552275"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","accident","personnel","response","urgency","emergency","emblem","boating","current","person"]}
