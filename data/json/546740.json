{"path":"546740.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a cityscape during the early evening or late afternoon. The scene captures a river running through the city, bordered by urban development including several large buildings and busy roads. A notable structure visible in the picture is the Kennedy Center, prominently situated beside the river. This grand building stands out with its rectangular, layered design.\n\nThe river is crossed by a multi-arch bridge, linking different parts of the city. In addition, there are parking lots filled with cars and some patches of greenery that add contrast to the urban environment. In the foreground, a highway packed with lines of cars suggests heavy traffic, possibly indicating rush hour. The quality of light and the shadows indicate that the sun is low in the sky, likely either early morning or late afternoon. The overall tone of the photo is somewhat dark, giving it a moody atmosphere. This image captures the dynamic nature of urban life alongside natural waterways while also highlighting the architecture and transportation infrastructure of the city.","title":"Potomac River looking south.
