{"path":"542881.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph exhibits an aerial view of a distinct landscape showing contrasting environmental elements. It captures a riverbank and surrounding terrain from a high vantage point. A broad, calm river curves through the frame, characterized by its dark water which reflects the shadows of the nearby terrain. Beside the river, there is an extensive deposit of what appears to be silt or sand, forming a lighter shaded area along the water's edge, indicative of sediment accumulation possibly due to recent flooding or river current changes.\n\nAdjacent to the river, the terrain showcases a prominent patch of deforestation. This cleared area appears stark against the otherwise densely wooded landscape. The exposed earth and absence of tree cover suggest logging activities, as evidenced by the visible linear patterns of cut paths which facilitate such operations. The surrounding forest is lush, with coniferous trees densely packed, showing deep shades of green. This greenery accentuates the raw brown earth of the clear-cut area, highlighting human impact on natural environments.\n\nThe background consists of a mountainous terrain, continuing the theme of dense forestry, but the top reaches show less vegetation, perhaps due to altitude or other natural factors. Overall, the image serves as a stark representation of natural beauty intertwined with human intervention.","title":"Stripped woodland","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542822","546351","542880","550530","550621","550623","550580","552838","550392","550527","542701","550620","550539","542825","549081","542826"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","terrain","factor","reach","silt","earth","deforestation","deposit","flooding","forestry"]}
