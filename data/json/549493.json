{"path":"549493.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image captures a night scene featuring a multi-level structure at dusk. The structure includes a central, vertically oriented tower connected to an adjacent, elevated walkway. The tower has several levels visible, each illuminated with interior light that contrasts with the dusky blue sky. The light inside the tower reveals details such as windows and the contours of utilitarian architecture, possibly indicating that it is an observing or control tower often seen in transportation settings like railway stations or ports.\n\nThe elevated walkway connects to the tower and features lamp posts that provide additional light, enhancing a feeling of depth and leading the viewer's eye across the image. Below these structures, the distant background displays a cityscape illuminated with various colors from building lights, signs, and street lamps.\n\nThe sky is still retaining some light from the sunset, with clouds faintly visible against the darkening blue tone. The overall ambiance is quiet and moody, underscored by the artificial lighting in the scene, and suggests a setting that is both functional and slightly mysterious due to its industrial overtones. The photograph has a soft focus, lending an ethereal quality to the scene.","title":"Prospect Point observation tower overlooking Niagara Falls on the American side","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549502","549490","545406","555426","550011","555736","546389","543957","551140","546546","550007","545646","548339","555794","547200","549487"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["tower","walkway","lamp","light","port","night","railway","contour","post","control"]}
