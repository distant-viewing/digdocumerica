{"path":"543365.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a charming scene at \"Roaring Camp,\" presumably a historical or themed touristic spot, designed to resemble an old railroad station. The building in view features wooden construction painted in deep red with white trim around the windows and doors. There are two prominent signs: one reading \"Roaring Camp\" and the other \"Ticket Office,\" and another smaller sign identifying a \"Waiting Room.\"\n\nIn front of the building, several people are engaged in various activities. On the left side, under the \"Waiting Room\" sign, a young girl in pink and white is playing on the ground while a woman, possibly her mother, is seated, looking at her. Beside them on a wooden bench, another woman is reading, her full attention on what seems to be a book. To the right of the entrance, under the extended roof, a man and a woman appear to be conversing warmly. The man holds a small child, who is looking directly at the woman. Closer to the foreground, on the right side of the building, a young adult in dark clothing is sitting alone on a bench, watching the scene or perhaps waiting.\n\nIn the background, lush green trees under a clear blue sky suggest a tranquil, rural setting rich in natural beauty, augmenting the historic and relaxed atmosphere of the venue. The architecture, along with the casual and leisurely activities of the people captured, conjure an image of a serene retreat into an era gone by.","title":"California - Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543223","554456","554699","551116","556101","556100","556041","556091","543239","557684","555969","557961","556103","557964","555990","556074"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["woman","bench","augment","mother","sign","read","retreat","venue","go","identify"]}
