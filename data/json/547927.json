{"path":"547927.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of devastation involving a damaged structure and vehicle amidst debris. The primary focus is a small, dilapidated building labeled \"BUNGALOW BAR\", which used to serve ice cream, as indicated by the faded advertising on its sides offering \"ICE CREAM PINTS & HALF PINTS, FUDGE BARS, FRUIT ICES & SUNDAES, ICE CREAM CUPS.\" The building's roof is severely damaged, with visible holes and missing sections exposing the interior, while the white paint on the exterior is peeling and dirty.\n\nAdjacent to this structure is a white, rusted and partially destroyed old-style truck that looks like it might have been used for deliveries. The truck is also in a state of disrepair with significant rust, damaged bodywork, and parts of it buried under rubble. It is cluttered with debris and appears immobile, with its front wheel visible and sunk into the ground surrounded by debris.\n\nThe surroundings are bleak and littered with various debris including scraps of metal, pieces of wood, and broken objects that create an overall sense of abandonment and destruction. The background is fairly nondescript, with bare trees suggesting a desolate or winter season, contributing to the overall atmosphere of neglect and decay in the scene.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of desolation, likely following some catastrophic event, emphasizing themes of decay, abandonment, and the passage of time.","title":"Abandoned ice cream wagon at Broad Channel in Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547888","545295","547130","553470","553863","552997","546051","554302","544809","547587","544468","548742","544797","547868","547653","543344"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["debris","cream","ice","abandonment","decay","truck","delivery","hole","devastation","rubble"]}
