{"path":"555907.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of automobile maintenance being done on a city street. A person, whose gender is indeterminate from the view, lies on their back on the ground, partially underneath an old van. The individual appears to be engaged in some sort of mechanical work on the underside of the vehicle, which is hoisted slightly above the ground with the assistance of a red hydraulic floor jack.\n\nThe person is dressed casually in a dark shirt and pants, with work boots, suggesting a readiness for manual labor. On their left side lies a creeper â€” a small, wheeled platform used for ease of movement when working under vehicles. A few automotive tools are scattered beside them on the pavement, which shows signs of wear and staining, typical of city streets.\n\nOn either side of the maintenance scene, the edges of other vehicles are visible, likely parked along the street. Towards the top right corner of the image, a car passes by, indicating that this repair work is happening in a somewhat busy area. The entire scene is set in daylight, under overcast skies, providing a soft natural light which casts no harsh shadows, underscoring the everyday nature of the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests an impromptu repair job being undertaken in an urban setting, possibly indicative of the resourcefulness or urgent needs of the vehicle's owner or mechanic.","title":"Man working on car in Hell's Kitchen, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins and the white poor. Most of all, the inner city environment is human beings, as beautiful and threatened as the 19th century buildings.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557832","553490","553491","557833","553489","557914","557925","557371","557916","553492","549652","549273","557852","557853","546632","557903"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["repair","vehicle","work","street","maintenance","assistance","underside","ease","owner","job"]}
