{"path":"552797.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"In the photograph, a group of people is gathered outside a building, specifically in front of an establishment named \"Holiday Inn\". A man, dressed in a dark business suit and black shoes, is in the foreground bending over on a concrete path to operate a yellow and black machine labeled \"ULTRA CHARGER\". This machine appears to be a portable device, perhaps for charging or powering equipment.\n\nThere are several other individuals in the scene: one man in a gray suit stands to the right with his arms folded, looking at the central action. Another individual, obscured in the background, gestures with their hand mid-conversation. To the left, a group observes or engages in discussions, including a person holding a camera, possibly capturing the event.\n\nThe environment is overcast, with a relatively dim light setting, suggesting either an early morning or a cloudy day. In the background, the two-story \"Holiday Inn\" building can be seen, with an exterior composed mainly of brick and a prominent sign on the roof displaying its name.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
