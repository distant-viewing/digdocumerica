{"path":"550765.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial area situated along a wide river. The picture is taken from the vantage point of an airplane, as the edge of the aircraft's wing and what appears to be a strut are visible in the foreground, framing the top right corner of the image.\n\nThe river, which is a prominent feature in the photo, meanders through the scene, filled with muddy waters that suggest recent rainfall or flooding. The riverbanks are partially submerged, indicating high water levels. Several industrial facilities, recognizable by their large buildings, storage tanks, and infrastructure, are situated close to the river's edge. Some areas of the land are flooded, isolating sections of the industrial landscape.\n\nA cargo ship is visible in the lower center part of the river, suggesting active transportation and commerce in this area. The river surface also reflects hints of sunlight, punctuating the otherwise overcast and ambient lighting.\n\nIn the wider scopes of the background, the city continues with more industrial facilities spread outwards. The overall layout, combined with visible transport routes and urban development, portrays a busy industrial hub connected intricately with the river it borders. The photograph likely captures a moment of environmental and economic significance, such as flood conditions impacting industrial operations and logistics.","title":"Mouth of the Fox River at Green Bay","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550890","547214","550886","552187","548320","550864","545889","550855","550865","557223","551993","547994","550861","555769","551609","551995"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","scope","flood","flooding","logistic","airplane","facility","commerce","wing","rainfall"]}
