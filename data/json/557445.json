{"path":"557445.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a calm freshwater wetland. In the foreground, there are tall, thin green reeds growing out of the water, which create a vertical visual texture. The water surface is partly covered by a large patch of floating algae or aquatic plant matter, exhibiting a spongy texture and a light grayish color that contrasts with the darker water surrounding it. The water reflects subtle hints of light, enhancing the calm, quiet ambiance of the scene. There are no visible animals or human activities, emphasizing the natural, undisturbed state of the wetland environment. The overall mood of the picture is serene, capturing the tranquil and somewhat isolated essence of a marshy ecosystem.","title":"Vegetation in Upper Newport Bay, near Newport Beach. The bay was scheduled for development as a yacht harbor. The state's coastal waters and lands provide a habitat for more than 108 species and subspecies of mammals, 260 birds, 54 reptiles and amphibians, and a wide variety of fish. Coastal wetlands necessary for their survival decreased from 381,000 acres in 1900 to about 125,000 acres in the early 1970's in California.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["547532","544524","557498","550783","547589","550786","550785","545033","550341","547509","544515","547500","544765","543561","553856","547544"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","matter","algae","reed","water","texture","ecosystem","essence","animal","picture"]}
