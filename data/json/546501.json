{"path":"546501.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a set of wide outdoor stairs in an urban setting, leading up to a building which can be partially seen in the background. The stairs are flanked on both sides by tall buildings, which have brick facades and several large windows. At the top of the stairs, two people are walking side by side away from the viewer. Overhead, there are globe-like street lamps casting a soft light.\n\nLarge trees line the background, partially obscuring the building behind them and adding a natural element to the urban environment. The lighting suggests that it could be either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to a serene, somewhat subdued atmosphere.\n\nThe composition of the image guides the viewer from the foreground of the stairs through to the background where the people and trees are situated, creating a sense of depth and movement in the photograph. The overcast sky and the lush greenery suggests a quiet, possibly damp day, enhancing the tranquil feel of the scene.","title":"Steps lead to First Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546529","551712","556165","546506","546532","547175","546559","550762","546431","546528","547099","546539","546470","546493","546745","553537"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["stair","globe","overhead","viewer","set","lamp","side","building","people","facade"]}
