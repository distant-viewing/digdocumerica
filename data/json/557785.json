{"path":"557785.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a group of six adults walking across a grassy field. The setting is relatively open, with trees lining the background and a large building, possibly a barn or community gathering place, visible in the distance. The sky is overcast with an abundance of clouds.\n\nThe group consists of three men and three women, and they appear to be dressed in a mix of casual and traditional attire which might suggest a cultural or festive gathering. The men are dressed differently, one in a conventional button-up shirt and pants, while the other two are in traditional Bavarian-style outfits, which include lederhosen, knee-length socks, and one wears a hat. The women also sport varied attire, ranging from modern casual dress to more traditional German outfits, characterized by dirndls (dresses with fitted bodices), aprons, and headscarves.\n\nTheir expressions and body language suggest a casual and happy demeanor, as they are walking with smiles and interacting lightly with each other, conveying a sense of movement and ease. Some of the individuals are holding items like a purse or jacket, indicating a casual stroll rather than a hurried walk.\n\nThe overall composition and attire of the group, combined with the setting, hint at their possible participation in a local or cultural event, likely in a rural community setting. It evokes a sense of community and participation in local traditions or gatherings.","title":"Visitors, including many of German ancestry, attended the fifth annual Oktoberfest in Helen. The 1975 event was held in a large circus tent set up in a field near the Helendorf Inn (seen in the background) and within easy walking distance of Helen's main street shopping district which has been Renovated with a Bavarian alpine theme. The small mountain community of some 270 people was typical of villages in the area until the Renovation began in 1969.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544821","552407","557207","543234","557206","558090","551736","549328","543233","554666","554489","558245","551017","558295","555947","544406"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["participation","gathering","community","group","outfit","dress","attire","stroll","ease","apron"]}
