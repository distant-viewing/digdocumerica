{"path":"542908.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene scene by a water body, most likely a lake or bay. In the foreground, a small white boat with a visible cabin and a mast is moving on the surface of the water, which reflects a bluish color likely due to the clear sky.\n\nBeyond the boat, the shore is lined with a variety of buildings nestled among dense greenery. There are several houses, one of which is prominently red, another painted in light green and white, and several others in the background with less distinctive colors. These homes appear rustic, some with multiple stories and patios, suggesting a residential area. \n\nThe surroundings are lush with trees and patches of grass visible beyond the immediate waterfront, indicating a rural or semi-rural setting. There's also visible fencing that demarcates what seems like paths or small roads winding through the properties. No people can be seen, adding to the tranquil and isolated vibe of the scene.\n\nIn the background, rising behind the houses, are sloping hills, partially covered with trees, leading to a sense of quiet and secluded environment. The overall mood of the picture is peaceful, showing a harmony between human habitation and natural landscapes.","title":"The hills surrounding Bodega Bay are to be developed for vacation housing.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["554101","557562","542903","553925","549417","542907","557416","542870","556905","550324","546856","548030","555694","552292","542872","544567"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["patio","fencing","harmony","house","boat","mast","bay","habitation","cabin","property"]}
