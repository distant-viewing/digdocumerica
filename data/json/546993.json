{"path":"546993.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene set against an urban background, likely dating from the 1970s or 1980s given the style of clothes and vehicles. The focus of the image is on a group of people gathered around a motorcycle, which prominently features a Confederate flag attached to the back.\n\nTo the left, a man in a red tank top and blue jean shorts is looking downwards, appearing somewhat preoccupied or contemplative. He is standing near a delivery van, which has \"Merita Bread\" printed on its side. Next to him, slightly behind, is a woman with medium-length hair, dressed in a casual shirt, observing the scene.\n\nIn the center, a man and a woman are facing a man to their right, who is explaining or discussing something, as evidenced by his gesturing hand. The man in the center, wearing bright pants and a light-colored shirt, listens attentively. To the right, another man is leaning on the motorcycle; he sports sunglasses, a mustache, and has his hair in a ponytail. He appears to be engaged in the conversation or the activity surrounding the motorcycle.\n\nIn the background, the street is relatively busy with people walking and cars parked along the sides. There are low buildings, possibly shops or apartments, lining the street, and the setting suggests an informal gathering or a casual day out in a neighborhood environment.\n\nThe photograph conveys a moment of casual social interaction centered around the motorcycling culture, juxtaposed with symbols that might carry various sociopolitical connotations, specifically the Confederate flag. This adds a level of complexity to the social and cultural narratives that might be interpreted from the scene.","title":"Vacationers on Isle of Palms, a popular ocean resort","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554875","551383","556206","554871","554872","554481","554874","554877","554482","554876","556214","556169","554178","556418","558232","544859"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["motorcycle","flag","street","man","ponytail","delivery","interpret","center","mustache","1980"]}
