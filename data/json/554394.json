{"path":"554394.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, densely wooded forest scene, beautifully illuminated by the soft, golden light of the sun filtering through the trees. The setting is thick with slim, straight trunks of tall trees, likely pines or similar conifers, which tower over the understory. The forest floor is lush with ferns and other undergrowth, visibly thriving in the dappled sunlight.\n\nThe composition captures the beauty of early morning or late afternoon, with the sun at a low angle, creating long shadows that stretch across the forest floor and highlight the textured surfaces of the tree bark and the intricacies of the fern leaves. The light plays a significant role in the atmosphere of the image, giving a warm, inviting tone to the scene and enhancing the feeling of depth and tranquility.\n\nThere is a mystical or peaceful quality to the image, emphasized by the natural gradient of light to shadow and the absence of any human or animal figures. The color palette is rich with earthy tones of greens and browns, and the slight haze suggests moisture in the air, possibly hinting at an early morning after the night's dew. The composition is both simple and complex, drawing the viewer's eye through the natural pathway created by the arrangement of trees and light, leading them deeper into the forest scene.","title":"Early morning sunlight filters through balsam firs and ferns at Twitchell Lake.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554393","542931","542849","543021","555118","555051","550791","554718","554965","554959","554425","558082","542932","557596","555028","546947"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fern","forest","floor","intricacy","dew","sun","undergrowth","conifer","morning","light"]}
