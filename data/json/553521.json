{"path":"553521.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a tender and casual moment between an older man and a young boy. The older man, likely in his fifties or sixties, is sitting beside the young boy, showing relaxed body language and wearing a plaid, button-up shirt with glasses. He has a subtle smile and is looking fondly at the boy, possibly speaking to him or enjoying the moment together. The young boy, appearing around five to seven years old, wears a vivid red shirt and is concentrating on drinking from a small white cup with both hands. The background is diffusely lit and somewhat shadowy, indicating that this scene might be set in a sheltered, outdoor or semi-outdoor area, such as a porch. The setting gives off a rustic, homely vibe, suggesting a familial, comforting environment.","title":"Ernest Watkins of Mulky Square, biscuit company worker and father of nine, likes his beer and likes teaching his three-year-old son to like it.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553520","556527","557355","557359","553519","547410","558186","543866","551948","557369","545970","557352","557152","553094","543849","551342"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","language","cup","year","button","smile","plaid","vibe","porch","shirt"]}
