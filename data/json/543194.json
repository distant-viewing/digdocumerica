{"path":"543194.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and somewhat abstract aquatic scene. Situated in what appears to be a body of water, the composition prominently features clusters of frothy, white foam arranged asymmetrically across the dark blue, nearly black water surface. These patches of foam are irregular in shape and vary in size, creating a textured contrast against the deep background.\n\nInterspersed among the foam are numerous thin, elongated objects resembling aquatic plants or algae. These are predominantly dark olive green, slightly translucent, and they gracefully undulate, suggesting gentle movement in the water. There also appears to be smaller, floating debris scattered throughout the scene, adding a sense of natural organic matter floating freely in the water.\n\nThe overall image evokes a sense of calm and stillness, capturing a moment of natural serenity. There are no visible human activities or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched and purely natural aspect of this environment. The subtle interplay of light and shadow, along with the contrasting textures and colors, enhances the visual depth and interest of the photograph.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557252","550849","545923","550370","550817","553348","550686","557240","545164","547650","550815","551352","547502","553388","555069","542582"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["foam","matter","algae","serenity","water","calm","stillness","interest","aspect","interplay"]}
