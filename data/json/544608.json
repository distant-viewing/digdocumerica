{"path":"544608.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a small, secluded settlement adjacent to a vast, open wetland area. The settlement includes several small buildings clustered close to one another, with one large central building that looks like a main hall or community center. There are neatly organized pathways and green grass areas around the buildings. A prominent fixture in the settlement is a high water tower painted white, which stands out distinctly against the surrounding landscape.\n\nTo the right of the buildings, there’s a recreational area that includes a baseball diamond, complete with a pitcher’s mound and bases. The corners of the field are lined with fencing and there is a small spectator area with bleachers.\n\nSurrounding these man-made features, the vast wetland stretches far into the horizon, characterized by low vegetation and what appears to be patches of water or marshy ground. The texture and color of the wetlands contrast with the organized and manicured layout of the settlement.\n\nA long, straight road lined with a continuous row of taller trees borders the facility on its southern side, providing a clear demarcation between the settlement and the wilderness. This road might serve as the primary access route to and from the area.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a serene, isolated community set against the backdrop of a natural, extensive wetland, highlighting a juxtaposition between human habitation and the natural environment.","title":"Micosukee Indian school at edge of Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544503","556973","555844","556994","550587","556972","550583","550534","544572","550520","544507","545896","552837","550398","557446","550757"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["settlement","wetland","organize","basis","demarcation","diamond","fencing","hall","community","baseball"]}
