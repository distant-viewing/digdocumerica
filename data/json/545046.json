{"path":"545046.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a forestry or logging scene. A man, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, stands confidently to the right of a large load of massive tree logs that are loaded on a heavy-duty trailer. The logs are notably large, with rugged, uneven surfaces and still bearing bits of bark. The trailer is equipped with large, sturdy tires suitable for uneven forest terrain.\n\nBehind the man and the loaded trailer, the background shows a cleared area with numerous felled trees and stumps, highlighting a scene of recent logging activity. This area has scattered wooden debris and branches, indicative of intense cutting and clearing activity. The surrounding environment beyond the immediate clearing still has dense forest, consisting of tall trees, which contrast with the devastation in the foreground.\n\nThe sky is overcast, suggesting overcast or gloomy weather conditions, which adds to the rugged and harsh nature of the setting. The overall composition of the photograph focuses on the scale of the logs in comparison to the human figure, emphasizing the magnitude of the logging operations. The image captures a moment that reflects both human endeavor and the substantial impact of such activities on natural environments.","title":"Logging truck loaded with cedar in a clearcut area of the Quinault Indian Reservation","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542856","542855","554419","554416","552583","553631","553647","553645","542790","555472","553612","554427","554418","542616","548155","553641"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["trailer","log","clearing","magnitude","cutting","comparison","devastation","load","stump","forest"]}
