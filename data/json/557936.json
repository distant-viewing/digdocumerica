{"path":"557936.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a rural setting with a group of people engaged in various activities near a barn and a small bridge over a creek. In the center of the image, a large, traditional red barn with white trim features prominently. The barn has a pitched roof, a loft with a circular window, and two large doors that are slightly ajar. Adjacent to the barn, there are some black barrels and a lantern hanging near the entry.\n\nIn the foreground, a rustic wooden fence runs parallel to a small creek, over which a simple wooden bridge spans. Several individuals are on or near the bridge. On the left side, an adult and three children appear to be moving towards or away from the bridge, possibly exploring or playing. Two of the children seem to be wearing costumes or dresses in pale hues such as pink and lavender. On the right, a man wearing a light shirt and cap stands by the fence looking towards the others. Another child, wearing a dark top, stands mid-bridge, looking directly towards the barn.\n\nThe background is lush with greenery and trees under a bright, sunny sky, suggesting a warm day. The scene likely depicts a leisure or family outing with elements of play and exploration in a pastoral setting. The presence of traditional costumes among the children may indicate a special occasion or cultural festivities. The overall composition and serene environment convey a sense of tranquility and simplicity.","title":"Visitors cross a creek to a barn at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Bath and Akron, Ohio.
