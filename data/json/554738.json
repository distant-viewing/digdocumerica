{"path":"554738.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene woodland scene during autumn. The image is dominated by a diverse array of trees, showcasing a vibrant palette of fall colors. The foreground features a marshy area with dense, low-lying foliage that appears to be golden-brown, surrounding a small, dark pond that reflects the sky and some of the surrounding vegetation. \n\nThe trees include both deciduous and coniferous varieties: the deciduous trees boast shades of red, orange, and yellow, indicating a prime moment in the fall season, while the green hues of the coniferous trees provide a striking contrast against the warm autumn colors.\n\nThere's a peaceful, untouched quality to the setting, suggesting a natural, possibly remote location away from urban environments. The lighting in the photograph brings out the richness of the fall colors and lends a soft glow to the scene. No human activity or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the untouched, natural beauty of the area. The composition of the image, with the focus on the reflective pond surrounded by the colorful foliage, evokes a sense of calm and tranquility.","title":"Young tamarack trees starting to turn their fall colors at Bald Mountain Pond","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554737","554715","554649","554751","554758","554713","555216","554757","554718","554711","550603","557821","557159","554730","557127","554735"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["fall","pond","autumn","boast","richness","foliage","bring","tree","surround","calm"]}
