{"path":"546894.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a maritime scene with a strong industrial feel, likely taken at a harbor or port. In the foreground, there is water reflecting a slightly overcast sky. On the left side of the image, there is an aged, weathered dock building labeled \"OLD BAY LINE\" which advertises daily freight and passenger service to Norfolk, points south and west. The building appears old and worn, covered in large, faded letters that are peeling off its surface.\n\nAdjacent to the dock, on the water, is a large ship named \"OCEAN TRITON\" registered in Monrovia. The ship is moored alongside the dock and has a sizable structure with multiple decks visible. Its hull displays the name and logo of the Old Bay Line as well. The ship has numerous cargo holds and three visible smokestacks, suggesting it might be powered by steam.\n\nBeyond the immediate structures, the background features various industrial buildings that appear to be part of the port architecture, consistent with the mid-20th-century port facilities. Some buildings also have visible signage, but the details are not clearly legible. The overall atmosphere is slightly muted with soft lighting, likely due to an overcast day.\n\nOverall, the scene captures the utilitarian nature of a working port from a past era, highlighting elements of industrial and transportation history.","title":"Busy old pier in the northwest branch of the Patapsco River","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552216","546804","547474","545147","547056","544657","546860","547572","543155","552244","546934","555726","546876","548403","548127","549931"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["port","ship","dock","freight","past","harbor","building","history","hull","cargo"]}
