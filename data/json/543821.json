{"path":"543821.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a landfill where waste disposal activities are ongoing. In the foreground, a large pile of compressed garbage is visible, tumbling out from the back of a garbage compactor truck, painted white with visible rust and grime. The garbage primarily consists of a multitude of miscellaneous items such as paper, plastic containers, cardboard, and metal objects, all tightly compressed together.\n\nIn the background, another large heavy equipment vehicle, possibly a bulldozer or compactor, is actively engaged in managing the waste. This machine, colored in a faded yellow, is partially visible, showing its front part raised as though in the midst of operation. It emits a dark plume of exhaust, indicating it is powered by a combustion engine.\n\nThe background landscape is somewhat bleak and barren, typical of a landfill environment, under an overcast sky. The setting suggests a cold and damp day, as evidenced by the lack of vegetation and the gray sky, enhancing the industrial and utilitarian nature of the scene. This image captures both the scale of waste humans produce and the mechanical processes involved in its management.","title":"Boulder county's land fill dump.
