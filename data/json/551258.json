{"path":"551258.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene lakeside scene with an emphasis on a boat storage facility. The facility features an expansive, covered boat dock, supported by numerous metallic pillars, and it's roofed with a large, slightly rusted metal sheet that shelters several boats moored underneath. On the visible left half of the dock, a personal watercraft and a few speedboats are present, suggesting recreational use.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, the tranquil waters of the lake reflect the underside of the roof and the docked boats, enhancing the calming atmosphere. Adding life to the scene, two white swans glide gracefully across the water near the center, their white feathers stark against the dark water, drawing the viewer's eye as a focal point.\n\nTo the right side of the image, more of the boat shelter is visible along with some rugged, rocky terrain that serves as the embankment of the lake, leading to a small strip of land that forms a partial boundary to the right side of the facility.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is peaceful, with a muted color palette dominated by blues and grays, hinting at either an early morning or late evening time, underscored by a subtle play of light and shadow that suggests a soft, natural light setting.","title":"Domestic ducks paddle in still evening water of wulff harbor marina","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["551259","544266","547027","557562","551312","544567","543527","547052","551219","549417","543579","557255","545936","551679","544126","548247"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","dock","shelter","facility","speedboat","underside","watercraft","glide","lake","embankment"]}
