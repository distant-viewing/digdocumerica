{"path":"545509.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image captures a poignant scene of four children spending time together outside a dilapidated wooden house. The building exhibits signs of considerable wear, with peeling green paint and bare wood exposed in several places. The children, all appearing of African descent, are engaged in simple, everyday activities.\n\nOn the left, two children are seated on a wooden beam that may serve as steps or part of a porch. The boy, wearing a striped, long-sleeve shirt and shorts, sits looking slightly off-camera with a thoughtful expression. Next to him, a girl in a sleeveless pink dress sits more directly facing the camera, her expression reflective and serene.\n\nOn the right, another child is captured in mid-action, perhaps playing or dancing. This child, wearing a brown and yellow shirt with plaid pants, is animated, adding a dynamic element to the group scene.\n\nA fourth child can be noticed partly obscured in the doorway of the house, contributing to the depth of the scene and perhaps suggesting the presence of more people inside or nearby.\n\nThe environment around them has scattered debris and some discarded items, indicating neglect or a lack of upkeep. The mood conveyed is one of resilience and community among the children, despite the rough conditions of their surroundings.","title":"In many areas of the city blacks still live in substandard housing.
