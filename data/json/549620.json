{"path":"549620.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a hazy aerial view of an urban landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The view is dominated by muted, foggy tones, mainly grays and faded earth colors, adding a somewhat obscure and mysterious atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a cluster of high-rise buildings seen through a dense haze, towering over its surroundings. These buildings, cloaked partially by the fog, seem distant and almost ghostly. The tallest building stands in the middle, slightly more prominent than those adjacent to it, yet its details are muted and blurred by the atmospheric conditions.\n\nBelow and extending to the foreground, the urban sprawl is intricately detailed with many smaller structures, roads, and patches of land that could be parks or empty plots. Lights from vehicles are visible, streaking along the major roadways, which creates a luminous, dynamic contrast against the darker tones of the buildings and open areas.\n\nThe top and bottom of the image are framed by a green border, possibly from the slide mount where the photograph is held, giving it a classic, archival look. There are no people visible in the scene; the photograph captures solely the urban environment and the moody, ambient interaction between light and fog. The overall impression is one of solitude and stillness, with the city shrouded in a dense atmospheric blanket.","title":"Sunset and smog","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549970","552394","545499","548385","548360","548384","545406","548365","553021","550186","550190","551141","548339","545428","548337","548383"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["fog","slide","sprawl","plot","blanket","building","border","roadway","stillness","dawn"]}
