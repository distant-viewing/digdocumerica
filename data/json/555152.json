{"path":"555152.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a forest scene with a focus on a large, uprooted tree. The uprooted tree's massive root system is exposed, revealing tangled dirt and roots, forming a large mound that towers over the person next to it. Several intact trees stand around the uprooted tree, and have relatively smooth, straight trunks. The ground is covered with scattered branches and debris, likely from the fallen tree.\n\nA person, wearing a light green jacket and dark pants, stands to the right side of the fallen treeâ€™s massive root ball. They appear to be observing or inspecting it.\n\nThe background of the image suggests a dense forest area with possibly some water or a wet surface slightly visible behind some of the trees. The lighting is natural, indicating daytime, but it seems a bit dim, possibly due to overcast conditions or the dense overhead canopy which might be blocking sunlight.","title":"A Sitka spruce tree, approximately 200 feet tall, blown down.
