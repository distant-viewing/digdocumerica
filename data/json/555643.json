{"path":"555643.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial mining truck, loaded with dirt, driving on a gravel road. The truck is exceptionally large with massive, rugged tires and a hefty, rectangular dump bed loaded with earth. It features a dark green cabin and body with a prominent black grille at the front, displaying the model name “Dart.” The terrain surrounding the truck appears to be a barren excavation site with piles of dirt or rubble to the left and a wider open dusty landscape stretching into the distance. The sky is clear blue, indicating that it might be a sunny day, which enhances the visibility of dust being kicked up by the truck's movement. The overall scene conveys a sense of heavy-duty industrial activity, likely associated with construction or mining operations.","title":"Coal company truck used to haul large loads from the strip mining sites to the processing plant near Chandlersville, in southeastern Ohio","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["547232","549956","544107","542538","547922","549245","550266","544135","550270","544099","554765","547243","547104","555636","556446","547591"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["truck","load","mining","kick","dirt","grille","rubble","dump","duty","drive"]}
