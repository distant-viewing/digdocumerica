{"path":"556063.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a train station with an Amtrak train prominently featured. The train, painted in bold red, white, and blue colors consistent with the Amtrak logo, is at the station with its nose pointing towards the left side of the frame. The front of the train shows the number \"60\" and has two sets of headlights along with additional lights and hardware on the roof, suggesting it might be a model designed for both passenger service and high visibility.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the train, several crew members are performing tasks. One person, wearing a light-colored shirt and denim pants, is climbing into the driver’s compartment, presumably conducting a routine check or preparing for departure. Another person, also in light attire, stands on a step, seemingly communicating with someone inside or performing a similar operational task.\n\nPassengers or onlookers are visible along the station platform, adding a sense of activity and human interest to the scene. They appear engaged in various activities such as walking, waiting, or interacting with others, beneath an overpass that partially shades the platform.\n\nThe background shows a combination of architectural and natural elements. A red brick building, possibly a part of the station’s infrastructure, suggests a setting that blends historic and functional design. The clear blue sky suggests a pleasant, sunny day, contributing to the overall lively atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThis snapshot encapsulates a moment of everyday operations at a train station, likely capturing both the routine and the unique interactions of travel via rail.","title":"Turboliner engine's windshield is cleaned as the passenger train is stopped at Bloomington, Illinois, en route from St. Louis, Missouri, to Chicago. The French-built train is capable of speeds up to 125 miles per hour, but normally travels no faster than 79 miles per hour on this run. Many of the passenger trains in the Amtrak system run slower than their capabilities because the nation's railroads need to upgrade track and roadbed.","placename":"Bloomington (Ill.)","location":"Bloomington, Illinois","nn1":["556059","555986","555984","555960","556074","556670","556857","556026","556090","556831","556100","556091","556649","556058","556767","555985"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","station","passenger","platform","hardware","departure","check","task","pointing","nose"]}
