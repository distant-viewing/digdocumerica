{"path":"543197.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a cluster of five daisy-like flowers. The flowers have bright white petals surrounding a vibrant yellow center, typical of many daisy species. The petals vary from slightly to highly jagged at the ends. Three of the flowers face upward towards the viewer while two are angled sideways, giving a dynamic variety to the composition.\n\nThe background consists of green foliage which appears a bit blurred, helping to highlight the sharp detail of the flowers at the forefront. Surrounding these central blooms are numerous leaves, some of which possess a silver-gray hue, adding color contrast. There are also thin, dried plant stems intermixed within the greenery, suggesting a natural, wild habitat. The overall feel of the image is lush and lively, typical of a vibrant wildflower scene.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543596","544876","557167","549230","550781","547642","544875","545695","545291","553368","554575","554576","555186","553076","555061","554574"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["daisy","flower","petal","possess","stem","wildflower","specie","dry","bloom","habitat"]}
