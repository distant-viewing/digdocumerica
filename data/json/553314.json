{"path":"553314.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a city scene dominated by the facade of a large multi-story building. The building has a vibrant red brick front with multiple rows of white-framed windows, decorated by white cornices at the roofline, adding architectural detail. Several fire escapes with black metal railings add a gritty, urban texture to the building's facade, characterizing typical older apartment buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, silhouetted against a clear blue sky, a person is depicted in a dynamic action pose, with one arm raised as though they are throwing or catching an object. The object, possibly a ball, is visible in mid-air above the person's hand, enhancing the sense of motion and activity in the scene. The individual's other arm is extended downward, holding what appears to be a cap or hat, adding a casual element to their attire and action.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the static, structured environment of the building with the lively, transient motion of the human figure and the flying object, capturing a moment of everyday life in an urban setting.","title":"Apartment building in Over-the-Rhine, an old residential neighborhood north of the business district","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["545404","551493","555902","552968","551724","555934","545356","552724","542802","549997","555952","552965","555894","550024","557286","549317"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["object","action","arm","facade","cornice","motion","building","roofline","ball","apartment"]}
