{"path":"545874.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a waterfall cascading over rocky terrain. The waterfall is the focal point of the image, with multiple streams of water flowing energetically over the uneven, moss-covered rocks. The rocks appear slick and shiny, suggesting they are frequently awash with flowing water.\n\nIn the background, there's a slight glimpse of a lush forest, with various trees framing the top part of the image. Light streams through the leaves, creating a play of light and shadow on the water and rocks, which adds depth and a sense of natural beauty to the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, perched on a large rock adjacent to the waterfall, is a solitary figure observing the scene. This person appears small compared to the grand scale of the natural elements surrounding them, emphasizing the vastness and wildness of the environment.\n\nThe overall impression is one of majestic natural beauty, emphasizing the power and serene qualities of the waterfall within a forested environment. The viewer may also feel a sense of tranquility and awe inspired by the natural setting and the sheer scale of the waterfall.","title":"Gorman Falls - a clean, spring water creek.
