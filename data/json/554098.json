{"path":"554098.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a fish market, characterized by a lively and engaging atmosphere. The image is focused on a group of people gathered around a display of various types of fish laid out on a table. These fish are mostly whole and appear fresh, with their vibrant colors and details visible. Some of the displayed fish have tags presumably indicating prices or types.\n\nThe group comprises seven individuals, predominantly males, with a diverse range of ages. The people in the group exhibit varying levels of interest and engagement: some are intently inspecting the fish, pointing and presumably discussing characteristics or prices, while others appear to simply be observing. The mostly casual attire of the individuals, which includes t-shirts, button-up shirts, and different styles of hats, suggests an everyday, informal setting.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is intimate, with a shallow depth of field putting the emphasis on the people and the fish while softly blurring the background. The lighting is natural and soft, enhancing the authenticity of the market environment. The image portrays not only the commerce of the market but also cultural and social interactions centered around food.","title":"Customers looking over the day's assortment at the Hilo fish auction, a daily event","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554095","550320","554093","545284","547848","547856","544995","551396","550040","545063","551419","550041","546216","552810","546319","557131"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","market","price","group","tags","everyday","authenticity","put","blurre","type"]}
