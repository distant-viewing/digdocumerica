{"path":"550950.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a river landscape showing signs of environmental degradation or disaster aftermath. The murky water of the river is at the foreground, reflecting a dull sky. On the riverbank, there are three large, white debris objects partially submerged in the water, appearing like geometric blocks, possibly foam or parts of structures. The bank itself is littered with a variety of trash and smaller debris, suggesting recent flooding or dumping, accompanied by scattered vegetation.\n\nThe surrounding area is densely wooded with mostly leafless trees, indicating that it might be late autumn or winter. The trees are thin and densely packed, contributing to a sense of unkept wilderness. Branches and fallen trees add to the chaotic appearance of the scene. There are no visible human activities or people; the focus is entirely on the environmental impact being showcased. The overall atmosphere is somber and reflects neglect or the aftermath of a natural disaster.","title":"Trash thrown down the river bank pollutes the kanawha river.  Between st.
