{"path":"548058.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful nautical scene. In the foreground, the main focus is on a sailboat with a vibrant orange hull and a white sail marked with the number 2790. The sail is fully unfurled, suggesting a good wind, and the boat glides smoothly over the water's surface, tilting slightly due to the force of the wind.\n\nBeside the sailboat, to its right, a motorboat is speeding through the water, creating a sharp wake behind it. Inside, two individuals can be seen; one appears to be handling the boat while the other enjoys the ride, both seeming to wear minimal summer clothing, indicative of warm weather.\n\nIn the background, the river bank is lined with dense green foliage and trees, making a stark contrast with the water and boats. The shore is dotted with exposed sandy stretches, indicating a low water level or natural riverbank structure.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of leisure and recreation, emphasizing a vibrant interaction between human activity and the serene natural environment.","title":"Boating on the Columbia River.
