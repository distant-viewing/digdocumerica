{"path":"547487.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic natural landscape featuring a narrow water channel or creek, which meanders through a lush wetland area. The creek is bordered by thick, tall grasses and reeds, which appear vibrant and healthy. In the center background of the image, the land opens up into a wide plain or meadow, where shorter grasses are visible, suggesting a transition from wetland to drier area.\n\nThe overall tone of the sky is slightly overcast, casting a diffused light and soft shadows over the landscape, indicating a cloudy day or an area not directly under sunlit conditions. This subdued lighting enhances the natural greens and browns of the vegetation and the dark blues and grays of the water.\n\nIn the far background, beyond the meadow, a line of trees stands with one particularly prominent tree visible, characterized by its slightly larger size and possibly different type from the surrounding foliage. These trees act as a natural barrier or backdrop to the scene, contributing to a sense of depth and seclusion in this wild setting.\n\nThe composition of the photograph draws attention from the foreground, where the creek starts and leads the viewer's eye along its winding path through the landscape, towards the open meadow and trees in the distance. This effect is complemented by the natural lines of the creek and the arrangement of tall grasses alongside it, creating a serene and untouched look at a natural waterway within a diverse ecosystem.","title":"Salt marsh in Tiverton","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["555211","546126","545473","553434","544470","545008","553084","558009","546896","557111","557498","550786","550351","547488","550345","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["creek","meadow","wetland","grass","start","seclusion","reed","tree","channel","act"]}
