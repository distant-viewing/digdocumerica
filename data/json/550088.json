{"path":"550088.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing next to a vintage gasoline pump at a service station. He is wearing dark-rimmed glasses, a dark T-shirt, and dark pants, with his hands casually placed on the gas pump. The pump is adorned with signs that display \"Gulf No-nox\" logos and a prominent hand-written cardboard sign on its top stating \"Sorry No GAS\", indicating a shortage. Behind the man, the station's signage reads \"STAY HAPPY WITH LAFFIN GAS\", possibly a clever name or slogan for the establishment. The background show parts of the station, including a red-striped awning, and suggests a sunny day with bright lighting conditions. The setting provides a glimpse into a mid 20th-century American gas station.","title":"'Sign of the energy crisis'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550096","555434","555486","555485","555467","548173","548047","555489","555495","555405","555414","557834","555465","548171","555484","555502"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["pump","station","gas","stay","shortage","slogan","gasoline","awning","cardboard","write"]}
