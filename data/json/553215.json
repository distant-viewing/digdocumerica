{"path":"553215.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"In this photograph, two men are deeply engrossed in a game of chess, seated on a low wall made of large concrete blocks. The setting appears to be an outdoor public area, possibly a park or an urban square. Both men are dressed in casual attire. The man on the left wears a vivid red shirt with a patterned design, black striped trousers, and black shoes, whereas the man on the right dresses in a vertical-striped shirt, maroon trousers, and black shoes. Their body language shows concentration and engagement, leaning slightly forward towards the chessboard which is directly between them on the wall.\n\nIn the background, there are other people engaged in various activities. Some are seated on steps and benches, talking or watching the area, while others are walking by. The environment is verdant, suggesting trees or bushes nearby, and the location appears to be well-attended and lively, with people enjoying their time in a communal setting. The overall atmosphere of the image captures a casual, serene moment in an urban setting.","title":"Game of chess on \"sitting wall\" in Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553197","556219","551958","553291","553290","546155","553158","552034","553270","544213","556775","553208","548567","551434","553222","550763"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["shoe","trouser","maroon","man","language","wall","attend","square","seat","game"]}
