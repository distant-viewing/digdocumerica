{"path":"548593.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a dense forest engulfed in mist and smoke, potentially due to a wildfire. The landscape is covered with a variety of tall, slender trees, possibly pines or a similar species, emerging from the foggy surroundings. Visible are patches of active fire at the base of the trees, with bright flames and smoke indicating ongoing burning. The smoke mixes with the natural fog of the area, creating a thick haze that shrouds much of the forest, obscuring details and giving the scene a somber, eerie glow. The atmosphere is heavy and likely filled with the scent of burning wood. This image depicts the destructive interaction between natural landscapes and fire, capturing both the beauty and the peril of this environmental phenomenon.","title":"Forest fire in the Everglades, Collier County. Fires are fairly common in the Everglades in dry seasons or dry years. 1973 was not dry, however, and there have been reports that the condition was caused by drainage of the land for commercial development.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["548596","555157","548592","553561","548597","553843","548590","548595","548591","553625","553560","542937","555088","555113","553128","554956"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["smoke","fire","wildfire","burning","phenomenon","engulf","flame","burn","forest","pine"]}
