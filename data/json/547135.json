{"path":"547135.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a heartwarming moment where a family is engaged in playful activities on a street. The scene unfolds under a clear sky, casting a vivid and expansive backdrop.\n\nIn the composition, an adult (presumably a father) is holding two children aloft, one in each arm. The children appear to be a boy and a girl, and they seem delighted with the joyous handling, both looking downward toward whoever is capturing the moment. The father is clothed in a plaid jacket, indicating a setting that might be in cooler weather. The children are also dressed in warm clothing; the boy is in a blue jacket and the girl in pink, both wearing pants.\n\nThey are positioned in front of a low wall, which appears to be an old structure with a mix of stones and concrete, showing signs of weathering and age. The street on which they stand is composed of asphalt, and the photographâ€™s perspective partially captures the shadow of the photographer, adding a personal touch to the image.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is cheerful and the setting casual, emphasizing a spontaneous family outing or a playful interaction during a casual walk or visit to a place of significance. The clear blue sky and the broad daylight suggest the photo was taken during the day, which highlights the family in a naturally bright environment, adding to the warmth of the scene.","title":"Breakwater at Michigan City","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["544310","552655","553094","543540","547398","551934","556531","557368","554506","556561","543866","547391","543515","556235","556525","551027"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["father","family","child","girl","boy","visit","photographer","jacket","unfold","asphalt"]}
