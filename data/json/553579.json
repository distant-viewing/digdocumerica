{"path":"553579.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a mysterious and somewhat somber forest scene. The composition is dominated by tall, thin trees with bare branches, suggesting it might be late autumn or winter. The trees are dense and vertically oriented, filling most of the frame and accentuating the height of the forest.\n\nThe background shows a slight clearing where a bit of an open field or possibly a lower density forest area can be seen, painted in muted tones of green and brown, indicating a sparse underbrush or grassland.\n\nThere are no leaves on the trees, providing a clear view through the forest, which suggests this might be after the leaves have fallen. The lighting in the photo creates long shadows that stretch across the forest floor, adding to the dramatic and serene quality of the scene.\n\nThe sky is barely visible at the top of the frame, appearing to be a light blue color, which contrasts with the predominantly dark and earthy tones of the trees and ground.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of quiet isolation and natural beauty, emphasizing the stark forms of the trees against a relatively bright background. The mood is introspective and calm, with an almost painting-like quality to the composition.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora scene within burn area known as \"granite creek.\"  Skeletons of trees stand at the edge of a meadow which the fire spared","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553574","543621","553578","555122","542849","557601","543406","557019","554746","553625","542931","542932","555119","554718","555081","543487"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","underbrush","tree","painting","grassland","quality","leaf","accentuat","clearing","density"]}
