{"path":"553321.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging moment at what appears to be a crowded event, possibly a protest or public gathering.\n\nA woman is featured prominently in the foreground. She is dressed in a vibrant and colorful outfit that includes a yellow sleeveless top and a white skirt with broad horizontal stripes in bright colors like pink, green, and yellow. She accessorizes with a black shoulder bag, sunglasses with dark round lenses, and a wide-brimmed hat that matches her outfit. Her hat is decorated with badges and she is holding up a yellow placard with messages that are not clearly visible due to the angle and focus of the photo.\n\nThe woman's expressive face and open mouth suggest she is speaking out or chanting, indicating her active involvement in the event. The atmosphere around her is dynamic and suggests the presence of many other attendees, although their details are largely blurred and they are mostly viewed from the back or side. The attire of other individuals looks typical of casual streetwear which might hint the era as being in the 1970s or 1980s based on fashion styles.\n\nThe background shows a partial view of a structure, possibly a building or monument, but it's mostly obscured by the crowd. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of energy and participation in a public cause.","title":"Fountain Square during a noon concert by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.
