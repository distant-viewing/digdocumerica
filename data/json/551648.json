{"path":"551648.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"In the photograph, three individuals are engaged in various activities on a bustling city street or a public gathering area.\n\nThe focal point of the image is a person in the foreground dressed in a stylish, light-colored bucket hat and dark sunglasses, actively taking a photograph with a small camera. They wear a long-sleeve denim jacket over white pants, showcasing a chic, casual appearance.\n\nNext to this individual, partially cropped out of the frame, is another person looking with intent in the same direction as the photographer. This person sports a simple outfit featuring a sleeveless blue and white top paired with a patterned blue skirt, accessorized with a watch and a light-colored shoulder bag.\n\nSeated in the background, an older woman, appears to be resting or observing her surroundings. She is dressed in a floral blue and white dress, visibly more relaxed in posture.\n\nThe setting includes some architectural elements such as imposing building columns, and deep colored storefronts with signage that reads \"VOX\". The environment suggests a shopping or urban recreational area with other passersby visible in the background, contributing to a lively, urban atmosphere.","title":"Rockefeller center--5th avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551816","551829","553275","545231","553963","549806","553204","551835","557039","549907","556226","549671","551798","551911","551434","556199"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["person","intent","public","stylish","passersby","photographer","accessorize","storefront","shopping","reads"]}
