{"path":"543990.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene of a bar or recreational lounge, dimly lit with a somewhat vintage ambience. The setting features several people engaging in leisure activities such as playing pool and socializing.\n\nIn the foreground, two pool tables are visible with individuals playing a game. One person stands, taking a shot, while another leans against the pool table, observing the game or awaiting their turn. The pool tables are illuminated by overhead lamps, which cast a concentrated glow on the green table surfaces.\n\nTowards the center and background of the room, there is a bar area where a few people are gathered. Behind the bar, shelves stocked with various bottles and drinking glasses can be seen, and a bartender appears to be serving the customers. The patrons around the bar seem to be engaged in conversation or enjoying their drinks.\n\nThe walls of the room are decorated with multiple hunting trophies, including mounted heads of deer and elk, adding a rustic feel to the environment. There are also pinball machines visible along the left wall, adjacent to one of the pool tables, suggesting additional entertainment options available in the lounge.\n\nThe lighting is subdued, predominantly coming from the lamps above the pool tables and smaller lights at the bar, contributing to the overall moody and relaxed atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Pool hall","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543975","546975","547794","547376","553518","558302","554278","551293","548233","546025","556613","551290","556441","551320","548234","550323"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["pool","bar","table","lounge","game","lamp","room","drinking","hunting","patron"]}
