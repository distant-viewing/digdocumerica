{"path":"547348.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, likely taken in the 1970s based on the style and model of the cars. The scene depicts a congested road filled bumper-to-bumper with a mix of vehicles, predominantly consisting of classic American cars from the era, painted in various colors. This traffic jam extends into the distance along the street.\n\nIn addition to the cars, there are road signs visible, including one that reads \"KEEP RIGHT\" and traffic lights. Commercial signs are also present; notable among them is a sign for a place called \"Honky Donky\" with additional signage indicating it's \"OPEN SUNDAYS NOON TO 5.\"\n\nFurther into the background, the architecture suggests a mix of commercial buildings. Prominent among these is a building featuring a large round red logo resembling a target, suggesting it might be a business logo or advertisement. The overall setting is urban and crowded, underscored by the density of both the traffic and the commercial environment. The vehicles and signs suggest the photograph could be from an area with a well-developed commercial district, possibly in North America.","title":"Traffic jam on dodge street, one of the city's main thoroughfares","placename":"Omaha (Neb.)","location":"Omaha, Nebraska","nn1":["542684","551324","547369","551135","550139","545216","546370","556724","549872","554297","553719","549903","555458","554551","556729","549919"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["bumper","traffic","logo","sign","jam","car","call","addition","mix","street"]}
