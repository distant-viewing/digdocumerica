{"path":"552867.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of an opened oyster shell resting on a wooden surface, presumably a table or a deck. The outer surface of the oyster shell is rugged and encrusted with marine growth, indicating it may have been underwater for a significant period. The inside of the shell displays a smooth, shiny, off-white texture which contrasts starkly with its rough exterior.\n\nInside the shell lies a small, mottled marine creature, appearing to be either a young fish or another mollusk. The creature has a pattern of dark and light stripes or spots, adapting to its environment likely as a form of camouflage. The creature is directly resting on what might be the oyster's pearl layer, showing no visible movement as if it’s using the shell as a protective hiding spot.\n\nThe ambient lighting emphasizes the texture contrasts between the marine growth on the shell’s outer surface and its luminous inner layer. The backdrop, largely shadowed and out of focus, concentrates viewer attention on the shell and its inhabitant, enhancing the intimate, serene nature of the scene.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oyster beds. Some of the men are preparing a legal deposition. Aboard Captain Pete Tesvich's boat they collect evidence for their case. A predator fish and its oyster prey, taken in Tesvich's dredge, is displayed on deck. Diseased oysters cannot close to protect themselves. A harvest of empty shells is the result.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552866","552880","552287","546365","552941","557605","555552","552860","555060","546306","546279","543264","546297","546322","555365","545186"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["shell","oyster","creature","growth","spot","inhabitant","inside","camouflage","layer","surface"]}
