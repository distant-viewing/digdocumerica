{"path":"550236.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and long shadows. The primary focus is a group of six people wading and playing in the shallow water of the lake. They are distributed along a gentle curve of the shoreline, which is mostly submerged under water, suggesting this might be a period of high water level or a particularly flat shore.\n\nAmong the group, different activities are evident: the closest to the foreground seems to be bending over, possibly picking something up from the water or adjusting something; others appear more engaged in playful activities, such as splashing water. One individual stands out from the group, being farther into the lake and more isolated, which could indicate swimming or wading deeper compared to others.\n\nAdding a dynamic element to the scene, a motorboat to the right of the image moves parallel to the shore, creating a trail of waves behind it. The boat contains at least one person who is managing the steering. The interaction or the lack thereof between the boat and the people suggests they are sharing the water space amicably but engaged in distinct activities.\n\nThe water itself is rendered with texture and varying shades, reflecting the lighting condition, and creates a tranquil yet lively setting for the activities of the bathers and the boat. The composition utilizes the natural curve of the shore and the path of the boat to guide the viewerâ€™s eye through the scene, balancing the tranquility of the environment with the liveliness of human activity.","title":"High waters of Lake Erie cover stone breakwater from which fishermen drop their lines.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["543892","550240","553431","552982","558233","553440","543951","545229","554477","550827","543998","551543","543943","544770","551538","553442"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","shore","curve","water","group","liveliness","lake","motorboat","steering","other"]}
