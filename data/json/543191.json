{"path":"543191.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a variety of colorful pebbles and small rocks, likely on a beach or riverbed. The stones come in various hues—blues, greens, browns, and greys—and are predominantly smooth and rounded, likely smoothed over time by water erosion.\n\nDominating the upper part of the image are dark, glistening seaweed leaves, which are spread out over the pebbles. The seaweed is sleek, with a wet appearance that reflects light, creating small, star-like bright spots where the sun hits its surface.\n\nOn the seaweed, two small, brownish snails are visible. They add a touch of life to the picture, emphasizing the interaction between the marine flora and the smaller creatures that inhabit this environment. The first snail is located towards the middle of the image and is slightly larger, while the second, smaller snail is near the bottom center edge of the seaweed.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the natural details and textures of this marine setting, presenting a snapshot of life at the intersection of land and water. The vivid colors and varying textures provide a rich visual interest, capturing the quiet yet dynamic essence of this ecosystem.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543150","543617","543292","550458","543152","547486","543185","547471","543142","549353","550483","543264","543183","550726","555182","543984"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["seaweed","pebble","creature","riverbed","star","intersection","flora","grey","erosion","texture"]}
