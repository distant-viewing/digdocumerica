{"path":"545700.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural landscape scene that likely takes place in a rugged, mountainous area. The composition includes a group of four hikers in casual outdoor attire, trekking through a rocky and arid environment. Three of the hikers are advancing along a dirt path surrounded by sparse vegetation, including small bushes and scattered trees. The fourth person is leading the way ahead of the others.\n\nIn the background, notable geological formations dominate the scene. These formations appear as towering rock pinnacles or hoodoos, characterized by their vertical structures and red-hued, weathered surfaces, suggesting erosion from wind and water over time. These rocks dramatically contrast with the brighter, expansive sky above, which adds a vivid backdrop to the setup.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of outdoor adventure and exploration, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural rock formations and the rugged terrain being navigated by the hikers. The setting suggests a remote, possibly protected natural area, emphasizing themes of wilderness and the enjoyment of natural spaces.","title":"On trail to Chesler Park.
