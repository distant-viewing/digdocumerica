{"path":"549165.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a red, vintage pedal car situated in a grassy area. The car is weathered with visible signs of rust and chipped paint. A prominent feature on the side of the car is a yellow, worn sticker with the text \"BAN STRIP MINING\" in bold, black letters, emphasizing an environmental protest against strip mining practices.\n\nThe pedal car is equipped with features typical of a real vehicle, including a steering wheel, which is positioned on the left. On the rear of the car, there's a bell with a push lever and a reflector. The words \"BALL BEARING DRIVE\" are also visible on the side of the car, indicating the type of mechanism used for the pedals.\n\nSurrounding the pedal car, tall grass and wild vegetation are thriving, suggesting the car is placed in a natural, possibly rural setting. The focus and lighting on the car, along with the vibrant green background, highlight the main subject and its message, effectively capturing a sense of nostalgia mixed with activism.","title":"Toy car on the John Redding ranch at Sarpy Basin.
