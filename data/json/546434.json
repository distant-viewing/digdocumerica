{"path":"546434.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a quaint, old-fashioned, two-story house with multiple architectural details typical of Victorian-era style, such as wood siding, decorative trim, and contrasting window frames. Painted in light olive green with darker green trims, the house features a variety of windows, including a bay window on the first floor and an attic window in the steep gabled roof.\n\nTo the right side of the house, there's a covered porch with ornate woodwork including spindlework in the porch's railing and a detailed bracket supporting the roof. The foundation of the house is stone, adding a solid contrast to the more delicate woodwork above.\n\nOutside the home, there's a well-maintained lawn. On the left side, framed between the main house and a shed painted in the same colors, a person is visible hanging laundry on a clothesline in the backyard. The setting suggests a peaceful domestic scene, enhanced by several mature trees that provide shade and greenery around the property. The sunlight casts shadows of tree branches onto the house and yard, indicating a bright, sunny day. The overall scene portrays a tranquil and serene residential setting, emphasizing a snapshot of daily life in a lush, green environment.","title":"Old home on chestnut street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546439","546438","558160","557068","557092","557094","558156","548662","558159","558153","557746","548667","550704","558035","548664","557076"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","woodwork","window","trim","porch","clothesline","bracket","laundry","backyard","foundation"]}
