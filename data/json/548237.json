{"path":"548237.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor office scene that gives the impression of a meeting or consultation. In the image, there are four individuals positioned within what appears to be a vintage, formal office setting. Starting from the left, the first two women are seated against the background of a large window covered with blinds. The first woman, sitting cross-legged, wears a dark coat and pants, while the second woman, also seated but with her legs crossed at the knees, wears a tan skirt and brown shoes, paired with a dark blazer.\n\nIn the center and right of the photograph, a man and another woman are positioned at a desk cluttered with papers and books. The man, seated in the middle, dons a dark suit and glasses and seems to be engaged in conversation or a meeting. Next to him, the young woman appears attentive to the discussion or perhaps to the documentation in front of her. \n\nThe office is equipped with traditional elements including a wooden desk, bookshelves filled with binders and books, and a sideboard behind the seated individuals. There’s an American flag on the left and various posters and pictures adorning the walls. One notable poster says, “Be a good neighbor. Help the Red Cross help your good neighbor,” which suggests a community-focused theme or event. Additionally, a framed scenic painting hangs centrally on the wall, enhancing the room's formal ambiance. The lighting in the room is soft, likely provided by ceiling fixtures, casting a warm glow that complements the dated interior design.","title":"Town selectmen's meeting in Rockport court house","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["547284","556028","547368","555233","552387","555234","546299","557038","552618","547407","547365","556270","555247","557704","545083","557682"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["office","woman","meeting","desk","poster","book","room","bookshelf","documentation","blind"]}
