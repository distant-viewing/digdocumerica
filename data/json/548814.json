{"path":"548814.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image features a striking, spherical object that resembles a globe. The surface of the globe is covered in a grid-like pattern of diverse, brightly colored squares that most likely represent geographical or man-made plots, though the colors used might also be indicative of a thematic representation, such as heat maps, demographic spreads, or other data visualizations.\n\nThe globe is highly detailed, showcasing sharp contrasts between the colors of individual squaresâ€”ranging from deep reds to bright yellows. There is an illusion of texture to the globe, emphasizing the different sections or divisions on its surface. The sphere is positioned against a dark background, suggesting it is illuminated to stand out, giving the image a dramatic and intense visual appeal.\n\nIn terms of its composition, the globe is centrally placed within the frame and slightly to the left, utilizing a perspective that shows it in part; the curvature of the sphere gracefully tapers off as it approaches the edges of the frame, alluding to the roundness and three-dimensional aspect of the object. The illusion of the globe's floating against the dark backdrop enhances its prominence in the visual field, pulling focus entirely to its surface details and colors. The foreground and background are devoid of other objects, ensuring that attention remains solely on the globe.","title":"Fish-eye shot of Imperial Valley.
