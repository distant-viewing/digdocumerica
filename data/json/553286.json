{"path":"553286.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an outdoor musical performance in an urban setting, likely a public square or courtyard. The image shows a large group of people gathered around a band. The band consists of multiple musicians with a range of instruments, including a grand piano, drums, and possibly a guitar and other equipment.\n\nThe layout is organized with the musicians located toward the center of the image while a crowd of people surrounds them in a semi-circular arrangement, extending out into loosely organized rows. The spectators are standing or sitting, some attentively watching the performance, others engaged in conversation, contributing to a casual, communal atmosphere.\n\nThe ground is paved with cobblestones, and there are no significant buildings or objects in the immediate background, suggesting the focus is strictly on the impromptu performance and the audience's engagement with the musicians. The overall composition of the photograph, viewed from above, emphasizes the communal nature of the event and the way music brings people together in a shared space.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
