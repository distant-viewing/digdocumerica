{"path":"542506.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, almost poetic scene of a biplane in flight during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The plane, a classical two-winged aircraft typical of early aviation, is in mid-air and slightly left of the center of the image, with its silhouette distinctly outlined against a softly glowing sky. The low sun casts a warm, golden light over the scene, creating a feeling of tranquility.\n\nBelow the aircraft, a vast field stretches across the foreground, densely populated with crops that are too indistinct to specifically identify but give a textured appearance to the landscape. The horizon is low, allowing a large expanse of sky to dominate the scene.\n\nIn the background, distant silhouettes of trees and possibly some structures are just visible through a light mist or haze which adds depth and a sense of distance to the photograph. This haze also enhances the golden hour light, contributing to the overall atmospheric quality of the image. The overall mood is peaceful and reflective, underscored by the quiet activity of the plane's flight and the expansive, open setting.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["553873","542500","548884","549072","542504","542496","542501","548841","542502","544491","542503","542499","548469","553044","553832","548215"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","flight","aircraft","haze","biplane","glowing","aviation","silhouette","atmospheric","identify"]}
