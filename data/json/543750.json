{"path":"543750.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking aerial or elevated view of a mountainous landscape, likely captured from a high vantage point. The image prominently features rugged mountain peaks covered with snow, illustrating a serene yet dramatic natural environment. The terrain is densely forested with dark evergreens on the steep mountain slopes, providing a stark contrast to the snowy peaks and adding a rich texture to the scene.\n\nA valley cuts through the mountains, showing a river or stream that meanders along the valley floor, surrounded by what appears to be cleared patches of land or possibly agricultural fields, though the details are not distinct enough to confirm their exact nature. A winding road parallels the river, snaking its way through the valley, suggesting connectivity and access to this remote area.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, alongside the river, there is an installation of some kind which could be a small settlement, a series of buildings, or industrial facilities, again specifics are hard to determine due to the distance. These structures are closely packed and situated adjacent to the road, hinting at human activity and potentially serving as a focal community or operational base within the valley.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as the mountains cast deep shadows over parts of the valley and the river, adding to the dramatic quality of the terrain. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the natural and human interaction within this secluded mountainous setting. The composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the natural curves of the landscape and the juxtaposition of human elements within it, offers viewers insight into the diverse uses and experiences of such a rugged terrain.","title":"Settling pond where wastes are allowed to \"settle out\" from milling process at Idarado Mill.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["550504","555678","550509","543742","550500","550413","542519","550634","545313","550507","550503","550518","550416","550595","550497","550514"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","mountain","river","peak","evergreen","specific","terrain","insight","connectivity","installation"]}
