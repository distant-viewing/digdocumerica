{"path":"543863.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tender and expressive moment between two individuals, likely a mother and her young daughter, against a natural backdrop. The young girl stands to the left of the frame, beaming a bright smile towards the camera. She appears cheerful, with wet, neatly combed hair that suggests she may have been playing in water. She wears a sleeveless red and white dress adorned with a geometric pattern and decorative trim around the collar and armholes.\n\nThe woman, assumed to be her mother, sits to the right, occupying the lower section of the frame. She has a subdued expression with a hint of a smile, and her eyes are slightly downcast, focused on the child. Her attire consists of a long-sleeved blouse decorated with small polka dots and a collar, suggesting a modest, simple style.\n\nBoth individuals are physically connected through a gentle hold; the child places her hands over the woman's hands, linking them in a protective and loving manner. This gesture adds a strong sense of closeness and affection to the scene.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, emphasizing the subjects. It suggests a wide-open space, possibly a field or a rural area, under a cloudy sky which provides a natural, diffused lighting over the scene. The moment captured seems tranquil and intimate, highlighting the bond between the two.","title":"Migrant mother with child, near sugar beet fields","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["551473","553543","556299","553496","556144","543854","556294","556145","550090","548793","556593","553219","543866","543040","551807","557632"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["mother","collar","smile","affection","bond","comb","polka","closeness","child","hand"]}
