{"path":"558375.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows a woman working meticulously within the intricate, open panels of a large piece of industrial or technological equipment. She is holding what appears to be a tool (possibly a soldering iron) close to a component within the machineâ€™s array of parts. The woman is wearing glasses and has straight, shoulder-length hair secured behind her ears. Her attire includes a short-sleeved shirt with a paisley pattern.\n\nThe internal structure of the equipment reveals a complex maze of wires, tubes, and mechanical components. Visible elements include red coiled wires, black tubes, various switches and buttons, metal frames, and bits of electronical interfaces that are perhaps part of a control system or power supply unit. The background suggests an industrial or lab setting given the functional style visible in the surroundings, including similar types of equipment and structured shelving. The image captures a focused moment of technological maintenance or assembly, illustrating the detailed and precise nature of such work.","title":"Interior of the 3m co.( Minnesota mining and manufacturing) plant showing an employee working with one of the machines.  3m has 1,377 employees which makes it the largest industry in town.
