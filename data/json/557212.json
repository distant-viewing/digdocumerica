{"path":"557212.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph features a fairly rustic and weathered wooden fence extending across the frame in an expansive grassy field. The fence is predominantly white with areas showing signs of aging and weathering, where the white paint has peeled off to reveal gray, weathered wood beneath. Variations in the fence's height and condition add a textured appearance to this barrier.\n\nOn the right side of the fence, there is a section that distinctly stands out due to taller wooden posts that are closely spaced together and retain more of their natural wood color, contrasting with the white of the rest of the fence. Above this section, there is a structure resembling a rudimentary fortification or lookout, built into the fence itself. It is made of the same style of wood, again primarily uncovered and maintaining its natural wooden look.\n\nThe foreground shows a well-maintained grass field, showcasing hues of green and brown under what appears to be the bright, possibly cold sunlight, suggesting either early spring or late fall, judging by the absence of leaves on the trees in the background. This tree line in the far distance forms a natural backdrop, indicating that the area is quite open and possibly rural. On the left side up close, there is a solitary evergreen tree, adding a splash of darker green to the scene, which emphasizes the rural and natural landscape setting of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements project a peaceful, slightly desolate rural scene, possibly part of a farm or a private large-scale property, with the landscape and structures suggesting functionality mixed with minimal artistic embellishment.","title":"Log walls acted as protection at Fort Kearny at Kearny, Nebraska, when the post was occupied from 1848 until abandoned in 1871 as the frontier moved westward. The site was located on the Oregon Trail. The fort was shelter to the settlers passing through and the men building the railroad. It has been restored by the state of Nebraska.","placename":"Kearney (Neb.)","location":"Kearney, Nebraska","nn1":["549154","543122","547404","543414","549156","543660","545159","547514","542895","546154","545823","543774","552448","557946","543116","549142"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["fence","wood","embellishment","section","field","aging","weathering","functionality","splash","variation"]}
