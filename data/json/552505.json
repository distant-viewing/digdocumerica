{"path":"552505.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up side view of an old, partially dilapidated bus. The bus is painted with a mix of dark blue and traces of red, with considerable patches where the paint has chipped away exposing the underlying surface. The focus is on the lower half of the bus, particularly highlighting a rusty and muddy wheel and tire that appears well-worn.\n\nTo the front of the bus, a door is ajar, and a faded, corroded step can be seen beneath it. A small warning sign that reads \"WATCH YOUR STEP\" is prominently placed near this door, affixed to the chassis alerting anyone entering or exiting the bus to be cautious. \n\nThe background features another part of the bus, possibly the rear end, indicating the bus is parked in a compact way, perhaps in a storage or junkyard area indicated by the limited visibility of surroundings outside the vehicle itself.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a sense of abandonment and decay, hinting at the long-stagnant state of the bus and its components. The scene is marked by textures such as rust and mud, contrasting against the solid mechanical construction of the bus, showing a poignant blend of human-made technological endeavor left to the elements.","title":"Junked bus","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["546927","544193","552773","549804","545540","552997","547587","552772","544720","555956","545295","555568","549107","547747","547814","545385"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["bus","step","chassis","door","affix","junkyard","poignant","rusty","paint","chip"]}
