{"path":"543350.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated wooden cabin in a rural or wilderness setting. The cabin consists of two main segments, each characterized by severe wear and different materials suggesting multiple repairs over time. The right segment of the cabin features darker, weathered wooden planks, some vertical and some horizontal, creating a patchwork appearance. The left segment is constructed with lighter, uneven wood planks and substantial gaps are visible, indicating decay and disrepair.\n\nBoth sections of the cabin have rusty tin roofs with numerous holes and patches, reflecting significant weather damage. Surrounding the cabin is a terrain overgrown with low, dry bushy vegetation, which might be sagebrush, typical of a semi-arid environment. The landscape gently slopes upward, covered in similar vegetation with no other structures in immediate sight.\n\nThe background reveals a soft-focus hillside, mostly barren with sparse vegetation, under a clear blue sky suggesting a dry, possibly arid climate typical of certain regions possibly in the western United States. This image conveys a sense of abandonment and the passage of time, emphasizing themes of isolation and neglect in a remote setting.","title":"Southern California -- Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543339","554786","543171","554707","552494","545518","545233","546149","542588","551111","556491","549193","543344","555231","554084","554788"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","segment","plank","tin","patchwork","hole","vegetation","sight","gap","repair"]}
