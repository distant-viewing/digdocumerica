{"path":"556168.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment in a residential setting. The focus is on a lush garden of rose bushes thriving in vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. These roses are closely packed and fill the foreground of the image, leading up to an ornamental trellis adorned with climbing roses in the middle ground.\n\nBeyond the garden, an elderly woman is seated on a cozy, cushioned bench on a porch. She appears relaxed and is dressed in a light pink and white outfit, blending harmoniously with the soft color palette of the garden. The porch features classical architectural elements such as wooden railings and a decorated column.\n\nThe house's exterior is visible just behind the porch, showing a part of its facade and window, suggesting a quaint and well-maintained home environment. The scene conveys a tranquil, domestic atmosphere, inviting viewers into a personal space filled with natural beauty and quietude.","title":"Black woman sits on a porch swing on Chicago's west side and surveys her rose garden.
