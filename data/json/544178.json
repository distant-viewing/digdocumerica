{"path":"544178.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged, unpaved road stretching through a barren landscape under a bright sky. The road is marked by deep tire tracks that meander into the distance, suggesting frequent use despite its rough condition. The terrain on either side of the road is sparsely vegetated with small bushes and patches of grass, indicative of a dry or semi-arid climate.\n\nIn the background, two prominent hills or low mountains rise against the horizon. Their presence adds a sense of depth and isolation to the scene, emphasizing the remote nature of this area. The sky above is clear and vividly blue, highlighting the daytime setting of the photograph.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or animals in the scene, which amplifies the sense of solitude and untamed wilderness. The road appears to be the main focal point, leading the viewer's eye directly toward the distant hills, and invoking a sense of curiosity about what lies beyond this rugged path.","title":"Access road to new development, the \"GRand Canyon\" estates.","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545604","554802","557468","554154","545575","544043","549013","545886","549179","545336","544428","549016","543665","544080","553662","545367"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","hill","curiosity","daytime","tire","climate","animal","wilderness","bush","sense"]}
