{"path":"544404.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring two elderly individuals, likely a man and a woman, in a rugged desert-like environment. The woman, on the left, is partially in motion and appears to be walking past the camera. She's dressed in traditional clothing which includes a dark colored skirt, a burgundy shawl, and a blue headscarf. Her expression is neutral and slightly turned towards the camera.\n\nThe man, positioned more centrally and standing still, is facing directly towards the camera. He wears a bright red shirt, dark trousers, and a black wide-brimmed hat. He has a turquoise necklace and is holding what seems to be a sack or a small bag in his left hand. His expression is calm and his posture is upright, giving him a dignified presence.\n\nBoth are surrounded by a natural landscape that includes sparse vegetation, primarily small bushes and a large tree immediately behind them. The terrain appears dry and rocky, typical of desert environments, and stretches back into rolling hills under a cloudy sky, which suggests it might be either dawn or dusk given the soft, diffused light.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene yet poignant, capturing a moment that feels both intimate and expansive, highlighting the individuals' connection to their environment.","title":"Arizona--Navajo nation","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["544408","544321","544089","557113","544330","556493","545612","545767","549037","543849","553202","545751","545602","554051","543469","548833"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["camera","desert","shawl","sack","headscarf","necklace","turquoise","expression","brim","rolling"]}
