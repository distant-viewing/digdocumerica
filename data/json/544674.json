{"path":"544674.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image features a natural landscape with industrial elements in a marsh or wetland environment. The focus of the photograph is a large concrete drainage structure set on the edge of a waterway. The waterway, possibly a river or canal, reflects the light of what appears to be a low sun, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon lighting. Foam and water-borne debris have collected at the edge of the structure and along the banks.\n\nThe concrete structure has a rectilinear, tunnel-like opening that allows water to flow under a pathway or road not visible in the image. The surrounding terrain is flat and covered with tall, dense grasses and other wetland vegetation, indicating a robust, natural setting. The sky is not prominently visible but contributes an overall brightness from one side of the image, highlighting the contrast between the man-made concrete and the natural environment.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the harsh, angular lines of the concrete with the organic, fluid lines and textures of the landscape, creating a visual dialogue about the interaction between human-made structures and natural waterways.","title":"Final-stage sewage enters the bay from the Union Sanitary District biofiltration plant.","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552254","556944","550715","548870","552071","558007","547952","552255","544289","549304","547890","546974","551519","549564","544673","547948"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterway","concrete","dialogue","drainage","tunnel","marsh","canal","collect","foam","opening"]}
