{"path":"546891.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or municipal scene featuring a water discharge system. In the foreground, a large concrete structure channels a dynamic flow of water, discharged from a large cylindrical pipe extending into the canal. The forceful ejection of water creates turbulence and foam on the water's surface, emphasizing the power and volume of the outflow.\n\nIn the background, a two-story, rectangular building with a beige or light brown façade stands atop a gently sloping hill. The building has multiple symmetrical windows and a central entrance, possibly serving an administrative or operational purpose related to the facility. Around this building, there are several parked cars, typical of the 1970s or earlier, suggesting the photo is from that era or perhaps the 1980s, based on the vehicle designs.\n\nSeveral leafless trees suggest that the season is either late fall or winter. The overcast sky hints at a chilly, damp environment, typical for such industrial settings. Adjacent to the water discharge area on the far right side of the image, a small structure with a blue-green façade, possibly housing equipment or controls for the facility, can also be seen.\n\nThis setting likely illustrates a water treatment facility or a similar utility environment where water management is key. The architecture and vehicles provide a nostalgic element, indicative of the period and functionality of the site.","title":"Sewage flows into back river sewage treatment plant, a primary treatment facility for the Baltimore area","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549564","550720","546801","549304","552136","547948","551180","557247","543810","542990","550708","550959","547568","550713","548212","550956"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["discharge","façade","water","facility","turbulence","chilly","volume","slop","treatment","canal"]}
