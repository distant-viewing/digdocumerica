{"path":"557881.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene dominated by a prominent stop sign in the foreground. The stop sign is red and octagonal with bold, white letters spelling \"STOP.\" It's mounted on a metal post, which is slightly rusted, suggesting it's been there for a while. The background is blurred but features a dark-colored sedan, paused as if obeying the stop sign. The car shows distinctive red taillights and a glossy finish.\n\nThe setting appears to be a tunnel or an underpass, as indicated by the ceiling structure visible above the car and the shadowy, artificially lit environment. The light source comes from above and slightly behind the stop sign, casting a direct light on it and making it the focal point of the image, while leaving the rest somewhat dimmer and less defined. The focus on the stop sign emphasizes its importance in traffic regulation, contrasting with the motion implied by the blurred vehicle in the background. The overall mood is a mix of motion and stillness, underlined by the urban setting and the common traffic scenario.","title":"Stop sign where motorists halt their vehicles and turn them over to employees at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
