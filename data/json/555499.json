{"path":"555499.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of cyclists riding along a roadside path. The scene is set against a moody, cloudy sky which creates a slightly somber ambiance. The riders are diverse in age, dressed in cold-weather attire, suggesting it might be a chilly day.\n\nThe closest cyclist to the camera is a young girl wearing a vibrant green hat and a red jacket; she's riding a bicycle equipped with a front basket and is leaning forward while pedaling. Behind her, the path is occupied by several other cyclists of varying ages, including what looks like another child and several adults, all maintaining a prudent distance from each other.\n\nThe asphalt path where they are cycling is bordered by grass on one side and a white railing on the other, beyond which there is a view of a calm water body, possibly a lake or river. Street lamps line the road, reinforcing the feel of a well-used public cycling path or parkway. The overall natural setting and overcast sky suggest a tranquil, albeit gray, day out cycling.","title":"School children were forced to use their bicycles on field trips during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1974. There was not enough gasoline for school buses to be used for extracurricular activities, even during dark and rainy weather.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555500","552340","555433","548574","547209","547241","550069","543719","545287","548572","546956","543715","557990","551545","548573","555501"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cyclist","path","ride","pedal","age","cycle","basket","rider","asphalt","bicycle"]}
