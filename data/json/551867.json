{"path":"551867.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a scene of an outdoor cafe set against a historic, architecturally detailed building, possibly a town hall or important civic building. In the foreground, there are numerous white metal chairs with a mesh design organized haphazardly around matching tables on a paved surface. The place is deserted suggesting the photo might have been taken early in the morning or during a less busy time.\n\nThe background is dominated by the intricate facade of the building which has multiple archways, decorative statues, and red flowers adorning its ornate balconies. The architecture suggests a Gothic style with its dark, weathered stone and elaborate embellishments.\n\nAdditionally, motion blur of a vehicle passing by suggests a long exposure, giving a sense of motion and life in contrast to the stillness of the empty chairs. This artistic choice adds dynamism to the scene, contrasting with the static and structured arrangement of the cafe furniture.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.  It is totally traffic free.  Not even bicycle riding is permitted.  On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned.  This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551635","551846","551637","551866","551634","550037","549657","551870","549677","551864","556046","549672","549669","551803","557643","549659"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["cafe","chair","dynamism","embellishment","motion","archway","hall","mesh","choice","statue"]}
