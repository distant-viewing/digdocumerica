{"path":"556260.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene inside a busy marketplace or craft fair. The central focus is a male vendor, who is actively engaging with potential customers about his products. The vendor is dressed in a traditional, patterned garment and a matching hat, adding a cultural element to the setting. He appears to be describing or showing off the various features of colorful handmade bags that hang from above.\n\nThe bags themselves are quite eye-catching, prominently displayed and hanging from hooks. They feature rich colors and detailed designs, suggesting they could be handcrafted or culturally significant items. The colors are predominantly red with green, yellow, and other vibrant hues incorporated into the designs.\n\nIn the foreground, there are customers listening to and interacting with the vendor. We see the backs of their heads, indicating they are paying attention to him. One customer, a woman to the right in a patterned blouse, reaches up towards one of the bags, possibly checking its quality or craftsmanship.\n\nThe background is somewhat blurred but includes a draped fabric or tapestry that adds to the ethnic or cultural ambiance of the stall. Overall, the setting is lively and filled with items that suggest a rich cultural heritage. The market scene is lively yet intimate, with the vendor passionately engaging with his audience about his wares.","title":"Black products was one of the themes at the annual Black Expo held in Chicago, also present were black education, talent, a voter registration drive and other aspects of black consciousness the aim is to make blacks aware of their heritage and capabilities and help them towards a better life.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551832","551690","551694","556215","551749","558249","557131","551691","557135","550068","551696","551751","550040","551695","557163","553141"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["vendor","customer","bag","marketplace","hook","heritage","item","craftsmanship","stall","tapestry"]}
