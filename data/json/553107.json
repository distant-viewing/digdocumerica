{"path":"553107.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, outdoor scene likely involving livestock herding or a veterinary procedure. Three individuals are present in the image, captured in a field with a backdrop of a gentle hill and expansive sky.\n\nIn the foreground on the left, a man wearing a light-colored straw hat, button-up shirt, and trousers kneels next to a large brown and white animal, possibly a calf or cow, that is lying on the ground. The man appears to be examining or comforting the animal, with one hand gently placed near its head.\n\nTo the right of this man, another individual, wearing dark clothing and a brown cowboy hat, is engaged in an activity involving the animal. He appears to be using a tool or instrument, possibly for a medical or grooming process, as he leans over the animal's side.\n\nBehind these two, there is a third person partially visible, wearing a red top and dark skirt or pants. This person's activity is unclear, as they are mostly obscured by the other figures.\n\nIn the background, a small herd of cattle can be seen grazing in the field under a vast, slightly clouded sky. The terrain is grassy and open, suggesting a pastoral setting common in farming or ranching areas.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
