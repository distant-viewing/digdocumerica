{"path":"550823.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts two young women canoeing on a calm river or lake. The foreground shows a silver canoe with one woman seated near the stern and the other near the bow. Both women are actively paddling, with the woman in the front holding her paddle vertically in the water, while the woman in the back holds her paddle horizontally, seemingly steering the canoe.\n\nThey are sporting casual, summery clothing; the woman in the front wears a long, light-colored dress, while the woman in the back wears what appears to be a sleeveless top and shorts. Both have their hair down, flowing and appear to be enjoying the activity, displaying relaxed smiles.\n\nThe background features a dark, densely wooded area that suggests they are in a secluded or natural setting. The light on the scene comes from above, illuminating the subjects and the reflective surface of the water with soft natural light, enhancing the peaceful and leisurely feel of the image.","title":"Canoers on the Wisconsin river at Wisconsin dells, a popular recreation area","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["553345","549996","553800","554469","553409","550767","547213","551518","550659","553343","553806","554468","550822","550309","551546","550768"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","woman","paddle","back","stern","steer","front","silver","bow","come"]}
