{"path":"546602.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a shopping mall parking lot. The main background features a large building with \"Leiner Shoes\" signage, indicating it is a shoe store or part of a shopping complex. The building facade above the shop is plain and colored in a muted red-brown hue, with large glass doors and closed shutters on one side.\n\nThere are two prevalent objects in the lot: a young, leafless tree centrally located in the foreground, and a post standing near it. On the far right, behind some bright yellow-orange bushes, the front part of an old-fashioned bus is visible, suggesting some form of public transportation or shuttle service to and from the mall.\n\nIn the foreground, two men, likely in professional attire, are walking together across the parking lot. One is wearing a dark coat and the other a lighter, grey coat. Both appear to be engaged in conversation, moving along an empty parking area delineated by faded parking lines.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image suggests a calm, perhaps cool day, indicated by the barren tree and the attire of the men. The emptiness of the parking lot might imply it is either early before the shops open or a typically quiet time for the mall.","title":"Disciplined riders queue up for early morning express bus from Montgomery Mall (MD shopping center) to Washington, DC.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546594","546598","546590","549858","556801","552789","546599","555449","549885","556196","546596","556201","548496","556736","550126","543890"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["parking","lot","shopping","shop","coat","emptiness","shutter","store","attire","bus"]}
