{"path":"543882.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of two vintage bicycles securely mounted on a car roof rack. The bicycles have a classic design with curved handlebars and old-fashioned leather seats. Behind, there's a colorful and visually busy background consisting of a vibrant advertisement board for fireworks. The board displays various texts and images promoting different kinds of fireworks, including brands like \"Cherry Bomb\" and \"Space Age,\" with prices and promotional messages. The car is a vintage model with distinct rounded edges and an elongated, boxy shape typical of mid-20th century station wagons. The setting seems to be in a parking lot, possibly near a store selling fireworks, as indicated by the advertisement in the background. The scene is bright with clear, sunny weather, highlighting the vivid colors of the advertisement and the shiny metallic surfaces of the bicycles and car.","title":"Visual pollution along Interstate 24","placename":"South Pittsburg (Tenn.)","location":"South Pittsburg, Tennessee","nn1":["545328","551443","547494","543887","544859","556719","558254","546093","543947","549316","547495","542640","554312","547797","548802","551456"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["bicycle","advertisement","board","car","handlebar","leather","price","rack","brand","wagon"]}
