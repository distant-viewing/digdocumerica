{"path":"543698.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a vast accumulation of discarded bottles and other debris, predominantly composed of glass and scattered across what resembles a dumpsite or beach. The pieces vary greatly in color, shape, and size, emphasizing a disorganized, yet dense heap of refuse. Notable are various glass bottles — some whole and others broken — that reflect different stages of wear and degradation. A few bottles standing out include a relatively intact green bottle lying horizontally and another clear bottle that appears crushed or compressed, situated close to the right edge of the image.\n\nAmong the glass-dominated debris, there are also fragments of metal and possibly ceramic, indicating a mix of different types of waste. There are no signs of any human presence or activity directly in the photograph, which focuses tightly on the litter itself. The background is blurred and out of focus, ensuring the viewer's attention is drawn primarily to the environmental impact exhibited by the piled-up waste materials. The overall composition conveys a strong message about pollution and the consequences of human consumption and waste disposal practices.","title":"Beer bottles ready to be fed into crusher.
