{"path":"547195.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene with several people, potentially engaged in the act of waiting for or observing a bus. A bus, marked with a destination sign reading \"Devon-Kedzie,\" is prominently positioned on the left side of the frame. The scene is set against a backdrop of a residential building, which is a multi-level, brick structure typical of urban apartment designs from mid-20th century America.\n\nThe foreground features silhouetted figures, likely due to the lighting conditions emphasizing shadow rather than detail. Among these figures, at least four individuals can be discerned. These include a person with a cane, suggesting mobility support. The individuals appear to be engaged in different activities: standing and looking towards the bus, suggesting a focus on transportation or travel. The overall ambiance hints at an everyday urban situation likely from the mid to late 20th century, with elements such as vintage clothing styles and older vehicle models reinforcing this temporal context.\n\nThe somber lighting and colour palette, featuring darker hues and a pervading bluish tinge, lend a slightly moody atmosphere to the snapshot, highlighting the mundane yet intimate moment of urban life. The composition, with its silhouetted figures against the light background of the bus and the building, adds a graphic quality to the image, emphasizing shapes and form over color detail.","title":"Sheridan Road bus stop","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546605","546655","556203","546650","545385","549644","547814","556786","549891","556742","546668","553796","556804","556050","546735","551445"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","figure","cane","mobility","century","destination","situation","act","apartment","support"]}
