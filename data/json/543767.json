{"path":"543767.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a complex and rugged landscape. The image shows an area bisected by a relatively straight roadway running vertically through the photo. To the left and right of the roadway are extensive areas of natural terrain featuring dense patches of trees, with the left side partly revealing grassy fields.\n\nA prominent feature is a winding river or creek that snakes through the landscape, parallel to and just right of the road. This water body is characterized by its meandering curves and branches, with some parts of its banks showing signs of erosion or sand deposits.\n\nAt the top left corner, further from the road, there is a large, semicircular area cleared of most vegetation, inside which are two small rectangular ponds with water that appears distinctly green, contrasting sharply with the surrounding brown earth. Near these ponds, there are signs of construction or excavation activity, with pathways and cleared areas suggesting human intervention.\n\nThe entire scene is framed by natural forested areas, and the terrain varies from flat fields to more textured, undulating ground indicating a diverse topography. There is no visible presence of people or moving vehicles, emphasizing the stillness and perhaps the remoteness of the location. The image captures both the natural beauty and the human-altered sections of the environment, highlighting interactions between the two.","title":"Aerial view of the idarado mill, where gold, silver, lead and zinc are processed.
