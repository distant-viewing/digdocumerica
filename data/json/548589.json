{"path":"548589.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a landscape that is apparently undergoing some form of land use alteration or disturbance, likely indicative of logging or agricultural preparation activities. The photograph captures vast expanses of terrain with distinct patches of vegetation.\n\nThe main features of this landscape include:\n1. **Forests**: There are different sections of forested areas visible, showcasing a variation in colors. The most prominent area is reddish-brown in color, potentially indicating a change in the health or type of vegetation. Surrounding these areas, there are patches of greener trees that contrast with the reddish-brown sections.\n\n2. **Clearings and Roads**: Throughout the landscape, there are clear linear patterns that can be interpreted as roads or cleared paths, possibly used for access to and from different parts of the forest. These roads dissect the landscape into blocks, assisting in structured land management or harvesting activities.\n\n3. **Smoke or Dust**: In a part of the image, there is visible smoke or dust rising from the ground among the tree lines, suggesting active work, such as burning of debris, clearing, or other land management processes.\n\n4. **Background**: The horizon shows a flat landscape extending far with no significant elevation changes visible. The sky is overcast, casting an even light over the scene which dampens the color contrasts.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the scale of human intervention in natural landscapes, highlighting patterns of resource extraction and land management in forested regions.","title":"Forest fire in the Everglades, Collier County. Fires are fairly common in the Everglades in dry seasons or dry years. 1973 was not dry, however, and there have been reports that the condition was caused by drainage of the land for commercial development.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["553051","542835","556938","542834","544962","555812","556920","553695","556922","545143","542833","554163","556996","557001","551204","544438"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["management","land","change","landscape","burning","smoke","harvesting","section","alteration","health"]}
