{"path":"555896.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts two young women standing in front of a graffiti-covered wall. The graffiti includes various tags and symbols painted in multiple colors, and notably, there's a large cartoon-like face drawn in black with a white outline.\n\nOn the left, a young woman stands with her left arm slightly extended, touching the other woman's arm. She wears a simple white t-shirt, a plaid skirt, and has a pendant necklace. Her expression is somewhat reserved as she looks directly at the camera.\n\nThe woman on the right poses with her hand on her hip, smiling towards the camera. She wears a patterned halter neck crop top with a white collar and high-waisted khaki trousers.\n\nThe overall mood of the picture, influenced by both the colorful urban background and the attire of the women, reflects a vibrant and youthful urban culture, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s given the style of clothing and the photographic quality. The interaction between the women and the playful background suggests a casual, yet lively urban setting.","title":"Two latin girls pose in front of a wall of graffiti in lynch park in Brooklyn, New York city, this project is a portrait of the inner city environment, it contains life, great murals on the walls of buildings and people enjoying themselves, today's inner city is a contradiction to main stream america's gas stations expressways shopping centers and tract homes, blacks, latins, and poor whites live there","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["549290","554909","549678","549865","551013","552962","553164","551436","551124","545423","552753","553155","556176","553166","553212","551923"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","graffiti","halter","arm","cartoon","hip","necklace","khaki","tag","1980"]}
