{"path":"557274.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph offers a sweeping view of a city's downtown area captured from an elevated vantage point. It features a large, picturesque cityscape that encompasses several distinctive landmarks, bridges, and architectural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, the city is divided by a river, bustling with activity and bordered by several bridges that connect the cityscape. Notable among these is a prominent, curvy bridge with a sleek, modern design that stands out due to its white color and graceful arches.\n\nThe left side of the image displays a large rounded stadium-like building nestled near the riverbank. This structure, with its multi-tiered, circular design, is a focal point along with the adjacent bridge.\n\nThe central part of the photograph reveals a densely packed cluster of various high-rise buildings. These include office buildings, which vary in height, facade colors, and architectural styles, adding to the dynamic urban atmosphere. The buildings are predominantly modernist, with some featuring dark glass facades and others clad in lighter materials.\n\nIn the background, the landscape slopes upward, transitioning from the downtown area to greener, more residential areas that extend into rolling hills. The horizon line is marked by gentle undulations of these hills, indicating the sprawling nature of the city as it moves away from the river.\n\nAbove, the sky is filled with scattered clouds, suggesting a clear but vibrant day. The cloud formations also add a touch of dramatic flair to the overall ambiance of the urban scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph is structured to highlight the interplay between natural landscapes and man-made architecture, underlined by the bustling activity of a thriving city. The perspective used here not just captures the physical layout of the city, but also evokes a sense of its vibrancy and scale.","title":"Golden Triangle shown from the Mt. Washington area.
