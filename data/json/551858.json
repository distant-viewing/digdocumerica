{"path":"551858.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil scene at a city square with a large, powerful fountain in the background. The fountain is spraying water high into the air, and this water action forms a misty haze which partially obscures the buildings that line the square.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals, seemingly unrelated, are seated on what appear to be large, cylindrical stone boulders scattered across the paving of the square. From left to right:\n\n1. A balding man dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt. He is sitting with his legs crossed and has a serious or contemplative expression. His gaze is directed downward towards his lap.\n\n2. Positioned in the center is a younger individual, with dark hair, wearing a dark blazer over a light-colored shirt. This person is seated in a somewhat hunched position, resting his chin on his hand, appearing deep in thought or perhaps weary.\n\n3. On the right, another figure is shown seated with her back partly turned towards the camera. She is dressed in a light-colored trench coat and seems to be looking out towards the fountain or the square.\n\nThe general atmosphere is one of calm and introspection, with each person appearing absorbed in their own thoughts against the backdrop of the dynamic fountain and peaceful architectural setting. The square itself is paved and surrounded by buildings with classical architectural features, suggesting this might be a European city. The ambiance created by the combination of historical architecture, a public square, and individual moments of reflection presents a reflective and timeless urban snapshot.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. This modern fountain at the western end has replaced a busy traffic circle. The rough hewn stones provide resting places.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["553224","551658","551793","553207","550747","551468","549982","551449","551663","551480","551855","551647","551636","550748","553281","551772"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["square","fountain","thought","paving","trench","chin","introspection","blazer","lap","city"]}
