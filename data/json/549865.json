It appears to be an urban environment, possibly an alley or large open space near buildings. The graffiti includes a variety of colors and styles, prominently featuring names and tags. Some of the larger words written include \"BORICUA\" and other personal names and symbols.\n\nThe children, a diverse group, seem to be mostly smiling and laughing. There are a variety of poses, with some of them pointing towards the camera, some holding sticks, and others with arms around each other, suggesting camaraderie and friendship. The kids are dressed in typical casual streetwear of the era, including jeans, jackets, and layered shirts. Their expressions and casual stances give the scene a lively, carefree feel.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of youthful exuberance against the backdrop of a vividly graffitied urban wall, highlighting a contrast between the playful innocence of the children and the rough surface covered in street art, suggesting a narrative of life and identity in a vibrant, dynamic urban landscape.","title":"A sidewalk in the Bronx becomes a playground for these youngsters","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555901","551726","552759","548271","553513","552753","546873","551926","555939","555896","551727","545319","556265","551716","557987","556163"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","name","friendship","kid","innocence","identity","alley","tag","variety","camaraderie"]}
