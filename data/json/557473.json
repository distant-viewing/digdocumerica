{"path":"557473.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a wintery, barren landscape that appears to be a frozen beach or coastal area. Two military vehicles, resembling tanks or similar armored vehicles, are positioned on the beach, moving away from the viewer. Each vehicle has several soldiers stationed on top, appearing vigilant and possibly observing the area around them.\n\nThe terrain is covered with a layer of snow, and the vehicles have left deep tracks in their wake, suggesting the ground beneath the snow is soft or wet. In the foreground, the tracks are pronounced and intersect, indicating recent movement of multiple vehicles.\n\nThe background features a calm sea that meets the overcast sky on the horizon, contributing to the cold and desolate mood of the scene. The colors in the image are muted, with shades of blue, grey, and white dominating, which underscores the chilly and austere environment.\n\nThe overall composition gives a sense of isolation and preparedness, perhaps indicating a military operation or surveillance in a remote or strategic location. The presence of soldiers and military hardware juxtaposes starkly against the natural and empty landscape, highlighting human intervention in a desolate area.","title":"Marine vehicles on maneuvers along the ocean at the Camp Pendleton base. The shoreline encompassed by the base has retained much of its natural beauty because of limited public access. There are 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay) in the state. Of this total, 662 miles or 61 percent is privately owned; the remaining 410 miles is public property. There are some 145 miles under federal control with 47 miles open to the public.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["556917","547979","544721","547139","545604","543163","551943","555397","547523","554807","555883","544754","557193","549179","545596","557472"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["vehicle","wintery","snow","dominating","hardware","surveillance","beach","track","preparedness","intervention"]}
