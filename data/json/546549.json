{"path":"546549.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a library featuring a series of bookshelves arranged in a linear pattern. The shelves are well-stocked with a variety of books and some books or materials displayed on the ends of the shelves for easier access or highlight.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a brick wall that complements the warm wooden tones of the bookshelves and the floor, suggesting a quiet and sturdy atmosphere typical of traditional libraries. The floor is carpeted in a color that matches the wooden hue, adding to the cohesive aesthetic of the space.\n\nIn the scene, a person with long hair, wearing a dark jacket and a light-colored shirt underneath, paired with patterned pants, is selecting or reading a book. The person stands facing one of the bookshelves, slightly bent towards a book they are holding with both hands.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subdued, with focus lighting appearing to highlight the books, enhancing the calm and studious ambience of the library. The composition of the photo, with its depth created by the rows of shelves, guides the viewer's eye along the length of the library, conveying a sense of order and tranquility.","title":"Rogers memorial library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["549337","549361","546560","553763","546553","555316","552592","546478","546500","553535","548219","546564","546554","546511","555310","551127"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["library","book","bookshelf","shelf","floor","select","stock","order","carpet","ambience"]}
