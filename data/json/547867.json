{"path":"547867.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene at a beach. It features a young child, appearing to be a boy with shirtless upper body and striped shorts, playing at the water's edge. The child is energetically running along the shore, partially splashed by an incoming wave. \n\nThe background shows a large suspension bridge spanning over a wide body of water. This bridge has two prominent towers and cables creating a distinctive silhouette against the sky. To the left, the beach appears somewhat deserted with a few sparse elements like debris and small patches of vegetation near the shoreline. On the right, extending into the water, thereâ€™s a long pier or jetty, supporting the vast expanse of the bridge.\n\nThe overall ambiance is vibrant yet serene, highlighted by ample sunlight and a clear sky with few clouds. The water at the beach has a gentle foamy surf, and the sand shows signs of wetness near the edges, reflecting a typical coastal environment. This setting not only emphasizes recreational beach activities but also the imposing architecture of the bridge in the distance, adding a sense of depth and scale to the landscape.","title":"South Beach, Staten Island.
