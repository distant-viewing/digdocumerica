{"path":"554154.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a long and bending road cutting through a rugged terrain. The road is seen from a high angle, possibly from an aircraft. The environment appears to be a vast, arid landscape with sparsely vegetated, flat plains extending far into the horizon. The terrain is mostly dark and barren, indicating volcanic or desert-like conditions.\n\nDust clouds trail behind vehicles, which are barely visible due to the distance, but they create dynamic, swirling patterns in the air. These clouds of dust emphasize the motion and activity on this otherwise desolate road.\n\nThe image uses a muted color palette mostly consisting of dark browns, purples, and hints of blues, highlighting the starkness and isolation of the landscape. The dusty trails and the way the road slices through the terrain adds a sense of movement and human interaction with a harsh environment. The overall mood is somewhat eerie and lonely, underscored by the vast open spaces and minimal signs of life or vegetation.","title":"New highway, under construction north of Kailua on the western side of the island, presages zoning changes from agricultural and conservation use to urban development.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554155","544178","545886","557468","544043","554802","554146","554131","549013","542838","549016","554130","545575","545604","545367","543665"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","terrain","starkness","plain","aircraft","cloud","dust","trail","purple","slice"]}
