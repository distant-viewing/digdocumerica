{"path":"557006.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of people outdoors, seemingly engaged in an activity involving plants or fungi. The primary focus is on two individuals, one holding a large mushroom-like object, showing it to another person who is facing the camera. The person holding the mushroom wears a red jacket with a blue cap peeking from under the hood, suggesting chilly or wet weather. This personâ€™s attention is directed towards the mushroom.\n\nNext to him, a woman in a blue jacket layered over a floral-patterned blouse is visible in profile. She has short hair and wears glasses, and looks toward the person holding the mushroom, indicating a moment of interaction or conversation, possibly about the object being held. Her facial expression seems to convey interest or curiosity.\n\nIn the background, there is another person visible only partially, adding a sense of depth and group activity to the scene. The setting appears to be a forest or heavily wooded area, evidenced by the dim natural lighting and the presence of foliage and trees around them.\n\nOverall, the composition and the attire of the individuals suggest an educational or recreational activity, possibly related to mycology or nature exploration, in a forest setting during cooler weather. The natural ambient lighting contributes to the serene and intimate feel of the photograph.","title":"Kitsap County Audubon Society members on a field trip.
