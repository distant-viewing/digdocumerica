{"path":"554290.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a winter scene involving several individuals and a car covered in snow. Two men, one wearing a green jacket and the other in a red jacket, are actively engaged in jump-starting a dark-colored sedan. One man is leaning over the bumper, attaching jumper cables to the battery, while the other is positioned by the open hood, assisting with the process. There is visible steam or smoke emanating from the area around the car which could be due to the cold air or the car being recently started in low temperatures.\n\nIn the background, two women are walking by, dressed warmly for winter. One woman appears to be looking at the men and the car. The setting is urban, featuring buildings that look like storefronts or office buildings. The sidewalk and the area around the car are covered in patches of white snow, indicating recent snowfall. The image portrays a practical moment of winter hardship, community assistance, and the ambiance of a cold, snowy day.","title":"Helping hands will get this skier's car off the ice","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["555483","549273","554229","553491","554263","554291","557181","558247","554258","554274","553492","548046","558246","557915","554262","546662"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["winter","car","start","hardship","snow","assistance","jump","snowfall","bumper","jacket"]}
