{"path":"544305.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic hiking adventure in a rugged, rocky terrain, presumably within a canyon or mountainous area. The image shows three hikers, likely on a trail, viewed from a slightly elevated angle. The composition lends a sense of depth and vastness to the landscape.\n\nThe foreground is characterized by large, uneven boulders and small pebbles, suggesting a dry riverbed or a similar natural trail. The hikers, two visible in more detail, are equipped for a long journey, carrying large backpacks. Their attire - shorts and simple shirts - suggests warm weather, and they appear to be moving comfortably through the challenging terrain.\n\nVegetation appears sparse but includes some bushy green trees or shrubs to the left side of the image, suggesting the presence of some water or moisture in the environment, despite the overall arid appearance. The lighting indicates it might be midday or early afternoon as the sunlight illuminates the top portions of the canyon walls in the background, which are visible rising steeply. The upper parts of these rocky formations are highlighted with a warm glow, contrasting with the shadowed areas.\n\nThis vivid image conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, emphasizing the scale of the natural surroundings compared to the human figures. It also illustrates the challenges and beauty of outdoor activities such as hiking in such a raw, natural setting.","title":"Hikers entering the GRand Canyon","placename":"Grand Canyon (Ariz.)","location":"Grand Canyon, Arizona","nn1":["545700","554558","544301","545781","545772","545762","545751","544903","554508","543385","543388","554503","545768","543382","554504","544902"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","canyon","challenge","adventure","trail","hike","riverbed","pebble","backpack","hiking"]}
