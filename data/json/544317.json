{"path":"544317.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a pastoral scene in a desert-like environment during what appears to be the late afternoon, given the warm lighting. In the foreground, there is a figure, likely a shepherd, dressed in traditional attire including a vibrant orange-red headscarf and a long dress-like garment in shades of red and pink. The shepherd is walking away from the camera, leading a flock of sheep that are spread out across the sparse grassy landscape.\n\nThe background features several rounded, barren hills that dominate the horizon, emphasizing the arid nature of the region. The soil is dry and covered sparsely with tufts of grass and small bushes, typical of a desert or semi-desert ecosystem. The sky is clear, suggesting a calm, dry weather condition.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses on the shepherd moving amidst a vast, open landscape, conveying a sense of solitude and the magnitude of the natural environment surrounding the lone figure and their animals. This setting highlights a lifestyle that is closely tied to the land and animal husbandry.","title":"Sheepherding on the grounds of the Utah International Mine on the Navajo Reservation","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["553807","544426","554928","553105","548954","544933","554883","554779","555820","554885","557747","544391","543269","544384","550450","552556"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["desert","animal","magnitude","flock","headscarf","sheep","figure","garment","lifestyle","ecosystem"]}
