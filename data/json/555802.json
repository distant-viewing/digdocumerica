{"path":"555802.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on the bow of a boat, where a man in a red shirt and dark pants is walking on deck, deep in activity. The boat's structure is curved, suggesting a broad front, and it is painted in a creamy or light tan color. The deck appears to be cluttered with ropes or lines, contributing to the working nature of the scene.\n\nThe image provides a panoramic view of the ocean - the waters are deep blue and slightly ruffled by the wind, merging into a clear horizon under a blue sky. The wake created by the boat forms dynamic swaths of white foam and turbulent water trailing into the distance, conveying the force of the vessel as it moves through the sea.\n\nAdditionally, there's a sense of isolation and focus on the task at hand, which the lone figure emphasizes as he goes about his duties, possibly handling the ropes visible on the deck. A solitary seabird can be seen in the distance, soaring above the vast ocean, adding a touch of serene wildlife to the human and mechanical bustle of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes human activity against the expanse of nature, encapsulated by the vast ocean and distant horizon. The photograph evokes feelings of solitude, diligence, and the interaction of man with the marine environment.","title":"Sludge being discharged at a bight dump site by the \"Owl's Head,\" one of four such ships owned by New York City. In 1973 there were 5.8 million cubic yards of sewage sludge dumped in the bight. The volume is expected to triple in the next few years. Dredge spoils are dumped six miles from shore, sludge 12 miles, waste acid 15 miles, and chemical wastes 106 miles.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547559","547554","549373","547456","547557","545179","551046","544234","554196","547564","549594","546317","545057","549380","547156","549601"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["deck","ocean","rope","boat","swath","bustle","bow","wake","foam","duty"]}
