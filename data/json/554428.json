{"path":"554428.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or rural setting inside a spacious building, possibly a sawmill or woodworking workshop. In the foreground, there's a long conveyor system lined with sharp, spike-like metallic teeth, which appear to be part of a mechanism for processing logs. Atop this conveyor is a large, roughly hewn cylindrical log, showcasing peeling bark and raw, exposed wood, indicating the initial stages of processing.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there stands a man observing the outside through an open doorway. He is silhouetted against the natural light, making his features indistinct yet emphasizing his outline. His posture and positioning suggest he might be taking a break or overseeing the outside activities from within the shelter of the building.\n\nBesides the man, thereâ€™s a large, robust piece of machinery which includes a vertical, circular saw or grinding wheel, and additional complex mechanical components, presumably related to the log processing. The interior walls of the building are plain and functional with visible structural beams and unfinished surfaces, typical of industrial or utility buildings designed primarily for function.\n\nThe light filtering in through the open doorway softly illuminates the interior, creating a contrast between the indoor equipment and the brighter, natural light of the outdoors, hinting at a rural setting beyond the confines of the building. The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a moment caught between tasks in a day of manual and mechanical labor.","title":"Logs are stripped of bark by chipper at the litchfield paper company mill near Tupper Lake","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554429","554430","557945","554431","554432","544026","546236","544007","558373","546036","543158","543997","554427","557388","556388","546757"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["log","processing","conveyor","doorway","saw","tooth","outside","building","confine","filtering"]}
