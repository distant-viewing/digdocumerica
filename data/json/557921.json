{"path":"557921.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a moment inside a vehicle inspection or maintenance facility, with a vintage aesthetic that suggests it was taken several decades ago. The image features four individuals and a car within an industrial setting.  \n\nThe main focal point of the image is a blue vintage Volkswagen Beetle, marked with a \"USA\" sticker and a license plate reading \"8288 AP\". There are three men and one woman in the image. Starting on the left, a younger man wearing glasses is holding what seems to be a long measuring stick, dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt tucked into dark pants with a red belt. He is looking slightly upward towards something outside the frame.\n\nNext, leaning against a desk or counter, there is a young man dressed similarly in a white shirt and dark pants. He appears engaged in conversation or observing someone outside the frame, with an attentive expression.\n\nIn the background, a woman can be seen. She appears slightly blurred compared to the others, and her expression or activity is less discernible. She wears a light-colored outfit, perhaps a blouse, and carries what looks like a purse or a bag.\n\nOn the far right, an older man stands near the Volkswagen Beetle. He is also dressed in a white shirt and darker pants, sporting a calm and observant expression while looking off to his left. \n\nThe setting includes industrial elements like large, paneled windows that allow for ample natural light, and the walls look to be made of dark, possibly metallic materials. The overall atmosphere is busy yet orderly, typical of a workplace focused on technical or mechanical tasks.","title":"Young woman watches an exhaust analyzer machine as her auto is being tested at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
