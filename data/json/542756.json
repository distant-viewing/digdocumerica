{"path":"542756.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph portrays two police officers examining some items while standing next to their patrol car. The officers, both wearing uniforms with badges and name tags affixed to their shirts, appear to be engaged in a focused examination or discussion. One officer, visible from the side, holds a small white paper or card in one hand, while pointing at an object that the other officer is holding. The second officer, whose features and face are more visible, is intently looking down at a small photograph or piece of paper he holds in his hands. Both officers are middle-aged Caucasian males.\n\nThe background of the image features a quiet, suburban street setting. A neatly trimmed lawn and a part of a driveway are visible, along with a part of a residential house, which is largely out of focus, indicating a shallow depth of field centralizing the focus on the officers and their activity. The patrol car, marked clearly with \"COUNTY\" and \"PATROL\" on the side, is white with contrasting black marking panels.\n\nThe overall scene captured suggests a moment of investigative work or discussion regarding details possibly captured in the photographs they are examining, often typical in police work concerning evidence review or case discussion.","title":"Air pollution control department officers comparing polaroid photos to identify violator before issuing citation","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["546654","546658","542757","546663","546637","546611","546661","546657","542758","546634","551941","547759","557872","546633","555447","547165"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","discussion","police","examine","paper","review","case","card","hold","regard"]}
