{"path":"553221.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a young boy seated on a cobblestone surface. He is dressed casually in a red tank top, blue jeans, and black converse shoes. The boy wears a black baseball cap, turned backwards, covering his short hair, as he attentively looks through a pair of binoculars, which he holds up to his eyes. Next to him on the ground is an open box of popcorn, suggesting he might be taking a break from a leisurely activity to observe something in the distance. The background is fairly uniform, focusing on the patterned cobblestones, which provides a simple, unobtrusive backdrop that centers attention on the child and his actions. The scene captures a moment of curiosity or investigation, characteristic of childhood.","title":"Pop and popcorn go down well at a Fourth of July concert in Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["546835","543871","553553","543744","549254","555915","553168","553170","551693","545953","551765","552940","553150","558191","553147","544372"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","cobblestone","investigation","binocular","childhood","baseball","curiosity","converse","shoe","box"]}
