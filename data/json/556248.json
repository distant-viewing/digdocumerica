{"path":"556248.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a solemn and formal scene within a courtroom. At the center of the image, a judge is seated behind a large, dark wooden bench that bears a nameplate with the inscription \"JAMES B. PARSONS.\" The judge, an elderly African-American man, is dressed in traditional black judicial robes and glasses, and he is peering down, partially obscured by the bench.\n\nAbove the judge, on the richly toned wood-paneled wall, hangs a large, circular seal of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The seal is prominently displayed and features an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch, surrounded by stars and other emblematic details.\n\nTo the left of the judge is an American flag, mounted on a pole with a golden eagle finial. The flag is partially visible and adds a patriotic element to the setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of authority and dignity, emphasized by the dark, subdued tones and the serious expression of the judge. The setting clearly conveys the gravity and importance of the judicial proceedings.","title":"Federal judge James B. Parsons in the federal building in Chicago.
