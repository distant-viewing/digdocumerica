{"path":"556890.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of railway maintenance or construction. In the foreground, a man wearing a bright orange hard hat, blue jeans, and a dark shirt is using a pitchfork to maneuver what appears to be ballast or dirt around the railway tracks. He is actively engaged in his work, bending over the tracks.\n\nBehind him is a large yellow backhoe with a man seated at the controls. The man, clad in a checkered shirt and jeans, is operating the machine, which is stopped with its digger arm positioned close to the ground, looking ready for action or currently paused.\n\nThe setting includes railway tracks which run parallel toward the background, bordered by grassy areas with some trees. A freight train car can be spotted in the back left of the image, indicating that this scene is indeed set along a railway. The setting suggests this work could be part of a larger construction or maintenance project focused on rail infrastructure.\n\nThe lighting is natural, suggesting the photograph was taken during the daytime, and there's a clear sky which can be seen at the top part of the image. The overall composition focuses on the interaction of man and heavy machinery in an outdoor, industrial setting.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew removes old railroad ties and will replace them to improve the roadbed.
