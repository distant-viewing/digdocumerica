{"path":"551882.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling city scene, prominently featuring an outdoor escalator that connects the street level to an underground area, likely a transit station indicated by a green sign with a white “S,” typical of signs used for S-Bahn or city train systems in German-speaking countries. The backdrop of the image is a lively urban street lined with classic European architecture, including buildings with detailed facades and rows of windows, some adorned with flowers.\n\nThe street is filled with numerous people engaged in various activities, suggesting a vibrant, dynamic urban environment, possibly during a shopping day or a busy weekday. The crowd is diverse, with people of different ages and styles of dress, from casual to more formal attire.\n\nOn the left side of the image, stairs run parallel to the moving escalator, where several people are seen ascending and descending. Two individuals on the escalator stand out due to their proximity and stance; one is possibly looking at something above the escalator, while the other seems to be descending calmly.\n\nThe foreground on the right shows the street level bustling with pedestrians and some visible street signs and lamp posts, enhancing the urban setting. The mood conveyed is one of everyday city life, with people moving about their routines in a densely populated area. The image captures a moment in time that reflects both the architecture and the liveliness typical of a city center in a European metropolis.","title":"Arrivals and departures at an underground station.
