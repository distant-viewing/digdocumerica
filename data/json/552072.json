{"path":"552072.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a junkyard scene full of broken and discarded vehicles, appearing under an overcast sky. The setting is dominated by a variety of damaged cars, particularly noticeable are a white car in the foreground and a red car positioned slightly behind it. Both cars show significant signs of wear and disrepair, with visible rust and damage. The red car's trunk is closed but shows dents and fading paint. Scattered around these cars are numerous car parts, including tires, rims, and other metallic debris contributing to a sense of clutter and abandonment.\n\nIn the background, an industrial-style bridge spans across a wide river, partially obscured by the junkyard's various objects. The bridgeâ€™s metal framework, consisting mostly of trusses, adds a geometric aspect to the otherwise chaotic scene in the foreground. The river underneath it and the slightly cloudy sky suggest a cool, possibly windy atmosphere. It appears to be a broad, flowing body of water that lends some natural elements to an otherwise heavily industrial image. \n\nOverall, the composition conveys themes of decay, abandonment, and the contrasting permanence of the distant bridge in relation to the transient junk scattered in the foreground. The scene is a stark portrayal of industrial waste and environmental impact juxtaposed against natural elements.","title":"AutoMobile junkyard on the north bank of the Kansas river between the 12th and 18th street bridges","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552073","542590","546249","545365","547597","545010","552999","555492","555849","555850","549307","546913","555853","551996","547587","542585"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","junkyard","bridge","damage","abandonment","relation","dent","rim","truss","clutter"]}
