{"path":"554168.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape alongside a coastline. In the foreground, a prominent sign reads \"PARKER RANCH RECREATIONAL BEACH PRIVATE KEEP OUT.\" The image gives the impression of exclusivity and privacy as suggested by the sign. Beyond the sign, the scene opens up to a serene beach setting with a rugged, rocky shoreline. Several trees, possibly indigenous to a coastal environment, are scattered around, some with wide-spreading branches, offering shade and contributing to the tranquility of the area.\n\nTo the right, the coastline extends into the distance, showing more of the rocky landscape and scattered vegetation. A few steps from the sign, the ground is mostly sandy and barren, indicating a dry climate or possibly the less fertile ground near saltwater bodies.\n\nOverall, the combination of the sign, natural beach elements, and mature trees create a scene that feels both inviting and restricted, capturing a tension between natural beauty and private property. The location feels remote and preserved, likely away from urban development.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543420","544263","545248","554119","543168","545109","548670","554060","543299","552434","554156","542984","543287","547973","543090","548604"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["beach","sign","coastline","restrict","privacy","tension","preserve","keep","property","combination"]}
