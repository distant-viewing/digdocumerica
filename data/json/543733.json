{"path":"543733.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial facility in a remote, hilly area. In the foreground, there is a terrain covered with sparsely vegetated hills. The central focus of the image is an industrial plant, characterized by multiple large buildings and several tall chimneys emitting white and dark smoke. The landscape around the plant appears barren with minimal vegetation, predominantly shrubs and small trees.\n\nThe industrial complex is possibly related to energy production or processing, evident from the smokestacks and the structured placement of large buildings. In the background and on some hillsides, dense forests can be seen, providing a stark contrast to the industrial activities taking place in the center of the image.\n\nThe skyline is clear, suggesting either an early morning or late evening setting, with the lighting casting long shadows and giving the smoke a prominent appearance against the natural setting. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a narrative of industrial impact on a natural landscape, highlighting the coexistence and possible tensions between industrial development and environmental preservation.","title":"Power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543011","548195","557374","546141","551026","551056","551060","543813","550672","544735","544777","550716","550998","554625","550329","551053"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["smoke","preservation","tension","placement","plant","coexistence","production","hillside","energy","chimney"]}
