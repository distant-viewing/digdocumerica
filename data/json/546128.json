{"path":"546128.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a street scene in front of a grocery store. It features prominently a large Coca-Cola sign with \"GROCERY\" written beneath it, signifying the store's main business. The scene is likely taken during the daytime given the clear blue sky and sunlight illuminating the scene.\n\nThe focus is on two men attending to a car parked in front of the store. The car, which has a muddy hood splattered with what appears to be mud, is possibly a sedan from the style of its hood and front grille. One man, wearing casual clothes including a white shirt and dark pants, is leaning on the car and seems to be chatting with the other man, who is partially inside the vehicle, facing outward.\n\nBehind the primary car, several other vehicles are parked along the roadside, including a striking red sports car, adding to the hustle-bustle feel of the area. The background of the image features other elements typical of a suburban area, like sparse trees, telephone poles, other roadside infrastructures, and distant, modest residential or commercial buildings. \n\nThe overall composition creates a snapshot of daily life, possibly in a small town, where locals gather, likely discussing daily affairs or automotive issues.","title":"Blood was splattered on car hood when a wild deer was tied to the roof.
