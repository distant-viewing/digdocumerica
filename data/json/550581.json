{"path":"550581.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image depicts an expansive aerial view of a river landscape during what appears to be dawn or dusk, due to the dim lighting and the moody ambiance. The photograph captures a sinuous river winding through a broad, flat valley. The river branches out into numerous tributaries, creating an intricate network of water channels that resemble the veins of a leaf. These channels vary in size and create patterns over the valley floor, which is light in color and contrasts with the surrounding darker terrain.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is dominated by forest-covered hills or mountains, which recede into the horizon under a cloudy sky. The sky itself is heavy with clouds, suggesting overcast weather, with some breaks allowing light to shine through, creating a dramatic and majestic atmosphere. The left side of the image is slightly shadowed, possible due to the angle of the sun, adding to the complexity and depth of the lighting in the scene.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the river and forest, there appear to be more mountains or rolling hills, and the overall topography of the area is rugged and natural. There are no visible man-made structures or signs of human activity; the focus is entirely on the untouched wilderness and the natural beauty of the landscape. The composition of the photo, with its panoramic view and the wandering river leading the eye through the scene, evokes a sense of tranquility and the grandeur of nature.","title":"View looks northeast from above the delta river toward its confluence with the tanana river and the pipeline crossing of the tanana.
