{"path":"556550.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a poignant moment between two individuals inside what appears to be a small shop or room cluttered with various products. A man, likely middle-aged, is seated in a wheelchair. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and looks slightly towards the side with a gentle, resigned expression. Behind him and embracing him from over his shoulders is a girl, possibly pre-teen, with blonde hair that falls over her face. She has a serious expression and appears to be affectionately leaning on the man, suggesting a close relationship, likely familial.\n\nThe background of the image is dark but features shelves stocked with a variety of items, including bottled beverages and possibly snacks, contributing to the impression that this scene might be set in a store. Visible brands and labeling give a casual, everyday feel to the surroundings. The lighting is subdued, with emphasis on the figures, adding to the intimate and serene atmosphere of the scene. The composition and the expressions captured suggest themes of support, care, and quiet strength within the seeming simplicity of daily life.","title":"Jack smith, 42, a disabled miner who lives in Rhodell, West Virginia, shown with one of his daughters, debra, in the tavern he now operates, he had worked in the mines one year when his legs were crushed in a roof cave-in, it took him 18 years to received workman's compensation, his wheelchair was bought for him by his friend, arnold miller, now president of the united mine workers smith is active in the union, and has manned picket lines in the past","placename":"West Virginia","location":"West Virginia","nn1":["552931","543906","556576","545478","553545","556607","558328","556581","552935","556559","543866","550090","558314","558186","543898","557359"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["wheelchair","strength","embrace","snack","intimate","beverage","relationship","shoulders","expression","shelf"]}
