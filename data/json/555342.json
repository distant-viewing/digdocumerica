{"path":"555342.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene focused on a residential swimming pool with a distinctive solar heating system. The pool is kidney-shaped and filled with water, although it appears somewhat neglected with visible debris floating on the surface. Surrounding the pool is a concrete pool deck and a partial fence composed of red and white panels, which appears to be under construction or repair, as suggested by the presence of a ladder and two men working on the fence.\n\nIn the foreground, a large, tilted solar panel system dominates the view. It's made up of multiple tubes likely containing water for heating by solar energy, covered by clear or translucent sheets that allow sunlight to penetrate while likely also providing insulation.\n\nThe backyard is bordered by a natural landscape, likely in a rural or suburban setting given the sparse vegetation and the visible hills in the distance. The scene is illuminated by bright, presumably natural light indicating a sunny day, which is suitable for solar heating. The overall setting conveys a practical application of renewable energy in a domestic environment, possibly during an era when such technology was relatively novel or experimental.","title":"Solar heating panels used to heat a swimming pool at a home outside of Tucson, Arizona.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555344","555343","555309","555292","557717","555327","555288","555341","557312","557426","557320","558143","548085","555349","555347","555891"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["heating","pool","panel","energy","system","application","fence","backyard","ladder","tube"]}
