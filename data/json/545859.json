{"path":"545859.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene featuring a silhouetted figure walking along a grassy ridge. The person appears to be a young male, wearing shorts and moving in a way that suggests a relaxed pace. The lighting suggests the time of day is either dawn or dusk, characterized by a soft glow and a gradient sky transitioning from a deeper orange at the bottom to a lighter, almost pastel, color at the top. The grass along the ridge is defined in outline form but detailed enough to identify individual blades against the sky. This simple composition emphasizes solitude, peace, and a connection with nature. The overall mood is contemplative and serene, aided by the lack of any distracting elements in the background.","title":"West beach","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["549642","545763","548230","557182","545195","553464","554674","555140","557519","552312","552899","558097","557146","549249","556587","546154"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ridge","silhouetted","pastel","pace","peace","identify","transitione","male","orange","define"]}
