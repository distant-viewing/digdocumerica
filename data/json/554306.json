{"path":"554306.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a crumpled and textured surface, which appears to be metallic. The dominant colors in the image are dark blues and rusty browns, indicating either the nature of the metal or effects of lighting and oxidation. The surface is heavily creased and folded, creating sharp angular forms and deep shadows that enhance the tactile quality of the image. The play of light and shadow across the uneven texture contributes to a sense of depth and three-dimensionality. The overall composition has an abstract quality, focusing on the patterns, textures, and colors rather than depicting any specific object or scene. The texture could resemble crushed or compressed metal, possibly scrap metal or a form of artistic metalwork.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["557626","554317","553582","544682","555177","550606","545597","543149","555072","554301","554319","555793","555345","544992","554346","554304"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["metalwork","metal","texture","crush","fold","scrap","quality","form","surface","shadow"]}
