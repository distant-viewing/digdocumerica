{"path":"551303.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a young woman riding a bicycle on what appears to be a paved road marked with yellow lines. The motion blur creates an impression of speed and movement, focused primarily on the cyclist, who seems joyous and energetic as she looks towards the camera with a smile. She is wearing a light blue short-sleeved shirt, black pants, and shoes, and is pedaling a road bicycle with a red frame and black handlebars.\n\nThe background is a blur of green and brown shades, suggesting a presence of trees or bushes, hinting at a suburban or rural setting. The overall composition uses a panning technique that sharply captures the subject in motion while the background streaks horizontally, emphasizing the speed of her movement. The color palette adds a vibrant yet soft tone, dominated by the verdant background, warm tones of the bicycle, and the cool blue of the rider's shirt.","title":"Keith pollack, ii, on route 5 near niangua bridge.
