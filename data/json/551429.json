{"path":"551429.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a mildly polluted water environment with a focus on urban run-off and environmental impact. In the foreground, there is a muddy riverbank with bits of debris scattered about, including two beverage cans lying amid twigs and a cluster of detritus. The water reflects a slightly murky quality indicative of pollution.\n\nIn the midground, the opposite bank of the river is visible, featuring grassy and eroded slopes. On the top of this embankment, centered in the image, a group of people can be seen gathered around a small red trailer, likely engaged in some form of outdoor or environmental activity. The presence of the trailer and the group suggests a possible community event or monitoring activity.\n\nIn the background, there are various elements including vegetation, utility poles, and parked cars which further imply human presence and activity in the area. There is also a building visible on the left side of the embankment, which could be a house or a small commercial structure, contributing to the semi-urban feel of the scene. This setting conveys a sense of place that is at the intersection of natural landscapes and human habitation, highlighting the environmental challenges and community involvement in such areas.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
