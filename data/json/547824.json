{"path":"547824.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a commercial airplane in mid-landing approach. The aircraft is a twin-engine jet exhibiting a prominent red and white livery. It is flying low and appears to be just moments away from touchdown as indicated by its landing gear being fully deployed. Behind and below the airplane are several complex structures associated with an airport; these include runway approach lights and other navigational aids, which are visible as arrays of red lights mounted on frameworks of metal beams.\n\nA striking feature is the pollution emitted by the airplane; a noticeable trail of dark smoke streams from the rear of the jet. This suggests it could be an older model, as newer jet engines typically produce cleaner exhaust.\n\nThe surrounding environment is not heavily detailed but includes glimpses of greenery, possibly trees, providing a natural contrast to the technical and mechanical aspects dominating the scene. The sky is a muted blue, subtly hinting at the photo possibly being taken during the early hours of the day or in slightly hazy conditions. The composition focuses squarely on the interaction between the technology of air travel and its immediate environment, capturing a moment in daily airport operations.","title":"Jet plane comes in for landing at love airfield","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["548447","547810","546178","542719","542720","544606","548448","548485","542717","554092","553731","548487","548469","548428","548484","548446"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["jet","airplane","airport","engine","approach","deploy","runway","landing","exhaust","aid"]}
