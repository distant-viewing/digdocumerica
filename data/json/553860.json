{"path":"553860.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic lakeside view under a cloudy sky. On the left, there is a leafless tree standing near the top of a grassy slope. The foreground features a sign positioned prominently on a wooden post, facing the viewer. The sign reads \"NO SWIMMING ALLOWED NO LIFE GUARD ON DUTY\" along with other faded text that specifies additional restrictions and warnings concerning water safety.\n\nBelow and beyond the sign, you can see a rocky shoreline leading to a body of water, possibly a lake, with small waves visible. The water stretches to the horizon, meeting the cloudy sky. The overall mood of the photo is somewhat somber or tranquil, enhanced by the overcast sky and the barren tree. The image combines elements of natural beauty with a hint of human-imposed restrictions, indicated by the warning sign.","title":"Lake Erie suburb. (From the Sites exhibition.
