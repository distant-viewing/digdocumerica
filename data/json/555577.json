{"path":"555577.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene featuring an array of rustic buildings and lush vegetation. In the foreground, wild grass and various green plants dominate the view, interspersed with pink wildflowers adding a touch of color to the verdure. Slightly to the left is an old wooden barn, which appears weathered and worn, surrounded by dense foliage that partially obscures its base.\n\nThe middle ground shows additional structures that contribute to the rural charm of the scene. A large white barn, with a steep roof and visible side planking, anchors the composition centrally. This barn has a small extension connected to its left side. Next to this, there is a cluster of dilapidated structures with corrugated metal roofs that seem to merge into one another, indicating a possible state of disuse or abandonment.\n\nTo the right stands a small, dark wooden shed raised off the ground on posts, adding to the variety of architectural styles and materials visible. It has an open front, hinting at its probable use for storage or as a shelter for animals.\n\nIn the background, the scene is bordered by a line of tall trees that provide a sense of depth. Behind the vegetation, a hill rises gently, and atop it, faintly visible in the distance, is a farm complex with a traditional silo, further emphasizing the agricultural nature of the setting.\n\nThe image projects a serene, timeless atmosphere, typical of a rural landscape where nature and human-made elements coexist quietly yet evocatively. The color palette is a soothing mix of greens, browns, and grays, punctuated by the white of the barn and the fading blue of the sky. Overall, the photograph portrays a tranquil snapshot of country life, seemingly untouched by modern hustle and bustle.","title":"Abandoned farmhouse and buildings off route #800","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["556963","557946","547309","555571","554767","555635","554819","551333","551305","552462","554800","549256","552537","550019","557674","554782"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","corrugated","extension","roofs","atop","country","bustle","disuse","wildflowers","hustle"]}
