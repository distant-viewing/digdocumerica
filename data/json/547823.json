{"path":"547823.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a busy freeway scene, likely taken during the daytime given the bright lighting and shadows prominent in the image. The view is from an elevated perspective, possibly from a bridge or another highway, showcasing multiple lanes of traffic heading in both directions. The road curves gently to the right, with vehicles including cars, trucks, and larger transport trucks populating the lanes.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the highway on-ramp merges with the main lanes, where several vehicles are seen entering the freeway. The traffic appears moderately heavy but flowing smoothly without any visible congestion.\n\nThe setting is urban, as suggested by structures and built-up areas visible in the distant background. Overhead, scattered clouds fill the sky, contributing to the varying light intensities on the roadway and surroundings. A series of lampposts aligns the freeway, likely illuminating the road at night. The guardrails along the sides of the highway ensure safety by preventing vehicles from veering off the road. The overall composition of the photograph reflects a common, dynamic urban highway environment.","title":"L.B.J Freeway","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["549890","547785","556194","547811","549902","553720","546686","545451","546612","557471","553727","555437","542764","546571","546747","556785"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["freeway","highway","lane","traffic","road","lamppost","truck","vehicle","ramp","guardrail"]}
