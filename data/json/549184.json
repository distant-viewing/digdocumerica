{"path":"549184.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural landscape featuring a series of barren, undulating hills under a cloudy sky. The hills are characterized by their steep, smooth slopes which appear to be composed of sediment or eroded rock material, showing various shades of beige, gray, and white. These color variations might suggest different mineral compositions or the effects of weathering. Sparse vegetation can be observed on the crests of some hills, indicating a semi-arid environment.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes a small section of a flat grassy area, suggesting a valley or basin adjacent to the hills. This grass is interspersed with small bushes or shrubs. Above, the sky is partially cloudy with some blue areas visible, suggesting variability in the weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of geological processes at work, highlighting erosion and sedimentation features typical of a dry or semi-arid climate zone. The absence of human activity and lush vegetation emphasizes the barren and isolated nature of the terrain.","title":"These strip-mining spoil piles are about 20 years old.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["545895","552423","549179","549183","555616","549136","546385","543635","545899","555642","555573","549132","551233","544016","549133","542518"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","variability","crest","basin","erode","mineral","undulate","sediment","variation","weather"]}
