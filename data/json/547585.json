{"path":"547585.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat industrial waterfront scene. The foreground is dominated by numerous weathered and worn wooden pilings sticking out of calm, dark waters. These pillars show varying degrees of decay and wear, which suggest their long-standing exposure to the elements. Many of the pilings are reflected in the water, creating a mirrored image that adds depth and intrigue to the scene.\n\nThe background features an industrial landscape across the expanse of water. Visible are various structures that could be part of a shipyard or industrial docks. There is a large ship partially visible on the left side of the image, hinting at maritime activities. The backdrop also includes several buildings and cranes, further emphasizing the industrial theme.\n\nThe sky is clear, adding a sense of openness and light to the composition, which contrasts with the darker tones of the water and the wooden pilings. The overall mood is one of quiet stillness, with a hint of the activity suggested by the presence of industrial elements in the distance.","title":"Waterfront ships and tanks","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547577","547019","549305","547572","549300","552240","547581","545005","551954","547582","547575","546864","555731","547594","548105","547622"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["piling","shipyard","pillar","degree","intrigue","openness","stick","waterfro","water","stillness"]}
