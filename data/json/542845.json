{"path":"542845.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph shows a dense forest dominated by tall, majestic redwood trees. The trees have thick, deeply grooved bark and their massive trunks stand prominently in the foreground, demonstrating the scale and grandeur of an old-growth redwood forest. The understory is lush with various shades of green; smaller trees, ferns, and other forest-floor vegetation create a layered texture.\n\nLight filters through the canopy, highlighting patches of the forest floor and providing a contrast between the shadowed areas and the illuminated leaves and branches. The background is slightly blurred due to the focus on the large trees in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and immensity. There appears to be a slight mist or moisture in the air, typical of a redwood forest environment, which adds a soft, ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nThe overall setting is serene and untouched, evoking a sense of tranquility and the ancient presence of these towering trees. It's a snapshot that emphasizes the natural beauty and calm of a wild, primeval forest, likely intended to capture the awe-inspiring impact of walking among these giants.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554969","554968","542922","543447","554966","542745","542750","555051","542748","542569","543449","554990","543442","542575","554970","542752"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["redwood","forest","floor","groove","tree","awe","fern","intend","demonstrate","moisture"]}
