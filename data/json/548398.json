{"path":"548398.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene featuring two men and machinery in an urban setting. To the left, there's an older man with grey hair, wearing a light brown jacket, trousers of a similar color, and he is standing beside a complex, large machine labeled \"600 ROTA-SIEVE.\" This machine shows signs of industrial use with visible grime and stickers, including one that features a Texas state outline with a star.\n\nTo the right, a younger man with curly hair is walking past. He is dressed in a light-colored (white or cream) jacket and trousers, and he appears to be carrying a cup in his hand as he briskly moves forward, seeming to be in motion as indicated by the blurring of his figure.\n\nIn the background, there are additional elements of an urban work site, such as barricades painted in black and white stripes, other pieces of machinery, and what appears to be the rear of a vehicle. The overall setting suggests an area under either construction or maintenance. The environment is somewhat gritty and industrial, characterized by machinery and lack of any visible natural elements.","title":"Men passing construction generator in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546036","556866","549268","544822","558371","558373","549867","543795","549684","558379","556861","556903","544007","556875","553827","558380"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["machinery","machine","trouser","barricade","grime","sticker","jacket","past","hair","star"]}
