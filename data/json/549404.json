{"path":"549404.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene of a sailboat in action on what appears to be a moderately windy day. The sailboat, with hull number \"1234 MS1I,\" is captured leaning heavily to its starboard side, indicative of a strong wind hitting its large white sail from the port side. The boat is clearly in motion, as evidenced by the white frothy waves breaking against its hull and the splash generated around the base.\n\nThe vessel seems well-crewed, with several individuals visible on deck, bracing themselves against the tilt and working to control the boat in these challenging conditions. Due to the boat's angle and the spray, details on the crew members' appearances are indistinct, but they appear to be actively engaged in sailing tasks.\n\nThe background features a hazy blue sky meeting the darker blue of the sea on the horizon. Other sailboats can be glimpsed at a distance, speckled across the seascape, likely participating in a sailing race or rally given their number and spread.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph conveys a sense of adventure and the thrill of competitive sailing. The tilt of the boat and the active stance of the crew emphasize the sport's physical demands and the excitement of sailing under such vivid conditions.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay in the early hours of the race.
