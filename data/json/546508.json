{"path":"546508.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents a striking composition involving modern architecture and artwork beneath a clear blue sky. At the forefront of the image, there is a large, dark sculpture with an arch-like form that partially frames the scene. This sculpture, which has a glossy surface, appears to show a part of an arching bronze leg, possibly from a monumental statue.\n\nIn the background, the central focus is a tall, slender square tower that features a clock near its top. The clock face is visible, showing a time, although the specific hour and minute are indistinct. This tower has a minimalist design, with a plain, flat façade.\n\nTo the left of the tower, there is a modernist building with a grid layout prominently displayed on its façade. The building’s exterior consists mostly of what appears to be glass, divided into square panels that reflect the light, creating a patterned effect.\n\nThe overall arrangement of the photograph—the sculpture in the foreground enveloping the background elements—coupled with the interplay of architectural and sculptural lines against the clear sky, creates a dynamic and aesthetically balanced image. The presence of the clock introduces a sense of time, while the large sculptural element adds a tactile, almost intimate contrast to the distant, impersonal buildings.","title":"Henry Moore's \"Large Arch,\" which was installed near Rogers Library in 1971.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["553278","546512","546490","549317","546557","551662","546499","548649","546506","551455","553769","546539","553295","550062","546415","544012"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sculpture","clock","tower","façade","minute","bronze","artwork","statue","time","hour"]}
