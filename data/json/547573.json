{"path":"547573.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image depicts a bleak, expansive landscape with numerous light fixtures positioned at regular intervals across a flat, parched surface that appears to be a drained lake bed or a similar vast dry area. The foreground shows two prominently displayed light fixtures on metal posts, one of which is notably taller than the other and is covered with a protective cage. Beyond these, a seemingly endless array of similar posts stretches far into the distance, creating a repetitive pattern that vanishes near the horizon.\n\nThe surface of the ground is uneven and shows signs of desiccation, such as cracks and patches of different textures and colors, indicative of dry, hardened mud. The horizon is flat with no visible vegetation or structures, just the light fixtures dominating the view.\n\nThe sky above is mostly cloudy but with patches of blue, hinting at a broad daylight setting. The overall mood is desolate and somewhat eerie, emphasized by the uniform layout of the man-made objects within a natural, yet stark environment.","title":"Drive-in movie at Fields Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["558107","555397","555783","546208","547653","545827","544733","549118","548136","545341","543728","545879","555333","544405","553866","553028"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["fixture","post","cage","interval","crack","mud","bed","horizon","patch","layout"]}
