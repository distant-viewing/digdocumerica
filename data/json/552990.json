{"path":"552990.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a silhouette of an industrial maritime scene, predominantly captured during either early morning or late afternoon, judging by the lighting. The central subjects are several tall oil drilling rigs or derrick structures, characterized by their towering, triangular, metal lattice frameworks. Each rig has a prominent central tower that is equipped with various horizontal beams and smaller vertical elements, likely for operational and structural purposes.\n\nThese rigs are stationed over a large body of water that glistens with the reflected light from the sky, suggesting that the sun is at a low angle. In front of these main structures, there are additional unspecified industrial components, possibly related to oil extraction or processing. Some fragmentary remnants of old piers or docking facilities are visible in the foreground, presented as a series of broken, vertical wooden posts protruding from the water.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is somewhat stark and desolate, emphasizing the industrial intrusion into the natural environment. The sky, while not detailed in the image, contributes to a moody backdrop, providing a gradient that fades from a darker hue at the top to a lighter one near the horizon line. The silhouette and the reflective nature of the water emphasize the contrast between nature and human-engineered structures.","title":"Abandoned oil field 15 miles south of Houston.
