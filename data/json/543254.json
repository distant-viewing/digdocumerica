{"path":"543254.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a beach scene viewed from an elevated perspective, looking down onto the sandy shore. The beach stretches wide across the image, bordered by the rough waters of the ocean in the background. Large, frothy waves are crashing towards the shore, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting.\n\nThe sand is largely unmarked near the water but shows numerous footprints further up, indicating frequent visitor activity. On the beach, several people can be seen engaging in various activities. Some are walking, while others are seated or lying on the sand, enjoying the seaside atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground of the image is framed by natural vegetation, with a sandy pathway cutting through it, leading down to the beach. The plants include various types of low-lying shrubs and flowers, adding splashes of green, red, and purple to the scene, which contrasts beautifully with the sandy beige of the beach.\n\nThis layout of the environment and the leisure activities of the people suggest a relaxed and scenic beach setting, likely a popular spot for visitors looking to enjoy a day by the sea.","title":"California--garrapata beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"Garrapata State Park, California","nn1":["543089","546982","553766","545162","543072","555402","557507","553952","553683","550919","557458","543193","545097","543303","557480","547612"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","visitor","sand","lie","shore","enjoy","footprint","crash","beige","purple"]}
