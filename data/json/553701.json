{"path":"553701.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a densely built area showing various stages of construction and development along with evident signs of a natural disaster, possibly a flood or storm. Numerous buildings appear to be damaged or under construction, with some roofs entirely missing and others half-completed. The layout is semi-urban with residential and perhaps few small commercial or industrial structures. Roads carve through the area, some wet, reflecting the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nDebris is scattered across many properties and streets. Several construction machines and materials are visible in various sites, indicating ongoing repairs or rebuilding efforts. The periphery of the view shows additional residential or commercial buildings that seem less affected.\n\nIn the background, the environment transitions into a less densely populated area with more natural terrain and vegetated landscapes. The extreme rear shows a large body of water, and the sky above casts a slightly reddish tint over the scene, suggesting the photo might have been taken at sunrise or sunset, or displaying the effects of weather conditions. Overall, the image captures the resilience of a community in the process of recovery and rebuilding.","title":"\"New town\" grows where pineapples used to thrive.
