{"path":"551434.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban outdoor setting, possibly a public plaza or pedestrian zone. The main focal point is a young man seated on the ground, leaning against a large round planter. He is absorbed in reading a book and appears to be oblivious to his surroundings. He wears glasses, a short-sleeved dark polo shirt, jeans, and sneakers. His curly hair suggests an afro hairstyle, emphasizing his casual, intellectual look.\n\nAround him, several large planters filled with bright red flowers enhance the aesthetic of the area. The background features other individuals engaged in various activities. There is a group of people walking, including a younger woman with long light-brown hair dressed in white and black, accompanied by another woman and a man in a suit and sunglasses. An elderly woman dressed in a light cardigan is also present, contributing to the diversity of the crowd in terms of age and appearance.\n\nThe setting is a sunny day, as indicated by the bright illumination and shadows cast on the ground. This, along with the behavior of the people, suggests a lively, busy environment typical of a city center during daytime. Overall, the photograph combines elements of urban life, leisure, and the contrast between solitary activity and bustling city movement.","title":"The large flower pots on nicollet mall beautify the urban environment","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551481","553222","553218","551829","551793","551823","551815","553158","551705","551798","551472","550751","553187","550302","551646","551477"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["planter","woman","behavior","polo","cardigan","sneaker","absorb","plaza","hair","city"]}
