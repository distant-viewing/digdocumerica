{"path":"548074.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image presents a highly creative silhouette scene that blends natural and potentially artificial elements. The central visual is a striking image of a sharkâ€™s silhouette, positioned horizontally across the mid-section of the composition, surrounded by what appears to be waved lines that may suggest water or wind patterns. Adding to the intriguing nature of this photograph, the left side of the image features the vague silhouette of a person's profile, showing the outline of a nose, lips, and chin, contributing a mysterious, almost hidden human element.\n\nThe background colors gradient from a dark blue at the top, fading into a lighter blue toward the bottom, which enhances the moody and underwater-like ambiance of the scene. The overall composition is quite abstract and evocative, engaging the viewer in a surreal interplay between the human silhouette and the shark, set against a dynamic and textured backdrop that suggests movement and fluidity. The use of lighting appears intentional to solely outline the silhouettes, creating a sharp contrast with the background and emphasizing the shapes within the frame.","title":"Fish-counting station with public viewing windows under construction at bonneville dam.
