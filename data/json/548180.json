{"path":"548180.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of juxtaposition between construction debris in the foreground and an architectural structure on a lake in the background. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of broken concrete pieces, some cinder blocks, and miscellaneous construction waste. The broken materials form a rough, uneven surface suggesting recent demolition or ongoing construction work in the area.\n\nTowards the center and stretching into the background is a large lake. A complex, modern building on stilts stands prominently in the water, slightly to the right of the image. This building is multi-tiered, with visible wooden beams and large glass windows, indicating a design that combines elements of openness with structural robustness.\n\nTo one side in the water, a small boat is moored, which emphasizes the functionality and accessibility of the building by water. A dock extends towards the building, suggesting that the building is used either for residential or commercial purposes, tailored possibly for activities involving the lake.\n\nThere are subtle hints of nature blending with human activity here, as trees faintly appear in the far background under a cloudy sky, indicating that this location is possibly on the edge of a developed area near a natural setting.","title":"Part of motel complex under construction on the north shore of Coeur d'Alene Lake.
