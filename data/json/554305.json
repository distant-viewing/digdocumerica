{"path":"554305.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a large array of crushed and twisted metal parts, which appear to be the remains of one or more vehicles after a severe accident or possibly after having gone through a metal compactor. The metal has a glossy quality at parts where light reflects off its uneven surface. The dominant colors in the image are shades of dark brown accented with patches of shiny silver and rust. Various parts, identifiable as components of a vehicle, such as parts of the car frame, sections of doors, fragments of the car's exterior shell, and possibly some mechanical elements, are jumbled together in a dense pile. The background is barely visible but seems to consist of similar fragments and debris, further emphasizing the chaotic nature of the scene. The image communicates a sense of destruction and the harsh results of mechanical forces.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554303","554355","554295","547476","554317","554302","554311","554321","552738","553863","551517","554301","554319","554352","554357","553005"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["fragment","compactor","metal","accident","part","remain","result","shell","destruction","silver"]}
