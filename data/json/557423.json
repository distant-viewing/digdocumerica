{"path":"557423.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant coastal scene with several elements contributing to a lively and picturesque setting.\n\nIn the foreground, three children are involved in playful exploration on a series of large, uneven rocks along the waterfront. The children are all focused on maneuvering the rocky terrain: One child to the left is bending down, possibly picking something up or examining the rock; the middle child seems to be cautiously stepping forward, balancing carefully; and the child to the right is in motion, stepping downward toward a lower rock. They are dressed casually in shorts and T-shirts, suggesting a relaxed, summery day.\n\nThe background offers a scenic view of a calm sea dotted with several boats. Prominently, there are two sailboats with sails fully unfurled, gliding gracefully over the water, adding a sense of leisure and elegance to the seascape. The shoreline is crowded with a variety of buildings, including a large white multi-story hotel or apartment complex that dominates the mid-ground view. Smaller residential or commercial structures, characterized by their varied architecture and foliage, line up behind and around this large building.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is one of serene coastal life, where recreational activities like sailing and exploring the rocks by the water seem to symbolize a typical day at this picturesque location. The combination of childhood play, leisure boating, and lush, populated coastlines provides a diverse snapshot of daily life in this coastal community.","title":"Shoreline at Newport Beach is heavily used. Upper Newport Bay, north of this area, is scheduled for intensive development, including construction of a yacht harbor. Development within 1,000 yards of the coastal line has been regulated by state and regional commissions since early 1973. The commissions must present a final report to the state legislature by January 1976, with recommendations for laws which will affect development along the coast throughout the state.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["546378","552341","543310","544302","543402","547004","553765","552000","543492","543329","548733","543485","546955","543389","554102","549329"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","rock","sail","step","unfurl","leisure","glide","elegance","hotel","pick"]}
