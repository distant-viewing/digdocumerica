{"path":"542879.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene featuring a fishing boat prominently in the foreground. The boat, named \"SEA RAIDER,\" is painted white, and its hull clearly shows the name along with a home port of Blaine. It is equipped with various masts and booms, likely used for fishing activities. The boat appears sturdy and functional, with several visible deck details such as antennas, lights, and possibly fishing gear.\n\nThe background showcases a body of tranquil blue water, suggesting a calm day, favorable for boating or fishing. Beyond the water, there is a shoreline where a wooden dock or pier can be seen, running partly along the coast. Behind the pier, the bank rises steeply, covered with lush greenery which includes several trees and underbrush, providing a natural and somewhat secluded environment.\n\nPerched above the steep bank, residential structures are visible, painted in lighter colors, contributing to the serene and picturesque setting typical of a coastal community. The scene is bathed in a gentle sunlight that enhances the colors and adds a peaceful, almost idyllic quality to the view. This photograph likely encapsulates a day of maritime activity, emphasizing the relationship between the boat and its natural surroundings.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542873","546939","552296","548546","545058","545120","547553","549374","555719","555694","545158","548733","548763","547549","549380","547953"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","pier","bank","name","antenna","relationship","boom","boating","coast"]}
