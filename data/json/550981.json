{"path":"550981.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a complex industrial landscape dominated by large plumes of smoke rising into the sky. The scene possibly illustrates the environmental impact of industrial activity. The image features multiple smokestacks emitting thick, dark smoke which billows upwards and blankets the sky, partially obscuring the blue atmosphere above. The industrial structures below include various buildings and towers, characterized by their sturdy, utilitarian construction typical of factories or processing plants.\n\nIn the foreground, an array of electrical lines and poles crisscross, adding another layer of complexity to the composition and serving as a stark reminder of human influence in this scene. These electric poles and wires frame the industrial background, further emphasizing humanity's impact on the environment.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat bleak due to the heavy pollution visible, with muted color tones mostly in shades of blue and grey, hinting at either early morning light or a dust- and smoke-filled environment. The industrial facilities sprawl across the image, suggesting a large-scale industrial operation. The absence of visible natural elements or people focuses the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the environmental cost of industrial activities.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV.","placename":"Charleston (W.
