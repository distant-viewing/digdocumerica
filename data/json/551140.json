{"path":"551140.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents an industrial landscape at dusk, capturing a somewhat hazy and moody atmosphere. The setting includes several prominent smokestacks that emit plumes of smoke, contributing to a silhouetted skyline against a soft, purple and mauve sky. The terrain is hilly, indicating that the industrial complex is located in a valley or a similarly contoured geographical area. \n\nIn the foreground, darkened outlines of trees and leaves frame the image, providing a natural border and a stark contrast to the man-made industrial elements. This juxtaposition subtly highlights the impact of industrialization on natural environments. \n\nNotable in the composition are the elements of infrastructure visible among the industrial buildings, including tanks, buildings of various heights, and possibly some large pipes or conduits. There's also a spherical structure that resembles a water tower, which is a typical feature in many industrial zones. Additionally, there's a glimpse of a river that reflects some of the lights and colors of the sky, adding depth and a sense of scale to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is somber and reflective, enhanced by the twilight setting and the obscured details caused by the distance and haze.","title":"Industrial Charleston in heavy haze","placename":"Charleston (W.
