{"path":"548825.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a residential area characterized by its distinct suburban layout. The housing development features closely packed, single-story homes with similar roofing and structure, suggesting a planned unit development typical of many suburban expansions. \n\nThe photo shows several loops and curving roads, creating a somewhat maze-like neighborhood pattern, a characteristic designed to reduce through traffic and foster a sense of community. These roads are paved and surrounded by sidewalks on either side. Each house typically features a driveway and a front yard, and few have small backyard spaces visible.\n\nThe broader setting reveals a stark contrast between the developed area and the surrounding landscape, which appears arid and sparsely vegetated, indicative of a desert-like environment. The background stretches into a flat expanse with what looks like a dry, undeveloped terrain and distant mountains, underlining the isolation of this developed pocket within a vast, open space.\n\nThe composition of the photograph highlights the isolation and distinctiveness of suburban development within a relatively inhospitable geographical area, perhaps to emphasize the extent and impact of human settlement patterns. The color tones in the image, rich in browns and beige, echo the desert environment, reinforcing the visual impact of an oasis-like human settlement in a predominantly barren region.","title":"Housing--lake havasu city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["553700","553934","546399","544510","549071","548824","544604","553699","547435","557455","553937","553939","553692","545914","547769","544600"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["settlement","development","develop","desert","oasis","foster","echo","reduce","isolation","backyard"]}
