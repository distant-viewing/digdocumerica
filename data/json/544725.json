{"path":"544725.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a natural landscape featuring a reflective water surface under a low light condition, possibly during twilight or after sunset. The main focus is on the shimmering water, which reflects light in various sparkling patterns, enhancing the visual texture. Salt or mineral deposits appear scattered throughout the scene, creating patches of white and grey that contrast with the darker tones of the water.\n\nThe water body is not perfectly clear; it is muddled, which allows for the light to scatter in intricate patterns across its surface. The horizon is visible in the distance, yet it is subdued and blends into a dusky sky, hinting at a flat, open environment such as a salt flat or a coastal plain.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or people in the frame; the photograph solely emphasizes the natural elements and the interplay of light on water, inviting a serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance. The overall composition relies on the natural contrast between the dark water and bright light reflections, creating a dynamic yet tranquil visual experience.","title":"Leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552237","553180","544679","550389","554076","544683","544253","549060","545923","554608","543126","557255","552294","548978","544711","547047"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["rely","water","flat","salt","deposit","sparkling","plain","light","shimmering","patterns"]}
