{"path":"545976.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this photograph, an elderly couple poses in a room with vivid aquamarine walls. The man is seated on the edge of a brown-tinted bedspread on a bed, with his hands placed on his lap. He has short grey hair, prominent facial lines, and wears a dark, long-sleeve shirt and slacks. He looks directly at the camera with a gentle, subdued expression.\n\nThe woman stands to his right with one hand on his shoulder, exuding a warm, kind smile. She has short, light-colored hair styled in a wave pattern, and wears a knit pink-and-white striped tank top and bright red slacks. \n\nThe room is simply adorned; behind the couple, the sunlit window is thinly veiled by a translucent curtain. The wall features a small, framed landscape painting and several framed photographs or small artworks. This background, together with the couple's attire and the homey setting, conveys a sense of everyday domestic life, filled with warmth and familiarity.","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Tillman Matherne, lifelong residents of Bayou Gauche, in their home.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["545981","558314","547421","547401","553849","554192","545479","551337","557149","548614","553029","553202","544232","557702","543469","548454"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["couple","slack","room","familiarity","artwork","painting","wall","lap","hair","curtain"]}
