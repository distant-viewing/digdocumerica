{"path":"549844.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an overhead view of two sanitation workers engaging in their daily duties of collecting trash. The main focus is on a large white garbage truck with visible identification numbers (\"252-395\") and a license plate somewhat obscured but ending in \"3098\". The back of the truck is open, revealing its packed contents mostly consisting of black trash bags and a few cardboard boxes.\n\nThe workers, both sporting grey uniforms, are caught in the process of lifting heavy black bags into the back of the vehicle. One man in the foreground to the left is lifting a bag, gripping it tightly as it hangs just off the ground. The other worker is on the opposite side of the truck, having just thrown a trash bag into it, his posture leaning towards the vehicle suggesting the motion. His back faces the viewer.\n\nThe scene unfolds on an asphalt surface, likely in an alley or a less-trafficked street given the industrial vibe of the surroundings, with oil stains visible on the pavement. A parked car with a shiny metallic finish sits adjacent to the scene, further establishing the urban environment. The composition provides a candid snapshot of everyday urban life and work, vividly illustrating the essential yet often overlooked labor of sanitation workers.","title":"Sanitation workers collect garbage on 172nd Street in Manhattan.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550150","550154","549842","550158","550147","550162","549837","549945","547975","550159","550163","549765","549949","549751","549940","544091"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bag","sanitation","worker","trash","truck","lift","back","identification","alley","grip"]}
