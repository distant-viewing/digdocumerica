{"path":"554921.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an intimate, serene moment set in a naturally lit woodland environment. Two people sit closely together on a rugged, moss-covered ground, which seems to be on a forest hillside given the slightly slanted terrain. The person on the left, who appears to be an older adult, is wearing a rich burgundy and festive-patterned cap along with a dark-toned vest over a patterned shirt. This person is embracing a child sitting on their lap. The child is in a bright red coat with intricate designs that suggest a traditional or cultural garment. The adult's gesture is tender, holding a bread slice or some sort of simple food that they are either offering to the child or holding while the child eats.\n\nTheir peaceful posture and the natural setting, bathed in sunlight filtering through a canopy of thin, bare branches and scattered foliage, give the scene a tranquil and timeless quality. The background hints at a dense forest; leaf-litter and several small bushes and young trees indicate itâ€™s likely autumn or early spring. There is nothing modern in the immediate vicinity that would tie the scene to a specific time period, adding a sense of universality and quiet to the moment captured. The overall mood is one of calmness and closeness with nature, emphasizing a theme of nurturing and care within a simple setting.","title":"Hunter and daughter before sunset waiting for a deer.
