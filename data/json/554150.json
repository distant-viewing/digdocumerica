{"path":"554150.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an array of intricate wooden tiki statues, each depicting various traditional faces and designs. Set against a lush backdrop of dense, green palm trees, the sculptures stand in the foreground, appearing as vivid cultural artifacts.\n\nThe tiki statues are tall and primarily a weathered gray color, showcasing deep carvings that form the distinct facial features and decorative patterns. Each statue has unique elements, though they share common motifs such as large expressive eyes, wide mouths often featuring teeth, and exaggerated facial expressions which may represent different deities or spirits from Oceanic mythology.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the tikis displays a rich attention to detail, with each curve and notch intended to highlight certain facial and anatomical details. Their imposing presence is highlighted by their sequential alignment which gives a sense of unity and rhythm to the group.\n\nThe background consists almost entirely of tall palm trees that provide a natural and somewhat tropical setting, complementing the aesthetic of the statues. The foliage offers a vibrant contrast of light and shade across the scene, enhancing the textured and rustic appearance of the wood against the more uniform patterns of the palm leaves. No people are visible in the image, which allows for a clear focus on the art and cultural significance of the statues.","title":"Ancient statues in City of Refuge National Historical Park near Honaunau on the western side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554153","554151","554152","549533","555368","546387","546947","547832","554967","554120","544332","555050","545288","543447","545278","549226"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["statue","palm","unity","tooth","carving","rhythm","spirit","alignment","artifact","craftsmanship"]}
