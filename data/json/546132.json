{"path":"546132.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts two men involved in the process of securing a deer to the roof of a car. The setting is outdoors during the day. Behind the two men, there is a small building with a sign that reads \"DEER STORAGE.\" This suggests that the location is related to hunting activities, possibly a facility where hunted deer are stored or processed.\n\nThe deer is covered with a pale fabric, leaving only its head and antlers exposed. The man closest to the camera, who appears focused and engaged, is tying a rope around the antlers, which are small and have several tines. He has short dark hair, a muscular build, and wears a blue short-sleeve shirt along with a watch on his left wrist.\n\nThe other man is partially obscured by his companion and the deer. He is visible in the background, also focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe car is an older model, evident from the design of the windshield and roof. The background features lush green trees under a clear blue sky, enhancing the outdoor, rural setting of the image. The overall scene is quite vivid in color, with natural sunlight casting shadows and highlighting details of the activity. This photograph captures a moment typical in hunting cultures where game is transported for storage or processing after a hunt.","title":"The first deer killed in the hunting season arrives at deer storage","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["554675","552587","554934","546094","552585","554676","552588","546093","552586","545980","546133","554925","546137","543786","554619","554681"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["deer","hunt","antler","process","hunting","companion","wrist","man","closest","windshield"]}
