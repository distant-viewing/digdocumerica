He has a tall afro hairstyle and a calm expression. He is dressed in a white shirt under a dark coat.\n\nThe second man from the left, who is in the foreground and slightly lower than the others, wears a stylish red beret tilted to one side. He gives a somewhat sceptical look with pursed lips, enhancing his prominent presence in the photo. His clothing consists of a black leather jacket over a dark shirt.\n\nThe third individual is partially obscured by the second man. His gaze is directed straight at the camera, indicative of a fearless demeanor. He is wearing a light-colored patterned shirt.\n\nThe man on the far right has a beard and an intense expression. He is dressed in a patterned shirt with paisley-like details in earth tones. His black hair and beard are well-groomed.\n\nIn the background, there is a weathered wall with fading paint, adding a gritty, urban texture to the scene. The lighting focuses on their faces, emphasizing their expressions and the textures of their clothing. The setting and attire suggest a scene from the 1970s or 1980s, reflecting a cultural moment with its own distinct fashion and attitude.","title":"Street gang members","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552753","551301","557145","552973","553172","553148","554938","555899","551459","554852","557907","545358","552873","552744","554872","556153"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["beard","expression","man","shirt","lip","clothing","leather","hairstyle","camera","gaze"]}
