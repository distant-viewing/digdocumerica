{"path":"544851.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a striking outdoor scene, primarily focused on a very large, vividly orange fabric, possibly a parachute or a hot air balloon envelope, which dominates the frame. The fabric is billowing and translucent, with sunlight filtering through it, creating a warm, glowing effect. The ribs and seams of the fabric add a textured appearance, emphasizing its size and curvature.\n\nBeneath the expansive fabric, several people are present. They appear to be engaged in controlling or setting up the fabric, likely in a process of inflating or preparing a hot air balloon for flight. The people wear casual outdoor clothes and helmets, suggesting safety precautions typical of aviation-related activities. \n\nThe background setting is an open outdoor area with rough, uneven terrain covered with patches of grass and small scrubby bushes, indicating a rural or wilderness area. The clear blue sky in the background suggests a calm, sunny day ideal for ballooning or outdoor activities. This location appears remote and naturally scenic, providing a practical and picturesque setting for balloon operations. The large scale of the fabric in comparison to the people and the natural surroundings emphasizes the grandeur and excitement associated with ballooning.","title":"The hanging at Rifle gap.
