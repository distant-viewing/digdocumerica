{"path":"546658.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving multiple police officers and a civilian on a city street. On the left side of the image, two police officers, one caucasian and the other african american, are escorting a handcuffed middle-aged Caucasian man toward a parked police car. The police car, painted in white and blue, features a door shield emblem indicating it is a police vehicle.\n\nThe officers are in uniform; the Caucasian officer is slightly ahead, leading the detained man, who is dressed in a brown suit. The African American officer follows closely behind.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, another African American police officer stands by attentively watching the scene while holding what appears to be a radio or communication device. His posture is relaxed but alert, suggesting readiness to assist if needed.\n\nIn the background, various other individuals can be seen walking along the sidewalk, and cars drive by on the street. The background reveals a typical urban environment with trees, scattered pedestrians, and a glimpse of buildings across the street.\n\nOverall, the photograph seems to capture a moment of law enforcement activity, likely related to the detention of the individual being escorted to the police car.","title":"Street arrest for drinking complaint","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546633","546657","546634","546663","546654","542756","546661","547205","546637","546611","551941","542757","546635","546631","556847","558137"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["police","officer","car","street","shield","enforcement","law","radio","readiness","emblem"]}
