{"path":"545013.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a large industrial area viewed from a high vantage point, presenting a compelling landscape that contrasts human activity with natural surroundings. At the foreground, we see an open field dotted with small buildings or mobile homes, hinting at a residential area. Rich, green vegetation and scattered trees add a rural impression to this part of the image.\n\nIn the middle ground across a stretch of calm water, possibly a lake or river, stands an industrial plant characterized by multiple large buildings and towering smokestacks emitting thick plumes of white smoke. This smoke disperses into the sky, contributing to a significant cloud formation that dominates the upper middle portion of the image.\n\nThe background features a mix of hazy mountains or hills under a vibrant blue sky, which is slightly darkened by the smoke from the industrial activity below. The clear separation between the industrial, residential, and natural elements in the scene paints a picture of the diverse and dynamic ways land is utilized and the impact of industrialization on the environment.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes human habitation and industrialization against a backdrop of natural scenery, highlighted by the vivid clarity and color variation from the foreground to the sky.","title":"Looking across the Columbia River toward Longview, where aluminium plants and pulp mills fill the air with smoke","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552246","550706","545354","544059","545020","545053","544039","551567","552196","543813","544736","546073","545989","550672","544735","551026"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["industrialization","smoke","separation","darken","disperse","variation","habitation","clarity","towering","plume"]}
