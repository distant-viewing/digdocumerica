{"path":"549956.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction or mining scene with two large vehicles operating in a dusty environment. On the left, there is a yellow wheel loader with a raised bucket full of earth positioned over a green dump truck, presumably depositing its load. The dump truck is exceptionally large, emphasizing heavy-duty operations commonly seen in mining or large-scale construction sites.\n\nA lone worker in a white shirt and dark pants stands near the front of the dump truck, giving a sense of scale to the vehiclesâ€”they are massive compared to him. The background features a barren hill with some vegetation, indicating the site is a dug-up area likely for mining or earth-moving purposes. The ground is dry and dusty, and the overall color tone of the scene is muted with earthy colors, suggesting an arid setting or the effect of dust in the air. The photograph captures a moment of active work with a focus on heavy machinery and industry.","title":"Scooping earth for the nearby landfill operation at Croton","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["547232","555636","555638","547243","544099","547922","549245","544135","542538","542539","550266","550270","544107","544138","547104","544160"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["dump","mining","truck","loader","earth","site","load","construction","scale","duty"]}
