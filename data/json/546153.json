{"path":"546153.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic outdoor scene that features an old gas station setting with vintage elements. In the foreground, there are two fuel pumps painted in red and white. The red pump is more traditional with a rounded top and a meter window; the white one is taller and box-shaped with a dial meter.\n\nBehind the fuel pumps, centered in the image, is a yellow school bus that has been repurposed, possibly as a living space or storage unit. The bus is parked on a dirt area, and its windows are partially curtained, suggesting it might be used for accommodation. Various items like a ladder, a propane tank, and miscellaneous rubbish surround the bus, adding to the cluttered, makeshift appearance of the setting.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, a large homemade sign reading “GAS 30¢ DILDO” is visible, which suggests a quirky, perhaps humorous approach to advertising, using makeshift or unconventional materials and messaging. The environment is open with few trees and wide patches of grass and dirt, indicating a rural or semi-rural location.\n\nOverall, the composition gives a sense of a bygone era, with a focus on antiquated technology and a DIY aesthetic, possibly indicating economic hardship or a remote location. The atmosphere is one of neglect and improvisation, evoking a sense of resilience or forgotten times.","title":"Cut-rate gas station operates out of bus.","placename":"Marshall (Tex.)","location":"Marshall, Texas","nn1":["554784","555510","555517","555511","555494","555520","547874","548169","548171","548174","546973","548173","555405","550103","555506","547866"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["pump","bus","meter","fuel","gas","hardship","accommodation","rubbish","dirt","ladder"]}
