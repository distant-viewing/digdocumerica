{"path":"548509.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful scene on the water, featuring a group of people on a traditional-style boat. The boat has a distinct design with a dragon-head figure at the bow, painted primarily in red with decorative black and white elements. It is equipped with a single mast and a large, red triangular sail that is partially furled.\n\nThe group on the boat is composed of several individuals who appear to be engaged in casual activities; some are standing and conversing, while others are seated and looking out towards the water. Their attire is casual, suitable for a day out on the water under sunny weather conditions.\n\nIn the background, the calm blue water stretches out to meet a hazy, faintly outlined coastline. To the left in the distance, another sailboat with a white hull and sail can be seen, adding a recreational maritime feel to the scene. The overall atmosphere is leisurely and serene, likely a day of enjoyment out at sea. The color palette of the image, with its shades of blue and red, offers a striking contrast that enhances the visual interest of the scene.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549410","548507","549415","548524","549412","549411","549413","547465","548513","549386","549419","548503","548508","549414","547456","549418"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","boat","mast","maritime","bow","group","water","sailboat","hull","coastline"]}
