{"path":"551863.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban scene, likely on a rainy day, given the wet pavement and the presence of umbrellas. The composition is centered around a street lined with buildings that have various business signs, including visible names like \"Woolworth.\"\n\nIn the foreground, a classic light grey Volkswagen van with a visible license plate (marked as \"M-EN 411\") is prominently featured, facing the viewer. To the left of the van, there is a larger, darker delivery truck, partially cropped by the edge of the image, parked and apparently in the process of unloading or loading goods - boxes are visible in the space between the truck and the van.\n\nThe street scene includes people engaged in their daily activities. A few people can be seen walking with umbrellas, reflecting the rainy weather. Notably, a woman holding a white umbrella and carrying shopping bags walks along the pavement. The ground reflects the city lights and signs, adding a reflective quality to the image.\n\nThe architecture includes commercial buildings with varied fa√ßades, from more traditional to mid-century modern styles. Neon signs and other lighted advertisements add to the urban vibe. The atmospheric lighting and the wet conditions give the scene a slightly gloomy yet vibrant urban feel, typical for a cityscape on a rainy day.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On this rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551868","546643","546660","551873","556734","556681","550128","555450","551877","556710","554299","549832","551871","549859","546639","556983"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["umbrella","van","pavement","truck","delivery","sign","neon","license","shopping","street"]}
