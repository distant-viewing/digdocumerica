{"path":"554346.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial decay featuring a large heap of scrap metal. The composition is dominated by piles of twisted and rusty metal parts, which include what appears to be parts of machinery, metal sheets, and other industrial debris. The debris is shown in various states of deterioration, creating a texture-rich surface.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the height of the scrap piles against a broad, soft blue sky. In the foreground, a small pool of water mirrors the pile, adding a reflective element that contrasts with the rough textures of the metal. The environment around the scrap pile is sparse, suggesting an industrial or possibly abandoned area, and there is grass visible around the edges, indicating some overgrowth. The focus and lighting draw attention to the detailed textures and shapes within the pile, emphasizing the chaotic assembly of discarded metal. This setting evokes a sense of neglect and the passage of time, highlighted by the natural light that casts sharp shadows and bright highlights across the scene.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["548109","554300","554301","554318","542585","548147","554357","549307","548753","547610","557308","547611","547625","547901","552740","545059"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["pile","scrap","metal","ligh","overgrowth","deterioration","texture","assembly","sheet","debris"]}
