{"path":"551527.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene river scene with a metallic bridge crossing the river in the distance. The bridge is a truss design, possibly for trains or vehicular traffic, supported by concrete pillars. The body of water appears calm, shimmering under a bright, sunny sky with several sparkling spots on its surface suggesting sunlight reflections.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the shoreline is visible with lush, dense foliage predominately green in color, suggesting a healthy, robust plant life, typical of a riverbank environment. Near the center right of the foreground, a large overturned boat, potentially a canoe or rowboat, is noticeable on the shore, hinting at recreational use of the river.\n\nIn the background beyond the bridge, a skyline of a small town or city can be seen. There are various structures including a building that stands out due to its height and distinct architecture. The skyline gives an urban contrast to the natural foreground and middle ground composed of the river and its green banks.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of nature with hints of human presence and urbanization, creating a picturesque and tranquil scene.","title":"West bank of the Mississippi river near 55th avenue, north, in Brooklyn center, a suburb of Minneapolis","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["548098","548064","555730","552598","542555","548087","549469","546865","544542","548097","557096","557996","547263","552107","558067","547669"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","river","skyline","urbanization","rowboat","truss","canoe","pillar","shimmer","riverbank"]}
