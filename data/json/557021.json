{"path":"557021.jpg","date":"November 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, misty lakescape during what appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the low light conditions. The lake is calm, reflecting the silhouettes of the trees and the subdued, cloudy sky. Surrounding the lake are dense forests, primarily coniferous, shrouded in fog that lends an ethereal quality to the scene. In the foreground, there are a few young leafless branches, possibly small shrubs, adding to the composition's layered depth. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and slightly mysterious, enhanced by the subtle interplay of light and shadow reflecting off the water's surface and the darkening hues of the surrounding woodland.","title":"Big Beef Creek Estuary, site of the University of Washington fisheries research station, south of Bangor Annex on Hood Canal. Increased land use pressure is expected on similar areas when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby.
