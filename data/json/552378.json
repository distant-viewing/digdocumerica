{"path":"552378.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor street scene featuring a man standing next to a yellow Hertz Truck Rental vehicle. The man, who appears Caucasian, is dressed in a mint green button-up shirt and dark brown pants, paired with a belt and sunglasses. He is standing casually, holding a cigarette in his right hand, near the front right fender of the panel van.\n\nThe van itself is yellow with the “Hertz Truck Rental” logo prominently displayed. It has a distinctive setup on its roof, including a chair bolted to the roof and some electronic equipment, possibly for measuring or monitoring purposes, next to what appears to be a large clock face.\n\nIn the background, we see a somewhat hazy environment suggesting smog or fog, typical of some urban settings. Various other vehicles from the era, including sedans and a station wagon, are visible on the street. The scene is indicative of an earlier time period, perhaps the 1970s or 1980s, given the style of the vehicles and the fashion.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["548275","556714","549869","555460","548264","549873","552800","549859","544370","555475","552795","549898","546653","553488","545391","547025"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["van","fender","vehicle","smog","clock","cigarette","monitoring","street","wagon","roof"]}
