{"path":"558336.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly woman engaged in crocheting. She is seated comfortably in a wooden armchair, dressed in a floral blue-and-white blouse. The expression on her face is focused and perhaps a bit stern as she looks directly at the camera, her glasses positioned midway down her nose.\n\nIn the foreground on a wooden table, there's a collection of crocheting or knitting materialsâ€”bundles of yarn, needles, and patches of fabric with colorful patterns, all appearing a bit blurred. The focus is mostly on the woman, which highlights her as the main subject of the image.\n\nTo the right, there's a draped off-white crocheted blanket over the back of another chair, adding to the domestic and crafty feel of the scene. Behind the woman, on a small cabinet, there is a radio and what appears to be a green plant, implying a cozy, lived-in space. The background of the room is subdued in color, with soft natural light filtering in, likely from a window out of frame. This ambiance contributes to a serene and quiet setting, particularly suited to activities like crocheting.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire.
