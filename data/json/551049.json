{"path":"551049.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful yet industrially touched rural valley scene, characterized by its visual contrast between the natural environment and human activities. In the foreground, there are numerous single-story houses, modest in structure, with shingled roofs, surrounded by lush green lawns and trees. These residential houses are organized in a neat suburban layout, complete with paved roads and utility poles.\n\nDominating the middle ground of the photo is a significant industrial plant, possibly a factory or a processing plant, as evident from the large buildings and multiple smokestacks emitting a thick plume of smoke that ascends into the sky. This smoke slightly obscures the otherwise clear view and blends into the cloudy atmosphere, suggesting the presence of air pollution.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by rolling hills or low mountains, which add a sense of enclosure and intimacy to the valley. The lush greenery of the hills suggests a region that receives ample rainfall or is well-suited for vegetation.\n\nAlthough the image instils a tranquil rural life at first glance, the presence of the industrial facility introduces a narrative of economic activity, possibly suggesting the community's dependence on this industry for employment.","title":"Looking up the kanawha river valley from deepwater toward Alloy where smoke from union carbide's ferroAlloy plant rises high into the air","placename":"Charleston (W.
