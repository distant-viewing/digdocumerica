{"path":"558082.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene primarily immersed in shadow and dappled sunlight, conveying a cool, secluded atmosphere. The uneven, rugged terrain is visible with large, exposed rocks and boulders, prominently featured in the foreground. These rocks have a rough texture and are partly covered with moss and leaf litter, suggesting a moisture-rich environment.\n\nDense, leafy trees in varying shades of green form a thick canopy overhead, which filters the sunlight, creating patterns of light and shade across the scene. The trees are tall, and their trunks appear slim and straight, rising towards the light.\n\nIn the background, there's a glimpse of brighter, sunlit areas suggesting an opening in the forest or a clearing nearby. Small patches of the sky might be visible through the dense foliage.\n\nThe composition is peaceful and natural, with no visible human presence or artificial elements, highlighting the untouched and wild aspect of the forest. The overall mood is tranquil and slightly mysterious, inviting exploration or contemplation.","title":"Rock ledges and trees offer beauty and solitude for hikers in the Virginia Kendall park, part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.
