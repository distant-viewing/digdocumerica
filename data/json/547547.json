{"path":"547547.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene wetland scene at sunset. The image is dominated by tall, dense stands of brown and golden-reedy vegetation, which is likely some type of marsh grass or cattails. The vegetation covers the majority of the frame but is intersected by patches of still blue water, reflecting the hues of the sky, suggesting it is either early morning or late evening due to the soft, warm lighting.\n\nThe landscape is flat, and the background gradually fades into a blurry horizon, where the color transitions from the golden tones of the vegetation to a deeper blue, indicating the vast expanse of the wetland and possibly a clear sky. The overall mood is calm and tranquil, emphasized by the natural earthy tones and the absence of any visible wildlife or human activity. This scene likely depicts a natural reserve or a protected wetland area, showcasing a typical ecosystem with aquatic and semi-aquatic plant life.","title":"Middletown dump (background) borders salt marsh.","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547589","547489","547604","547500","547532","550788","547544","553856","544515","547488","546205","553085","542525","547543","550783","554717"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","reserve","marsh","vegetation","majority","stand","absence","wildlife","ecosystem","transition"]}
