{"path":"549683.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting where a technician, identified by a name tag as \"Don,\" is conducting tests or monitoring machinery. The technician is a Caucasian male wearing a light blue lab coat, dark trousers, and headphones, attentively adjusting or inspecting a piece of machinery.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a large, bright yellow Caterpillar engine mounted on a metal platform, connected with various pipes and tubes. The engine is intricate, featuring numerous components such as a radiator visible at the front and exhaust parts. The color of the engine contrasts sharply with the muted colors of the surrounding equipment and environment.\n\nBeside the engine, there are additional elements of industrial machinery, including a large, cylindrical component to the right of the engine which appears to be part of the testing or operation setup. The room itself has blue-painted walls and a myriad of other mechanical parts and wires, indicating a well-used technical or mechanical testing area.\n\nThe ambient lighting and the focused expression of the technician suggest a serious, professional maintenance, testing, or research environment. The overall setup implies a test lab where engines or similar machinery are evaluated or calibrated.","title":"Evaluation and development control room at epa's ann arbor motor vehicle emissions test center","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549684","553329","553330","544822","557829","551595","555239","549721","542765","552371","556315","546036","557851","557855","558371","552112"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["engine","technician","testing","test","machinery","lab","component","setup","myriad","tag"]}
