{"path":"550085.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in the process of barbecuing chicken. Both men wear white aprons and straw hats, seemingly to protect themselves from the heat and smoke emanating from the large barbecue grills they are tending to. They appear to be outdoors, in an area surrounded by a metal fence, possibly at a fair or community event, judging by the somewhat blurred background that includes glimpses of a truck and carnival-style tents.\n\nThe barbecue setup consists of two large, rectangular grills filled with rows of chicken pieces. The grill on the left is open and one man is either adjusting the chicken or the grill itself, while the one on the right is covered with a mesh lid, and the other man is watching the cooking process intently, suggesting that precise cooking is key to their task.\n\nThe scene is enveloped in smoke, likely from the chicken cooking, which adds a dynamic quality to the image and conveys the intensity of barbecuing at such a scale. The environment is informal and practical, focused clearly on the process of cooking.","title":"Amish men assist at chicken barbecue - a fund raiser for the Middlefield volunteer fire department","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["544983","557801","546127","544986","544974","557934","557793","545017","554686","550081","549451","551275","543987","544979","545021","557700"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["cooking","grill","process","carnival","lid","apron","smoke","man","heat","mesh"]}
