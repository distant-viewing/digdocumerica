{"path":"545178.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a fishing boat, featuring two individuals engaging in marine activities. The setting is an expansive body of water, likely a sea or ocean, under a clear blue sky. The calmness of the water suggests good weather conditions.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a male figure dressed in a plaid shirt and dark trousers, complete with rubber boots, suggesting he is prepared for wet conditions. He appears to be inspecting or working on a part of the boat, next to a small, cabin-like structure that forms part of the boatâ€™s deck. The cabin is modest, constructed from wood and simple materials, and holds various items like a jacket hanging off it.\n\nOn the right, another figure, possibly female due to the presence of a blue sweater and striped pants, stands facing the water, handling a large, circular fish trap which is being lifted out of the water. The trap is made of a metallic frame and netting, designed to capture seafood such as crabs or lobsters.\n\nThe background reveals a hint of a distant shoreline, suggesting this fishing activity is not far from land. The entirety of the composition reflects a working day on the water, capturing both the effort involved in marine fishing and the serene setting in which it occurs.","title":"Jack wiegardt and denis hickey harvesting dungeness crabs","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545093","554200","552324","547552","546758","545185","546301","547563","552298","546053","545056","544256","550942","546972","546330","554008"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["trap","fishing","cabin","boat","crab","seafood","entirety","rubber","water","figure"]}
