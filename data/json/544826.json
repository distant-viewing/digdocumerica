{"path":"544826.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene inside a large, spacious factory or assembly area characterized by high ceilings and a blueish overtone. Two workers, clad in typical industrial workwear including helmets, are seen engaging in a meticulous manufacturing or assembly process on the floor of the facility. They appear to be assembling or inspecting large, metallic, hexagonal structures or components, which are laid out in an intricate pattern covering the floor area.\n\nIn the background, the factory environment is marked by a layered construction of metallic girders and beams suggesting a robust infrastructure. Tall structures and storage units punctuate the space, hinting at a facility equipped to handle large-scale operations. Lighting fixtures installed at various points illuminate the work area effectively, emphasizing the ongoing activity despite the subdued ambient lighting. Several other personnel are seen in the distant background, suggesting a teamwork-oriented operation.\n\nThe photograph focuses not only on the labor and concentration of the individuals but also capture the complexity and scale of industrial operations, hinting at a meticulous and high-precision nature of work being conducted. The environment and the assembly suggest a focus possibly related to engineering, construction or large-scale manufacturing pertinent to sectors like aerospace, heavy machinery or similar fields.","title":"\"Refueling floor\" at St. Vrain Nuclear Power Plant","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544018","549723","544022","544153","544026","544053","544014","544320","546036","556314","549719","554431","546628","544822","549721","544331"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["assembly","manufacturing","scale","operation","factory","workwear","girder","floor","sector","personnel"]}
