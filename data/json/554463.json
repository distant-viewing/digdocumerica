{"path":"554463.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a group of people appears to be preparing for a kayaking or canoeing trip. The setting is a forest, with tall trees surrounding the area and a dirt ground, suggesting a somewhat remote or natural location.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there are two kayaks on the ground, one lying flat on its hull and the other slightly elevated on its side. A small pile of personal items, including a white bag and a black bag, is placed next to the kayaks. The kayaks are white and appear sleek, designed for river or lake paddling.\n\nA green car with wood paneling on the sides, indicative of styles popular in the 1970s or early 1980s, is parked on the left side of the image. The carâ€™s trunk is open, but the contents are not visible. It appears the car has been used to transport the kayaks to this location.\n\nThere are three people in the scene. One individual, possibly a woman, stands in the background to the left, near the car, facing the other two individuals. She is wearing a white jacket, dark pants, and appears to be holding a yellow life vest. The middle person is a man with his back turned, wearing a red jacket and blue pants, and seems to be engaged in a conversation or receiving something from the person on the right. The third person, another man facing the camera, has gray hair and is dressed in a yellow jacket and dark pants. He is interacting with the man in the middle.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is active and seems focused on outdoor recreation, conveying a sense of camaraderie and preparation for an adventure in the waters nearby. The attire of the individuals suggests cooler weather, indicating it might be a trip taken in early fall or spring.","title":"Canoe and kayak club from Vermont prepare to paddle down the Upper Hudson River near Indian Lake via Indian River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554470","554464","558068","544759","558069","554661","549441","550661","546880","554465","554539","549996","554462","550659","554468","558072"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","trip","car","jacket","pant","bag","person","paneling","receive","camaraderie"]}
