{"path":"552219.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area adjacent to a body of water. The scene captures part of the shore and water, which is noticeably discolored with a large swath of red, possibly from pollutants or a spill. On the land, there are multiple structures and open areas with stacked materials that could be cargo or industrial supplies.\n\nClosest to the shoreline, there are train tracks running parallel to the coast with several adjoining buildings alongside. These buildings appear to be functional facilities possibly related to loading, unloading, or storage tasks, typical in an industrial port setting. Arrayed next to the buildings are some grouped materials which include cylindrical and cube-shaped objects, likely containers or stored goods.\n\nThe configuration and organization of the space suggest that it is a working industrial area, likely involving materials handling related to the nearby waterway. The presence of the red discoloration in the water is an arresting visual element that contrasts starkly with the otherwise mundane industrial setting, hinting at environmental issues related to industrial activity.","title":"Red-stained water at the edge of crown zellerbach kraft pulp mill at port townsend, where the strait of juan de fuca joins puget sound","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["549524","552205","555776","549519","552209","548423","552151","549495","550890","551183","552007","555769","552206","552181","550886","551177"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["relate","material","swath","discolor","configuration","discoloration","pollutant","spill","unloading","coast"]}
