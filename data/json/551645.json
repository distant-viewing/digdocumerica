{"path":"551645.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene featuring a large, sculptural metallic object in the shape of a stylized number '6' or '9', depending on the perspective. This sculpture, which has a reflective surface, is prominently displayed in the middle of the frame and is set on a pedestal or platform.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a sizeable collection of parked bicycles, suggesting this area might be a common biking hub or a designated parking space for cyclists. Many of the bicycles have baskets, indicating practical use possibly for commuting or shopping.\n\nThe background shows a bustling city environment with towering high-rise buildings that have numerous windows, reflecting a dense, commercial part of the city. The architecture suggests a mid-20th-century style. Visible street signs, such as those for a \"Discount Center\" and a \"Pepsi\" billboard, add to the urban commercial atmosphere. There are also pedestrians visible, some walking and others congregated in groups, possibly indicating a lunch hour or similar break in a business district.\n\nOverall, the composition presents a dynamic juxtaposition of leisurely (bikes) and corporate (buildings) elements within a dense urban setting, possibly in a major city. The photograph offers a snapshot of city life, where art, commerce, and personal transportation intersect.","title":"Rockefeller center--6th avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554312","551646","557263","551456","551443","553247","551651","553266","551493","553278","549317","551465","551464","551662","553254","551647"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["city","bicycle","congregate","depend","commuting","lunch","cyclist","pedestal","stylize","stroot"]}
