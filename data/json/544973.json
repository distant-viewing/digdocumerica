{"path":"544973.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing in a small, weathered rowboat that is gently bobbing on a body of water. The man is dressed in casual attire, wearing a white T-shirt and dark shorts, paired with a dark headband, sunglasses, and a watch. He is holding a rope in one hand, suggesting that he has just secured or is about to maneuver the boat. \n\nIn the boat, you can see various items including what appears to be a small motor at the back end, a white bucket, and some other unidentifiable equipment, possibly related to fishing or boating. The setting is outdoors during what seems like daylight hours, given the bright natural light and clear conditions.\n\nThe background features a dense forest of tall, evergreen trees lining the shoreline, reflecting a serene, secluded environment. The water is calm with slight ripples, indicating a gentle movement in the rowboat's vicinity.\n\nOverall, the composition enables a portrayal of a tranquil moment in a natural setting, with the person appearing poised and purposefully engaged in his water-based activity.","title":"Leroy black raises steelhead fish on lake quinault","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547023","550975","546976","552122","547558","553341","544214","555602","550841","553411","550835","544208","544260","546352","548553","551350"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["rowboat","enable","headband","poise","motor","boat","boating","portrayal","maneuver","secure"]}
