{"path":"547302.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a view of a wide highway that curves gently through a lush, rural landscape. The highway is a divided roadway, featuring multiple lanes in each direction separated by a grassy median. The road is partially wet, suggesting recent rain, with visible reflections on its surface enhancing the divide between wet and dry areas.\n\nVehicles, which include both cars and trucks, are dispersed sparsely along the highway, moving in both directions. The landscape surrounding the highway features rolling hills and fields, some of which appear to be cultivated with visible furrows and patterns indicating agricultural use.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with long shadows cast across the road and terrain. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and emphasizing the green hues of the grass and hills. There are also a few signs visible along the roadside, typical of highway markers for directions or advertisements, but the specifics are indistinct.\n\nOverall, the composition and the perspective of the photograph emphasize the winding form of the highway, leading the viewer's eye along the path of the roads as they navigate through the rural setting.","title":"Interstate 80 passes through a stretch of rolling farmland 10 miles west of Lincoln.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547298","547294","554566","557430","546733","556405","548144","546603","557471","546720","554130","546571","555630","546587","546607","545367"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["highway","direction","median","road","specific","marker","hill","roadside","roadway","advertisement"]}
