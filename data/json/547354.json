{"path":"547354.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque rural scene, most likely taken from an elevated perspective. A long, straight country road stretches directly through the center of the image, receding into the distant horizon. This narrow road, bounded on each side by lush greenery and occasional trees, appears as a defining feature, drawing the eye along its length.\n\nTo the right of the road, in the foreground, there is a white house with a gabled roof, accompanied by several other smaller outbuildings, suggesting a residential or farm property. The surrounding fields are divided into various sections by fences, displaying different shades and types of vegetation, possibly indicating multiple uses such as grazing, fallow fields, or crop cultivation.\n\nPower lines parallel the road on one side, reinforcing the sense of rural infrastructure and the connection to broader networks despite the seemingly remote location. The landscape itself is gently undulating, not steep, but marked by slight rises and falls. The background shows a wide-open sky and a hint of more distant farms or buildings, suggesting a broader community in a largely agricultural setting.\n\nThe scene is lit by what seems to be the soft, warm light of either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the grass and the road, which hints at some form of tranquillity and timelessness common to rural areas. The overall composition uses the road as a central axis, creating a strong linear perspective that invites the viewer to look deep into the photograph and consider the distances, both literal and metaphorical, that such roads traverse in less urban environments.","title":"Looking south along county road in farmlands of Seward County","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["549235","547316","547300","555818","554127","555635","549261","554130","556405","549257","556971","556462","554031","556960","549182","554800"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["road","farm","grazing","timelessness","outbuilding","country","perspective","cultivation","field","crop"]}
