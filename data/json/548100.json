{"path":"548100.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a winding road viewed from an elevated perspective, meandering through a forested landscape. The road curves tightly through the hilly terrain, characterized by patches of green trees and shrubs. On the road, a vintage car with a contrasting color roof is rounding a bend. Surrounding this paved path are scattered rocks and sparse vegetation, indicative of a relatively dry climate. The sun casts stark shadows, suggesting it's either early morning or late afternoon. There are no visible buildings or people, emphasizing the serenity and isolated nature of the scene. The overall mood is calm and quiet, highlighted by the natural setting and the lone car traveling the road.","title":"Looking down from the old highway on Rowena Hills to hairpin curve of Route 80N in the Columbia River Gorge between Mosier and the Hood River.","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["557528","556579","548099","551240","554566","550614","557010","550695","554130","547659","553630","555670","554805","556976","556465","554031"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","round","serenity","meander","car","climate","bend","travel","shrub","wind"]}
