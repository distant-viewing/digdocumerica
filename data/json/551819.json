{"path":"551819.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling street scene, likely dating back to the 1970s based on the fashion and overall aesthetic. The focal point of the image is a middle-aged couple walking with a medium-sized black-and-white dog, possibly a Collie.\n\nThe man is dressed in a smart, dark suit with a matching tie and glasses. He appears to be in mid-stride and is holding a newspaper under one arm. The woman is wearing a tartan skirt with a dark blazer accented by a yellow blouse. She also carries a white handbag and wears white low-heeled shoes. Both the man and the woman wear a white flower pinned to their garments, suggesting they might be attending a special event or memorial.\n\nThe scene around them is lively, with multiple people of various ages walking in different directions. People are dressed in a mix of casual and more formal attire, indicating a usual day in an urban environment with diverse activities. Notably, the backdrop features storefronts with bright displays and large text, one prominently reading \"SPORT START\", hinting it might be a store selling sporting goods.\n\nThe street itself is paved with large, patterned tiles, and the ambiance suggests a well-attended commercial area in a city. The slightly overcast sky contributes to the soft lighting, which casts gentle shadows and gives the image a slightly faded quality, resonant of the eraâ€™s photographic film.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
