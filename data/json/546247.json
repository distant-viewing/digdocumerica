{"path":"546247.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a landfill operation with heavy machinery at work. In the foreground, a large yellow bulldozer, operated by a man visible in blue clothing, is moving a significant amount of earth and waste. The bulldozer's scoop is large and filled with debris and soil, indicating active work in consolidating or covering trash.\n\nThe middle ground is filled with piles of garbage that include diverse items, suggesting a mix of domestic and perhaps light industrial waste. The colors of the garbage vary widely, with noticeable pieces such as white plastics, colored papers, and other unidentifiable refuse which reflect the diversity of the materials dumped here.\n\nIn the background, another heavy machine, possibly a compactor, is seen atop one of the garbage mounds, further suggesting ongoing waste management processes. The background also features open sky and the edges of other machinery, including a red vehicle that may be associated with the landfill operations, positioned on top of another mound.\n\nThe terrain is rough, uneven and mostly bare of vegetation, indicating heavy and frequent usage for waste disposal. The entire scene captures a busy and dynamic landfill in operation, managing the accumulation and processing of waste under a clear sky.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
