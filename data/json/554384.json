{"path":"554384.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage red car, likely from a car show scene due to the polished condition of the vehicle and the presence of spectators. The car's hood is featured prominently in the foreground with a glossy finish that reflects the bright interior lighting, causing linear light reflections to appear on the hood.\n\nThe car has distinctive chrome detailing, especially around the front grille and headlights. The grille is divided by a vertical line, and the headlights are partially visible at the lower edges of the image. The carâ€™s hood exhibits a raised, central section which enhances its muscular appearance.\n\nInside the car, you can see parts of the interior through the windshield, including a light-colored roof and parts of the dashboard or inner door panels. There are at least two people inside the vehicle; their reflections can be faintly seen on the windshield. The surrounding area seems crowded, indicative of multiple onlookers or other cars in proximity, reflecting an event-like atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the strong lines and glossy exterior of the car, with the surrounding details suggesting an event setting where the car is likely being exhibited or admired.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557052","552803","554388","554376","554373","554389","552412","557847","554381","552787","556703","557878","555475","554387","554377","554385"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","hood","grille","windshield","headlight","exhibit","admire","dashboard","reflection","event"]}
