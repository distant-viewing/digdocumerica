{"path":"557958.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a muddy river meandering through a lush landscape. The river, tinted brown perhaps due to sediment or recent rainfall, dominates the center of the image, bending slightly as it flows through the scene. On either side of the river, dense greenery, likely trees and other vegetation, outlines its banks, emphasizing the natural setting.\n\nTo the left of the river, a road runs parallel, partially obscured by the trees. This road, along with clearings sporadically visible, indicates some level of human presence or development in the area.\n\nThere's also a railway track visible on the right side of the river, which, like the road, follows the riverâ€™s course closely. A train, marked by a plume of white smoke or steam, can be seen moving along the tracks, suggesting a moment captured during its journey through this serene environment.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate surroundings of the river and its flanking roads and rail, the topography gently rises and is clothed in a similar dense foliage, stretching to the horizon under a sky that appears clear, hinting at good weather conditions during the time the photograph was taken.\n\nThis image serves as a picturesque representation of a landscape where nature and human-made elements coexist, with transportation pathways quietly integrated into the natural environment. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and somewhat timeless.","title":"Cuyahoga River with diversion of water to the old Ohio-Erie Canal at the left. Weekend steam engine powered train out of Cleveland, Ohio, is seen in the background at the right. The train gives passengers a view of the Cuyahoga Valley and part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Cleveland and Akron. This picture was taken near Highway 82 near Cleveland. The Indians named the river Cuyahoga, which means crooked.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547227","556964","552838","555575","555753","550623","552953","553452","542653","548010","550885","550586","549081","550616","555214","557106"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","road","track","course","coexist","representation","journey","rainfall","topography","integrate"]}
