The poster is in black and white, promoting the re-election of \"Lynn Hill\" as County Commissioner for the Second District as a Republican candidate. The upper portion of the poster features a photo of Lynn Hill, who is a middle-aged man wearing glasses and a hat.\n\nBelow the photo, the poster details his credentials and involvement in the community. It mentions that he has served in various capacities such as a member of the Garfield County Conservation Commission, Chamber of Commerce, and several other local organizations. Lynn Hill is also noted as a veteran of World War II, and the poster describes him as a \"FARMER and BUSINESSMAN with 35 years in Garfield County.\"\n\nAt the bottom of the poster, voters are urged to support him, with a notice that \"YOUR VOTE FOR LYNN HILL ON NOVEMBER 7 WILL BE APPRECIATED.\"\n\nThe edges of the poster are slightly frayed, indicating it has been exposed to the elements.
