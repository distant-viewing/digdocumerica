{"path":"548435.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an elevated view of a sparsely occupied parking area. The scene is dominated by broad open space marked by light and dark streaks, possibly indicating tire marks or shadow patterns on the pavement. The central focus of the image is a solitary dark-colored car, which appears to be a vintage model, parked within the area framed by two prominent light poles.\n\nEach pole supports an overhead lamp and a small yellow sign labeled 'LOW LEVELS'. The poles are tall, with the lamps positioned at their ends, casting noticeable shadows that intersect with the geometric patterns on the ground. The angle of the photo, along with the long shadows, suggests it was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the sun is low.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the photo is somewhat desolate and quiet, emphasizing the emptiness and the broad, unobstructed expanse of the parking lot. The background is plain and unremarkable, which helps to draw attention to the car and the structural details of the light poles. The composition utilizes the lines of the pavement and shadows to lead the viewer's eye across the image, making these everyday elements visually interesting.","title":"Empty parking spaces at Logan airport.
