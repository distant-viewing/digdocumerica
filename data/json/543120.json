{"path":"543120.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of historical decay and rustic charm, likely taken at an abandoned settlement or a preserved historical site. The central focus of the image is an old, weathered wooden wagon with prominent large wooden wheels, and additional wheel parts strewn about. The wagon is in a state of disrepair, with its wooden structure showing signs of age and exposure to the elements.\n\nTo the side of the wagon, various other relics can be seen scattered across the grassy ground. Notable among these is a rusted metal object that resembles a portion of another wagon or farm equipment. Behind the wagon, running along the right side of the image, is a long dark brown wooden building, possibly a barn or storage facility. Its siding shows a deep, weathered patina and it features several windows and a slightly sloped roof.\n\nThe background features a gentle, grass-covered hill, adding to the serene yet somber mood of a place left behind by time. No living beings are visible in the shot, which enhances the feel of abandonment and quiet history. The setting suggests a rural location, possibly in a region known for its pastoral lifestyles and agrarian history. The colors are vivid yet hint at age, with rich browns, faded greens, and the deep blue of the sky. The light suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, given the soft shadows and gentle warmth of the tones.","title":"A wooden wagon in Bodie State Historical Park.
