{"path":"547578.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image prominently displays a series of large industrial pipes and valves in the foreground. The pipes are predominantly white but some show signs of rust and weathering, indicating they may be old or exposed to harsh conditions. Two prominent valves with large hand wheels are situated in the center, one exhibiting a rusted surface and the other appearing in better condition with some paint still visible. These valves are connected to the pipes through flanged joints, bolted tightly together.\n\nIn the background, there's a view of an industrial area beside a body of water. Several factories or processing facilities with tall chimneys emitting no visible smoke are noticeable. The factories are painted in various pastel colors, adding a unique contrast against the more weathered and industrial foreground. Old wooden piers and pilings are scattered through the water, suggesting a once busy but now possibly less utilized waterside industrial setting.\n\nThe scene is set under a clear sky with some clouds, suggesting it might be a sunny day. The overall composition juxtaposes the intricate, mechanical details of the industrial foreground against a broader industrial landscape, highlighting themes of industry, decay, and possibly environmental impact.","title":"Providence River waterfront, from Bold Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545844","557387","547497","546767","549053","552003","557304","547958","546108","552135","552179","542545","558365","551156","545978","551576"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["valve","pipe","factory","piling","show","weathering","condition","rust","pier","wheel"]}
