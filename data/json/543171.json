{"path":"543171.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dilapidated wooden building, which appears to be an old, abandoned shack or shed. The structure is in a state of severe disrepair, with a heavily distressed wooden exterior and a roof that is collapsing, clearly showing missing panels and bent metal sheets. The wood has weathered to a deep, rusty brown color, consistent with long-term exposure to the elements.\n\nThe ground is littered with debris, including scattered rusted metal pieces, cans, and fragments of wood, suggesting long-term neglect and possible scavenging activities over time. The landscape around the building includes low scrub and grass, indicative of a dry, perhaps arid environment. In the background, rolling hills can be seen, giving a sense of being in a rural or remote location.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of desolation and decay, typical of abandoned industrial or mining sites left to the ravages of time and weather. The photo, with its clear sky and harsh lighting, emphasizes the starkness and abandonment of the scene.","title":"California--Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543339","543344","543350","554707","551330","557344","552494","545233","555612","545818","547038","551115","551111","552491","542588","557348"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["term","shack","distress","starkness","scrub","panels","wood","collapse","sheet","fragment"]}
