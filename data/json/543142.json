{"path":"543142.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and textured coastal landscape, emphasized by the low angle of sunlight casting deep shadows and highlights across the scene. The image depicts a pebbly beach, densely covered with numerous rounded stones and rocks of varying sizes. The rocks, which dominate the foreground and middle ground, appear smooth, shaped by the forces of water and weathering over time.\n\nThese rocks are interspersed with patches of wet sand and patches of seaweed, adding a mix of textures and colors to the composition. The varied shades of the rocks, ranging from dark grays and browns to lighter hues, contribute to a rich mosaic pattern. The sunlight creates a visually dramatic contrast, accentuating the rough surfaces and contours of the rocks with deep shadows, making them appear more three-dimensional.\n\nThe background of the photograph is less distinct; however, it maintains the continuity of rocky textures diminishing in size due to perspective, leading towards a faint suggestion of the shoreline meeting the horizon. The overall atmosphere suggests a serene yet rugged natural environment, typical of a coastal region during low tide when the rocks are exposed and the sea is temporarily withdrawn. The image does not include any visible human activity, focusing solely on the natural elements and the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"California--Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["547486","551554","550458","543295","549353","543289","542890","543081","547483","543243","543250","545173","543092","545130","545122","543306"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["rock","suggestion","continuity","seaweed","size","shadow","tide","sunlight","force","highlight"]}
