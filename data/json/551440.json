{"path":"551440.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental degradation, displaying an area cluttered with various types of discarded waste. The foreground is heavily littered with garbage that includes multiple old tires, some with their rims visible, plastic bags filled with debris, and scattered wooden planks and broken pieces of furniture. Among the refuse, patches of green plants can be seen struggling to grow.\n\nThe background shows a body of water that is heavily blanketed with a thick layer of green algae, indicating significant pollution. Floating amidst the algae are more disposed items such as a rusted barrel, a detached white window frame, and other unidentifiable pieces of trash.\n\nThe entire scene conveys a somber reflection on environmental neglect, highlighted by the stark contradiction between natural elements and man-made waste. The area is devoid of any human presence, focusing entirely on the impact of pollution and waste on natural settings.","title":"Choked with dumped landfill and coated with algae--backwater of the Mississippi River along Versailles Avenue","placename":"Saint Paul (Minn.)","location":"Saint Paul, Minnesota","nn1":["550352","551441","547907","547524","550800","546838","550812","547525","550687","551247","550801","556419","547520","552089","555228","552098"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["algae","waste","pollution","struggle","piece","rim","refuse","furniture","barrel","garbage"]}
