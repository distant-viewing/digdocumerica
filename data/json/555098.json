{"path":"555098.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a rugged, sloped terrain primarily covered with loose soil and sparse green vegetation. Dominating the scene are remains of massive tree stumps with exposed roots, indicative of a heavily logged or deforested area. The foreground shows a couple of these large stumps prominently, while the rest of the soil sprawls with trails of erosion. Additional pieces of fallen logs, partially decomposed, scatter throughout the environment, suggesting either past logging activities or natural tree falls. Shadows and sunlight play across the scene, creating a varied texture and depth, juxtaposing the life of the remaining greenery against the desolation of the cleared forest. The image conveys a strong sense of ecological impact, particularly deforestation, and might invoke thoughts about conservation and forest management practices.","title":"Douglas firs growing from an eroding mountainside in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555136","555107","555208","555104","555092","555221","555150","542820","542865","555094","555089","555198","542938","542819","555162","545138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["stump","soil","deforestation","remain","root","forest","conservation","practice","desolation","thought"]}
