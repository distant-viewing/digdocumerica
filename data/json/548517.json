{"path":"548517.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on a body of water with two young sailors managing a small sailboat. The boat is sleek, with a white hull and a red trim, equipped with a single mast and two sails. One of the sails is notably marked with the number \"56036\" and a black circular insignia. The boat is positioned at a gentle angle to the camera, showing both its port side and part of its starboard.\n\nThe two individuals on the sailboat appear to be focused and engaged in sailing. The boy closest to us is standing near the stern, wearing denim shorts and no shirt. He seems to be overseeing the boat's course, looking relaxed yet attentive. The second boy, partially obscured by the sail, is seated near the middle of the boat, handling what looks to be the mainsheet or another part of the rigging.\n\nThe background features a hazy sky suggesting a mild, possibly humid day. The water is relatively calm, with minor ripples indicating a gentle breeze. Visible in the far distance are other watercrafts, including a sizable boat, enhancing the recreational and busy aspect of the waterscape. This scene paints a picture of youthful adventure and the tranquil enjoyment of sailing.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["543941","548514","549386","549423","548203","548521","549425","549421","544224","549406","552343","547463","548510","548506","544669","548508"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["sail","boat","sailing","sailboat","boy","insignia","waterscape","sailor","watercraft","rigging"]}
