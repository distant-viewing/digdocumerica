{"path":"545028.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a log boom in a body of water, captured from a high vantage point. The foreground prominently displays a cluster of floating logs gathered together and bound by ropes, projecting a sense of the logging industry's presence. The water shimmers with reflections that catch the light. Beyond these logs, extend several neat rows of wooden structures supporting more log booms, organized into geometric patterns that guide the eye further into the image. These structured rows create a network of canals guiding the logs.\n\nThe background showcases a tranquil water surface that contrasts with the industrial activity in the foreground. In the distance, there is a hint of land with sparse vegetation visible at the edges of the water body. The sky is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day, further evidenced by the vivid lighting and deep shadows in the photograph. Overall, the image portrays a blend of natural and industrial elements, captured in a serene aquatic environment.","title":"Log storage on coos river","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["548018","548162","552161","552178","545036","550326","550338","545037","550325","542921","552163","552176","552197","548004","545266","552170"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","boom","guide","logs","beyond","bound","row","evidenc","canal","logging"]}
