{"path":"555796.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph presents a bustling industrial scene likely captured at a shipyard or construction site near a large body of water. The entire scene is densely packed with various types of machinery and construction materials.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple green and yellow structures stacked and arranged in a complex layout. These appear to be parts of buildings or ships in the middle of assembly, with intricate frameworks and exposed columns. The color and structured appearance of these objects suggest modular components, possibly prefabricated parts for quick construction.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a myriad of cranes, ranging in color from red to yellow, and they are seen extending their booms across the skyline. The cranes are interspersed with more construction materials and equipment, as well as containers plus other sections of future constructions. This indicates an extensive, heavy-duty construction or shipbuilding project.\n\nMultiple barges are docked in the waterway shown in the immediate foreground, loaded with additional equipment and materials, further emphasizing the industrial nature of this scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a bridge that spans the width of the photo, suggesting the proximity to an urban area. The bridge, along with the distant skyline featuring buildings, locates this scene within a developed, possibly metropolitan setting.\n\nThe water and the industrial activity suggest this could be an area where shipbuilding or large-scale construction is prevalent. The cloudy sky and the overall atmosphere deliver a gritty, industrious feeling typical of such working environments.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a dynamic industrial landscape bustling with activities pertinent to construction or shipbuilding, showcasing a blend of engineering feats and heavy machinery.","title":"Construction on the north river sewage treatment plant in Manhattan, New York.  Treatment plants in most of the 31 major drainage areas dispose of their sludge in the New York bight about 12 miles from entrance to New York harbor and long island beaches in 1973 there were 5.8 million cubic yards of sewage sludge dumped into the waters of the bight.  This volume is expected to triple in a few years","placename":"Manhattan (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Manhattan, New York","nn1":["546833","548346","547129","545147","552013","547474","546033","548353","550890","546016","549305","548361","551988","555795","550910","552015"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["construction","material","crane","skyline","bridge","myriad","shipyard","working","deliver","bustle"]}
