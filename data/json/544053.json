{"path":"544053.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph is set in an industrial environment, likely a factory focused on metal or steel production. It features two workers wearing hard hatsâ€”one facing towards us in profile and the other looking away.\n\nIn the foreground, directly above the workers, there are large rectangular metal panels hanging from an overhead crane, colored in a faded red tone. This arrangement suggests that these panels have either been coated or treated and are being transported or dried. \n\nTo the left of the photograph, you can faintly see additional equipment and machinery which appears part of the industrial process. There's a dimly lit background which hints at the expansive size of the factory, with some structural and mechanical elements visible.\n\nThe lighting is subdued with natural light illuminating from beyond the factory doorway or window, highlighting the edges and surfaces of the metal panels and casting shadows on the ground. The overall atmosphere suggests a typical working day in an industrial setting, with an emphasis on the manufacturing or processing tasks at hand.","title":"Electrowinning refining plant, part of Arizona's extensive copper industry.","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544018","544001","544153","546036","544026","544014","544022","544826","542989","544331","544171","549693","556866","546023","549694","557388"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["panel","factory","worker","metal","doorway","production","profile","emphasis","manufacturing","steel"]}
