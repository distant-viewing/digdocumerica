{"path":"547928.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and densely packed outdoor parking lot filled with a large variety of cars, suggesting a period from the mid to late 20th century based on the car models visible. The cars display a range of colors and styles, including sedans, coupes, and station wagons.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, multi-story boat labeled \"B Aviation\" docked at a pier. Industrial equipment and structures are visible around the docking area, indicating a port or industrial area. The backdrop features a bridge spanning across the back, partially obscured by the other elements in the composition.\n\nThe sky is clear, and the setting appears to be during the daytime given the bright lighting and clear visibility. This scene likely represents a bustling urban or industrial environment possibly near a waterfront, where parking space is in high demand. The photography provides a vivid snapshot of a moment in time, focusing on automobile variety and an active industrial backdrop.","title":"Parking lot at ferry dock on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547327","548496","556204","556773","547480","556790","546879","547826","546685","546900","556721","556722","547469","548015","553303","542633"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","coupe","demand","car","docking","variety","wagon","automobile","photography","port"]}
