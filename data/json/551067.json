{"path":"551067.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverside setting in a lush, green landscape. The foreground features the calm, reflective waters of a river. Along the bank, a cluster of homes can be seen nestled among a variety of trees, adding a tranquil, residential feel to the riverscape. Small boats are docked along the shore, suggesting recreational activities or local fishing practices.\n\nAt the waterâ€™s edge, several people appear engaged in different outdoor activities, adding life to the scene. One of them seems to be standing near a boat, possibly in preparation for a ride or maintenance.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a well-maintained park-like area with open grassy spaces surrounded by trees, which might serve as communal grounds for the locals. The residential structures vary in style and size, painted in different colors, which adds to the picturesque charm of the area.\n\nRising above this tranquil town and standing out distinctly against the dense green backdrop of lush hillside forests in the background, is a tall white pole, which could signify a flagpole or a communications antenna. This vertical structure juxtaposes with the horizontal tranquility of the river and organized settlement, adding a sense of scale and depth to the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a peaceful, community-oriented riverside area where nature and human habitation merge harmoniously.","title":"Smithers, a town on the kanawha river","placename":"Charleston (W.
