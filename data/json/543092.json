{"path":"543092.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and rugged seascape, characterized by a series of dark, jagged rocks jutting out from a turbulent ocean. The scene is set along a coastline where the powerful waves crash against these rocks, sending white foam spraying into the air, highlighting the force of the ocean.\n\nThe foreground and middle parts of the image display these rocky outcrops in rich detail, providing a sense of the rough texture of the rocks and the swirling water around them. Some of the rocks are tall and sharply pointed, while others are lower and partially submerged by the surf.\n\nTowards the background, the ocean extends to the horizon, where it meets hills or a low mountain range that fades into a misty distance under a bright sky. The sea appears very dynamic, covered with whitecaps that indicate windy conditions, giving the entire scene an atmosphere of wild natural energy.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo uses the contrasting elements of static, solid rocks against the continuous movement of the sea, emphasizing the eternal struggle between land and water. This landscape is devoid of any human presence, focusing wholly on natureâ€™s own drama and beauty.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543295","543309","545122","543306","547486","543250","543251","543243","545130","543067","543290","553775","545173","543025","543307","543060"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","ocean","struggle","whitecap","drama","sea","surf","seascape","outcrop","foam"]}
