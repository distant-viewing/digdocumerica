{"path":"549219.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural landscape featuring three deer on a grass-covered hill. These deer are standing with alert postures, perhaps cautious of their surroundings. The hill slopes gently upwards, dotted with green shrubs and small rocks, illustrating a typical grassland habitat.\n\nIn the background, the sky is overcast with heavy, gray clouds suggesting an impending storm or recent rainfall. This backdrop lends a somewhat dramatic mood to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on wildlife and the natural environment under a stormy sky, evokes a sense of tranquility mixed with the rawness of nature. The cool, subdued color palette further enhances the peaceful yet moody atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Antelope graze near the dave johnston power plant","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["553808","544114","542955","544571","545898","558368","543326","544914","545902","542963","550494","543369","546232","542959","543279","552697"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","impend","grassland","storm","rainfall","hill","habitat","wildlife","lend","subdue"]}
