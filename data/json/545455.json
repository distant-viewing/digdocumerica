{"path":"545455.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a busy highway scene set against an industrial background. The image features a multi-lane highway filled with vehicles from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s. Various types of vehicles are visible, including sedans, a Volkswagen van, and a couple of trucks, one carrying a large tank. The traffic is dense with cars heading in both directions.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene is dominated by an industrial landscape with multiple smokestacks releasing large plumes of smoke into the sky, suggesting heavy industrial activity, perhaps a steel mill or similar facility. This gives the photo an atmospheric quality, with a haze that partially obscures the industrial structures.\n\nA road sign indicating a speed limit of 60 is noticeable on the right side of the highway, reinforcing the setting as a regulated traffic zone. The overall composition effectively combines everyday transportation with an intense industrial backdrop, highlighting a contrast between motion and the static nature of the heavy industry structures in the distance.","title":"Smog obscures Birmingham's skyline.
