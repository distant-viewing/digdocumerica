{"path":"554336.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph portrays a classic, light grey Volkswagen Beetle parked on an urban street. The car's trunk is prominent in the foreground, bearing a Connecticut license plate labeled \"JK-1612.\" An emblem reading \"Volkswagen\" adorns the lower part of the trunk. The vehicle is rounded with distinct, circular tail lights and a shining metallic bumper.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a traditional black fire hydrant near the curb. Beyond the car, the street extends into a tree-lined city block, marked by a sidewalk bordered with metal fences and a series of brownstone townhouses that suggest a residential neighborhood.\n\nIn the background, two individuals—one closer to the camera, possibly playing or skipping, and another further away, walking—can be seen on the sidewalk. The scene conveys a quiet, daylit moment in a typical urban setting. The atmosphere is calm, with overcast lighting that softens the colors in the photograph.","title":"High risk parking in greenwich village, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556712","551912","546665","550796","556753","545321","542817","556707","549895","556713","551868","557882","542634","557766","547797","555448"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["sidewalk","trunk","hydrant","townhouse","shine","bumper","round","emblem","license","tail"]}
