{"path":"546115.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a disheartening environmental scene involving marine life affected by pollution. The focus is on two starfish visible against a background that appears to be heavily contaminated with oil. The oil forms swirls and patches of shiny, dark colors, interspersed with lighter, soapy-looking residues that suggest the presence of chemical dispersants or other pollutants.\n\nThe starfish are coated in a glistening sheen, indicative of oil coverage. One starfish is particularly smeared with dark oil, highlighting its rough texture and the severity of the contamination. The colors of the sea stars range from pale to beige with hints of red, suggesting that they might have once been vibrant but are now marred by the darkening effects of the oil.\n\nThe composition conveys a somber tone, emphasizing the tragic impact of environmental pollution on marine ecosystems. The image starkly contrasts the natural beauty and biodiversity of ocean life with the devastating influence of human-caused disasters. It serves as a potent visual reminder of the need for responsible environmental stewardship.","title":"The contaminated water of Mill Creek.
