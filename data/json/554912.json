{"path":"554912.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph portrays a close-up scene of two individuals engaged in the act of smoking, with one person assisting the other. On the left, a young woman with long blonde hair is seen holding a cigarette between her lips; her eyes are closed, and she appears to be inhaling. She is wearing a white dress or top paired with a blue headband. On the right, a man with dark hair and a beard is carefully lighting the cigarette he holds between her lips. The man is wearing a striped, multicolored sweater and has a ring on his left hand.\n\nThe background features a large, textured tree trunk, suggesting that the scene takes place in a wooded or park-like setting. The environment around them appears subdued and natural, with a soft focus that blurs the details of the foliage and grass, emphasizing the actions of the individuals at the forefront. The image conveys a moment of shared intimacy or companionship in a serene outdoor location.","title":"Boy and girl smoking pot during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas.
