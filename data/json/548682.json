{"path":"548682.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This underwater photograph captures a vibrant scene from a coral reef. Central to the image is a large, dome-shaped coral formation that dominates the frame, showcasing a detailed texture characterized by numerous rounded protrusions. The coral formation has a rich, dark greenish-brown color, adding a somewhat dense appearance to it.\n\nSurrounding the main coral, the seafloor is visible with patches of white sand interspersed with smaller coral outcrops, rocks, and marine flora such as seaweed and various other smaller aquatic plants, providing a textured mosaic of marine life.\n\nIn terms of fauna, several fish species enhance the dynamic of the scene. Close examination reveals a few brightly colored fish, including one with yellow stripes and a sleek, elongate body, swimming near the bottom of the scene. A smaller, darker fish can be seen swimming toward the upper right side, possibly a type of wrasse or damselfish based on its size and silhouette.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is calm and serene, accentuated by the filtered, ambient light that permeates the water, creating a diffuse illumination which softens the colors and shapes. The backdrop is a gradient of blue, likely indicating the open water, contributing to the depth and the isolated feel of this underwater landscape.","title":"About 12 feet under water at john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548678","548712","548719","548677","548679","548723","548711","548722","548676","548717","548710","548721","548681","548718","548713","548715"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","swim","fauna","reef","coral","protrusion","sha","permeate","formation","underwater"]}
