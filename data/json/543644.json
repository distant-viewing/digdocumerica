{"path":"543644.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a vast, flat landscape dominated by what appears to be a dried-up salt flat. The foreground prominently features intricate patterns of cracked soil creating natural designs, perhaps due to the evaporation of water, which has left behind salt deposits. These patterns present textured, polygonal pan-like shapes filled with darker sediment, contrasting against lighter-colored earth.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is an expanse of water reflecting the sky, and beyond this body of water, a series of structures are visible. These include a large building resembling a historic or agricultural utility structure, which is simple in design, possibly made of stone or another durable material. Nearby, more small, less distinct structures can be seen, perhaps part of a rural or industrial complex.\n\nThe background is characterized by mountainous terrain with varying shades of browns and greens, suggesting sparse vegetation. The mountains slope gently downward towards the water and buildings, underlining a sense of isolation in a vast open expanse.\n\nThe overall composition along with the soft lighting conditions conveys a serene, albeit barren, natural landscape that has been marked by human activity, though it seems minimal and somewhat remote. The photograph likely captures a moment of tranquility in an otherwise harsh environment, emphasizing both natural beauty and the rugged challenges of the location.","title":"Waste water containing radioactive materials is allowed to settle at Union Carbide uranium mill.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["548703","550397","553867","544721","545623","555865","555863","544774","555885","552902","555397","552420","544733","550598","554817","543658"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["salt","expanse","deposit","challenge","pattern","water","design","sediment","complex","utility"]}
