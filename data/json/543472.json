{"path":"543472.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a young boy, likely in his early teens, is seated on the corner of a wooden pier, looking calmly over his shoulder towards the camera. He wears a green jacket and has short, light-colored hair. Beside him, there is a white pickup truck, parked such that its back end partially juts out over the pier. The truck's tailgate is down, revealing several fish that are hanging and tethered by their tailsâ€”presumably freshly caught.\n\nThe pier itself appears well-worn, with sections of peeling white paint and visible weathering. In the foreground, one can read the faded and partially obscured lettering \"NO FISHING\" painted onto the pier's edge, which adds an ironic touch given the presence of the fished hanging from the truck.\n\nIn the background, the expanse of a calm sea stretches to the horizon under clear blue skies. Bright sunlight bathes the scene, casting shadows and highlighting textures such as the wooden planks of the pier and the smooth surface of the truck.\n\nThe composition of the image balances elements of tranquility (the sea and sky) and subtle narrative (the boy's presence and the caught fish), creating a reflective maritime scene.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["552291","551022","544303","551025","548138","544306","543220","551024","543465","546998","544203","548141","547554","543210","550776","550899"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["pier","truck","fish","boy","catch","tether","hang","teen","sea","jut"]}
