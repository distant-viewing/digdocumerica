{"path":"544428.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a barren, rugged landscape. The primary view is of dry, cracked earth which dominates the foreground with a network of intersecting tire tracks, marking where vehicles have previously traveled. The arid ground appears brittle and parched. In the background, several rounded hill formations extend beyond the plain. They have subtle striations and varying shades of brown and gray which suggest they are composed of layered sediment or sandstone. The sky above is mostly clear with a few wispy clouds, suggesting a dry, sunlit environment typical of desert regions. This scene could be indicative of off-road activity in a desert or a similarly deserted, arid location. The overall mood is desolate and remote.","title":"Volcanic dunes criss-crossed with tracks of motorcycles and dune buggies","placename":"Painted Desert (Ariz.)","location":"Painted Desert, Arizona","nn1":["545604","557417","549133","549179","555882","544401","544016","545575","549016","555885","544027","549183","545593","544178","553057","550397"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dry","desert","striation","sandstone","off","plain","crack","sunlit","sediment","tire"]}
