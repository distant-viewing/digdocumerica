{"path":"553675.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of a coastal cityscape from a high vantage point. It features a broad view of an urban landscape stretching along a coastline bordered by a large body of water, likely an ocean. The scene is partitioned into several distinct zones:\n\n1. **Foreground**: At the lower part of the image, thereâ€™s an area of rough, brown terrain that looks like a hill or mountain slope, which provides a natural frame to the urban scene.\n\n2. **Middle-ground**: Just beyond the hill, there is a lush green area with scattered trees and what seems to be a park or a golf course. Beyond this green space are residential areas with homes nestled among more patches of greenery. There are also high-rise buildings, possibly hotels or apartments, which mark the beginning of the denser urban area and line the edge of the waterfront. \n\n3. **Ocean and Beaches**: Along the coastline, there are sandy beaches visible, and the gentle blue of the ocean stretches horizontally across the image. Small white specks in the water could be boats or waves.\n\n4. **Background**: The city features a cluster of taller commercial buildings which are more densely packed. This urban area extends inland and is backed by a backdrop of towering mountains, which adds a dramatic contour to the horizon. The entire scene is set under a sky partially filled with clouds that cast shadows over parts of the city and the surrounding water.\n\nThe image is vibrant with contrast between the natural landscape and the developed city, depicting a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements typical of coastal cities. The picture likely aims to showcase the beauty and expansiveness of this location, emphasizing its attractiveness as a place to live or visit.","title":"Honolulu waterfront seen from the top of Diamond Head, the extinct volcano which is the island's best-known landmark.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["552171","553677","553680","553672","551587","552252","544638","553778","553748","553678","552133","555756","549480","553790","552231","553679"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["city","coastline","ocean","beginning","golf","expansiveness","hotel","course","speck","mountain"]}
