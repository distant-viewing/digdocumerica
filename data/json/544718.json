{"path":"544718.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image depicts a close-up view of ocean waves. The waves, captured in various stages of motion, display a mixture of colors ranging from deep blues to murky greens. The water's surface is dynamic and textured, showing white foam crests and darker, smooth troughs between the waves. The photograph appears to show the waves under bright, natural daylight, which highlights the glistening surfaces of the water. There is no shore visible in the photograph, and the image focuses solely on the patterns and rhythms of the seawater. The overall mood conveyed is one of natural power and tranquility.","title":"\"Choppy waters\"","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["543138","555322","557814","547609","543019","548704","555803","543253","547475","554076","550817","543308","553180","543251","555713","543092"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["wave","trough","rhythm","crest","glisten","foam","mixture","stage","daylight","surface"]}
