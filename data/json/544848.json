{"path":"544848.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This is a scenic photograph depicting a wild mountain landscape. In the foreground, numerous fallen trees lie scattered amidst dense shrubbery and grass, indicating possibly an area that has suffered from a natural disturbance like strong winds or heavy snowfall that caused trees to fall. Among these fallen trees, vibrant wildflowers in yellows and whites are visible, adding a burst of color to the lush greenery that dominates the area.\n\nIn the midground, the landscape rises into a sloped mountain, covered with patches of snow and more sparse vegetation. This part of the mountain also shows signs of similar disturbances with several fallen or dead trees standing out against the live forest.\n\nThe background features the higher peaks of the mountain range. These peaks are rugged, with sharp edges, and are mostly barren or have only patchy vegetation. The sky above is clear and bright blue with a few fluffy, white clouds, which emphasizes the overall serenity and untouched nature of the scene. On the uppermost parts of the mountain, small patches of snow are visible, suggesting that the image was taken during a time of year when the snow has mostly melted but remnants still linger.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its rich detailing of natural elements and the gradient from a disturbed, vibrant foreground to a barren, tranquil background, portrays a sense of natural resilience and the diverse beauty of a mountain ecosystem.","title":"\"Logging scars\"","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544852","544881","550439","543582","543569","554531","544936","550478","555666","555657","545714","548025","550441","555105","555660","543827"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","snow","fall","disturbance","peak","linger","melt","snowfall","burst","serenity"]}
