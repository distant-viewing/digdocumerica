{"path":"557540.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an up-close view of a striking succulent plant, likely a species of Echeveria. The succulent has densely packed, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are grayish-purple with a velvety texture, which suggests they might be covered in a fine layer of hairs or farina.\n\nAt the center of the image, there is a long, slender stalk emerging from the rosette, bearing a cluster of vibrant pink flowers. These flowers are bell-shaped with extended, slightly curling petals, and they are arrayed around the stalk in a tiered fashion, giving the plant a very ornate appearance. The flowers at the top appear fresher, while those lower down the stalk seem to be a bit wilted or older, indicating the progression of the blooming period.\n\nThe background of the photograph is soft and blurry, predominantly showing shades of dark blue and black, which contrasts sharply with the detailed and brightly lit subject in the foreground. This contrast helps the succulent and its delicate pink blooms to stand out vividly, emphasizing their intricate details and the velvety texture of the leaves. The lighting in the image suggests that it might be captured during a time of day with directional light, possibly late afternoon or early morning, which casts gentle shadows and highlights the contours of the plant's structure.","title":"Plantlife in the Malibu canyon area of the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.  The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county, but are threatened by development.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure.
