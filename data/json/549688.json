{"path":"549688.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph shows a busy and expansive automobile shipping yard. Multiple levels of rail car racks are loaded with a variety of new cars, predominantly from the 1960s or 1970s. Each rail car rack contains two levels and is densely packed with cars of various designs and colors, such as yellows, reds, whites, and blues. The focus point of the picture is a line of cars situated on a diagonally positioned multi-tiered railroad car platform labeled with \"Union Pacific\" indicating the involvement of the Union Pacific Railroad company in transporting these vehicles.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediately visible rail platforms, the area is filled with rows upon rows of parked cars, tightly packed in an organized layout, covering a vast area. The cars in the lot appear to be similarly styled, suggesting they are also new and possibly waiting for distribution or shipment.\n\nThis scene gives a clear view of the logistics involved in the automotive industry, specifically in the distribution and transportation sector, during the mid-20th century. The setting is likely an industrial area, dedicated to such operations, with no significant buildings, landmarks, or natural features visible in the background. Itâ€™s a bright day, and the entire scene is well-lit, enhancing the vivid colors of the vehicles.","title":"Fob Detroit--New cars are loaded onto railroad cars at Lasher and I-75","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549704","546848","542633","549696","547469","542635","546900","542639","547265","547480","547327","547686","553022","555748","547140","551007"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","rail","rack","distribution","platform","level","sector","row","logistic","shipping"]}
