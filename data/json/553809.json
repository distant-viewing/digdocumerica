{"path":"553809.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the low light conditions. The foreground features a rustic stone wall composed of various large, rounded stones. Among these stones, dried grass and thin plant stalks are seen, suggesting an autumn or winter season due to their withered state.\n\nBeyond the stone wall, an expansive field stretches out, appearing mostly flat with a slight roll to its terrain. The field is covered in a carpet of grass, interrupted only by the occasional tree. Sparse, leafless trees can be seen scattered across the landscape, accentuating the season and providing a stark contrast to the sky.\n\nIn the middle distance, there are several traditional structures visible, possibly farm buildings, which include a barn and what could be a residence. These buildings are simple in architecture with dark-colored roofs, possibly wooden or shingle.\n\nThe sky above the scene is overcast, with a dark blue hue that further hints at the low-light conditions of early morning or late evening. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and quiet, typical of a rural setting, and evokes a sense of solitude and tranquility.","title":"Farm near Narragansett, (from the sites exhibition.
