{"path":"549408.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene of people engaging in leisure activities on a sailboat, distinguished by its white hull and name \"STINKER TOO AYC.\" The boat is equipped with large, filled sails indicating a moderate breeze; it's cruising through calm water, symbolized by mild ripples surrounding it.\n\nThe image prominently features six individuals. At the stern, a man in sunglasses and a dark shirt stands overseeing the scene, potentially steering the boat. In front of him, five younger individuals, with two seated and three standing, engage actively. They appear relaxed and are likely enjoying a social gathering or a leisurely sail. These individuals are dressed casually, all in swimsuits, enhancing the recreational and summery feel of the setting. Their attention seems partly focused on one person who is swimming in the water, trailing the boat. This swimmer, clearly enjoying the moment, holds onto a line that links them to the vessel, suggesting an activity like assisted swimming or casual towing.\n\nThe background and atmospheric conditions indicate a clear, somewhat hazy day with visibility slightly obscured by distance or mist. Other sailboats can be faintly seen in the far distance, contributing to the sense of a popular or communal boating area possibly near a coast or in a large lake environment. The general ambiance is one of relaxed, summer leisure - a snapshot capturing joy and tranquility on the water.","title":"Chesapeake Bay sailing race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548495","548502","547465","549415","548491","549397","548511","548513","549386","544021","549410","547458","549412","543944","549939","548508"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","boat","swimmer","leisure","swimsuit","individual","boating","coast","swimming"]}
