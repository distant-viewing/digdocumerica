{"path":"544378.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and atmospheric scene featuring a large crane against a mountainous backdrop during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The crane, dominant in the frame, is silhouetted and backlit by a vivid sky with an intense blend of purple, pink, and blue hues. The sky is partly cloudy, contributing to the diffusion of light and color. There are visible beams of sunlight filtering through the clouds, enhancing the ethereal quality of the scene.\n\nThe crane itself features a long, extended arm, and its structure is highlighted by a few lights turned on within the cabin and along its arm, providing small points of brightness against the darker silhouette. There is no visible activity around the crane, suggesting either a pause in work or an abandonment of the site.\n\nThe foreground is rough and uneven, likely a construction or excavation site, as suggested by scattered debris and irregular terrain. The surrounding mountains have sharp, angular lines and are also silhouetted against the sky, contributing to the mood of isolation and stillness.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph, with its interplay of light, color, and industrial elements, set against a natural landscape, creates a stark but beautiful scene that captures a moment of tranquility amidst the typically bustling energy of a construction site.","title":"Peabody coal company in Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["553027","544109","544127","550907","550874","544131","545655","544374","547223","547615","545648","554545","545646","547102","555269","544157"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","site","silhouet","diffusion","arm","lights","backlit","construction","pause","sunrise"]}
