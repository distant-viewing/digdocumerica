{"path":"547530.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an environmental or industrial clean-up process taking place on a sandy beach. There are three individuals wearing bright yellow protective suits with darker elbow patches and white boots. They are equipped with work gloves, and two of them are using shovels to deal with a mound of dark, potentially contaminated material. This mound runs roughly down the center of the image, drawing the eye along its path.\n\nIn the background, positioned centrally, is a yellow bulldozer with a large front bucket. The bulldozer is facing towards the camera. The individual operating the bulldozer is also dressed in a similar yellow suit, and is contained within the cabin, which is adorned with black protective grills over its windows.\n\nThe beach itself appears expansive, with no significant vegetation visible; the ground is sandy with patches of darker soil or debris evident. In the far background, there seem to be parked cars suggesting perhaps a public or accessible area. The sky is clear, implying it may be a sunny day, which contrasts with the labor-intensive activity shown.\n\nThe scene suggests a focused, possibly urgent environmental remediation effort, likely dealing with some form of pollution or spillage on the beach. The protective gear worn by the individuals indicates the potential hazard of the material being handled.","title":"Cleaning-up after oil spill from a tanker in Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545076","547151","547117","545662","542655","545657","547115","552951","547498","547926","547186","547167","548641","546239","544460","545669"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["bulldozer","deal","beach","mound","suit","hazard","contaminate","elbow","grill","darker"]}
