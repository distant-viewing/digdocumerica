{"path":"546874.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene, filled with a variety of people and activities, conveying a sense of summer enjoyment and communal leisure. The image shows a sandy beach crowded with people of varying ages engaged in different activities.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of people is gathered on colorful blankets on the sand. This group appears relaxed and engaged in conversation. Among them, some are lying down sunbathing, while others sit and talk. There are both adults and children in this group. A prominent figure is a woman in a red swimsuit sitting up and conversing with others around her. Another woman to the right is lying on her stomach, facing the camera.\n\nIn the background, the beach extends to a body of calm water where more people are swimming. Children and adults are visible in the water; some are standing and talking, while others are swimming or playing. The beach scene is dense with activity but does not appear chaotic; rather, it exudes a sense of busy relaxation.\n\nA lifeguard stand can be seen on the left side of the image, but no lifeguard is visible in the photograph. The body of water and overcast sky suggest it might be a slightly cloudy day, yet the atmosphere is warm and pleasant for a day at the beach.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its clustering of individuals, both on the sand and in the water, portrays a typical, bustling summer day at a public beach where families and friends gather to enjoy the outdoors.","title":"Sunning, splashing, swimming at Sandy Point state park","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546942","550243","547628","550931","547503","547482","547491","546794","546928","555923","550919","553685","548541","550932","557772","550936"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","talk","swim","other","summer","group","gather","sand","people","adult"]}
