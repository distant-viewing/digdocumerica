{"path":"551712.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and sunlit outdoor setting, featuring multiple people engaged in various activities. The scene takes place on a broad stone staircase surrounded by lush green trees and foliage, indicative of a park-like environment, possibly during the spring or summer months due to the abundance of greenery.\n\nIn the foreground, two women are seen descending the stairs. The woman on the left is pushing a traditional-style baby stroller that holds a young child. She has dark hair, sunglasses, and wears a patterned blouse. Next to her, another woman with blonde hair is dressed in a bright red outfit accessorized with a necklace, suggesting a casual yet stylish appearance for a day out.\n\nOn the right side of the staircase, three children are seen walking down independently. The child furthest up the stairs wears a blue jacket and carries a small bag, looking cautiously at the steps. The child in the middle, wearing a red jacket, seems more focused and confident in stride. The third child, closest to the camera, also in a red jacket, displays a playful mode of descent, possibly running or jumping down the steps.\n\nThe composition of the photograph places these individuals at the center, with the natural environment and the stairs framing their activities. The interaction between the characters, combined with the tranquil surroundings, creates a dynamic yet peaceful snapshot of a day out in a park-like setting, where nature and human activity coexist harmoniously.","title":"Stairway to Carl Schurz Park, between East End Avenue and the East River in Manhattan's Upper East Side.
