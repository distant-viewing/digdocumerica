{"path":"547566.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene featuring two men in separate boats on what appears to be a large body of water, possibly the ocean, given the deep blue hues and waves visible in the background. The image is tinted with deep blues and shadows contribute to a somewhat moody atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, the more prominent figure is a man facing forward towards the front of the boat. He is wearing a cap, a heavy jacket, and holds a cigarette in his mouth, adding a rugged character to his appearance. His attention is directed towards operating or holding onto something not fully visible, perhaps a part of the boat or a fishing tool.\n\nBehind him, the scene extends to another boat where a second man stands, dressed in a yellow jacket, suggesting protective or waterproof gear, appropriate for marine conditions. He appears to be steadying himself against the motion of the water, with his posture suggesting movement and activity, likely managing the boat or preparing for a task.\n\nThe background is composed primarily of water and sky, the horizon barely distinguishable under overcast or fading light conditions, adding to the ambiance of an early morning or late evening maritime activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts active engagement in boating or fishing, underscored by a sense of isolation on the water, spotlighting the men's relationship with the marine environment in a visually captivating and emotively rich setting.","title":"Members of the sakonnet river fishing fleet","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554196","547559","547557","548164","547554","547549","546758","546939","554200","546980","547564","543465","548304","547558","548738","546976"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","steady","spotlight","man","jacket","relationship","cigarette","maritime","mouth"]}
