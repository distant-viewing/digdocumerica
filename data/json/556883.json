{"path":"556883.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of labor and machinery on a railway track during daylight. Two men are seen working diligently, engaged in the maintenance or construction of the railway. The man in the foreground is bending over the tracks, wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, focusing on the task at hand. Meanwhile, another worker, partially visible and facing away from the camera, operates a large, orange machine mounted on the railroad itself, under a protective canopy.\n\nThe machine appears robust and industrial, outfitted with various gears and levers, used for laying or fixing the railway tracks. Several black railway ties are laid out beside the track on the gravel bed, ready to be installed. The environment is open and wide, featuring a clear sky and flat terrain sparsely vegetated, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. In the distance, more machinery and possibly other workers can be seen continuing the track work, creating a sense of ongoing activity and progress. The scene is indicative of physical labor and the essential maintenance needed to keep railway infrastructure in operation.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, with a machine that drives spikes into the railroad ties to hold the new quarter-mile-long sections of rail. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556881","556871","556862","556901","556899","556869","556874","556875","556878","556897","556895","556890","556872","556012","556884","556861"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","track","machine","labor","worker","maintenance","lever","machinery","progress","railroad"]}
