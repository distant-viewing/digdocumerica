{"path":"553416.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and frothy river rapid, surrounded by nature. The forceful waters appear creamy white and gray, indicating strong currents and turbulence, contributing to the wild and untamed feeling of the scene. Black and dark gray rocks are sporadically visible, peeking through the rushing water, suggesting a rocky riverbed beneath.\n\nThe background is densely populated with various types of trees, predominantly conifers, hinting at a forested or wilderness area, likely in a temperate climate zone. The foliage is lush green, indicating it might be late spring or summer.\n\nOn the edges of the frame, some leaves are visible hanging into the view, slightly out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention more towards the center where the water is most intense. The overall lighting is natural and somewhat overcast, enhancing the colors of the natural landscape and giving the water a slightly silvery sheen.\n\nOverall, the photograph embodies a sense of isolation and the raw power of nature. The composition is straightforward yet effective, pulling the viewer's eye directly to the tumultuous water, while the surroundings imply solitude and the untouched beauty of an outdoor setting.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River.
