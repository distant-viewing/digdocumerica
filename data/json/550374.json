{"path":"550374.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of a swirling, marbled pattern, reminiscent of liquid or semi-solid materials mixing together. The dominant colors in this photograph are shades of deep purple and black, intertwined with striking white streaks and a few isolated patches of bright white. The pattern appears dynamic and organic, suggesting movement as if the materials are currently flowing or were photographed while still in motion.\n\nThe shapes formed by the intertwining materials are irregular and fluid, creating a series of swirls, loops, and waves across the composition. There are no distinct objects or figures, just the continuous interplay of colors and textures that convey depth and complexity. The overall effect is quite abstract and might be associated with natural phenomena like the mixing of water and oil, or something more artistic like ink or paint flowing on a surface. The background is uniformly filled with these patterns, suggesting the image is likely a close-up shot where the intricate details of the materials' interaction are emphasized. The lack of any clear boundaries or frames within the composition enhances the image's all-encompassing, immersive quality.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the St. Croix River at Calais, a few miles below the Georgia Pacific paper mill.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550373","550375","552239","550372","555226","557626","555177","545850","555804","544716","555213","555155","557605","555714","550740","550606"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["material","pattern","loop","phenomenon","swirl","streak","liquid","oil","complexity","boundary"]}
