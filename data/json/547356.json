{"path":"547356.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and picturesque sky scene likely during sunset or sunrise. Dark, heavy clouds dominate the upper part of the image, filling most of the frame with varying shades of blue and gray. A significant portion of the clouds opens up near the center, where intense, bright sunlight bursts through, creating striking rays of light that radiate outward in a classical \"crepuscular\" pattern.\n\nThese sunrays illuminate parts of the clouds and filter downwards, spotlighting areas below. The illuminated areas in the cloud convey a mix of gold and warm tones, contrasting starkly with the darker regions of the sky. \n\nBelow the sky, the horizon line is visible, marked by a silhouette of a tree-covered landscape. The trees and terrain are dark and only just discernible against the sky, emphasizing their silhouette. The scene conveys a serene yet powerful mood, typical of moments when nature dramatically displays its elements. The vantage point and composition suggest that the photograph was taken looking out over a vast, open landscape, enhancing the grandeur and expansiveness of the sky above.","title":"Sun rays through storm clouds over Grafton, in the farmlands west of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553993","545375","552896","547352","544944","550390","552483","553992","542680","554396","557575","543712","557591","550429","553857","547719"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cloud","spotlight","ray","expansiveness","burst","silhouette","radiate","gold","sunrise","open"]}
