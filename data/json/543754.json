{"path":"543754.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a mining operation nestled within a mountainous terrain covered in dense forests. The central part of the image shows a large excavation site with reddish-brown earth and various layers of rock strata visible, indicating open-pit mining or quarrying activities. Surrounding the mine, a winding road snakes through the forested landscape, suggesting access routes for vehicles.\n\nTo the left of the photo runs a river or stream, bordered by trees and bushes, reflecting the serenity and undisturbed nature just beside the harshly transformed mining area. The juxtaposition of the untouched river and tree-covered mountains against the stark, dug-out mine provides a visual contrast between natural and altered landscapes.\n\nEquipment and construction materials, possibly including piles of extracted earth or rocks, can be seen scattered around the site, which adds to the industrial feel of the place. The overall scene sits in a secluded environment, emphasizing the impact of human industrial activities on natural settings.","title":"Gold strip mine was closed down because the erosion of the hillside was silting the San Miguel River.","placename":"Norwood (Colo.)","location":"Norwood, Colorado","nn1":["544785","543758","544789","549174","550572","543857","549172","550568","543674","549167","549242","543729","552177","549173","544064","555621"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","mine","stratum","transform","earth","extract","site","pit","dig","serenity"]}
