{"path":"555987.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a daytime scene outside the Albuquerque Amtrak station. The composition primarily features an elderly man with a slim build, walking from right to left across the frame. He is smartly dressed, wearing a crisp white shirt under a dark vest, dark trousers, and dark polished shoes. He sports a brimmed hat and sunglasses. In his right hand, he carries a briefcase, indicating he might be traveling or coming from a business engagement.\n\nThe station building itself has a distinct Southwestern architectural style, characterized by its stucco walls and arched doorway and windows. Above the entrance, the name \"ALBUQUERQUE\" is prominently engraved directly into the facade. Just above this text, there is a white rectangular sign with the Amtrak logo in blue and red, underscoring the building's identity as a railway station.\n\nThe sky appears clear, suggesting a sunny day, casting sharp shadows on the ground that add depth to the scene. The overall mood conveyed is one of motion and transience, typical of a transportation hub. The image captures both a sense of individual journey and the broader context of travel infrastructure in the American Southwest.","title":"Albuquerque, New Mexico, train station is one of the stops the southwest limited makes on its run from Los Angeles, California to Chicago.
