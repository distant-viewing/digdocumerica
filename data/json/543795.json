{"path":"543795.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a man working on machinery outdoors. The man appears to be middle-aged and is wearing eyeglasses, a light gray t-shirt, and dark pants. He is crouching on his right foot while steadying himself with his left foot on a railing, reaching out to manipulate a valve or handle on a large, cylindrical industrial mechanism. This device is positioned atop what appears to be a platform made up of metal bars.\n\nThe background is bright and slightly overexposed, indicating it could be a sunny day. Below the platform, there is an interesting visual elementâ€”foamy water that seems to be effervescing vigorously, capturing light and creating a textured appearance at the bottom of the image. The foreground is dominated by this bubbly, chaotic water, contrasting sharply with the orderly mechanical scene above. \n\nThe setting suggests a water treatment facility or similar industrial operation where machinery is used to process or manage liquid substances under pressure. The composition of the photograph, with its clear focus on the worker and the machinery, framed against the effervescence below, emphasizes the industrial activity and the role of human oversight in this process.","title":"At intake sewage plant, high speed pump mixes sewage with activated sludge.
