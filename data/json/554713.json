{"path":"554713.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph presents a serene autumn landscape dominated by a wide expanse of nature. It captures a sprawling view of a wetland area, possibly a marsh or shallow lake, interspersed with patches of water and grassy, possibly boggy areas. The foreground shows part of the water body, which reflects the clear blue sky above.\n\nSurrounding the wetland are dense forests boasting a rich palette of fall colors, with trees in shades of red, orange, gold, and green. The forests extend into the background, covering rolling hills and two noticeable, rounded mountain peaks that frame the scene. These peaks emphasize the vastness and the secluded beauty of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, taken from an elevated perspective, suggests it might be captured from a hilltop or a high vantage point overlooking the valley. The photograph epitomizes the vibrant foliage season, typically observed in regions like New England, and reflects a peaceful, natural environment with no visible signs of human disturbance. The lighting and clear skies suggest it is taken during daytime with good weather conditions, enhancing the vividness of the autumn colors.","title":"Typical meandering inlet to a lake with adjoining balsam flats and marsh-bog","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554756","554715","554648","554712","554761","554649","554714","554738","557127","554758","554757","552599","554653","554737","557159","554651"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","autumn","peak","boast","hilltop","marsh","gold","forest","disturbance","vividness"]}
