{"path":"552515.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene rural scene. In the foreground is a large field of tall, wild grass and weeds, showing signs of a natural setting under an overcast sky. Dominating the right side of the composition is a dilapidated barn or farm structure. This building features desaturated, weathered wood panels and a rusty metal roof; parts of its structure appear to be caving in, highlighting its state of disrepair. \n\nTo the left, the scene includes several large trees with lush foliage, providing a stark contrast to the open field. The trees' leaves are dense and dark, suggesting they are healthy and possibly indicative of a humid or moist environment. \n\nBeyond the immediate field and structure, the landscape opens up into a flat expanse that appears to be farmland, hinting at a rural agricultural community. The sky above is moody, with various shades of blue and grey, suggesting an impending storm or a recently passed one. Shadows and light patches indicate that the photograph was taken during a time when sunlight was filtering through cloud cover. The overall mood is quiet and contemplative, emphasizing themes of nature, decay, and the passage of time in a rural setting.","title":"Just before rain--near Murphysboro","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["555577","554782","555612","554561","556962","547305","555537","555571","552462","552091","555627","552541","558101","557183","557013","555609"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["field","weed","farmland","storm","time","barn","disrepair","passage","cover","panel"]}
