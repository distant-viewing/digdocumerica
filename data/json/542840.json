{"path":"542840.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive view of a severely deforested landscape, likely the aftermath of large-scale logging activities. The terrain is rugged and crisscrossed with numerous dirt tracks or roads that have been etched into the hillside, suggesting heavy machinery movement. The topography consists of hilly and mountainous areas, with the ground predominantly bare or covered in leftover debris from logging operations. \n\nOn the left side, you can observe a patch of forest that remains standing but appears to be thinning, possibly indicating an area not yet logged or selectively cut. In contrast, the rest of the landscape is almost devoid of standing trees, featuring just stumps and fallen timber.\n\nIn the background, the landscape continues with similar patterns of deforestation, and there's an indication of a water body, possibly a river, visible in the far right corner. The horizon is lined with more dense forestation, which perhaps outlines the boundary of the logged area. The overall scene is a stark portrayal of the impact of industrial logging activities on natural forest lands.","title":"\"Clear cutting\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555221","550354","542828","542820","555104","542865","555150","542833","545143","555094","542827","555208","545138","555136","542834","542826"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["logging","forestation","deforestation","indication","stump","forest","timber","portrayal","topography","aftermath"]}
