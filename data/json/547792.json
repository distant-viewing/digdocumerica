{"path":"547792.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic scene centered around a small, single-story house with a brick exterior. The house features a large window boarded partially with plywood, and there is an electric meter attached to the wall near the window. Bushes with clusters of blooming purple hydrangeas are growing lushly in front of the house, adding a vibrant touch of color to the scene.\n\nTo the right side of the house, there is a modest wooden porch with slightly weathered steps leading up to it. A mature man is shown sitting on a yellow plastic chair on the porch, engaging in an activity that involves him handling some objects on a small table in front of him, possibly related to food preparation or some kind of handiwork. He appears absorbed in his task, wearing a short-sleeve shirt and pants.\n\nThe house and its porch are surrounded by a grassy yard, with a visible garden hose coiled on the ground nearby, suggesting regular maintenance or gardening activities. The background features dense greenery and trees, consistent with a somewhat rural or suburban setting. The overcast sky suggests it might be a cloudy day, casting diffuse natural light across the scene, which helps in highlighting the tranquility of the environment. The overall mood of the photograph is serene and depicts a moment of everyday life.","title":"Home on Ethel Street, a Black neighborhood in Longview","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546992","551091","556488","556489","550704","557746","555581","548295","555615","558110","554697","557671","557638","546441","545041","555632"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","porch","coil","meter","gardening","front","hose","absorb","kind","preparation"]}
