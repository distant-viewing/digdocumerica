{"path":"551443.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a bustling urban scene dominated by rows of parked bicycles in the foreground. The bicycles are densely packed, secured on metal racks. The image gives a sense of active urban transport, with a focus on cycling.\n\nThe background shows a street scene typical of a mid to late-20th-century city, with cars and pedestrians. There are several vintage vehicles, indicating an older timeline, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s. The cars are parked along the side of the street, with one green car passing by the parked bicycles.\n\nBuildings line the opposite side of the street, appearing to be commercial properties with large windows and storefronts. People are walking on the sidewalk, adding to the dynamic and lively urban atmosphere.\n\nThe setting appears to be a downtown area of a city, reflecting a time when cycling was a popular mode of transportation in urban environments. The lighting suggests it is daytime with clear weather, enhancing visibility throughout the scene.","title":"Bicycle parking","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551456","554312","556708","548388","551645","551464","551849","551913","549662","546743","556709","556734","551504","551478","555782","556718"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bicycle","street","car","mode","rack","storefront","city","downtown","mid","secure"]}
