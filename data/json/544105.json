{"path":"544105.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting with a focus on a middle-aged man in the foreground. The man is smiling and wearing a white hard hat with a red logo, dark sunglasses, and a green work uniform. He also has a pen and a slide rule in his shirt pocket, suggesting he may be an engineer or manager. His attire and accessories indicate safety and professionalism within an industrial environment.\n\nIn the background, there are large industrial structures, including two tall chimneys emitting smoke or steam. The chimneys are part of a complex facility with multiple levels and sections connected by various pipelines and metal frameworks. There's extensive metal scaffolding and several buildings with corrugated surfaces, possibly for manufacturing or power generation. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a gloomy and robust industrial feel. The overall composition juxtaposes the human element with the massive scale and somewhat severe nature of industrial operations.","title":"Four corners power plant","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553025","549632","544171","556391","544822","557388","556320","544835","542989","543648","547163","545442","544153","557386","544001","546036"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["chimney","rule","professionalism","pipeline","engineer","slide","accessory","generation","scaffolding","pocket"]}
