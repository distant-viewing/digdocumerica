{"path":"548234.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene inside a bar or pub. Three older men are prominently featured in the foreground, seated at the bar. They are engaged in what appears to be a cheerful conversation, enjoying each other's company. The man on the left is smiling broadly and wearing a white cap with a plaid, button-up shirt. The man in the middle is wearing a darker cap and a dark jacket, and he has a more serious expression. The man on the right, also wearing a dark cap and jacket, is holding a small glass, possibly containing a drink, and has a slight smile.\n\nThe background is cluttered with various items typical of a bar setting. You can see shelves stocked with boxes and other merchandise behind the bar. Drakes cakes and other snacks are also visible, adding to the casual, local pub atmosphere. \n\nThe overall mood of the image is convivial and relaxed. The scene captures a moment of leisure and social interaction among friends in a familiar and comforting setting. The lighting is somewhat dim with a focus on the men and the bar area, highlighting the intimate and cozy feel of the place.","title":"Poole's drugstore in rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["547796","547794","547376","551279","553518","548233","550323","551342","558262","556613","558313","557152","545984","558264","554866","554278"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["bar","cap","man","smile","merchandise","stock","snack","jacket","friend","shelf"]}
