{"path":"543188.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating coastal landscape dominated by a vivid patchwork of greenery and sand. Focusing on the foreground, we see low-lying red and green succulent plants densely covering patches of sandy ground. The plants' bright colors create a stunning contrast against the sandy beige tones. This colorful vegetation spreads throughout the image, filling the majority of the scene.\n\nIn the background, through a light mist or fog, appears a line of trees and shrubs sketched faintly against a murky sky. These trees appear windblown, suggesting a harsh, windy coastal environment. The overall mood is serene yet dramatic because of the natural fog that blurs and softens the distant views.\n\nThe setting suggests a coastal dune environment, possibly taken during early morning when mist is still visible. The image could relate to themes of environmental conservation, the beauty of natural landscapes, or the specific flora of coastal regions.","title":"California--Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["543192","543196","548739","543389","543401","543301","547592","543193","547015","552434","553994","543399","542917","543134","548672","553805"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["mist","dune","patchwork","majority","plant","conservation","fog","flora","sand","red"]}
