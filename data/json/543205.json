{"path":"543205.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and lush close-up of a variety of succulent plants and wildflowers. The image is filled with thick clusters of green succulent leaves, some of which have red-tinted edges, creating a rich tapestry of color and texture. Interspersed among the succulents are blossoms in shades of orange, yellow, and a striking pink. The orange flowers appear to be small and clustered, resembling a type of sedum or similar flowering succulent. The yellow flowers are bright and open, contrasting sharply with the predominant green. A prominent pink flower, possibly a type of ice plant blossom, adds a soft but vivid splash of color. The background is softly blurred, emphasizing the sharpness and detail of the plants in the foreground. The overall impression is a dense, healthy growth of flora, thriving in what appears to be a sunny natural habitat.","title":"Wild flowers abound at Shell Beach Point.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543201","557540","553074","542970","545718","555024","545722","544890","553366","554595","544875","544934","543196","555042","550460","545727"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["blossom","flower","plant","sharpness","type","tapestry","pink","ice","close","wildflower"]}
