{"path":"552558.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene snowy landscape, predominantly featuring a group of bison grazing. The scene is set with a gentle, expansive snow cover across the ground, punctuated by bits of dry vegetation sticking out of the snow. The bison appear in the foreground alongside the midground, offering a natural focal point. Their dark figures contrast starkly against the bright white snow, enhancing their visibility.\n\nIn the background, a mountain partially shrouded by mist or light snowfall looms, its slopes gently rising and dotted with sparse vegetation or rocks, barely visible through the snowy covering. The sky is overcast with gray clouds, contributing to a muted, tranquil atmosphere typical of a snowy day, where sounds are muffled and the air is crisp.\n\nThe image exudes a sense of peacefulness and the stark beauty of nature during winter, showcasing the resilience of wildlife amidst harsh conditions. The overall composition skillfully balances the grandeur of the mountainous backdrop with the intimate activity of the bison in their natural habitat.\n","title":"Sheep and cattle ranching is the chief occupation of the Piceance Basin. The large ranches are based on private lands in the valley bottoms. Surrounding Bureau of Land Management holdings are leased for grazing.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552559","546091","546123","546099","552557","546095","550380","552697","544901","546129","557192","557194","550494","543732","550384","543755"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["snow","sound","grazing","snowfall","covering","peacefulness","resilience","grandeur","midground","habitat"]}
