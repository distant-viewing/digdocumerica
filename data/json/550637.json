{"path":"550637.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial or high-altitude view of a glacial landscape. The predominant texture in the image is rough and rippled, indicative of a glacier's surface, filled with deep crevasses and rolls that suggest slow, powerful movement over time. The color is mostly a dark bluish-gray mingled with hints of white, typical of glacier ice and snow in varying shades and stages of compactness.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the glacier curves out of view, revealing a sense of vastness and the larger scale of the icy terrain. The lower left corner displays a shadowy area that could either be a body of water hemmed in by the glacier or a deep crevasse, adding a dramatic contrast to the textured ice surface.\n\nThere is a noticeable absence of flora, fauna, or human elements, underscoring the inhospitable and remote nature of such environments. The overall composition and the patterns observed in the photograph emphasize the rugged beauty and monumental scale of the glacier, highlighting the natural sculpting processes of the Earth's colder climates.","title":"Worthington Glacier crevasses.
