{"path":"556474.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and cozy indoor scene featuring a man and a woman in a living room setting. The man, seated to the right, holds an acoustic guitar and is presumably playing it, gazing downwards at the instrument with expression of concentration. He wears glasses, a short-sleeved shirt, and pants. The woman, seated to the left on a floral patterned couch, appears relaxed and is listening intently to the music, with a slight smile on her face. She wears a short-sleeved, dark striped shirt and dark pants.\n\nBoth individuals are seated against a backdrop that includes patterned drapes and a partial view of a brick wall to the right. The muted lighting of the room suggests an evening setting, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. On the couch rests a decorative plush doll, and in front of the couch is a small coffee table with multiple dishes on it, suggesting they might have been having a meal or snacks during this musical session.\n\nThe photograph portrays a warm, personal moment, with a focus on leisure, music, and companionship in a home environment.","title":"Hershal and mai Shrewsbury live just outside of a coalmining area near Beckley, West Virginia.
