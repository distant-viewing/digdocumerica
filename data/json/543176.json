{"path":"543176.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures three young individuals, possibly scouts, engaged in an outdoor activity. They are each holding onto the corners of a dark cloth, perhaps preparing to spread it out or gather something within it. The scenario suggests a team activity possibly related to an environmental or cleanup exercise.\n\nThe youths are dressed in casual outdoor clothing typical of scouting or camping activities: long pants, sneakers, and jackets with visible patches and emblems that signify some form of group identity or achievement. The setting is a grassy area beside a busy roadway, lined with tall trees in the background, hinting at a suburban or semi-rural locale.\n\nIn the background, a man observes the group. He wears a cap and casual attire, standing at ease, hands in pockets, possibly supervising or instructing the youngsters. The road next to them features cars from mid-20th-century America—evidenced by their vintage designs—driving along, blurred slightly by movement.\n\nOverall, this image portrays a moment of youth engagement in environmental or community service, under guidance, in a setting that blends natural beauty with the presence of modern transportation infrastructure.","title":"Keep america beautiful day.
