{"path":"557025.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural setting enveloped in mist, depicting a landscape scene with several structures and natural elements. The foreground features dense green vegetation, which appears to be somewhat wild or unkempt, including shrubs and tall grasses. Behind this layer of foliage, slightly elevated, are multiple buildings scattered across the scene. They appear to be residential and possibly some farm-related structures, with features typical of rural homes like wood siding and composition shingle roofs.\n\nOne prominent house in the middle-right of the image is of a darker hue, likely brown or dark red, with a distinct rectangular shape and a visible chimney. Other smaller buildings and sheds can also be seen, signifying a residential area with well-utilized outdoor spaces, possibly for small-scale farming or storage.\n\nThe background extends into an expansive field or meadow, which gradually blends into a treeline obscured by fog, adding a mystic quality to the landscape. The sky is overcast, and the overall lighting is soft and muted, typical of an early morning or late afternoon in a humid, temperate climate. \n\nThe atmosphere is quiet and peaceful, evoking a sense of solitude and closeness to nature. Elements like utility lines crossing the top portion of the image insert a trace of modern human presence into this idyllic rural tableau.","title":"Typical year-round dwellings of berry pickers who live along highway #305 on Bainbridge island.
