{"path":"545200.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a strikingly picturesque and serene natural landscape. The foreground shows a large, gently sloping sand dune with deep ripples created by wind patterns. The textures on the dune appear soft yet well-defined, suggesting a fine, dry sand. The dune occupies the left and part of the central portion of the image.\n\nTo the right and in the background, there is a calm body of water reflecting the tranquil sky above. The lake runs parallel to the dune and extends into the distance where it meets more sand dunes that rise and fall gracefully. These further dunes on the opposite shore blend into a soft blue and purple sky.\n\nAbove, the sky is adorned with a low sun, nearing sunset, evident from the warm hues and soft lighting conditions. The sun's position creates a backlight effect, highlighting edges of the dune and creating a luminous outline that adds to the image's dramatic feel. Lens flares, likely from shooting directly into the sun, add an artistic effect to the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition showcases a serene and undisturbed natural environment where the elements of earth and water create a peaceful, almost otherworldly, scene. The absence of visible human activity or presence suggests a remote or untouched location. The mood is one of isolation and tranquility, emphasizing the beauty of the natural landscape under changing light conditions.","title":"An example of the spectacular dunes that rise between the coastal town of Florence and the Pacific Ocean","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["550490","545207","545203","545199","543097","547015","548230","547717","551553","557459","555400","553058","545280","542994","552889","547607"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dune","sand","sun","near","backlight","effect","flare","lens","shoot","create"]}
