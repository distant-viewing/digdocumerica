{"path":"547935.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a beach scene where the primary focus is a person sunbathing. The individual, wearing a red swimsuit and a white cap, is lying on a pink towel. Next to the person, there is a radio, suggesting that they might be listening to music or a broadcast.\n\nThe setting is a sandy beach, with intricate textures of the sand shown around and beneath the towel. Behind the sunbather, the beach continues towards a curving coastline that gently borders a calm and expansive body of blue water. No vegetation is visible, and the beach appears quite open and undeveloped.\n\nIn the distance, a trace of land or a sandbank can be seen extending into the sea, dividing the water view. The sky is predominantly clear with very few clouds, hinting at a bright sunny day, ideal for outdoor activities like sunbathing. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on leisure and the natural beach environment, promotes a sense of relaxation and simplicity.","title":"Lifeguard takes a sunbath at great kills park on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548624","550920","553882","551306","543477","547680","547507","548541","553685","550936","547491","550930","550919","553683","547503","550932"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sunbathe","towel","sandbank","radio","swimsuit","music","trace","promote","ideal"]}
