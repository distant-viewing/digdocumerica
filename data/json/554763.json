{"path":"554763.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape, likely a mining site. The scene is dominated by a large, striated surface on a man-made hill, possibly created by the accumulation of mining byproducts such as tailings. The regular, almost rhythmic, patterns on the hill are most likely due to the layering process of these materials.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there's an industrial structure with a tall chute, which could be used to transport materials to or from the site. The presence of a few industrial buildings and tanks suggests ongoing industrial operations.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a mix of untamed shrubbery and trees, indicative of a rural setting. On the horizon, there is a visible contrast between the industrial activity and the distant rural surroundings, including a noticeable small house atop a hill, emphasizing the intrusion of industrial activity into a natural landscape.\n\nThe entire setting is under a subdued, perhaps autumnal light, which casts a soft glow on the industrial structures and the vegetated foreground. The composition of the photo, using a wide lens, allows for an encompassing view that reflects both the environmental and industrial dimensions of the location.","title":"The land of Belmont and harrison counties in southeastern Ohio has been scarred by more than twenty years of strip mining here a huge bank of coal slag has been left to erode and possibly pollute local water supplies","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["554764","544059","554811","555588","554628","543642","550574","543848","555591","552544","551065","554804","552004","544390","543836","542553"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","hill","byproduct","chute","site","dimension","intrusion","lens","material","shrubbery"]}
