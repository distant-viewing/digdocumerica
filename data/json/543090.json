{"path":"543090.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape view of a rugged coastline. On the left side of the image, a steep, densely forested hillside descends dramatically toward the ocean. The trees appear to be coniferous, typical of a temperate rainforest, and they blanket the hill in deep shades of green.\n\nExtending from the base of this hill is a long, winding beach that stretches into the distance toward the top right of the image. The beach is broad and sandy, interspersed with areas of what could be wetlands or shallow water pools closer to the hillside. The shoreline meets gentle surf, with waves breaking lightly on the sand.\n\nThe ocean itself fills the right side of the image, its surface a calm expanse extending to the horizon. The water appears gray, blending almost seamlessly with a misty or foggy sky. The atmosphere has a slightly hazy quality, suggesting either early morning or late evening light, which gives the scene a serene and somewhat mysterious character.\n\nThe far background, beneath the mist, hints at additional landforms or hills fading into the distance, which adds to the depth and vastness of the scene. Overall, the composition conveys a sense of quiet isolation and the raw beauty of a natural coastal environment.","title":"A forest grows by the ocean","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543432","543300","545222","543085","543328","543061","545226","543068","545173","545934","545122","543297","545230","543080","545124","553995"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["hillside","hill","ocean","beach","rainforest","surf","landform","descend","extend","pool"]}
