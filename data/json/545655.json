{"path":"545655.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity in a rugged outdoor setting. The main focus is a large crane with an extended arm, operating in what appears to be a watery landscape. The crane's bucket is submerged, suggesting it might be engaged in dredging or similar activities involving the removal of material from the water. Near the crane, debris and other materials are scattered around, indicating ongoing work or the aftermath of a significant process.\n\nThe crane's cabin is yellow and slightly rusted, hinting at robust usage and exposure to harsh conditions. Behind the crane, a pickup truck can be seen, blending a sense of transportation or logistical support into the scene.\n\nThe background features towering red cliffs under a cloudy sky, suggesting a dramatic and remote location, likely near a river or lake given the presence of water. The cliffs provide a stark, natural contrast to the mechanical and human-made elements in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes a blend of nature and industry, with the powerful landscape juxtaposing the imposition of mechanical equipment used to modify or interact with the environment.","title":"Dragline shovel scoops up oil-laden debris from log boom on San Juan river near lake powell.
