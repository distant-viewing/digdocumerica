{"path":"558054.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The image displays an aerial view of mixed rural and industrial landscapes. In the bottom center of the image, there is a small agricultural farm consisting of several buildings, including a classic red barn, another small red outbuilding, and a few other neutral-colored structures. Surrounding these buildings are patches of green grass, a few trees, and pathways that connect the buildings.\n\nThe middle section of the image shows a winding road intersecting with a straight, larger road lined with utility poles. There are a couple of vehicles visible, suggesting some level of activity or transit.\n\nTowards the top of the image, dominating the composition, is a large industrial complex. This facility includes several tall, connected buildings with white exteriors and few visible windows. The complex is surrounded by extensive parking areas, which are nearly empty, suggesting either a time of low activity or a newly constructed or underused facility. A few scattered vehicles can be seen in the parking lots. Beyond the industrial complex, the landscape transitions again into a rural setting with trees and fields, emphasizing the juxtaposition of industrial and natural environments in the vicinity.\n\nThe overall setting appears peaceful and quiet, with no significant movement or bustling activity visible at the time the photograph was taken. The contrast between the rural and industrial areas provides a vivid depiction of land-use diversity in this region.","title":"Aerial view of the coliseum built near Interstate 271 south of Cleveland, Ohio. Farms near the structure eventually will disappear, according to critics who were against construction of the arena. The photo was taken on a Sunday when no event was scheduled. Land for sale signs are evident in the area. The coliseum is located just west of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which contains 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555752","542620","543764","553969","549523","547426","552091","551174","553943","547447","556913","545842","555755","550549","546122","548894"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["complex","parking","outbuilding","facility","building","time","transit","depiction","diversity","barn"]}
