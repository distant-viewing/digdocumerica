{"path":"549998.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures three individuals sitting and reclining within large concrete pipes on a paved surface. The concrete pipes appear to be construction materials and are placed upright on the ground. \n\nThe central figure is sitting inside one of the pipes, slightly hunched over and holding their head with their hands as though either in deep thought or shading their eyes. The pose suggests moments of rest or contemplation. The individual is barefoot and appears to be wearing dark shorts. The lighting within the pipe shadows much of this person's body.\n\nThe person on the left is sitting more relaxed or laid back within another concrete pipe. This person is barefoot and also dressed in a casual manner, likely in shorts, with their legs extended outward and resting on the ground. The posture and setting evoke a casual, perhaps playful or restful moment.\n\nA third individual is partially visible in the concrete pipe on the right side of the frame. This figure is seated and shaded, making details about their posture or clothing difficult to discern. They appear to be interacting or conversing with the central figure, as suggested by the orientation of their bodies towards each other.\n\nThe background includes another bicycle propped against a red wall, enhancing the urban, casual feel of the setting. The presence of these bikes suggests that the individuals might have arrived at this location for a temporary rest while traveling around the area. The road and backdrop reveal a typical street scene, possibly in a suburban or semi-urban environment.\n\nVegetation sprouting around the concrete pipes and the general wear on the sidewalk hint at an outdoor environment that is not meticulously maintained, adding a rough, authentic texture to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on relaxation in an unconventional setting, captures a moment of daily life that combines elements of urbanity with spontaneous and creative use of available urban objects.","title":"Public playground on the Charles River, near Soldiers Field Road","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553166","545358","551451","553207","551433","553218","547821","547748","552973","551860","553122","546223","545330","557713","554910","552971"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["pipe","rest","figure","individual","short","person","posture","orientation","bike","moment"]}
