{"path":"558042.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph featuring a serpentine river carving through a lush landscape. The river reflects the sky above, creating a mirror-like effect and doubling the visual impact of the snaking waterway. A road crosses the river via a bridge, connecting two banks; the road also winds along the river shore before stretching out towards the horizon. Fields, possibly agricultural, are visible adjacent to the banks, punctuated by dense clusters of trees and scattered infrastructureindicative of either small farms or rural dwellings.\n\nThe composition of the photo emphasizes the winding nature of both the waterway and the road, leading the viewer's eye through the scene from the foreground to the hazy horizon. The overall color palette is dominated by greens and blues, punctuated by the dull grays and whites of the roads and infrastructure, evoking a tranquil, almost idyllic rural setting. The topography and the way nature and humanity intersect here speak to a managed but appreciative use of the landscape.","title":"Aerial view of the old Ohio-Erie Canal, left, and the Cuyahoga River, right. The river has an Indian name meaning crooked. Canal Road is to the left while Alexander Road crosses the water, near Cleveland. The view, looking south towards Wilson's Mill, is obscured by trees. The canal was heavily used for commerce between 1833 and 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems. A flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548096","555753","550616","549262","555575","556964","550571","548097","553663","549081","549456","547227","550627","558050","550562","550570"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","road","waterway","bank","carving","dwelling","topography","mirror","horizon","white"]}
