{"path":"545372.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a street scene captured from an elevated viewpoint, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The setting appears to be a residential area, characterized by verdant trees and family homes visible in the background. The time seems to be either dawn or dusk, reflected by the soft lighting and muted colors, lending an atmospheric quality to the image.\n\nIn the foreground, utility wires run horizontally across the top half of the image, leading the viewerâ€™s eye into the scene. Below these, on the street, the daily life of the neighborhood unfolds. A woman walks towards the right, holding what looks like a shopping bag, suggesting she might be returning from or going to a market or store. Her dress and the way she carries herself adds a personal narrative to the image.\n\nOn the street behind her, the center of activity includes children playing. A child on a bicycle rides ahead, followed by a slightly older child possibly giving chase or joining in the fun. Another child can be seen walking and closely observing the bicycle rider. This interaction provides a dynamic contrast to the calm movement of the woman.\n\nThe street itself gently curves in the middle ground, flanked on both sides by parked cars from an era indicated by their designs, suggesting a time frame for the photograph. The muted colors of the vehicles blend with the rest of the quaint residential ambiance.\n\nIn the distance, the environment is made richer with trees and other foliage, with some houses partially visible. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and portrays a slice of daily life, steeped in tranquility and a sense of community. The subdued and somewhat hazy atmosphere could also indicate weather conditions like mist or light rain.\n\nThis visual tableau captures elements of human interaction, urban environment, and a serene, almost nostalgic mood.","title":"Residential street near U.S. Steel plant in heavy smog","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["547388","551084","555895","556448","556435","550994","546545","551742","543657","556170","553550","545398","548473","557290","550145","553493"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["child","street","bicycle","fun","tableau","rider","shopping","ride","market","time"]}
