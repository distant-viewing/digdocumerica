{"path":"551746.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph presents a lovely and lively scene in an urban garden or park. In the foreground, vibrant pink roses and various other flowers in shades of orange and yellow contrast beautifully against the lush green grass. The focus slightly blurs the roses closest to the camera, making them appear soft and ethereal.\n\nIn the middle ground, several people are engaging in different activities. To the left, an older person in a light-colored outfit is painting on a canvas set up on an easel, evidently capturing the scenic beauty of the garden. Towards the center and right in the middle ground, other individuals can be seen. A person, probably a woman judging from the long hair, is bending over, possibly tending to the flowers or admiring them up close.\n\nThe background features a line of old buildings with visible commercial signs, like \"St. Vincent Chemists\" and a \"Luncheonette,\" indicating a city setting. The architecture is somewhat aged, with traditional facades and signage that give the scene a throwback feel, suggesting this might be a well-established, possibly historic, area.\n\nOverall, the composition balances natural beauty with urban life, illustrating a serene moment in a city park that provides a genial retreat from the urban environment surrounding it. The visual juxtaposition of flora and architectural elements adds depth and a sense of how nature and urban life coexist.","title":"Painter and volunteer worker in the garden opposite St Vincent's Hospital at Seventh Avenue and 11th Street. Property had been acquired by the hospital for expansion purposes, but community pressure brought about a stay and the garden was a temporary solution. Maintained by volunteers, its great variety of plants makes a splendid display.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551747","551784","551743","551785","551781","551702","551756","557257","551705","551644","549516","551698","551775","551744","551703","551685"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["rose","garden","flower","park","canvas","retreat","city","person","flora","beauty"]}
