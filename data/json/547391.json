{"path":"547391.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a family moment on a bright, sunny day set in a lush, green garden in front of a two-story house. In the foreground, a man, presumably an adult, kneels down, hugging a young boy. They are both smiling, and the man is wearing glasses, a cap, a light grey shirt, and dark pants. The young boy has blonde hair, wears a red t-shirt and striped shorts, and is sporting sneakers. They are closely seated on the well-kept grass.\n\nIn the background, the house, probably the family's home, is a traditional two-story structure with white sidings and red accents around the windows. Off to the side, under the shadow of the house's roof, another part of their family or friends can be seen. They appear to be engaging in a casual conversation; this group includes a woman holding a small child and another man beside them.\n\nThe background also showcases tall, mature trees and clear blue skies, which contribute to a calm and serene environment. Overall, the setting reflects a familial, suburban leisure scene, possibly during a weekend or a holiday gathering.","title":"Farmer frank otte with gRandson Troy.
