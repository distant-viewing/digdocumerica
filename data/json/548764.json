{"path":"548764.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a tranquil waterfront scene in a coastal setting. On the left, there's a small marina or dock, partially enclosed by a rocky breakwater. Numerous lobster traps are stacked by the edge of the water, suggesting that this might be a fishing hub, possibly specializing in lobster fishing. A hammock is strung between palm trees, emphasizing a laid-back, leisurely atmosphere.\n\nA series of modest, single-story buildings—perhaps boathouses or storage units for fishing equipment—align the docks. Each structure has a simple, functional design, and one features a large water tank on its roof, possibly for rainwater collection or another utility purpose.\n\nSeveral small boats are moored at the docks, indicating active use of this area by the local community for maritime activities. The calm water reflects the sky and flanking objects, enhancing the serene ambiance.\n\nIn the background, under a bright, clear sky, more modern, residential or commercial buildings are visible, suggesting that this might be on the edge of a small town or settlement. The presence of utilities like power lines confirms that this is an established, inhabited area.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a working waterfront with elements of both industrial use and recreational relaxation, set in a picturesque coastal environment.\n","title":"Cove at Conch Key, a lobster fishing community.
