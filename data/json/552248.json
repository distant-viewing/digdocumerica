{"path":"552248.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental degradation where numerous rusty oil drums are abandoned along a riverbank. The drums are scattered in various positions; some are upright while others are lying on their sides. Their surfaces show signs of considerable wear and corrosion, indicating long-term exposure to the elements. The colors of the barrels range from faded orange to dark brown and rust.\n\nThe background of the image features a dark, tranquil river with reflections of light dancing on its surface. Around the barrels, there is an assortment of natural debris including branches, driftwood, and some litter. This creates a stark contrast between the natural environment and the man-made waste.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a strong message about pollution and the impact of industrial waste on natural landscapes. There is a somber tone to the image, emphasized by the absence of any human presence and the quiet decay of the discarded containers. The photograph serves as a poignant reminder of the environmental costs of industrial activities.","title":"55 gallon drums, which had been dumped into the Snohomish River, lie exposed by low tide in the intertidal section of the river at Everett.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552883","543762","543806","542494","544810","552884","547907","553433","547493","546000","556324","553045","547485","546920","550352","551440"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["drum","barrel","waste","dancing","corrosion","reminder","driftwood","litter","assortment","degradation"]}
