{"path":"553275.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, candid scene of multiple people gathered, likely at a public event or gathering. The focal point of the image features a person wearing a striking, textured, large-brimmed golden hat facing away from the camera. This individual is dressed in a red tank top and is engaged in conversation with another person who also faces away from the camera, identifiable by a red hat with white polka dots. \n\nTo the right, another key figure is an older woman wearing sunglasses and a patterned dress or top, holding a drink with her left hand and sitting with a rather contemplative or distant expression. She seems slightly turned away from the center of the action, suggesting her disengagement or rest amid the bustling environment.\n\nThe background of the scene is relatively minimalistic, featuring a roughly textured concrete or wooden wall that doesn't offer any specific details about the location. The lighting is natural, indicating a daytime setting, and other partial glimpses of attendees include a piece of a red garment and a burger, suggesting the casual and social nature of the event. The overall mood is casual and evokes a sense of everyday leisure activity where people gather, eat, and interact.","title":"Fountain Square is downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["558295","547437","551808","553304","553709","556532","553251","551648","557031","556528","543482","551011","551460","557040","553761","551028"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["polka","event","garment","dot","hat","drink","attendee","camera","person","top"]}
