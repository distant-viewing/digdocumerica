{"path":"554632.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene likely set in a mining or processing area. In the foreground, there's a railway track strewn with rocky gravel. The land beside the track has some sparse vegetation and wildflowers.\n\nTo the right in the foreground, part of a railcar is visible. It appears to be stationary and is marked with identification numbers and letters, which are partly obscured.\n\nIn the middleground, there are large mounds of coal and other raw materials. Multiple industrial structures, including tall metal towers and buildings with several levels, dominate the scene. These structures are likely part of the processing facilities.\n\nIn the background, a verdant hill is partially visible, suggesting that the industrial site is situated in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural space. Some smoke or steam is being emitted from one of the structures, indicating ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears slightly dim, possibly due to the time of day or weather conditions, contributing to a slightly gloomy ambiance typical of heavy industrial areas. The photo captures the blend of nature and industrial activity, emphasizing a stark contrast in the environment.","title":"Railroad cars take two to three or more shipments weekly to sayreville, New Jersey, to pigment plants to make white paint from this ilmenite mine owned by nl industries at tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556602","545503","543642","551036","556382","556349","554625","556520","554764","550974","555591","557403","556424","557374","551037","554763"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["processing","railcar","track","identification","coal","wildflower","gravel","strew","mound","railway"]}
