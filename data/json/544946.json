{"path":"544946.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman sitting on a smooth, sloping rock formation overlooking a vast desert landscape. The woman, wearing a black tank top and patterned shorts, is seen from a side angle as she gazes out over the terrain. Her long hair is partially blown by the wind, covering her face slightly, which adds a sense of motion to the static scene.\n\nThe landscape in the distance is characterized by layered rock formations that exhibit varying shades of tan, pink, and red, indicative of sediment deposits over time. These geological formations are carved into undulating ridges and valleys, with sparse vegetation dotting the expanse. In the distant background, flat-topped hills covered with low-density scrub-like vegetation stretch under a clear, bright blue sky. \n\nThe image evokes a feeling of solitude and the grandeur of the natural environment, highlighting the vastness and the unpopulated state of the terrain. This kind of scenery is typical of desert regions in the American Southwest, noted for their rugged beauty and dramatic rock formations. The photograph might have been taken with a film camera given the texture and the quality of color seen in the image, reminiscent of photos from the mid-to-late 20th century.","title":"White canyon near sipapu bridge Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["545300","545696","545196","545804","545753","543838","545767","545775","545755","545789","545800","544745","544341","545771","545748","544397"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["formation","rock","desert","blow","scrub","deposit","carve","note","kind","overlook"]}
