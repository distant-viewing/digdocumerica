{"path":"548800.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and picturesque outdoor scene, likely taken in a natural setting during daylight. It features two people, each relaxing in hammocks suspended from the branches of leafy trees. The trees frame the image, their dense, intricate branches and leaves creating a detailed silhouette against a bright sky, through which sunlight gently filters, casting soft light and creating a tranquil, dreamy atmosphere.\n\nThe setting suggests a leisurely, peaceful moment, possibly in a camping or hiking area given the natural surroundings and the presence of a backpack placed on the ground nearby, suggesting outdoor activities. The ground appears to be level and covered with dirt or small foliage, typical of a forest or park floor. The overall composition of the image, with its majestic trees and hanging hammocks, evokes a sense of relaxation and connection with nature.","title":"Campers hang loose at Little Duck Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548799","545293","554679","551942","547045","551682","545780","554513","542732","553065","554120","545767","546387","552033","546340","543881"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["branch","backpack","camping","hiking","relaxation","connection","daylight","tree","ground","floor"]}
