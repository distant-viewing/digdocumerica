{"path":"542572.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic view of a forest through a fisheye lens, which distorts the perspective creating a spherical effect that makes the scene appear to curve around the viewer. At the lower part of the image, the forest floor is visible, covered with brown leaf litter and small twigs. A single green plant with long, slender leaves and a budding flower stands prominently in the foreground, suggesting early stages of growth, possibly in spring.\n\nThe background of the photo is dominated by tall, straight trees, likely conifers, extending upwards toward the sky. The trees are densely packed, and their trunks are visible rising high above the forest floor. Due to the lens used, the towering trees bend inward at the top of the image, converging toward a central point, which gives a surreal and enveloping effect to the photograph. The use of natural lighting creates a somewhat dark ambiance at the bottom, while highlights penetrate the canopy above, suggesting that this image was taken during the day in a heavily forested area.\n\nOverall, the composition and use of the fisheye lens create a sense of immersion into this forest scene, emphasizing both the grandeur of the tall trees and the delicate details of the forest floor, encapsulating a vibrant ecosystem within a single frame.","title":"Seedlings","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["553576","555120","555054","542725","542569","554959","555114","542930","555675","554978","557596","554425","555043","545285","553574","554980"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["lens","forest","floor","distort","immersion","penetrate","effect","bud","twig","converge"]}
