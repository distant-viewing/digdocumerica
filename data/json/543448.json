{"path":"543448.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures the majestic appearance of a large tree, perhaps a sequoia or another type of giant tree, against a backdrop of a clear sky. The perspective is upward-looking, emphasizing the impressive height and bulk of the tree.\n\nThe tree trunk is enormously thick, demonstrating the characteristic texture of tree bark which seems rugged and furrowed. It splits into a prominent branch that bends away from the main trunk, contributing to a dynamic and asymmetrical natural form. This branch is thick and sturdy, supporting a rich, dense foliage that appears lush and a deep shade of green.\n\nThe leaves of the tree are bathed in a golden hue, likely due to sunlight filtering through or reflecting off them, creating a vibrant contrast against the darker areas of foliage in shadow. The light appears to be coming from a low angle, possibly during the late afternoon or early evening, which adds a warm tone to the scene and highlights the intricate details of the tree’s limbs and leaves.\n\nFurther enhancing the composition are the smaller branches that feather out into the sky, speckled with leaves catching light, that add texture and depth to the scene. The sky itself serves as a calm, gently gradated backdrop, shifting from a light to a deeper hue of blue, giving a sense of fading daylight.\n\nOverall, the photograph encapsulates a tranquil nature scene full of grandeur and serenity, focusing entirely on the natural elements without any human presence or man-made objects, illustrating the tree’s formidable presence and beauty in its natural setting.","title":"Tree shaped by wind","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["548687","554995","554966","548709","557621","548708","554099","548685","542927","545278","543442","545292","542958","554967","550792","543488"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["tree","branch","leave","trunk","limb","foliage","serenity","hue","bark","grandeur"]}
