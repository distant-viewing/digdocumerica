{"path":"550684.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set against a natural backdrop. The foreground is dominated by a chaotic juxtaposition of industrial elements, including large steel storage tanks, constructions, and a complex assembly of electrical towers with numerous wires. Amidst this industrial setup, there is a small building emitting white smoke or steam from a chimney.\n\nA turbulent watercourse flows through the center of the scene, where rapid, foamy water rushes over rocks and debris, adding a dynamic element to the composition. Several large pipes, partially dismantled or disused, are seen jutting out over the watercourse, releasing water or possibly waste, forming a cascade. The surrounding terrain looks rugged and is strewn with debris, suggesting recent or ongoing construction or demolition activity.\n\nThe color tones are predominantly dusky, with shades of grey, brown, and faded greens, conveying a sense of aged and heavy industrial activity. The overall atmosphere exudes a grim and utilitarian environment where industry meets nature in a stark, unembellished manner.","title":"Brown Paper Company, showing outfall into the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550710","546080","551156","545996","550672","550673","557376","557374","550995","557225","551009","543813","551026","550725","557377","546007"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["dismantle","demolition","assembly","construction","release","disuse","rush","jut","debris","cascade"]}
