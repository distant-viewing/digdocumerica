{"path":"557430.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, multi-lane highway curving gently through a landscape composed of greenery and rolling hills. The highway is busy with traffic; vehicles of various sizes and colors, including cars and a motorcycle, are traveling in both directions. Several streetlights line the roadside, and road signage is visible, including one that says \"Back Bay Dr.\"\n\nThe environment around the highway features grassy fields, indicative of rural or semi-urban landscapes, stretching out to the horizon. Tall utility poles are installed along the side of the road, following the curve of the highway. The sky above appears slightly overcast, suggesting a calm, perhaps cool day. The overall atmosphere is one of peaceful co-existence between nature and the built environment, emphasizing a well-traveled but serene roadway.","title":"Multilane highway leading to Newport Beach. Road widening in this area has occurred in the past few years as a large shopping center and business complex was developed above the all residential area at the harbor. Regulation of development within 1,000 yards of the coastline has resulted in increasing restrictions in California since the implementation of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in early 1973.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["547302","547294","546603","554566","547298","546587","546571","546720","546583","545432","546733","549890","548391","546686","546612","546607"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["highway","existence","streetlight","motorcycle","roadside","roadway","road","curve","direction","signage"]}
