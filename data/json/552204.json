{"path":"552204.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental disruption, focusing on a large accumulation of logs and debris in a waterway. The foreground is cluttered with logs, many of which appear weathered, showing signs of moss and decay. These logs crisscross each other chaotically, filling the frame and creating a sense of disordered congestion.\n\nIn the middleground, the logs partially fill a river or stream, which is visible in patches through the openings between the wood. The water reflects the dusky or early dawn sky, indicating either early morning or late evening light. This soft light casts a blue hue over the scene, enhancing the somber mood.\n\nThe background shows a treeline and a clear sky with very light cloud cover, suggesting a remote or natural setting away from urban development. The visible environment beyond the immediacy of the logs is lush and green, which contrasts with the destructed nature of the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph and the debris suggests themes of environmental neglect or the aftermath of a natural event, stressing an interaction between human activities (such as logging or industrial waste) and the natural landscape.","title":"Solid waste dumped into a roadside pond in the lower snohomish river area","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550347","555209","552161","551603","545266","555143","552158","551604","550950","547661","550338","555094","552178","550352","555208","552046"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["log","logs","clould","immediacy","dusky","stress","treeline","congestion","disruption","debris"]}
