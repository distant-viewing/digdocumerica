{"path":"551637.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This image captures a scene at an outdoor cafe setting adjacent to a modern architectural structure with prominent, large arched windows and vertical fluting on the facade. The architecture suggests a mid-to-late 20th-century modernist style, possibly a public or cultural building given its scale and design.\n\nIn the foreground, several people are seated at tables under round table parasols, enjoying the outdoor ambiance. The patrons display styles typical of the mid-to-late 20th century, including a mix of casual and semi-formal attire. There are large planters filled with lush, blooming flowers adding a vibrant touch of nature to the setting.\n\nNear the center and right of the frame, people are engaged in social interactions, including conversations and dining. Some individuals are standing, possibly in the midst of arriving or departing the cafe. The scene conveys an atmosphere of relaxed urban leisure, common in café settings within city environments.\n\nThe background includes a partial view of another building that mirrors the design of the building directly adjacent to the cafe, suggesting that this setting is part of a larger architectural complex or cultural center. The environment is sunny and clear, perfect for outdoor socializing, dining, and enjoying the day.","title":"Lincoln center plaza is enclosed by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
