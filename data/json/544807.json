{"path":"544807.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene along a roadside. The image prominently features a person sitting on the edge of a road next to a roadside sign. The sign is labeled “NORTH 119” and features the Colorado state flag, indicating that the location is on a northbound route in Colorado, specifically State Highway 119.\n\nThe person, who appears relaxed and waiting, is accompanied by a dog sitting close by their side. The person is wearing a wide-brimmed hat and casual clothes, holding up a cardboard sign with the word \"BOULDER\" handwritten on it, suggesting they are hitchhiking northward towards Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThe background consists of a rocky and barren hillside with sparse vegetation, characteristic of a semi-arid landscape. The road surface is visible in the foreground, and it seems to be a quiet road with no visible traffic at the moment of the photograph. The setting conveys a sense of rural or semi-wilderness area, likely situated in a less urban part of Colorado.","title":"Hitchhiker waits for ride from Black Hawk to Boulder","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["543034","545349","554704","544425","554460","543379","543637","543027","544845","545591","544262","545602","545767","545753","558089","556615"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["roadside","person","road","sign","cardboard","route","dog","clothe","hillside","word"]}
