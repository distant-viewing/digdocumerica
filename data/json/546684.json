{"path":"546684.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a bustling urban scene during dusk. The image captures a highway densely packed with numerous cars exhibiting their headlights, which suggests heavy traffic conditions. The road curves slightly and extends towards the horizon, bordered on both sides by large bodies of water, reflecting the twilight sky and contributing to a serene contrast against the busy highway.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there's a notable building with a domed structure that could be a significant landmark, enhancing the cultural or historical importance of the scene. Surrounding the highway and bodies of water are patches of greenery which indicate urban parks or possibly natural reserves, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment.\n\nAbove the landscape, the sky is painted with hues of blue and purple of the fading light, with scattered clouds subtly visible. A few birds are captured in mid-flight, their presence adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban elements.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its juxtaposition of natural and man-made features, alongside the movement represented by both the birds and the bustling traffic, provides a vivid tableau of urban life during twilight. This portrayal might invoke thoughts regarding the balance between nature and urbanization, or the ever-active pace of city life.","title":"14th Street bridge during evening rush hour, looking south from the district to Virginia","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546707","545352","545467","546586","547429","547051","555418","546574","543957","547780","548392","548418","553846","546686","547755","549857"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","bird","twilight","urbanization","traffic","regard","bustle","reserve","pace","tableau"]}
