{"path":"557466.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial view of a coastal landscape. On the left, there is a beach with the sea extending to the right. The shore is lined by regular, white-capped waves which create a foamy texture along the coastline. The coastal strip adjacent to the beach appears to be flat and sandy with minimal vegetation. Slightly further inland, there are patches of cultivated fields or grassland.\n\nJust inland from the beach area there are structures, potentially houses or small buildings, possibly indicating a sparsely populated settlement or recreational area. The landscape beyond these structures features more developed agricultural fields, and appears more lush and green compared to the coast, suggesting more fertile or irrigated land.\n\nThe scenario captured in the photo gives an impression of tranquility and relative remoteness, emphasizing the natural border between land and sea. The clarity and color depth in the photo provide a vivid contrast between the blue of the ocean and the varied greens and browns of the land. The sky is clear, indicating it might be taken on a sunny day. The horizon fades into a light haze, adding a sense of vastness to the view.","title":"Coastline, which is south of Los Angeles. Some 84 percent of the residents in the state live within 30 miles of the coast which has resulted in mounting land use pressure. Since 1900 the number of coastal wetlands has decreased from 381,000 acres to about 125,000 acres. State and regional commissions have been set up to regulate shoreline development. They must submit a plan to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending a \"constitution\" that will affect future coastal development.","placename":"San Clemente (Calif.)","location":"San Clemente, California","nn1":["554057","554023","556982","548785","554156","543427","553983","543088","557453","553982","543430","548604","543425","557523","547637","545129"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","land","sea","remoteness","grassland","coast","field","settlement","border","scenario"]}
