{"path":"545259.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a forested landscape dominated by dense coniferous trees. The view is of a hilly terrain that is covered extensively with pine trees of varying heights. In the image, one can observe that some of the trees, particularly noticeable at higher elevations and on ridges, appear to be dead or dying, as they lack foliage and have bare, pale trunks standing out in contrast to the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe colors in the photo suggest it might have been taken during the day under clear sky conditions, as the lighting is even and there are no visible shadows that are harsh, which would typically be present in strong, direct sunlight. The overall tone of the colors is slightly muted, with deep greens and earth tones dominating the landscape.\n\nThere are no visible human elements like trails, houses, or other structures, emphasizing a natural, untouched environment. The background reveals higher layers of the same hilly, tree-covered terrain, fading into a light haze which could indicate either mist or distance. The top of the image shows a clear sky but the nature of the film or the age of the image might have affected the color representation, giving it a slightly vintage feel.","title":"This hillside, which was clear-cut and then replanted with Douglas fir and hemlock, is an excellent example of good forestry management by the u.s.
