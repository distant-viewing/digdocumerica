{"path":"543758.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The image depicts an expansive aerial view of an industrial mining operation, presumably an open-pit mine, within a rugged and predominantly arid landscape. The overall terrain is articulated by layers of exposed earth, suggesting excavation and mineral extraction activities. The mine itself is characterized by terraced levels, enabling access to deeper geological layers, with various earthy colors indicating different mineral deposits or soil types.\n\nTowards the left side of the photograph, there's a complex that includes several industrial buildings, possible processing plants, and storage facilities, equipped with large tanks and interconnected by paved roads. Nearby, there appears to be a settled body of water, likely used in the mining process, possibly for mineral processing or dust control.\n\nScattered around the mine are patches of untouched land, covered with sparse vegetation typical of a semi-arid or mountainous environment. The background shows a dense forest extending to the horizon, contrasting sharply with the foreground's industrial activity. The sky is clear, suggesting the image was taken on a day with good weather, aiding in the visibility of the siteâ€™s extensive activities and operations.\n\nAdditionally, there are several dirt tracks winding around the mine, used for the movement of heavy machinery and transport of materials. These routes connect different sections of the site, merging into the main access roads that likely link the mine to nearby infrastructure or townships. The presence of these man-made structures amidst the natural landscape highlights the significant human impact on this environment.","title":"Union carbide uranium mill","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["549174","549177","544785","549172","549242","549167","543857","544111","552177","544112","555621","544789","544781","544100","544110","543674"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mine","mineral","access","mining","processing","enable","settle","interconnect","site","pit"]}
