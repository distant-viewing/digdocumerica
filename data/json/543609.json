Two young girls and a boy, all dressed in casual outdoor clothes such as jeans and tees, are gathered around an adult male who is holding a fishing rod, demonstrating or preparing to fish.\n\nIn the center, a group of children are seated on the ground, seemingly engaged in an activity involving paper plates and cups, possibly eating or preparing to eat. \n\nTo the right, three adults are standing and sitting around a rock that is used as a makeshift table. One of the men is eating, while another holds food in his hand, conversing with a woman who is seated and also holding some food. There are various food containers and open coolers around them, suggesting a meal is being enjoyed.\n\nThe background is dominated by the calm lake, reflecting the trees and bushes along its edge, which bathes the scene in a tranquil, natural light. The gathering seems informal and leisurely, with an emphasis on enjoying the outdoors and perhaps a bit of fishing. The setting is rustic and relaxed, with items and clothing strewn around, indicating a day spent in casual recreation.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543631","545267","548188","546941","554517","544223","543892","542647","544442","543164","548190","550026","545228","556298","546811","549444"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["adult","food","child","boy","fishing","cooler","gathering","picnic","overall","meal"]}
