{"path":"547550.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and atmospheric scene on water during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The image is predominantly draped in the subdued tones of early or late daylight, creating a silhouette effect.\n\nIn the foreground, the water surface is glittering with reflections of sunlight, scattered sporadically and giving the water a textured appearance. These light reflections are intense and concentrated around what seems to be a large buoy, which is the most prominent object in the lower part of the image. The buoy has a somewhat spherical shape, with smaller spherical objects strung in a line extending towards the viewer, possibly part of a maritime navigational or fishing setup.\n\nFarther back, in the middle of the image, a canoe carrying two individuals is the focal subject. The people and the canoe are silhouetted against the brighter water, rendering detailed features indiscernible; however, it is clear that one individual is towards the front of the canoe while the other is towards the rear, likely propelling the canoe forward with paddles.\n\nAbove the canoe and in the distance, the hint of a horizon is visible where the water meets a barely discernible sky. The absence of discernible clouds suggests clear weather conditions. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes tranquility, isolation, and a smooth interplay between light and shadow on water.","title":"Fishermen pull out trap nets at end of April-May season.
