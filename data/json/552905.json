{"path":"552905.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural landscape possibly during dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and subtly bluish tint. The image predominantly features a dried-up river bed, lined with rounded stones and pebbles of varying sizes and colors, primarily shades of gray and brown.\n\nFlanking the rocky riverbed, there are dense patches of wild shrubs and grass, exhibiting hues of green, gray,and muted red, suggesting resilience in a possibly arid environment. The vegetation appears well-adapted to the dry conditions, with bushy, compact forms that likely conserve water.\n\nThe background showcases a gentle slope of a hill that rises on the left side of the image, continuing the trend of sparse vegetation and a rocky surface. Toward the distant horizon, the landscape flat out under a vast, somewhat cloudy sky, which adds a moody atmosphere to the scene. In the far background, indistinct features that might be distant mountains or hills contribute to a sense of depth and isolation, emphasizing the expansive, open terrain.\n\nThis photograph likely aims to convey the rugged beauty and tranquility of a desolate, natural landscape, possibly in a highland or semi-arid region. The absence of human presence and the raw, untouched aspect of the environment are highlighted, making this a peaceful yet somewhat somber depiction of natureâ€™s understated yet profound presence.","title":"Beach rocks and sage bush on the eastern shore of Pyramid Lake.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["543793","542583","550486","554777","552891","542653","545783","543789","543977","553135","545895","545629","551520","544392","552900","550397"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["trend","riverbed","pebble","tint","hill","depiction","bed","resilience","absence","dawn"]}
