{"path":"555667.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a young plant sprouting among a spread of small rocks and pebbles. The viewpoint is low to the ground, creating a distinct perspective that emphasizes the resilient growth of the plant in a seemingly harsh environment. The sky in the background appears slightly overcast with clouds, diffusing sunlight that graciously illuminates the scene. The sun creates a subtle lens flare effect near the base of the plant, adding a magical quality to the image. The overall mood of the photograph reflects themes of growth, resilience, and the beauty of life in unexpected places.","title":"Tough and hardy, this alder shoot is sprouting on a glacial moraine at the foot of the Worthington Glacier.
