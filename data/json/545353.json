{"path":"545353.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid urban scene, seemingly taken from an upper floor looking down onto a street corner. The focus is divided between the aged architecture of a building and a group of individuals around an old car.\n\nThe building in the foreground is characterized by weathered architecture and appears quite dilapidated. The brick walls are worn, with peeling paint and visible decay. A prominent feature is the rustic fire escape, made of wood and metal, displaying various levels of deterioration and rust. The staircase descends from an upper balcony, hinting at multiple floors above. Shadows from the fire escape cast distinct lines across the building, adding to the gritty feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, on the street, there are three individuals gathered around an old car, which has a vintage design indicative of mid-20th-century American automotive style. Two of these people are leaning on the car, engaged in conversation, while the third person is standing slightly apart. The car's color, a soft blue, contrasts with the darker tones of the building and street.\n\nThe street itself shows signs of urban wear with marks on the pavement and minimal pedestrian activity. The surroundings in the photograph suggest a quiet, maybe somewhat neglected, part of the city. There are hints of other vehicles and parts of buildings in the distance, but they are not the primary focus.\n\nOverall, the composition intriguingly contrasts the rugged textures and shadows of the urban structure against the human element and vintage car, which inject life and narrative into the setting. The lighting, primarily ambient with bright sunlight, highlights details and enhances the textural qualities of the scene.","title":"El paso's second ward, a chicano neighborhood which is losing its ethnic flavor in the wake of urban renewal","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["555944","545321","550108","555902","545326","545351","553488","552965","543471","545333","557882","547587","556249","552968","557278","557874"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["escape","car","street","fire","floor","building","weathered","descend","deterioration","vintage"]}
