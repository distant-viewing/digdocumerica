{"path":"543934.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively scene at a riverside or lakeside dock. In the foreground, a white cabin cruiser named \"JOHNSON'S FOLLY IV\", registered in Louisville, KY, is moored to a wooden pier. The boat has an upper deck with several chairs and aft deck space, designed for leisure activities.\n\nTo the right, we see a covered fueling station for boats, featuring two Texaco gasoline pumps, one labeled \"Sea Chief\". Above the gasoline pumps, a hanging sign reads “water charge,” indicating additional services provided at this dock.\n\nOn the dock, there is a group of people engaged in various activities. Some are standing by the gasoline pumps, possibly preparing to refuel their boat, while others appear to be walking along the pier or engaged in a conversation.\n\nThe environment is lush with greenery visible across the water, suggesting a tranquil, natural setting. The sky is slightly overcast, diffusing the daylight and creating a calm, soft light over the scene. The time period or style of clothing and the design of the boat suggest the photograph could be from the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThe setting and activities capture a relaxed moment likely associated with recreational boating and the leisure pursuits characteristic of river or lakeside living.","title":"Yacht is refueled at station on Ohio River.","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["544260","551528","546856","554484","550029","548525","554659","544117","543943","543952","544126","547773","544533","551228","549934","545155"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["gasoline","pump","dock","boat","lakeside","pier","deck","cruiser","leisure","pursuit"]}
