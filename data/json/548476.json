{"path":"548476.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures an older man walking past a graffiti-covered wall, with a vivid urban backdrop. The man, wearing glasses and a light-colored trench coat, is depicted in profile view, looking away from the camera as if caught mid-motion while passing by. His expression is not visible, emphasizing a candid, perhaps introspective moment.\n\nThe graffiti wall itself is interesting, full of various tags and marks predominantly in white paint, adding a touch of chaos and urban expressionism to the scene. The graffiti appears thickly layered, indicating that this has been a canvas for many individuals over time. \n\nBehind the man and the wall, the background is populated with older residential buildings characterized by their flat roofs and classic architectural elements, which indicate that this may be a mature, built-up neighborhood. There are hints of more industrial elements in the far back, including a distant view of utility poles and sparse tree coverage, suggesting a mix of residential and possibly commercial zones.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast between the moving figure of the man and the static, colorful graffiti, setting against a muted urban environment, to evoke a sense of place and time that is distinctly textured and layered.","title":"A side of the MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) pedestrian bridge that links the split segments of Neptune Road","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553506","552971","547816","548271","555939","553537","556231","551926","549277","545351","545315","554325","553823","549325","550257","556232"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["graffiti","wall","trench","canvas","man","tag","chaos","coverage","mark","time"]}
