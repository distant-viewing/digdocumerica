{"path":"557463.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a bird's-eye view of a coastal urban area next to a broad beach. The image captures a bright sunny day by the sea, highlighting a town nestled against a hilly backdrop with sparse vegetation. Two jetties extend into the ocean, with waves breaking around them. The beach is broad and sandy, possibly a popular spot for visitors given its expanse.\n\nOn the left, the coastline curves inward forming a gentle bay, while on the right, the area transitions into a busier part of the town with more dense construction, including several buildings closely packed together. The town's architecture suggests a mix of residential and commercial developments with some larger structures possibly indicating hotels or public landmarks.\n\nThere are some clear roads or pathways interlinking these zones. In the midst of the town, a round structure, similar to an arena or perhaps a public gathering place, is visible. The landscape changes from beach to built environment rather abruptly, showing how the town expands right up against the natural shoreline.\n\nThe overall feel is of a populated, yet scenic coastal region that balances natural beauty with human development. The clear skies and visibility suggest good weather, making the ocean's color vividly blue. The surrounding hills provide a natural boundary, emphasizing the town's coastal orientation.","title":"Aerial of coastline showing San Clemente.
