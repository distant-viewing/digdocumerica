{"path":"558038.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a town street scene set against a backdrop of autumn foliage and a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, the image captures a simple wooden-pole road marker indicating \"SOUTH 9G,\" suggesting that the location might be along Route 9G, likely in the northeastern United States, based on the foliage type and architectural styles.\n\nIn the middle ground, on the left side, there is a two-story white wooden house with black shutters and what appears to be a commercial or public facility below, evidenced by a broad display window and central entrance on its ground level. The house is set slightly elevated from the street, with stone steps leading up to the main door and a brick-retaining wall that runs alongside part of the property's perimeter.\n\nOn the right side of the street, the scene contains parked cars and a modest stretch of businesses or homes. The vehicles date the photograph to the 1970s or earlier, with models that show the characteristic design styles of that era, such as long bodies and prominent hoods. The mix of vehicle types includes sedans and possibly a station wagon.\n\nIn the distance, the street gently descends and curves to the right, lined on both sides by small businesses built close to the sidewalk. The roadway appears to be quiet, with no visible moving traffic, enhancing the tranquil small-town atmosphere.\n\nLeaf-strewn roads and the flush of autumnal colors contribute to the seasonally scenic aspect of the location, offering a picturesque glimpse of a peaceful, rural American setting. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of nostalgia and quietude, emphasizing a slower pace of life.","title":"Bootie's dry goods store in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.  It occupies an 1820's greek revival house and store formerly operated by the woods and boody families.  The tasteful restoration has its entry on the side of the building for orientation to the old Ohio-erie canal.  The canal was built between Akron and Cleveland during 1825 and 1827, and was heavily used for water commerce from 1833 to 1913 when a flood and the railroads put it out of business","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["554710","557655","558039","558037","555584","557155","556435","551106","558028","558020","554709","557154","552526","548245","557661","556564"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","business","town","type","perimeter","retain","pace","quietude","shutter","nostalgia"]}
