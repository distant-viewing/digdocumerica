{"path":"545554.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph shows an intriguing and visually striking rock formation. It is captured within a narrow, vertical composition that emphasizes the height and rugged texture of the rocks. The dominant feature of this image is a tall, narrow arch formed by two massive walls of reddish-brown sandstone that meet at an acute angle at the top, creating a natural skylight.\n\nAt the base of this arch, there is a curious man-made structure built from stones that match the color of the surrounding rocks. This small, circular structure appears to be an ancient stone dwelling or ceremonial space, given its historic-looking construction and remote location. It has remnants of what appears to be wooden beams protruding vertically from its top, hinting at a possible roof structure in the past.\n\nThe rock walls surrounding the structure are smooth and striated, showing layers of sedimentary formation with variations in hue from deep red to brown. The natural light filtering through the top of the arch subtly highlights the texture and contours of the rock surfaces. The overall scene is devoid of any visible flora or fauna, focusing solely on the geological and historical features. The background shows the continuation of the rock formations extending into an overcast sky, subtly implying the isolated and untouched nature of this environment.","title":"Keyhole Ruin, on Horse Creek in Canyonlands National Park, was once a home to pre-Columbian cliff dwellers.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545550","544939","545566","545568","545572","545584","553077","545555","544397","544935","545563","545580","545578","544952","550481","552890"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["rock","arch","formation","fauna","top","skylight","stone","dwelling","sandstone","continuation"]}
