{"path":"550989.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil river scene surrounded by a lush, forested landscape. In the foreground, a small boat with two individuals is making its way through the water. The boat appears to be a simple, flat-bottomed type, commonly used for navigating shallow or calm waters.\n\nThe river itself is wide and appears somewhat calm, with small ripples visible on the surface suggesting a gentle current. It is bordered by dense greenery and trees, indicating a healthy, vibrant ecosystem and possibly a remote or less urbanized area.\n\nIn the background, the photograph shows rolling hills or low mountains, densely covered with trees. The hills envelop the river, creating a secluded and picturesque valley. The light and shadows suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, providing a soft and warm lighting that enhances the serene and untouched feel of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the river leading the viewer's eye through the image towards the distant hills, creates a sense of depth and natural beauty, evoking a peaceful and somewhat adventurous atmosphere.","title":"The mouth of the kanawha river at gauley bridge.
