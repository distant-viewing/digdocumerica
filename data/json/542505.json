{"path":"542505.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene juxtaposing technology and nature. In the foreground, there are fresh green grapevine leaves that occupy the lower right quadrant of the image, detailed enough to show the serrated edges and veins of the leaves against the sky. The focus of the image, however, is the agricultural airplane in the background, captured from an angle below as it flies diagonally across the frame from the top left to the bottom right.\n\nThe airplane is emitting a thick, white spray, likely pesticide or fertilizer, which forms a dense and textured cloud trailing behind it. The detail of the plane itself is a bit obscured due to the angle and the perspective, emphasizing the spray pattern over the machinery. The backdrop is a clear sky, transitioning from a deeper blue at the top to a lighter gradation near the horizon, indicating either early morning or late afternoon. This scene encapsulates a moment of agricultural activity, focused on crop care and protection, providing a vivid portrayal of human intervention in nature.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["553044","542502","542503","542495","542504","553873","544606","548902","542654","553881","549094","548991","549178","548903","544491","548907"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","spray","pesticide","quadrant","angle","gradation","leave","vein","plane","protection"]}
