{"path":"545281.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view framed by the peeling, reddish-brown bark of a Madrona tree in the foreground. The focus through this natural frame is on a tranquil body of water, presumably a lake or river, with a reflective surface mirroring the sky and surroundings.\n\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a modest residential area with houses nestled among lush greenery. The middle-distance shows buildings with a waterfront view, one prominent among them appears to be on stilts, possibly indicating a boathouse or fishing lodge. The area surrounding the buildings is verdant, with dense trees and undergrowth, typical of a temperate forested region.\n\nIn the background, rolling hills rise gently, covered predominantly in coniferous trees, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright but overcast day.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the natural arched frame of the tree bark, draws attention not just to the lake and the dwellings across it but also to the peaceful coexistence of human habitation and nature. The texture and color of the tree bark in the foreground provide a stark contrast to the tranquil and lush scene visible through the natural archway.","title":"Madrone trees with peeling bark.
