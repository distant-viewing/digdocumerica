{"path":"545182.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up shot of a person handling a large, brown crab. The person is holding the crab by one of its claws using a sturdy tool, possibly a pair of tongs, which is partially visible at the top left of the frame. The tool features a blue, worn-out handle indicating frequent use.\n\nThe crab's shell and claws are the main focus, showing a range of brown and orange hues with visible textures and patterns. Its legs dangle downward and its pincer is visible, emphasizing its size and the firm grip of the person handling it.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there appears to be a metal grid or cage, likely used for trapping or storing these crabs, hinting at a fishing or seafood harvesting setting. The surrounding area is shaded, possibly casting shadows from a boat or a dock structure, emphasizing the outdoor, sunny environment suggested by the bright lighting in the shot.\n\nThe composition of the photo, focusing on the action of handling the crab with tools, tells a story of marine life harvesting, possibly for culinary purposes.","title":"Dungeness crabs are taken from pots and measured.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543909","543912","553913","545089","544264","552285","550316","545175","546214","543905","543916","546297","552284","554005","552307","545174"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["crab","handle","harvesting","tool","shot","person","claw","cage","seafood","trap"]}
