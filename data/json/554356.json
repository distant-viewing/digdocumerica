{"path":"554356.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a stark industrial scene dominated by mounds of compressed and crushed metallic debris, likely from cars or other vehicles, piled alongside a railway track. The metal scraps are contorted and tangled into large, chaotic heaps with various colors, mostly rusts and grays, peeping through their mangled forms. Some parts reflect signs of paint, pointing to their vehicular origin.\n\nThe railway track itself is composed of wooden railroad ties and steel rails that lead directly towards the horizon. It appears unused or in disrepair, evidenced by small stones and debris scattered over the ties and the rusty condition of the rails.\n\nThe background features a low, overcast sky that casts a dull light over the scene, enhancing the somber and abandoned look. In the distance, a bridge spans across the horizon with several cars visible, suggesting some proximity to active human activities despite the desolation of the foreground. A flat landscape with minimal vegetation underlines the industrial and possibly post-apocalyptic vibe of the setting.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["552765","554353","554357","548147","547611","547610","549307","554301","554346","548109","554300","556324","554318","542585","542590","545059"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["rail","railway","tie","track","compress","underline","origin","pee","tangle","crush"]}
