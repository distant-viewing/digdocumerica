{"path":"542930.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph displays a majestic and atmospheric scene within a dense forest, characterized by towering trees and enveloped in mist. These impressive trees, likely conifers, are thick and tall, dominating the composition with their height. The image captures a low-angle view, looking up towards the canopy, which is not visible due to the thickness and height of the trees.\n\nThe forest emanates an ethereal feel, heavily accentuated by the mist or fog that fills the space between the trees, softening the outlines and creating a moody, almost mystical atmosphere. Sunlight streams through the mist at various angles, creating beams of light that highlight the moisture in the air. These shafts of light add a dynamic quality to the otherwise muted and monochromatic color palette, primarily composed of dark greens and grays.\n\nThe trees are spaced somewhat closely but not densely, allowing some visibility through the forest. The lower parts of the trees show rough, possibly moss-covered bark, suggesting a humid or damp environment typical of a rainforest.\n\nThere is no visible ground in the photograph due to the chosen angle, emphasizing the verticality and imposing nature of the trees. This angle also contributes a sense of grandeur and the feeling of being small when compared to the vastness of nature. The atmosphere is quiet and serene, likely cool and damp, typical of a forested area covered in mist. Overall, the composition and setting convey a deep connection with nature and a sense of awe at its beauty and scale.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542569","542575","555125","557601","554965","555124","543406","555128","554959","553574","542849","557596","542929","542725","555051","542931"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["mist","angle","forest","tree","height","choose","thickness","rainforest","shaft","verticality"]}
