{"path":"550925.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and bustling beach scene, likely from the late 20th century given the style of cars and beachwear. The main focus is on a crowded parking area filled with a variety of vintage cars in different colors and styles, ranging from sedans to station wagons. The cars are parked in disarray, suggesting a busy day at the beach with no formal parking arrangement.\n\nIn the background, there's a lively beach filled with people. Numerous beachgoers can be seen under a collection of colorful beach umbrellas, mostly in shades of yellow and blue, providing shade from the sunny day. The density of umbrellas creates a patchwork of colors.\n\nThere is a lifeguard stand visible on the left side of the image, signifying watch over the beachgoers for safety. Additionally, a sign saying \"BEACH SERVICE RENTALS\", along with a large flag, can be seen in the middle background, suggesting the availability of beach chairs, umbrellas, and possibly other recreational items for rent.\n\nThe ocean is barely visible in the background due to the crowd and umbrellas but contributes to the overall beach atmosphere of the scene. The general ambiance is one of leisure and summer activity, with people dressed in swimwear and casual beach attire, enjoying a warm day by the sea.","title":"Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island Galveston's 30 miles of ocean front makes it one of the most popular of Gulf Coast resorts.","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["545857","550934","557475","547499","550933","550922","547478","550921","547495","545252","548929","545237","546412","550931","547503","550928"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","umbrella","beachgoer","parking","availability","car","watch","disarray","patchwork","stand"]}
