{"path":"549668.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a person's hands holding an open leaflet or notice. The paper is prominently displayed and readable, suggesting the focus of the image is on its content.\n\nThe leaflet reads as an official notice from the \"Federal Police Headquarters VIENNA,\" addressing a violation of traffic regulations, particularly no stopping or parking in a designated area. The text is polite but firm, notifying the recipient of their infraction and expressing hope for future cooperation in maintaining traffic order. It ends with a signature from the \"Chief of Police.\"\n\nThe individual holding the notice is not completely visible; only their hands and part of their attire are shown. One can observe that the person is wearing a dark blazer or jacket, suggesting a formal or semi-formal attire style.\n\nThe background is blurred, with some light and dark forms that make it indistinct, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the leaflet and the holder's hands. The overall composition uses a shallow depth of field to emphasize the document while softly suggesting the environment and context.","title":"Vienna's pedestrian-only zones are guarded by police women.
