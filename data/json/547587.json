{"path":"547587.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban decay and abandonment. The focus of the image is an old, white car that appears to be from the mid-20th century. The car is heavily vandalized and missing parts, including the front hood and some side panels, exposing the engine and internal framework. It sits awkwardly among large heaps of debris.\n\nThe surrounding environment adds to the sense of desolation. In the foreground, there are scattered, broken wooden planks and pallets, covering much of the ground and contributing to a disorganized, neglected atmosphere. Beyond the car, partially collapsed and heavily rusted structures—likely parts of an old warehouse or similar industrial facility—add to the setting of decay. These structures have gaping holes and bent metal components, indicating long-term exposure to elements and neglect.\n\nOverhead, the sky is overcast, casting a grey, somber light over the scene, which emphasizes the themes of abandonment and decay. This lighting condition also brings out the textures and the muted colors of the rust and the weathered wood.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a stark and melancholic tableau, highlighting themes of neglect, decay, and the remnants of industrial activity.","title":"State pier","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547917","553007","554302","552997","545540","544060","549107","553009","546400","542590","547484","554536","547481","545743","547771","545295"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["decay","abandonment","neglect","pallet","car","hole","tableau","theme","heap","hood"]}
