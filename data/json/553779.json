{"path":"553779.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape view which combines natural and urban elements. The foreground shows a densely packed suburban area, likely a town or small city, containing numerous small houses or buildings clustered together. The architecture and layout suggest a quiet, residential setting.\n\nThe middle ground features slightly open areas with some isolated buildings, possibly larger commercial structures or industrial complexes, surrounded by patches of greenery or fields. These provide a buffer between the residential foreground and the dramatic natural scenery in the background.\n\nThe background is dominated by a majestic mountain range that looms over the scene. The mountains are steep and craggy, hinting at volcanic origins, typical of island terrains. Their slopes appear lush, likely covered in dense vegetation which is common in tropical or subtropical climates. Alongside the base of these mountains, one can see a coastline with a sandy beach and the ocean extending towards the horizon. A small boat is visible on the water, adding a sense of scale and activity to the otherwise tranquil natural setting.\n\nThe lighting suggests this image was taken during the day under clear skies, given the brightness and visibility in the photograph. The photograph provides a vivid contrast between human settlement and nature, typical of regions where urban areas adjoin significant natural landmarks.","title":"Hawaii--valley near Kaneohe on windward side of Oahu, Oahu I","placename":"Kaneohe (Hawaii)","location":"Kaneohe, Hawaii","nn1":["553778","553677","557532","543429","554064","552603","553676","546407","554090","554052","550639","554091","556953","552171","553675","554020"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["mountain","buffer","origin","landmark","settlement","island","brightness","coastline","scenery","layout"]}
