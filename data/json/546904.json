{"path":"546904.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a water treatment facility. In the foreground, there's a wide channel filled with agitated, foamy water that seems to be overflowing slightly. Sunlight reflects off the surface, highlighting the froth of the water.\n\nThe middle of the image features a long narrow walkway that spans across the water. On the walkway, one individual dressed in red with a yellow protective helmet is standing. This person is holding what appears to be a water sampling device or a tool involved in monitoring or maintenance of the facility.\n\nIn the background, there's a small, traditional building with a pale yellow facade and dark roof, located near the tree line of a leafless forest, which suggests the season might be late fall or winter. The sky is a clear blue, indicating a sunny day. This setting provides an industrial yet somewhat secluded environment, focusing mainly on the interaction of the individual with the water treatment process.","title":"Aerating sewage is one step of the process at the back river sewage treatment plant","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["543810","543803","548212","547568","542988","542982","543804","544689","543573","543568","548196","544040","542990","549636","543572","542987"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","walkway","water","sampling","froth","overflow","facility","monitoring","channel","device"]}
