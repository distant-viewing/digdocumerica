Several red trucks, branded with the name \"PETRO,\" are prominently featured. In the foreground, a truck is in motion, slightly blurred, indicating it's traveling past the camera. In the midground, there are stationary tankers being filled under a series of canopies, providing some shade for workers who are visible but not distinct. Beyond the trucks, the backdrop includes harbor cranes and industrial buildings, alluding to a waterfront industrial area. A myriad of overhead cables and a traffic light are also visible, crossing above the scene. The overall atmosphere of the image captures busy industrial operations, likely focused on fuel distribution.","title":"Allens avenue--waterfront industrial area","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551977","549978","548437","557385","555777","546221","551987","549977","552131","555724","547666","550911","555786","546212","547569","547505"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["truck","distribution","allude","myriad","tanker","gasoline","fuel","harbor","brand","cable"]}
