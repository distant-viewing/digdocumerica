{"path":"544799.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a sprawling landfill under a clear blue sky. The landscape is densely covered with various forms of waste including paper, plastics, cardboard boxes, and other discarded items. The myriad of rubble creates a chaotic texture across the terrain, revealing various colors amid predominantly earth tones. The horizon is slightly visible at the upper part of the image, emphasizing the vastness of the landfill area. There are a few fence posts visible near the horizon, suggesting some attempt to manage or enclose the site. The ground shimmers slightly, indicating either wetness or the reflective nature of some of the materials discarded in the landfill. The wide-angle of the shot captures the massive scale of waste accumulation, conveying a sense of environmental overload. No humans or animals are visible, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the environmental impact highlighted by the sprawling waste.","title":"Open dump","placename":"Aurora (Colo.)","location":"Aurora, Colorado","nn1":["548210","549747","550256","549739","557307","544637","549750","554541","543832","546246","549748","545299","553433","550801","549762","550248"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","wetness","myriad","attempt","rubble","cardboard","accumulation","horizon","plastic"]}
