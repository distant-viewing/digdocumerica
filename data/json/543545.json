{"path":"543545.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene marina setting during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening, given the soft lighting and long shadows present. The image prominently features three sailboats moored closely together in calm water, creating gentle, wavy reflections on the surface. One of the boats in the foreground is named \"Chabma\". The boats are mostly white, with masts standing tall and rigging visible, pointing to their readiness for sailing.\n\nIn the background, there are further indications of a well-equipped marina: additional boats are visible, and there's a small, white building that likely serves a functional purpose for the marina, such as storage or office space. There is also a crane-like structure, possibly used for lifting boats in and out of the water. Behind all these, dense trees line the background and partially obscure the sky, enhancing the secluded and tranquil feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition is focused on the tranquility of the boating environment, capturing the quiet beauty of the marina and the reflective quality of the water, which adds a layer of calmness to the scene. The image invites the viewer to appreciate both the leisurely purpose of the sailboats and the functional infrastructure of the marina that supports them.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542904","543246","546388","556191","548247","542903","544661","549407","542872","548546","548515","544248","544669","542871","542907","546877"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","sailboat","purpose","readiness","rigging","indication","appreciate","mast","calmness"]}
