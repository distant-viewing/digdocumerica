{"path":"547563.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of maritime labor, specifically fishermen at work. It is set on the open water, under what appears to be bright, possibly early morning or late afternoon sunlight. The key focus is on three fishermen engaged in pulling nets filled with fish aboard their small vessel. \n\nThe fisherman closest to the foreground is bending over the net, pulling it aboard, his attire consisting of a yellow hat and a brown jacket suggesting protective and practical workwear typical in fishing. Next to him, partially visible, another fisherman in a yellow and white outfit assists in the task. The third fisherman stands on the right side of the boat overseeing the operation, dressed in a beige sweater and darker pants.\n\nThe sea around the boat sparkles under the sunlight, hinting at calm sea conditions, suitable for fishing. The net appears heavy and laden with catch, suggesting a successful fishing effort.\n\nIn the background, the vast open sea stretches to the horizon, merging seamlessly with a clear sky. This backdrop highlights the isolation and vast working environment of the fishermen. The composition of the image, with its focus on labor and the vastness of nature, evokes a sense of hard work and the scale of the oceanic surroundings fishermen operate within.","title":"Trap nets are set at the mouth of the Sakonnet River in April and May.
