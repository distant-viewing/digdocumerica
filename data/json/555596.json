{"path":"555596.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural landscape under a partly cloudy blue sky. In the foreground, there is a large puddle or small pond reflecting the light, surrounded by grassy terrain. The ground is uneven and appears somewhat dry, perhaps indicative of recently rainy weather given the presence of the water. The middle ground stretches out into an expanse of grasslands, with some patches looking greener than others, suggesting variations in vegetation or soil moisture. In the distance, there appears to be a rolling hill, topped with trees and what might be a small structure or a group of structures, possibly a farm or rural buildings. This distant element adds a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The colors in the photograph are rich yet slightly faded, typical of a vintage film, giving the image a nostalgic feeling. Overall, this is a tranquil, natural setting with no visible human activity or modern structures, emphasizing a serene and pastoral mood.","title":"Previously strip mined land has been recontoured by the coal companies off Route #519 near New Athens, Ohio.","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["551304","549142","549227","545040","549186","549236","549256","549146","557087","557749","555603","557946","555567","552903","554722","554803"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["grassland","puddle","moisture","film","variation","pond","farm","feeling","structure","ground"]}
