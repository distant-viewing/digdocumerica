{"path":"548270.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This is a photograph taken on an elevated subway platform, presumably at 125th Street, as indicated by the sign in the scene. The image features a single individual, a person wearing a dark red jacket and grey pants, standing by a railing adorned with graffiti. The person is leaning slightly over the railing, looking down towards the street or tracks below.\n\nThe background scene is somewhat blurred and depicts an urban landscape with various buildings, some of which have visible signage. There is noticeable smoke or steam rising above the buildings, contributing to the gritty urban atmosphere. The skyline is diverse, featuring buildings of different sizes and architectural styles, possibly indicating a downtown or busy section of a city.\n\nThe overall color tones in the photograph are subdued, with a lot of grays and dark colors, enhancing the feeling of an overcast day. The platform itself displays signs of weathering and considerable use, evident from patches on the ground and the overall worn appearance of the railing and furnishings.\n\nThe scene captures a moment of quiet contemplation or observation, set against the backdrop of a bustling city environment. The presence of graffiti adds a layer of urban texture and might suggest the area's socio-cultural dynamics during the time the photo was taken.","title":"125th street elevated train platform","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548254","556821","548265","556662","556663","556811","556650","556651","548253","554325","548273","548263","548274","550022","553823","548259"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railing","graffito","platform","furnishings","dynamics","subway","city","downtown","weathering","person"]}
