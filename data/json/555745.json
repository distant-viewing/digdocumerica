{"path":"555745.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures an elevated aerial perspective of an urban landscape, mostly likely depicting the outskirts of a large city. The focal point of the photograph is a complex and expansive highway system, featuring multiple levels of curving roads, exits, and overpasses. This intricate network of roads is filled with cars, indicating a time of moderate traffic.\n\nAdjacent to the highway, there are several prominent structures and features to note. On the left side, there is a long, high-rise bridge that stretches across a wide river, which is likely a significant waterway given its breadth. The river is filled with various boats, including what appears to be cargo ships, hinting at the areaâ€™s industrial use.\n\nThroughout the image, there are numerous industrial and commercial buildings, some of which are large and warehouse-like, suggesting a heavy industrial zone. Several cranes and other large machinery can be seen near the waterfront, supporting the industrial activities in the area.\n\nThe right side of the photograph showcases more greenery, with patches of what seem to be parks or recreational areas nestled among the urban environment. Notably, there is a spherical structure reminiscent of a water tower, which is situated close to the highway.\n\nThe background extends to a haze-covered horizon, indicating either fog, smog, or a blend of both, characteristic of many bustling industrial cities. The skyline is relatively flat, with no immediate signs of taller skyscrapers, suggesting that the photograph might be taken at the city's edge. \n\nOverall, the image provides a comprehensive view of a busy urban and industrial sprawl, characterized by transportation infrastructures like highways and bridges, alongside significant industrial operations by the riverbank.","title":"The Triboro Bridge, a major artery into Manhattan, New York. Transportation in an urban and industrial area like New York produces environmental problems of its own. Freeways sprawl across the landscape and cut through cities, isolating one neighborhood from another. The auto must take responsibility for air pollution, one of more critical problems of the environment which affect the bight.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548344","555762","553015","555744","547764","553001","546678","546709","547770","546573","546578","553838","546616","544634","546726","552719"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["highway","city","bridge","breadth","overpass","exit","outskirt","sprawl","note","river"]}
