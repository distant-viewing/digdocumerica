{"path":"553572.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a haunting landscape of a burned forest. It captures a silhouette of tall, bare tree trunks standing against a dark blue sky. The trees are leafless with intricate branches that stretch upwards. The foreground is dominated by shadows and the texture of scorched earth and remains of undergrowth, hinting at the devastation of a forest fire. The composition utilizes a low angle, making the trees appear imposing as they rise high into the sky, enhancing the somber and eerie feel of the scene. The lighting suggests either dawn or dusk, with the sky appearing slightly lighter at the top, providing a natural contrast to the darkened ground and blackened tree trunks. The overall mood is solemn and reflective, emphasizing the aftermath of forest destruction.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora scene within the section of the burn area known as \"granite fire.\"  This part of the territory has not yet been logged","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553571","546065","553561","553583","555202","542819","553626","545747","555088","543843","553565","546121","555162","555159","553625","555113"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["forest","trunk","haunt","blacken","devastation","undergrowth","burn","darken","destruction","tree"]}
