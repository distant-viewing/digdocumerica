{"path":"550749.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a landscape predominantly covered by a body of water and lush green vegetation. The water appears dark brown, interspersed liberally with dense patches of what looks like green aquatic vegetation, possibly algae or water lilies. There are areas where the water is more visible, showing a rippling surface that reflects light.\n\nOn the bottom right of the image, resting along the edge of the water body, is a small residence with a visible white or light-colored roof. The house is surrounded by greenery and has a cleared area that seems to be a small personal garden. Adjacent to the house, there are utility poles running parallel to a dark, narrow pathway or road that slightly curves and disappears into the denser tree areas.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is thick with trees and vegetation, evidencing very little human disturbance besides the small house and road. Overall, the image conveys a serene, possibly secluded environment, where nature dominates the landscape.","title":"Algae collect inside bays of the Fox River between Appleton and Green Bay. There are 19 sources of industrial pollution along this 40-mile stretch. The problem is compounded by algae in Lake Winnebago, which die in the lake, decompose in the river, and pass into the bay.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556981","558046","556931","556955","550757","544557","556964","550601","556972","556937","545896","550569","556928","555702","552141","555728"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["house","lily","disappear","residence","water","algae","vegetation","disturbance","clear","road"]}
