{"path":"542789.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a wooded scene, featuring the rugged, natural beauty of a dense forest. In the left foreground, a large, thick tree trunk, displaying rough, dark bark textures, supports a sign. The white sign affixed to the tree has bold, legible text and an emblem resembling a forest service symbol. It reads \"STREAMSIDE AREA TRACTORS PROHIBITED BEHIND THIS SIGN,\" indicating a protective measure for the area.\n\nBehind this, the landscape slopes down where a forest officer, clad in a typical uniform with a hat and boots, stands on rough terrain consisting of dirt and underbrush. The officer is looking towards the area possibly patrolled or inspected, portraying a sense of duty and vigilance towards protecting the natural surroundings.\n\nThe background extends into dense forestry; towering conifer trees, with their rich green foliage, dominate the scene. These trees range in size, suggesting a lush and mature forest environment. The lighting is soft, possibly filtered through clouds or mist, enhancing the deep greens and the brown earthy tones of the scene. Overall, the composition suggests a sense of solitude and the importance of conservation efforts in such pristine natural environments.","title":"Clear cut area and logger","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542568","544913","555116","542791","551962","545488","554958","547011","553457","553635","542745","542753","550664","550351","542604","555198"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["officer","forest","measure","emblem","tractor","forestry","symbol","importance","tree","conservation"]}
