{"path":"547179.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of an elderly man looking directly into the camera. He appears to be in his 70s or 80s, wearing large black-rimmed glasses, with a gentle and thoughtful expression on his face. His skin shows signs of aging, such as wrinkles and spots, indicating a life with considerable outdoor activity.\n\nThe man is wearing a dark-colored baseball cap, which is faded and appears well-worn. He is dressed in layered shirts; the outer one is long-sleeved with visible vertical ribbing and a light blue color that has a worn texture. Beneath it, he wears a darker buttoned shirt, which appears to be black or dark gray.\n\nHis demeanor and the style of his clothing suggest he might be involved in activities like farming, fishing, or another occupation that involves physical outdoor work. His expression and the direct gaze into the camera convey a strong, resilient character with a lot of life experience.\n\nThe background of the photograph is out of focus, emphasizing the subject. The colors are muted, mostly earth tones, which blend seamlessly with the man's attire, suggesting that the photo could have been taken in a natural outdoor setting.","title":"Long-time resident of bass lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["556563","552871","552103","554857","547282","542613","553605","552872","543701","554846","548224","548616","548251","556452","548218","548226"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["occupation","80s","70","rim","baseball","portrait","expression","camera","farming","skin"]}
