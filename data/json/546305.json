{"path":"546305.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals engaged in the activity of handling oysters on the deck of a boat. The scene takes place on a sunny day with the ocean visible in the background, suggesting that the boat is on open water. One person, wearing a striped grey t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, is bending over to pick up an oyster from an open metal bucket. This person also has a helmet, and his posture indicates involvement in a physical task. The other individual, clad in a red sleeveless shirt and jeans, is actively selecting or examining oysters spread out on a grey, stained surface on the boat deck. This person is also wearing a helmet, which along with the casual dress suggests a working or recreational activity related to marine or coastal environments.\n\nThe deck area is framed with white and grey walls of the boat, and parts of a rod, possibly for fishing or related activities, are seen in the upper right corner. The floor of the deck where oysters are scattered appears dirty and used, indicating frequent activity in this area. Overall, the image portrays a moment of laborious engagement with marine life, possibly during an oyster harvesting or sorting process, against the backdrop of a clear day at sea.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: Aboard the Dolphin.
