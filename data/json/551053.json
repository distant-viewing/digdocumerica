{"path":"551053.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph presents an industrial landscape framed against a mountainous background. In the foreground, there is an industrial complex with multiple buildings of various architectural styles and functions, marked by the presence of smokestacks, storage tanks, and processing facilities. Large volumes of smoke or steam are being emitted from several stacks, contributing to a heavy, dense atmosphere. The smoke billows upward and diffuses, partially enveloping the industrial setup and blending into the hazy sky. The background features lush, green mountain slopes, which juxtapose the industrial activity in the foreground. The overall atmosphere of the scene appears somber and polluted, likely suggesting environmental impacts due to industrial operations. The color palette is muted with a dominance of grays and blues, hinting at the overcast conditions and contributing to the sense of a polluted environment.","title":"Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant at Alloy, as seen from across the Kanawha River at Deepwater","placename":"Charleston (W.
