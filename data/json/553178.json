{"path":"553178.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two individuals. In the foreground, a woman is featured prominently; she is smiling broadly, showcasing an expression of joy and engagement. Her hair is styled in a voluminous afro, and she wears a red top with a plaid skirt. The focus on her face and the blur of her movements suggest an animated conversation or interaction.\n\nFacing her, and slightly out of focus, is another person, visible mostly by their back and side profile. This individual is wearing a bright, patterned shirt and a white cowboy hat adorned with what seems like lace and patterned detailing.\n\nThe background consists of a blur of vertical lines and soft lights, likely from an indoor or urban setting in the evening, given the artificial lighting visible through what might be window slits at the top of the image. The setting provides a neutral backdrop that contrasts with the vivid and dynamic foreground interaction of the two individuals. The overall composition conveys a spontaneous, lively moment caught in an otherwise static and structured environment.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: on \"Speaker's Landing\" overlooking the square.
