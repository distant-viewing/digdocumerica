{"path":"546386.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, outdoor setting that seems to be a path alongside some dense vegetation. The main focus of the image is a signpost prominently positioned on the left side of the frame. The sign is in Spanish and reads, \"PROHIBIDO ECHAR BASURA $10000 MULTA MAXIMA,\" which translates to \"It is forbidden to dump trash. $10,000 maximum fine.\" This indicates that the area is likely protected or part of a conservation effort to keep it clean and free of litter.\n\nBehind and around the signpost, there are dense green bushes and a variety of trees that fill the backdrop with a rich tapestry of leaves and branches. The light filtering through the trees suggests that this photo was taken on a sunny day, which illuminates parts of the path and the vegetation. On the bottom left corner, there appears to be a collection of leaves or possibly some discarded items, although it's difficult to discern precisely.\n\nTowards the middle and right of the frame, the photograph shows broken and rusted parts of what might be an old vehicle or machinery mixed within the undergrowth, adding a sense of neglect or historical abandonment to the scene. The ground is uneven and covered with a blend of dirt, leaves, and small plants, reinforcing the natural and untamed character of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the warning sign against a background of natural and somewhat disordered elements, creates a narrative about environmental protection and the impacts of human activity on natural sites.","title":"Abandoned autos","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["545517","552084","554103","542789","544648","544813","547123","551247","545109","544640","553729","545624","544262","546805","543104","553905"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["signpost","leave","path","disorder","cove","tapestry","undergrowth","dump","warning","protection"]}
