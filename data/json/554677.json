{"path":"554677.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features an older man standing outdoors. He is dressed in a vibrant hunting outfit, with a red flat cap decorated with a badge, a red jacket over a plaid shirt, and brown trousers that are tucked into red gaiters over his boots. His attire suggests he may be involved in a hunting or outdoor activity, emphasized by the small, dark holster hanging from his belt on his right side.\n\nThe background is softly focused and shows an autumnal setting with trees shedding their leaves, hinting that it is likely in a forest or rural area. The sunlight casts a warm glow, enhancing the earth tones of the surroundings and the manâ€™s weathered face. His expression is contemplative, suggesting he may be pausing from his activity or possibly observing the environment.\n\nThe composition of the image, featuring the man centered and slightly turned, provides a strong sense of his presence and character in the context of the great outdoors. It captures a moment that reflects both the tranquility and the ruggedness of an outdoor adventure.","title":"Hunter on opening day of the big game season in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at moose river plains the plains is a state primitive recreational area","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554521","554680","542613","554678","553418","554926","551397","554522","548302","552113","547679","548236","554915","554797","557112","545091"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["outfin","hunt","hunting","tuck","pause","ruggedness","badge","outdoor","shed","decorate"]}
