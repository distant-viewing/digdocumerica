{"path":"556602.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a coal processing facility nestled in a lush, green valley. The main focus is a large structure comprised of tall, gray silos and interconnected metal conveyors that transport coal throughout the site. To the right, a freight train carrying numerous coal-loaded cars extends into the distance, indicating the operationâ€™s scale and its reliance on rail transport.\n\nVarious smaller buildings are visible around the main silos, likely serving as offices or maintenance shops. The terrain is surrounded by thick woodland, which encroaches close to the industrial operations, highlighting a contrast between nature and industrial activity.\n\nThe environment is overcast, suggesting either early morning or late evening light, casting an even, diffused light over the scene without harsh shadows, which emphasizes the industrial atmosphere of the setting. There are some vehicles visible, including trucks, which are probably used for transport and logistics within the facility.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image captures both the scale of the industrial operation and its integration into the natural landscape, underlining themes of industry, transportation, and environment.","title":"Very large coal mine in Appalachia, Virginia, near Kingsport, Tennessee.
