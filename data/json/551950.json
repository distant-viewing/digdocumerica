{"path":"551950.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene at a residential property. A person, visible only from the chest up, is peeking out from behind a large cardboard box labeled \"TERI DISPOSAL TOWELS\". The box also features some text and numbers which suggest some form of commercial or merchandise information, such as discount details.\n\nThe individual, who appears to be a mature adult, is standing in an open doorway that leads to a small porch or entryway stepping down into a yard. This doorway is part of a white-sided house with a distinct, yet simple architectural style. Next to the door, part of a window can be seen, indicating another room adjacent to the entry.\n\nTo the left of the image, there's a clearer view of the house's roofing, showing a somewhat weathered red shingle roof with a tall chimney pipe extending upward, showing signs of rust and wear.\n\nThe ground in front of the house has patches of grass, and there are a few logs scattered around, possibly indicating recent yard work or preparation for fireplace use. The surroundings suggest a calm, residential setting with practical use of space around the house. The overall atmosphere is homey with a touch of aging character in the building's exterior and the utilitarian objects around.","title":"Man carries out carton of belongings salvaged after lake storm flooded his home.
