{"path":"551290.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of what appears to be an arcade or amusement center. In the foreground, slightly out of focus, is a plush toy resembling a dragon or dinosaur, presented as a prize. More plush toys, including a pink fluffy object, hang from the ceiling behind the display glass. The center of the image shows a young man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a light short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers. He is leaning over, intently focused on a pinball machine, which is situated inside a well-lit glass display that also contains other tabletop arcade games or devices.\n\nThe interior is brightly illuminated by fluorescent lights, reflecting off the white tiled ceiling and enhancing the visibility of various smaller arcade games arranged within the room. The background through the window shows a night-time exterior view of a parking lot, indicating that the establishment is located in a commercial area. The overall atmosphere conveys a typical leisure scene from a past decade, likely the 1970s or 1980s, characterized by casual entertainment and vintage gaming machines.","title":"Pinball games in a Renovated garage on \"the Strip,\" a commercial playground beginning at Bagnell Dam and winding about a mile or so along the ridge tops to the south.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["546975","543990","543975","558302","545461","547739","551293","551296","547794","542765","555332","552647","547376","551902","549378","545444"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["toy","game","ceiling","glass","machine","entertainment","amusement","tile","establishment","night"]}
