{"path":"556573.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a man seated at a desk, deeply focused on his work. The man has a full beard and mustache, and he is wearing a light blue hospital-style scrub top. He seems to be in the middle of analyzing or reading a long sheet of paper that he is holding in his hands, while also holding a pen in his right hand, suggesting he might be making notes or calculations.\n\nThe background shows an office-like setting with shelves containing various items including boxes, what appears to be a binder, and possibly electronic equipment like a phone and a monitor or another computer device. The lighting in the room is soft and the general color tone is cool, which complements the calm and concentrated mood of the scene.","title":"Dr. Donald Rasmussen, physician in charge of the black lung laboratory at the Appalachian Regional Hospital in Beckley, West Virginia. Miners who have been turned away by other doctors come to him to learn whether they have an accumulation of coal dust particles filling the air sacks in the lungs and causing a progressive shortness of breath. A chest specialist, the doctor uses known testing methods in checking for black lung symptoms.","placename":"Beckley (W.
