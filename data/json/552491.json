{"path":"552491.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image features an old, weathered house showing signs of abandonment and deterioration. The structure, possibly a residential home, is characterized by peeling and faded wooden siding, and parts of the exterior appear damaged or missing. It's a two-story building with a pointed roof and a chimney visible at the peak. There are multiple windows, some with broken panes, adding to the deserted appearance.\n\nThe house has a covered front porch with decorative pillars that are still intact but show significant wear. The porchâ€™s wooden floor appears weathered and uneven, and there is no visible door, just an open entryway leading into the dark interior of the house.\n\nIn the foreground, the yard is overgrown with tall grasses and weeds, suggesting the property has been neglected for some time. A chain-link fence partially encircles the property, indicating an attempt at demarcation or security.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, there is a large tree with thick branches and foliage; some of it looks dried or dying, which complements the atmosphere of neglect visible in the rest of the scene. In the background beyond the tree, you can glimpse an open field under a cloudy sky, which contributes to the rural and isolated feeling of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph evoke a sense of abandonment, decay, and a bygone era.","title":"Deserted house near small crossroads village of Detroit","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["552494","552455","557640","557346","554818","554707","557141","554822","546989","557633","550113","555632","554799","542588","551115","555612"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["property","house","porch","abandonment","demarcation","entryway","attempt","security","deterioration","weed"]}
