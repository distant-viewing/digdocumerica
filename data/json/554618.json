{"path":"554618.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a lively lakeside summer scene. In the foreground, a large number of bicycles are parked in disarray against a chain-link fence. Beyond the fence, a sandy beach is populated with people engaged in various activities typical of a day at the lake. Some individuals are sunbathing on beach towels, while others walk along the shore. There are multiple groups of people, children and adults alike, some standing and chatting, others seated or actively playing.\n\nIn the water, more people can be seen swimming or floating near a dock with a slide, which appears to be a popular attraction, hinting at joyful water play occurring there. The lake surface reflects glimmers of light, suggesting it's a bright sunny day.\n\nThe background features a dense tree line around the lake, which enhances the secluded and tranquil feel of the setting. A wooden house with a prominent deck sits on the opposite side of the beach, adjacent to docks harboring various small boats, suggesting recreational boating as another activity enjoyed by visitors.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of casual, summertime enjoyment and recreation, set in a picturesque lakeside environment. The composition and elements within the frame — from bicycles to beachgoers to boats — collectively depict a quintessential summer day shared by a community.","title":"Public beach at Old Forge, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558233","554476","551543","553446","553447","544442","557772","544002","546955","544006","553445","545267","543998","552978","543518","546941"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["beach","bicycle","lake","summer","dock","glimmer","fence","slide","summertime","beachgoer"]}
