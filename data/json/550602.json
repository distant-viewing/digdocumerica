{"path":"550602.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape, predominantly characterized by its layered vegetation and mountainous terrain. The foreground features a thick cluster of trees with vibrant green and golden foliage, indicative of either early autumn or late summer. These trees are likely a mix of deciduous and coniferous species.\n\nMoving beyond the foreground, the middle of the image shows expanses covered with taller, dense trees, possibly a coniferous forest, exhibiting dark green hues that contrast with the lighter colors of the foreground. \n\nThe background of the scene is dominated by a mountain. The mountain's slope appears gentle and is covered with a mixture of low-lying shrubs and grasses, conveying a sense of undulating terrain rather than steep cliffs. The color palette here shifts to brown and dark green, suggesting either a change in vegetation type or the effects of seasonal change.\n\nThe sky, partially visible at the top of the photograph, is a deep blue, hinting at clear weather conditions, which enhances the overall visibility and color saturation of the landscape. This setting does not show any human activity, structures, or animals, emphasizing its untouched and tranquil nature. The light in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the softness and angle of the light, adding a calm and serene mood to the scene.","title":"Alpine environment is characteristic of this region.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548025","555217","543582","557159","554715","550604","550536","557127","554398","555110","554531","550603","550537","554718","554459","558088"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["change","softness","mountain","shift","saturation","specie","undulate","terrain","mixture","autumn"]}
