{"path":"548198.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph displays a group of people engaged in a clean-up activity along a riverside. The setting appears to be a wide, open area near a river, characterized by a sparse landscape with minimal vegetation and visible driftwood scattered about.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple individuals, including children and adults, are actively participating in the clean-up. They are collecting debris and trash, coupled with handling logs and other natural materials. One child, noticeable by the blue and orange scarf typical of scouts, is bending over near a log.\n\nThe middle ground stretches wider across the scene with various other participants dispersed across the area, all seemingly involved in similar activities. This includes picking up litter and arranging natural materials. The river, calm and expansive, forms the background, enhancing the sense of openness and tranquility of the surroundings.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures an active, community-oriented effort, possibly organized by a local group or scouting organization, focused on environmental clean-up and the restoration of a natural area.","title":"Cub Pack 16, from the Harvey Scott Grade School in Portland cleaning up beach litter at Sauvie Island on the Columbia River.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548191","551427","551391","543927","545531","552948","550060","542655","544800","552085","552951","551421","551388","546863","545535","543176"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["up","log","restoration","child","scarf","driftwood","organization","litter","material","group"]}
