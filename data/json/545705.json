{"path":"545705.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people walking through a narrow canyon pathway. The path is surrounded by tall, vertical red rock walls that almost touch at the top, allowing only a sliver of light to enter. The canyon's ground is dusty and reddish-brown, typical of rocky desert environments.\n\nThe group consists of approximately two dozen individuals, most wearing hats to shield themselves from the sun. The people display a range of casual outdoor attire, indicating a recreational or touristic activity. The group appears diverse in age, with most facing away from the camera, walking deeper into the canyon. \n\nIn the foreground, two men are clearly visible. One wears a light grey blazer over a dark shirt and pants with a crossbody bag, and the other is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. The individuals are walking along, seemingly in conversation or observing their surroundings.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the scale of the canyon compared to the individuals, emphasizing the majestic and overwhelming nature of the landscape. The constricted space between the tall canyon walls creates a sense of adventure and exploration. The vertical orientation of the photograph enhances the height and narrowness of the canyon walls, concentrating the viewer’s attention on the path and the group’s journey through this striking natural corridor.","title":"Tourists must be guided through Fiery Furnace, an intricate maze of narrow canyons.
