{"path":"543342.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an old, possibly abandoned town. It features two prominent, aging buildings. On the left, there is a two-story building constructed of red brick, showing some signs of disrepair but still holding a solid structure. It has arched windows on the first floor, rectangular ones on the second, and a decorative architecture common to late 19th or early 20th century. The door and windows appear weathered, and some of the window panes are missing.\n\nAdjacent to it on the right is another two-story building, but this one displays more visible wear and tear. Its construction seems to be of wooden planks, weathered to a pale color, and it lacks the solid, robust look of the brick building. The buildingâ€™s rightmost section is covered by corrugated metal sheets that appear rusty and worn. The ground floor seems to have large openings that might have been storefronts or wide windows.\n\nBetween these buildings, there is a smaller structure, seemingly a wooden shack with a metal roof that also appears aged and rusted.\n\nIn front of the buildings, there's an old wooden wagon with decayed wheels, which adds to the historical and abandoned feel of the scene.\n\nThe background reveals a sparse, grassy field leading to a hillside, suggesting that these buildings might be situated in a valley or a rural mountain area. The overall mood of the photo is of a once-thriving place that has been left to the elements, providing a nostalgic sense of history and decay.","title":"\"ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543356","552681","543367","545233","543341","556330","543349","543344","543351","543354","543120","551111","543353","554707","557344","552997"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["abandon","window","buildings","building","decay","corrugate","19th","second","floor","shack"]}
