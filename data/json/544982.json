{"path":"544982.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures several pieces of raw fish, likely tuna, that are prepared and presented for cooking. The fish is skewered on sticks, showing both rich red flesh and some pieces with the skin-on, revealing a silver and black striped pattern typical of tuna skin. The varied cuts are placed on a grill, indicating that they are either being cooked or are ready to be cooked. The background is dark and blurry, focusing the viewer's attention on the brightly colored fish. There is also a visible can or container at the edge of the frame, which could be holding a marinade or sauce. Shadows and light play across the surface of the fish and grill, adding depth and texture to the image.","title":"Salmon bake, fund-raising affair for community of browns point","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544974","547848","545063","544987","544995","544978","554093","546366","544979","542892","554098","545075","554095","544986","546127","554094"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["cook","fish","grill","skin","piece","silver","stick","can","container","cut"]}
