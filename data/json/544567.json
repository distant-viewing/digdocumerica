{"path":"544567.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat rugged waterside scene. In the foreground, there is dark, rippling water that seems to surround the area. A small wooden dock extends into the water, with a couple of flat-bottom boats moored at its side. One of the boats is tilted, partially submerged, suggesting recent disuse or neglect.\n\nTo one side of the dock, there is a wooden outhouse-like structure with open sides, mounted directly on a floating platform, adding a rustic, utilitarian aspect to the scene. Adjacent to this, there is a modest cabin built on raised foundations, probably to protect it from potential water rise. The cabin, appearing aged, with a brownish-red exterior and a simple rectangular structure, has a sloping roof and a small, visible window. It suggests a functional, no-frills retreat space or a fishermanâ€™s shelter.\n\nThe background is dense with lush green trees, indicating a secluded, forested area. The variety of trees, thick underbrush, and the overall density suggest this location might be in a temperate forest or a wetland area.\n\nAbove, the sky is partly clouded, with some patches of blue sky, indicating a fair weather day. The light and shadows suggest it might be either morning or late afternoon. The overall composition and setting evoke a sense of isolated natural beauty, typical of wildlife or fishing retreats. The environment looks quiet and undisturbed except for the human-made structures, blending semi-rustically with its surroundings.","title":"Private vacation housing","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545005","544266","543527","544260","543579","554438","550293","545008","547965","557562","548030","555694","551312","548034","547027","545911"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["retreat","cabin","dock","underbrush","fisherman","foundation","disuse","boat","forest","shelter"]}
