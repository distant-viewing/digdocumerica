The construction appears to involve the erection of a large structure, possibly a dam, given the presence of concrete sections and cranes. The river cuts through the terrain, curving around the construction site and flowing through the broader area which is populated with scattered buildings that might serve as accommodations or operational support for the construction project. The backdrop includes rolling hills dotted with greenery and minor settlements. The sky is clear and scattered with white clouds, suggesting good weather conditions which illuminate the scene, highlighting the contrast between the natural landscape and industrial activity.","title":"Reservoir dam under construction, south of the city","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553392","553453","551193","553379","553353","545858","547235","550539","549169","547259","548361","548020","549166","553932","553380","544282"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["construction","accommodation","site","dam","hill","settlement","project","river","support","crane"]}
