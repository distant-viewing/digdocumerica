{"path":"554826.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph portrays a large industrial scene focused on a significant mining operation. Central to the image is a massive mining machine, possibly a dragline excavator, characterized by its substantial red and white boom that supports a large bucket used for excavating materials. This boom extends diagonally across the photograph, with the bucket at rest amidst a pile of excavated earth and rock. The body of the machine features robust, weathered metal construction painted in red and white, typical of heavy industrial machinery.\n\nThe excavator is positioned on a vast mound of uneven, rocky terrain primarily in shades of gray and black, suggesting a coal mining site. The surrounding environment is barren, with no visible vegetation, emphasizing the stark industrial nature of the location. Behind the mining operation, the land gradually rises, hinting at a hilly terrain under a clear sky. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows cast by the terrains and machinery, enhancing the rough textures of the rocks and metal surfaces.\n\nThis landscape is devoid of any visible human presence in the photograph, focusing solely on the mechanical and geological aspects of the mining operation. The scene captures the rugged and gritty essence of industrial activities involved in resource extraction.","title":"Shovel stripping land, off route 800, near Cadiz, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["552416","555644","552418","549124","552417","554831","555606","545831","543639","554772","554812","554828","544099","555586","549126","554769"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","excavator","boom","bucket","machine","operation","terrain","machinery","involved","extraction"]}
