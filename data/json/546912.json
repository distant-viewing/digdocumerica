{"path":"546912.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures four individuals in a small, orange powerboat moving over water. The boat is generating waves and spray as it speeds across the surface. It's equipped with an outboard motor and has internal seating upholstered in a matching orange color, contributing to a uniform and vibrant aesthetic.\n\nThe boat occupants appear to be enjoying themselves. From front to back: the first person is seated at the stern, handling the boat's controls and steering; the second is sitting beside them, slightly turned to face the rear; the third is the most visible and is standing in the center of the boat holding a camera, perhaps capturing the moment or the surrounding scenery; the fourth is seated at the bow, facing forward. All four individuals are men dressed casually, consistent with recreational boating.\n\nIn terms of surroundings, the photograph offers a close-up view of choppy dark blue water swirling around the boat, emphasizing the speed and movement of the vessel. There are no other visible elements in the immediate vicinity, focusing all attention on the boat and its occupants. The image encapsulates a dynamic moment of leisure and adventure on the water.","title":"Power boat underway in Annapolis harbor","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546348","551308","554199","550840","548520","548525","548736","551255","544122","546317","549622","545740","543940","549418","545179","544269"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","occupant","speed","upholster","second","motor","steer","generate","seat","seating"]}
