{"path":"544794.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution along a riverbank. Two children are present in the image, standing on and around a pile of discarded automotive parts and other debris. One child, wearing multi-colored pants and a dark jacket, is standing while looking out towards the river. The other, clad in a pastel yellow jacket and white pants, is seated on a car’s roof, reaching out towards something not visible in the image.\n\nThe surroundings are bleak, showcasing a dirty and littered river’s edge with a variety of junk items including crushed automobiles, exposed frames, detached car doors, and miscellaneous garbage scattered around. The river itself flows in a curve around a sandy bank, appearing murky. Beyond the river and debris, the landscape is flat with sparse vegetation and a few trees, under a pale blue, partly cloudy sky. The overall composition candidly captures the neglect and adverse environmental impact, framed with a focus that conveys a strong message about pollution and its interaction with the young generation.","title":"Children play on garbage dump","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555851","544810","555853","550205","547907","556942","546913","551560","551440","550352","552100","555852","550946","552098","546785","551531"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","pollution","child","generation","jacket","crush","pant","debris","automobile","garbage"]}
