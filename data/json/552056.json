{"path":"552056.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph showcases a barren landscape featuring deeply cracked, dry earth. The surface is a largely uniformed pattern of desiccated, dark grey soil, with wide, jagged cracks creating a textured pattern across the image. Central to the scene is the carcass of a small animal, possibly a fish, lying amidst the dry cracks. The creature's body is decayed and flattened, blending somewhat with the dusty hue of the soil, but with patches of shiny, silvery scales still clinging to the desiccated flesh. This creates a stark contrast to the matte, parched soil around it. The overall composition evokes a sense of desolation and the harshness of a drought-affected environment. There are no signs of vegetation, water or other life, which emphasizes the extreme dryness and lifeless atmosphere captured in the photo.","title":"Waters of the Kansas River have receded, exposing the riverbed.
