{"path":"551991.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a busy maritime scene, likely a river or harbor, demonstrating significant boat traffic and activity. The body of water is expansive, shimmering with ripples and light reflections, possibly indicating this image was taken on a sunny day. Various boats, including tugs and larger vessels, are navigating through the water, creating long, textured wake patterns that spread across the surface.\n\nIn the background, distant shorelines are visible, featuring both dense vegetation and urban development with several low-rise and high-rise buildings scattered throughout. The setting suggests a blend of industrial and perhaps residential or commercial areas near the water.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the dynamic interplay of human activities and natural waterways, emphasizing the role of rivers or harbors in transportation and industry. The use of an aerial perspective enhances the sense of scale and activity in the scene.","title":"The mouth of Arthur Kill, the waterway which separates New Jersey and Staten Island.
