{"path":"553072.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic and joyful beach scene. In the foreground, there's a man running through the shallow water towards the left-hand side of the frame, accompanied by a medium-sized dog also in mid-stride to his left. On the right-hand side of the frame, there is a young girl, possibly in her early teens, standing closer to the shore. She appears to be watching the ocean or the man and the dog, as her body is turned slightly towards them.\n\nThe ocean itself is glittering with sunlight, creating bright reflections on the waves which vary in size and intensity. This light effect makes the water appear lively and almost silver in color. The beach shows patches of wet and darker sand, suggesting the tide might be going out.\n\nThis scene is rich with motion and emotion, instilling a sense of freedom and the simple pleasures of life like playing at the beach. The composition of the photograph, with its candid capture of human and animal figures against the reflective ocean, emphasizes both activity and a peaceful coexistence with nature.","title":"Zmudowski State Beach.
