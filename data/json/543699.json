{"path":"543699.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an industrial bottling process. It shows several amber-colored glass bottles in a production line. The bottles are filled with a bright, orange liquid, possibly a beverage like soda or beer. The necks of the bottles are enclosed by mechanical gripping devices, which appear to be part of a larger automated bottling machinery. These devices are dark and speckled with what looks like water or liquid droplets, suggesting that the process involves liquid handling that might splash or spray.\n\nThe bottles are placed on a conveyor system with a textured surface, likely for grip and to facilitate movement along the line. The background and surroundings are dimly lit and blurred, drawing the viewer's focus primarily on the bottles and the mechanical grips. This suggests a factory setting with a focus on the precision and efficiency of the bottling operation. The overall atmosphere is industrial, highlighted by the technical and functional elements visible in the composition.","title":"New beer bottles on assembly line after being molded from old glass.
