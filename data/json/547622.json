{"path":"547622.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a dilapidated waterfront scene, possibly indicative of industrial decline or abandonment. The foreground is dominated by heavy debris scattered along and into shallow waters. This debris includes jagged planks of wood, crumbling stones, large chunks of concrete, twisted metal poles, and scraps of unidentifiable material. The overall appearance is chaotic, with the corners of various beams sticking out at sharp angles from the water.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, the setting includes partially submerged wooden piles, some appearing unstable or broken, jutting out of the water, which adds to the sense of neglect and decay. The water is calm, reflecting a grayish sky and parts of the surroundings, adding a somber tone to the image.\n\nIn the background, there are industrial structures on the shore. One notable building is a large, squat structure painted in a greenish hue, and another smaller building appears neglected. On the far right, the edge of a dock or platform is visible, running alongside the water.\n\nThe color palette is primarily muted—dominated by browns, grays, and dark greens—contributing to the atmosphere of dereliction. The sky appears overcast, suggesting an overcast or gloomy day. There are no visible people or moving objects, which reinforces a sense of abandonment. The scene is devoid of vibrant life or activity, emphasizing decay and the passage of time in what might once have been a bustling industrial area.","title":"Oil floats on Providence River in area of tanker terminal.","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547582","547581","551985","548105","547893","551984","547594","547575","547577","549307","552240","549300","547626","549306","546854","547890"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["abandonment","decay","chunk","water","decline","scrap","debris","passage","concrete","plank"]}
