{"path":"550450.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a sheep amidst a rocky and rugged landscape. The sheep is positioned centrally in the frame, facing slightly to the left, and seems to be in a state of movement, likely walking. Its body is predominantly white, contrasting with the darker and varied shades of the rocks behind it.\n\nThe background consists of a large pile of diverse rocks ranging in size and color, mainly shades of gray, white, and brown, creating a textured and somewhat chaotic backdrop. This pile of rocks seems to occupy the upper half of the image. The lower front part of the image where the sheep is walking is a strip of grass, indicating a natural, possibly mountainous terrain.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it might be overcast, as the colors appear muted and the shadows are soft. The overall composition focuses on the sheep in its natural habitat, emphasizing its isolation and the rough terrain it navigates. The scene is serene yet portrays a vivid sense of survival and adaptation to the harsh environment.","title":"An adolescent ram struts proudly, showing off before the young females at the west salt lick (in Atigun Gorge).","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550453","550452","550449","550446","554928","550445","543269","550451","550448","554779","555820","544933","554888","554890","554891","544384"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","rock","survival","pile","adaptation","walk","half","shade","strip","terrain"]}
