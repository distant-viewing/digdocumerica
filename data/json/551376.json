{"path":"551376.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The image depicts a rabbit sitting in grass. The rabbit appears alert and is facing slightly towards the right, conveying a sense of watchfulness. Its large eyes and prominent ears are characteristic features, suggesting it is keenly aware of its surroundings. The rabbitâ€™s fur is visible with varied patterns of brown, black, and white.\n\nThe background features a blurred mix of vibrant red and green colors, likely indicating foliage or other natural elements, giving the scene a lush, vibrant backdrop. The green color predominates in the lower section directly behind the rabbit, likely representing more grass or low vegetation, while the red hue occupies the upper portion of the image, creating a contrasting colorful effect.\n\nThe overall composition uses a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the rabbit while the background remains out of focus. This technique highlights the rabbit as the central subject of the photograph, with the vivid background serving to enhance its visual appeal without distracting from the main focus. The lighting appears soft and diffuse, suggesting an outdoor setting with either overcast sky or shaded light, which helps in creating a subtle and naturalistic atmosphere.","title":"Cottontail rabbit in a lawn at purvis beach","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544738","545557","542629","544916","554621","542778","543369","545902","550803","546163","552339","550468","543839","543279","542630","543851"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["distract","predominate","ear","technique","fur","appeal","grass","outdoor","remain","represent"]}
