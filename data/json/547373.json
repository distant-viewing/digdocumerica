{"path":"547373.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two middle-aged men engaged in a conversation in what appears to be an office or a small room with wood-paneled walls. The man on the left is seated in a gray office chair and wears a brown shirt with various badges and patches, and glasses. He has a prosthetic arm, which is noticeable as the other man is holding this and possibly working on it or examining it. \n\nThe man on the right, who is also seated and slightly turned away from the camera, is wearing a light-colored sweater and glasses. He is holding a pipe in his mouth and seems to be attentively listening to or conversing with the first man. His demeanor and setup suggest he may be a professional in prosthetics or a similar field, performing a function or check on the prosthetic arm.\n\nThe background includes a dark-toned, wooden bookshelf filled with small boxes and papers, adding to the sense of this being a workspace. A small, narrow bench and a floor lamp with a focused light source also appear behind the second man, giving the room a practical, work-oriented ambience. The overall mood is focused and professional, yet the posture and expressions hint at a calm and friendly exchange.","title":"Dr.  Charles ashby of geneva takes blood pressure of local businessman in his examining room","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["555233","557037","547382","557856","556557","557894","555247","546948","557152","553030","547399","555234","547353","554870","545471","552356"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["man","office","room","bookshelf","arm","professional","boxe","exchange","glass","focused"]}
