{"path":"546170.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene on a clear day with a diverse and detailed composition. In the foreground, there is a field covered with tall, wild grass, exhibiting varying shades of green and specks of yellow from wildflowers. This natural setting contrasts starkly with the industrial structures in the midground and background.\n\nThe image features large industrial facilities, including several tall, metal towers filled with intricate networks of pipes, scaffolding, and stairs. There are two main structures, both appearing complex and constructed primarily of metal, with various cylindrical and rectangular elements. The structures are outfitted with numerous steel beams and supports, emphasizing their robust industrial functionality.\n\nTo the left, there is a tall, narrow water tower, painted white, with a rounded tank on top. It stands against a backdrop of a vivid blue sky with few fluffy clouds, contributing to the image's deep perspective and enhancing the industrial aesthetic.\n\nThis scene offers a visual portrayal of the contrast between natural landscapes and human-made industrial developments. The sky's vivid blue creates a fresh, expansive backdrop that further accentuates the mechanical and constructed nature of the facility structures.","title":"Chemical plants","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544676","542705","545989","545862","545998","555542","546122","544179","545013","545996","552544","542545","546974","552190","551082","543913"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tower","scaffolding","speck","facility","portrayal","stair","wildflower","functionality","metal","structure"]}
