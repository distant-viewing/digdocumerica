{"path":"543744.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a young boy with light-colored hair, focused intently on an object. The boy is shown in profile, his nose and cheeks sharply lit, creating a contrast with the darker background. His hand, along with another person's hand, is reaching towards a large cylindrical object that appears to be a wheel rim or possibly a mechanical component. They are touching or adjusting this object, suggesting an activity oriented around exploration or repair. Dim lighting emphasizes the subjects and the object, hinting at an intimate or concentrated setting, possibly indoors or in a shaded area. The rest of the background is indistinct, maintaining the focus on the boy and his interaction with the object. The composition captures a moment of curiosity or learning, highlighted by the keen attention and tactile engagement of the young boy.","title":"Boy learns to pan for gold in Boulder Creek.
