{"path":"557970.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment during an overcast day alongside a railway track. Two individuals, likely involved in some kind of maintenance or inspection work, are present near the foreground. They are carrying a small boat, possibly to navigate through water nearby or under the bridge.\n\nThe setting features a striking arched bridge constructed from concrete, which spans across the image. The architecture of the bridge is notable for its series of elegant arches and substantial columns that support it, giving it a robust and majestic appearance. The bridge crosses over what appears to be a small river or stream, slightly visible underneath it.\n\nThe surrounding area is lush with vegetation, enhancing the sense of a secluded or less urbanized location. The railway track runs parallel to the stream and disappears into the bridge, suggesting that this might be a route not frequently traveled, or selected specifically for its scenic or strategic relevance.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its focus on both human activity and architectural beauty within a natural setting, creates a narrative that blends work with the tranquility and challenges posed by nature.","title":"Canoeists on their way to launch their boat below the spillway at the base of Ohio Highway 82 bridge near Cleveland. They will then paddle on the Cuyahoga River, which is a part of the 30,000-acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. It is the last major undeveloped land remaining between the metropolitan areas of Cleveland and Akron. The railroad tracks carry trains of the Chessie System and the Cuyahoga Valley Line, a weekend steam-powered excursion train.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557969","552064","557959","556876","544542","551527","548064","551423","557658","549469","555730","557513","558067","548207","552247","557096"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","railway","stream","track","select","disappear","inspection","kind","route","concrete"]}
