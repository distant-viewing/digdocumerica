{"path":"545052.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque coastal scene. In the foreground, tall wild grasses and flora fringe the top edge, adding a natural frame to the image. Below, a sandy beach stretches horizontally across the picture. This beach, dotted with driftwood and debris, hosts a pair of distant figures walking near the water's edge, giving a sense of scale and activity.\n\nDominating the mid-ground are modernist architecture buildings, likely housing or a resort. These structures are multi-storied, featuring prominent balconies, flat roofs, and a design that uses geometric shapes. Positioned on a sloping hillside, these buildings blend into the landscape but still stand out due to their architectural style.\n\nThe background features a forested hill that is partially obscured by mist or fog, contributing to the image's mood and emphasizing the coastal environment's often foggy conditions. The muted colors and soft lighting condition of the photograph suggest that it might have been taken during either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Condominiums","placename":"Otter Rock (Or.)","location":"Otter Rock, Oregon","nn1":["545108","543244","542890","545222","543078","557429","557523","555400","547607","543090","547592","544617","543066","545124","543362","546953"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["fringe","beach","resort","driftwood","housing","balcony","flora","pair","condition","edge"]}
