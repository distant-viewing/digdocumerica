{"path":"557164.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a gathering of people, predominantly men, in an informal outdoor setting that appears to be a backyard or rural property. The group seems to be engaged in some form of activity involving mechanical or electronic equipment.\n\nStarting from the left, there's a woman with short, dark hair wearing a printed headscarf and sunglasses, closely observing a man in front of her operating a small device, possibly a camera or similar gadget. Next to her, an elderly man with a cap and eyeglasses is inspecting something in his hands very closely.\n\nThe center of the image is dominated by three men engaged in a conversation or inspection over a metallic object, which one man is holding in a raised position. This man, to the far right of this trio, is perhaps showing or demonstrating the item to the other two. He is dressed in a flannel shirt and is actively participating in the interaction. The man opposite him, who is partly obscured and facing the camera, is wearing a denim jacket and a cap; he looks focused on the item being held up.\n\nIn addition to these main subjects, there is another man at the extreme right of the frame who is wearing a hat and glasses, looking at the central activity, he appears to be holding a camera up to his face, possibly taking a photograph or preparing to do so.\n\nThe setting is rustic, with wooden structures (possibly fences or sheds) visible in the background, contributing to a casual, workshop-like atmosphere. The group is surrounded by various items that suggest a work or hobby-related gathering, including tools and possibly pieces of machinery or parts. The photo has a vintage feel, emphasized by the clothing styles and physical appearance of the equipment being used.","title":"Auctioneer sells items at the sale of the Shreve Drugstore in White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy. It was built in the 1870's by C.W. Shreve, who had settled in White Cloud in 1858. The drugstore, since torn down, was in the process of being named on the National Register of Historic Places. The other building has not been torn down, but is in a state of disrepair. Some people would like to see White Cloud restored as an example of a 19th century Kansas river town.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["557145","544406","554666","557004","557943","548299","544817","542562","556858","554481","550679","554930","553117","549328","556600","554685"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["man","item","camera","hobby","flannel","gathering","hold","eyeglass","cap","backyard"]}
