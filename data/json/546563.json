{"path":"546563.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals on a walkway beside a green metal fence. The setting appears to be a public area with industrial elements in the background, including a block structured building with a dark roof and a chimney. A small grassy lawn separates the walkway from the road and the building.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman is standing with one hand shielding her eyes, possibly scanning the surroundings or looking toward the distance. She is dressed in a patterned plaid jacket over a light-colored top and flared trousers. Beside her, a younger girl stands looking off to the side. She wears a white long-sleeved shirt under a stripy vest and lighter colored bell-bottom trousers.\n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat overcast, and the overall color palette of the image is somewhat muted, giving it a slightly somber or reflective feel. The scene captures a moment that seems both ordinary and contemplative, set against a backdrop that blends natural and manufactured elements.","title":"Long ramp, which is exit from school to play area.
