{"path":"555304.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor scene shown from a low angle, showcasing an interior space under a slanted, translucent ceiling. At the top of the image, two potted plants hang from the ceiling, suspended by ropes. The light that filters through the ceiling projects intricate shadows of tree branches onto the opaque, whitish material of the ceiling, creating a natural pattern and giving the impression of a barrier between an indoor space and the nature outside.\n\nThe structural elements of the ceiling include dark metal framing, which segments the translucent panels. Below, the interior is softly illuminated with warm tones, hinting at a cozy, inviting atmosphere typical of a sunroom or enclosed porch.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, the room is furnishing with a varnished wooden interior, including a wide shelf or countertop that occupies most of the bottom frame. This shelf holds various objects: several small potted plants, gardening supplies, and general bric-a-brac suggesting a functional space used for plant care or as a hobby area.\n\nThe composition relies heavily on the natural lighting and the interplay of light and shadow, which highlights the textural details of the ceiling's surface and conveys a serene, tranquil indoor environment tuning closely with the natural world outside. The overall ambiance is peaceful, secluded, and closely connected to nature.","title":"Styrofoam beads are shown being blown in between two layers of plastic panels in an efficient solar greenhouse built for a school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
