{"path":"555565.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat rustic and heavy-duty scene featuring an old yellow tractor towing a laden coal carrier on a paved road. The tractor, vintage in appearance, is moving to the left with visible motion blur emphasized by the stir of dust beneath its large, rugged wheels. The attached trailer, appearing aged and weathered with patches of rust and paint peel, is filled with coal, highlighting its utilitarian function. \n\nThe setting is outdoors with a backdrop consisting of gentle grassy slopes dotted with small shrubs and a few coniferous trees visible in the midground. The area suggests a rural or semi-industrial location, possibly near a mining site, given the content of the trailer. The overcast sky and the subdued, muted colors in the image add to the sense of an industrious yet serene natural environment. There are no visible people in the photograph, directing the focus primarily on the machinery and the industrial activity depicted.","title":"Coal hauling truck on Route #519","placename":"New Athens (Ohio)","location":"New Athens, Ohio","nn1":["547690","553662","553664","542533","547436","556430","543671","555989","555878","544319","555866","544888","544138","555608","544323","556325"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","coal","trailer","blur","duty","dust","content","function","vintage","rust"]}
