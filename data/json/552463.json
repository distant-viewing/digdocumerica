{"path":"552463.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures an old, weathered agricultural building wall. Prominently visible is a large vertical sliding wooden door, textured with lines of degradation and color variation, primarily showing shades of dark red and brown. The paint is heavily worn, revealing the aged wood beneath. \n\nBelow the door, there is a faded advertisement poster inset into the wall within a damaged, peeling frame, surrounded by deteriorating wood panels. The poster features a vibrant contrast of red and yellow and advertises \"CASE '77 Modern Machines for Profitable Farming.\" Elements of machinery and farm equipment are illustrated on the poster, emphasizing agricultural productivity.\n\nThe surrounding structure of the wall and its features are in states of decay, with scraps of materials peeling away and exposed parts of the underlying structure. There is visible corrosion and organic growth, underscoring the neglected state of the building. The backdrop hints at additional rustic and derelict characteristics typical of unused or abandoned farm buildings.","title":"A wall in Ladd","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552511","554821","555627","547894","543330","544719","554561","554820","554707","543339","552467","550693","546164","552448","552455","545821"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["poster","farm","wall","state","corrosion","productivity","door","wood","scrap","characteristic"]}
