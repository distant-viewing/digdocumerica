{"path":"546045.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and busy industrial setting, likely a dock or shipyard. In the foreground, a large warning sign is prominently displayed, which reads: \"WARNING - LAW PROHIBITS THROWING OF TRASH OR DEBRIS IN RIVER,\" highlighting the environmental regulations in place at this location.\n\nThe scene shows two men in safety helmets and vibrant red outfits walking along a wooden plank walkway beside a large ship. One of the men appears to be casually walking and carrying a briefcase, while the other rides a small, white scooter, suggesting they are workers or inspectors moving around the expansive industrial area.\n\nThe ship beside them is large, with a metallic hull that exhibits signs of wear and age. Various hoses and mechanical equipment are visible along the side of the ship, indicating ongoing maintenance or operational activities.\n\nIn the background, a crane and other heavy industrial machinery can be seen, further indicating that this area is used for significant loading, unloading, or construction activities related to maritime operations. The sky is clear and the environment suggests a bustling yet regulated work area focused on maritime industry.","title":"Warning sign at the Avondale shipyard","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546009","546936","546016","555797","552216","545147","552148","552149","546850","547474","544753","548125","548346","546861","552244","552206"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","warning","prohibit","regulate","briefcase","shipyard","regulation","unloading","walk","hose"]}
