{"path":"545231.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene seemingly from the 1970s or 1980s, showcasing a busy street atmosphere with pedestrians. The focus is on a group of three young women walking towards the camera. They are dressed in fashionable attire indicative of the era: high-waisted jeans, crop tops, and casual blouses. Each has a distinct style, from a nautilus-shell-patterned crop top to a sleeveless, ruffled blouse.\n\nForegrounded, and walking away from the camera, are an elderly couple. The man wears a tan straw hat, a navy sweater, and brown trousers, while the woman is attired in a white blouse and a brightly floral skirt, suggesting a casual, yet distinct style typical of older generations.\n\nThe background of the photograph reveals a busy urban street lined with shops and filled with people. Signs, though not clearly readable, together with the variety of parked cars, suggest the commercial nature of the area. The street bustles with a mix of individuals including those who appear to be locals going about their daily routines or perhaps tourists exploring the area.\n\nThe overall composition balances activity and interaction, capturing a moment that reflects both the fashion and the social milieu of the time. The sharp focus on the group prominently positions them as subjects within the narrative of daily life in this vibrant urban setting.","title":"Promenading on the main street of Westport, a Pacific Coast fishing mecca","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551835","551124","549923","553184","556808","551820","553155","558253","549645","553183","552411","548369","556221","551817","553204","556199"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["blouse","street","crop","local","navy","generation","shell","straw","routine","group"]}
