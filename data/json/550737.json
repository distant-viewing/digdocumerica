{"path":"550737.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a construction site for a modern-looking building. The building appears to be two stories high, featuring a flat roof and multiple large rectangular window openings, some of which are already installed with glass. The structure is composed of concrete with visible pillars and beams supporting its framework.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is rough, uneven terrain that seems to be in the process of being leveled or cleared. Scattered around the site are various construction materials, including planks and other timber pieces, which might be used for scaffolding or forms.\n\nVisibly noticeable in the image is a black pickup truck, slightly muddy, parked adjacent to the building, which indicates ongoing work and the presence of workers. Off in the background, a crane is faintly visible, potentially used for lifting heavier materials needed for the construction.\n\nThe background is composed of a densely wooded area with tall trees, suggesting that the construction site is located near or within a forested region. The sky is overcast, giving the photograph a somewhat gloomy ambiance, which could reflect the weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment in the development of a large architectural project amidst a natural setting, highlighting both the man-made structure and the rugged environment around it.","title":"Auburn-Lewiston municipal sewage treatment plant under construction","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["548552","547977","556619","557728","547833","548551","543591","543583","556940","547829","548558","550273","546426","546988","547235","553702"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","compose","instal","scaffolding","pickup","timber","need","pillar","material"]}
