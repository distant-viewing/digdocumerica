{"path":"552324.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image captures a moment of active fishing from a small boat. In the boat, there are two individuals engaged in the fishing activity. On the left side of the frame, one person is bent over, using a net to scoop something from the water, presumably a fish. This person is partially visible, dressed in a patterned sweater and a knitted cap. Another person, standing on the right, is actively reeling in a fishing rod, leaning back slightly to exert force against the pull of the line. This individual is wearing a red cap, dark jacket, and blue jeans.\n\nThe boat appears to be a modestly sized, metal craft equipped with seats and some fishing gear. The surrounding environment features calm, reflective waters and a forested shoreline in the background, suggesting a serene, secluded setting. The sky looks overcast, lending a cooler tone to the overall atmosphere of the scene. The focus and excitement of the moment are centered on the catch that is being secured, highlighting a successful outing.","title":"On the Skagit River near Concrete, Dan Dudley of Bellevue plays a 19-pound steelhead trout as guide Kerry Duvall handles the net.
