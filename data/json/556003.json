{"path":"556003.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a long, curving train on tracks that extend across a flat landscape. The focus is on a broad expanse of golden-brown grassland in the foreground, which fills the bottom portion of the frame with its textured and wavy appearance. The train, visible in the middle distance, stretches from one edge of the frame to the other, suggesting considerable length. Its cars are uniform, with a predominantly gray and silver color scheme, reflecting a utilitarian design typical of mid-20th-century trains.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky with very few clouds, indicating a sunny, calm day. On the horizon, just above the train, there is a thin line of low-lying vegetation or trees, which provides a slight contrast to the otherwise open vista. The overall composition balances the vastness of the landscape with the linear structure of the train, emphasizing the flatness of the terrain and the isolation of the railway in this rural setting. The lighting and color saturation give the image a slightly dated feel, typical of film photography from the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"The Southwest Limited passes ripening wheat fields near Dodge City, Kansas.
