{"path":"543669.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a mining or industrial site surrounded by a barren, rugged landscape. The area is likely part of a larger desert or semi-arid environment, characterized by sparse vegetation and rocky terrain. The main features of the photograph include:\n\n1. **Location and Setting**: The facility is nestled in a valley or a depression surrounded by higher terrains. The color palette is dominated by earthen tones—browns, ochres, and shades of dusty green, typical of desert environments.\n\n2. **Main Industrial Area**: Central to the image is a configuration of various buildings and structures, suggesting an operational hub likely for processing or administrative purposes. There are numerous square or rectangular buildings, some large and warehouse-like and others smaller and possibly for office use.\n\n3. **Storage Tanks**: To the immediate right side of the central facility area, there are four large, round storage tanks grouped together, a common sight in industrial settings for storing either water, chemicals, or fuel.\n\n4. **Open Pits or Ponds**: Adjacent to these tanks, there are irregularly shaped open areas that could be either ponds or pits. They appear to be void of water, suggesting they might be used for storage or processing of materials related to the site’s primary industrial function.\n\n5. **Material or Spoil Heaps**: The landscape includes several mounded areas that look like heaps of discarded material (spoils), common in mining operations, indicating extraction or waste from the process carried out at the site.\n\n6. **Roads and Infrastructure**: There are visible roads that cut through the site, facilitating movement of vehicles and equipment. The roads are clearly defined, winding through the area, and appear well-travelled, evidenced by the lack of vegetation and the distinct tire tracks.\n\n7. **Water Body**: On the north side of the industrial area, there's a relatively large, irregularly shaped water body, adding a contrasting blue-gray hue to the otherwise dry and dusty landscape. It could possibly be a retention basin or a natural pond essential for the operations or environmental management at the site.\n\n8. **Terrain and Vegetation**: The surrounding area shows signs of limited vegetation, which is typical for a rugged, arid environment. The hills and flat areas have sparse scrub and brush, with the ruggedness of the terrain highlighted by the shadows and natural undulations of the land.\n\nThis setting, devoid of visible human activity in the picture, gives a sense of isolation, focusing solely on","title":"Aerial view of union carbide uranium mill","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["542513","551611","544036","544068","554163","552004","554764","544788","544569","544781","554763","544059","549168","551612","555610","550398"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["site","tank","storage","processing","mining","desert","roads","depression","essential","area"]}
