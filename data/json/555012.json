{"path":"555012.jpg","date":"May 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of three young owls huddled together. The focus is primarily on the owl in the foreground, which directly faces the camera lens with a noticeable intense gaze. Its eyes are large and somewhat reflective, bordered by prominent feathery eyebrows and beak that are characteristic of owlets. The feathers are predominantly white with patches and speckles of brown and gray, providing natural camouflage.\n\nThe remaining two owls in the photo are slightly out of focus, nestled closely to the main owl, likely for warmth and protection. These owls also feature similar coloring with fluffy, soft feather textures noticeable even in the image. Their eyes are closed or nearly closed, suggesting a state of rest or minimal activity.\n\nThe background is entirely blurred, emphasizing the owlets in the foreground through a shallow depth of field. The lighting appears natural, likely outdoors during daylight, highlighting the details and soft coloration of the feathers. The overall composition conveys a sense of intimacy and vulnerability typically associated with juvenile wildlife.","title":"Baby great horned owls (bubo Virginianus) in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555011","553876","548505","544513","544505","548497","544501","544222","545214","555010","549115","557208","557628","543851","556135","552696"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["feather","vulnerability","beak","camouflage","intimacy","coloring","eye","lens","speckle","protection"]}
