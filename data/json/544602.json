{"path":"544602.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense cluster of trees, likely in a swamp or wetland environment. The trees are tall and straight, with rough textures on their bark, a common characteristic of cypress trees. Their trunks are predominantly grayish-brown, and many are surrounded by dark, hanging moss which adds an eerie, draped look to the scene. Interspersed among the trees are various air plants, including bromeliads, which can be seen clinging to the trunks and branches. Some trees also have vines climbing up their sides.\n\nThe setting is remarkably dense, with little to no visible ground layer, suggesting a focus on the vertical rise of the forest trunks and the intertwined vegetation. Light falls unevenly through the canopy, creating patches of illumination and shadow which enhances the depth and complexity of the scene. The overall impression is of a lush, somewhat mysterious wetland space, teeming with life and typical of certain temperate and subtropical forest ecosystems. There are no visible human activities or animals in this image; it solely captures the natural beauty and eerie atmosphere of a deep forest environment.","title":"Cypress trees along TaMiami Trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544549","544585","554975","546947","544589","554961","555125","544595","544593","555000","555121","554958","554985","545488","546059","554976"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","wetland","forest","vine","swamp","teem","tree","cling","climb","intertwine"]}
