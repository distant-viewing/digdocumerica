{"path":"543094.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image features a quirky and colorful attraction set in a forest setting. The main structure is a building that appears to be purposely built with an unusual, slanting architecture to create an optical illusion or a disorienting effect; this is typical of a \"gravity house\" found in some amusement parks. The roof and the structure itself tilt sharply to one side, while the yellow-bordered windows and doorframes pop against the dark brown wood, enhancing the surreal appearance.\n\nThe door is open, inviting visitors inside, and there are multiple signs adding to the site’s whimsical nature. One sign mounted on the structure reads \"Mystery Spot,\" suggesting the theme of intriguing optical illusions or gravitational anomalies purported to occur within. Another sign, larger and more prominent, hangs from a nearby tree stating \"Confusion Hill OPEN\" in bold letters, with an arrow directing visitors towards the attraction, and an additional message about \"free bumper signs at office\".\n\nThe surrounding area is densely wooded with tall, mature trees, likely redwoods, considering the lushness and typical forest composition, indicating that the location is in a region with substantial natural forest growth. A wooden fence lines the path leading to and around the building, blending with the rustic environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph uses the natural greenery of the forest as a backdrop that contrasts with the crafted eccentricity of the man-made structure, creating a curious and inviting atmosphere for an unusual attraction. This setting evokes curiosity and plays with the visitors’ sense of reality and perspective.\n","title":"Klamath River","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["543095","545221","554457","557336","554454","557776","543580","554456","543239","544445","556999","547123","546457","554440","544824","554549"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["attraction","visitor","forest","sign","gravity","redwood","lushness","amusement","arrow","bumper"]}
