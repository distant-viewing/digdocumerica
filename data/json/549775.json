{"path":"549775.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a row of sanitation trucks parked along a gravel road under a partly cloudy sky. These trucks are positioned one behind the other, stretching into the distance. The nearest truck is prominently in the foreground to the right and is white with the word \"sanitation\" written in bold black letters along the side of the back compartment. The front of this truck has a warning sticker and identifying numbers. The truck is somewhat dirty, indicating frequent use.\n\nEach truck in the line appears similar in design, featuring a green and white color scheme, and each has reflective stripes for safety. The trucks have various service-related markings and dirt on them, showing regular field operation. The environment around the trucks is barren, with sparse vegetation visible, suggesting an industrial or outskirts setting. The road itself is composed of gravel and dirt, leading straight through the middle of the photo and surrounded by a flat, open landscape. The cloud formations in the sky add a dynamic element to the otherwise industrial and utilitarian scene.","title":"Procession of trucks hauling waste to an already overflowing city dump in the Bronx","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549765","549830","544061","548980","549753","547975","549837","553041","552077","549832","543896","544164","548348","547979","549779","547232"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["truck","sanitation","gravel","sticker","dirt","compartment","warning","trucks","outskirt","write"]}
