{"path":"556907.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping aerial or high elevation view of a vast landscape that seamlessly blends both natural and man-made elements. The central foreground of the image features expansive lush forests predominantly composed of coniferous trees. Amid these dense woods, there are several clearings where human activity is apparent.\n\nIn these cleared sections, there are visible industrial or commercial buildings with large, flat roofs. These settings are likely facilities related to forestry, manufacturing, or agriculture considering their integration into the forest and their significant scale. Additionally, meandering through the trees, a network of dirt roads connects these facilities, illustrating an infrastructure likely designed for logistic or operational purposes.\n\nThe background of the image is breathtaking and dominated by a series of lofty mountains, which form a dramatic and rugged horizon. Snow caps some of these peaks, suggesting their considerable altitude and possibly hinting at a temperate or cold climate zone. Below these mountains, further illustrating the area's natural beauty, is a large body of water - possibly a lake or a wide river. Its calm surface mirrors the sky, contributing to the serene and somewhat untouched impression of the landscape.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with human elements nestled within a largely untamed and picturesque natural setting, offers a visual narrative of harmony and perhaps tension between industrial development and environmental preservation. The selection of a high viewpoint gives the viewer a sense of scale and the vastness of the area, emphasizing the small but significant footprint of human activities within such a large natural expanse.","title":"Aerial view looking west at a portion of U.S. Navy Bangor Annex installation. The asphalted space in the foreground is the present brass yard which will become the administrative area for the new Trident submarine base under construction. Logging roads and clear-cut patches on Mount Walker and the Olympic National Forest are seen in the near background. The Olympic Mountains are on the horizon.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556913","556919","556908","556904","556977","557003","545042","556937","552243","556918","545001","556915","556916","550533","556936","550642"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["selection","preservation","tension","footprint","harmony","integration","scale","facility","forest","forestry"]}
