{"path":"545612.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features two people, a man and a woman, outdoors during what appears to be late afternoon, judging by the warm lighting. They are situated on rough, rocky terrain with a panoramic view of a deep valley and distant cliffs under a partly cloudy sky. The landscape behind them has layers of mesa-like formations and is expansive, suggesting a desert-like environment that might be characteristic of the American Southwest.\n\nThe woman, positioned on the left, appears joyful and is smiling broadly as she looks towards the man. She has long blonde hair, worn down, and is dressed in a simple white shirt with a collar and short sleeves. She is leaning slightly on a large-format camera mounted on a tripod, suggesting she is either a photographer or associated with the photography process.\n\nThe man, to the right, sports a full beard and long hair tied back. He is dressed in a denim shirt and seems to be in the midst of a conversation or explanation, judging by his expressive hand gestures and focused expression. He holds a camera lens or similar object in one hand, indicating his involvement in photography.\n\nThe interaction between the two, the photographic equipment, and the scenic backdrop all suggest they are engaged in a photography project or adventure in this picturesque and rugged terrain. The overall atmosphere is that of creativity, exploration, and enjoyment of the natural world.","title":"Setting up a camera at Anticline Overlook in the Canyonlands","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545784","548833","545767","544404","545751","554513","545772","546312","545602","547834","545516","545768","544408","550048","543248","546320"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["photography","tripod","creativity","photographer","lens","hair","collar","involvement","beard","gesture"]}
