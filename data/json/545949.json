{"path":"545949.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a solitary warning sign centered in a rural setting, standing by a body of water with its reflection clearly visible on the surface. The sign reads \"DANGER HIGH PRESSURE PIPE LINE DO NOT ANCHOR OR DREDGE.\" It is slightly weathered, with some rust and signs of wear, mounted on a single metal pole that extends below into the water, indicating the presence of a submerged pipeline.\n\nBehind the sign is a broad expanse of reed-filled flatland, suggesting a wetlands area. The reeds are brown, seemingly dry or dormant, which may imply the photo was taken in a cooler season. The sky above is clear, offering a gradient of blues which indicates either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of calm but caution, with the vast open space around the sign amplifying its warning. The presence of the water and the reflected sign add a sense of symmetry and stillness to the composition, emphasizing both the natural setting and the industrial element represented by the pipeline.","title":"One of many signs posted by oil companies on Louisiana bayous","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["544227","545997","552432","548063","553749","546402","558000","557546","558017","545167","552211","552076","544245","547992","550688","549000"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["pipeline","sign","warning","reed","caution","pressure","symmetry","calm","wetland","stillness"]}
