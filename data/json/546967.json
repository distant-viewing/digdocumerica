{"path":"546967.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a candid and joyful moment outside a modest house. It features a young boy gleefully riding a vibrant red bicycle with a shiny chrome basket at the front and a cushioned yellow saddle. He is smiling broadly, looking directly at the camera, and seems to be in motion or just starting to pedal. The boy is wearing a casual grey T-shirt, shorts, and is barefoot, typical of a relaxed day outdoors.\n\nBeside the house, leaning casually against the gray cinderblock wall, is a woman dressed in a white robe or dress, observing the boy. Her expression is less visible, but she appears to be watching the boy with interest or mild amusement.\n\nThe house itself has a straightforward, utilitarian design with a red wooden front porch that has a simple railing painted in a matching red color. The roof appears a bit worn, and there is an exposed gutter. The windows have white frames, and one can see curtains inside, adding a touch of homeliness.\n\nThe setting includes green grass and trees in the background, suggesting a rural or suburban environment. The scene communicates a sense of everyday life and the simple pleasures like riding a bike on a sunny day. The overall mood is light-hearted and depicts a slice of life from the viewpoint of the subjects in the photograph.","title":"A boy and his bike on john's island","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["557361","555950","555436","544432","553515","544310","557699","558131","553495","557367","543715","550249","547199","551105","551727","551032"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["boy","ride","house","pedal","hear","saddle","robe","amusement","pleasure","bike"]}
