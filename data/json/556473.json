{"path":"556473.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and somewhat dramatic outdoor scene, primarily focusing on natural landscapes. The image captures a hillside densely populated with trees. The lighting is low, suggestive of either dawn or dusk, casting deep shadows and enhancing the moodiness of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a hill slopes downward, lined with dark, bare trees that appear to be either leafless or coniferous, hinting at a cooler season or a region where deciduous trees have shed their leaves. The color palette is dominated by dark blues and grays, lending a cool tone to the entire scene.\n\nThe most striking feature of this photograph is a solitary tree near the center, which is illuminated by what seems to be sunlight. This tree stands out dramatically against the darker background, with its branches highlighted and more visible in contrast to its surroundings. The light plays off the leaves or branches of this tree, giving it a bright, almost silvery appearance.\n\nThe background involves a similarly treed hill, which fades into the shadows, adding depth to the image. The overall atmosphere is serene and somewhat isolated, emphasizing the natural beauty and quiet majesty of the scene. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, reinforcing the untouched, wild aspect of the landscape.","title":"Old slag heap near Pigskin, West Virginia, and Beckley shows the first signs of natural recovery. It is a long, slow process and begins only if the piles are not so steep that they erode into the streams. Slag heaps also can catch fire and burn indefinitely from a number of causes. This is one of the topics of conversation that make miners mad.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549248","553593","547546","555119","543621","542924","553579","555081","542644","557159","543406","550602","542849","554099","555217","555116"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["tree","branch","leave","majesty","hill","hillside","dawn","gray","slope","aspect"]}
