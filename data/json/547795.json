{"path":"547795.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a scene outside the \"Baker Hotel,\" as indicated by the prominent neon signage above the entrance. The image features six men, all attired in formal business suits, emerging from the hotel. The time period appears to be around the 1970s or 1980s, judging by their fashion styles, which include wide lapels, ties, and sunglasses.\n\nFrom left to right: The first man is in a dark navy blue suit with a white shirt and a black tie, accessorized with dark sunglasses. Next to him, a man in a light beige suit with a white shirt and a dark tie is stepping forward. The third man wears a burgundy red tie and glasses, completing his look with a dark jacket and lighter trousers. He is followed closely by a man in a light gray suit, a white shirt, and a dark red tie. The fifth man wears a light cream suit, a white shirt, a light-patterned tie, and glasses. Completing the group, the last man to the far right wears a white suit with a patterned shirt and tie combination.\n\nBehind the men, the entrance to the Baker Hotel is partially visible. There’s also a smaller sign with the logo of American Airlines (stylized as \"AA\" inside a circle), visible to the right above the hotel entrance.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, coupled with the men’s stern expressions and sharp attire, sends a vibe of seriousness, possibly indicating they are businessmen or associated with some professional event. The clean and structured urban setting enhances the formal and somewhat cinematic feel of the scene.","title":"In downtown Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552785","547806","551459","556731","547443","556733","553182","546596","553909","546419","547411","549812","553189","556247","553148","550130"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["tie","suit","man","entrance","hotel","shirt","sunglass","seriousness","circle","right"]}
