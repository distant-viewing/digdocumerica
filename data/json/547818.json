{"path":"547818.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene of nature featuring a butterfly alighted on a cluster of flowers. The butterfly, with its wings wide open, displays large, black and yellow patterned wings, which contrast strikingly against the floral backdrop. The flowers are predominantly pink with yellow centers, surrounded by dense green foliage. The shallow depth of field focuses sharply on the butterfly and a few flowers, blurring out the rest of the floral background to create a soft, dreamy effect. The light seems natural, suggesting it is an outdoor setting, possibly a garden or meadow, during daylight hours. The overall composition emphasizes the beauty of wildlife interaction with plant life, showcasing vivid colors and the delicate structure of the butterfly amidst a lush, floral environment.","title":"Butterfly and wild flowers in Elm Fork Park Nature Center in northwest Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["543603","544479","544553","544619","544618","551381","544614","544603","544517","544566","554839","544514","548283","544590","548284","545699"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","flower","meadow","rest","hour","wildlife","garden","daylight","cluster"]}
