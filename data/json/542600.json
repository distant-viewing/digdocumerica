{"path":"542600.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a mountainous landscape, showing a striking contrast between areas affected by a fire and parts that remain lush and green. The foreground of the image is dense with green coniferous trees, indicating an untouched forest area. Progressing towards the middle and background, the landscape changes dramatically where a fire has scorched the hillside. \n\nThe affected area is characterized by barren terrain with sparse vegetation, blackened tree trunks, and a few remaining trees that appear dead or severely burnt. The hillside shows signs of severe fire damage as the ground is mostly devoid of greenery, except for a few patches of surviving plants or trees. Some areas in the burnt zone show slight signs of regrowth or resilience.\n\nThe background of the photo is dominated by another hill, also showing signs of fire damage but with a slightly higher number of surviving trees, possibly indicating a different intensity or time of the burn. The sky is blue and clear, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day, providing a sharp visual clarity to the contrasting landscapes depicted.","title":"Terraced area for tree production, showing effects of controlled burning which desTroyed fifty acres.","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["542598","555202","555113","553626","542819","555088","555157","553561","553565","553560","555159","545731","553843","548592","548591","548590"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["fire","damage","hillside","burn","tree","sign","intensity","resilience","clarity","zone"]}
