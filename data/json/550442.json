{"path":"550442.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures a stark, rugged mountainside with rich geological details. The terrain is dominated by various shades of dark brown and reddish-brown hues, reflecting the mineral composition of the rocks. Large boulders and numerous smaller stones scatter the uneven, craggy surface, which appears devoid of vegetation. The color palette and lack of visible life suggest this might be a high-altitude or harsh environment, potentially volcanic in origin due to the color and texture. The lighting is subdued, indicating either an overcast day or a lower sun angle, which casts soft shadows and enhances the depth and contours of the geological formations. There's a solitary small, bright light visible midway down the slope, possibly reflected sunlight, a distant vehicle, or some other small reflective object. The composition centers around the majestic and foreboding nature of the mountain landscape, focusing on its vast, uninhabited ruggedness.","title":"West end of Atigun Gorge","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550425","550480","543635","545807","550505","550428","550396","550395","550422","550421","545792","543148","545802","545799","552444","550424"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountainside","origin","ruggedness","boulder","mineral","altitude","contour","lack","subdue","reflect"]}
