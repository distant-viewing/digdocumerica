{"path":"546653.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a city street, focusing on a man who appears to be an officer, possibly a traffic policeman or a city worker, engaged in an activity involving a red car. The man, dressed in a dark blue uniform with black shoes, is bending slightly as he manipulates something at the rear end of the car, next to the trunk. He has a set of keys in his hand, indicating he might be either unlocking or locking the car.\n\nThe red car has a distinctive 1960s or 1970s design, with a shiny paint job and chrome detailing. The trunk of the car is slightly open, and inside the trunk, there is a visible sticker or emblem that reads “GENERALS”, possibly indicating a sports team or a company name.\n\nIn the background, there's a large, white tow truck parked immediately behind the car, equipped with specialized machinery, possibly for towing. The truck has various metal components and seems ready for use, with a visible number \"13\" on the side of the truck.\n\nThe scene occurs on a lined street with other cars parked in the background and lush green trees suggesting this might be in a park or a boulevard with ample vegetation. A street sign is partially visible in the top right corner, but the content on the sign is not entirely legible. The overall ambiance is busy yet orderly, typical of a city environment. The photograph has a candid and somewhat documentary feel, capturing a moment of everyday municipal activity.","title":"Ready for tow away in seconds.
