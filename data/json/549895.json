{"path":"549895.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph offers a street-level view of a classic, black luxury car, possibly from the late 1960s or early 1970s, prominently parked on a city street. The car, possibly a Cadillac due to its distinctive tail fins and rear design, features glossy black paint and chrome detailing, adding a sophisticated and opulent look. The car's bumper reflects some orange-colored buildings, likely a result of the urban setting.\n\nTo the right of the car, in the foreground, stands a traditional New York City fire hydrant. It appears robust and slightly worn, painted in a dark color that complements the urban atmosphere. The pavement under the car and around the fire hydrant is visible, marked with a yellow line that suggests parking regulations.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by high-rise apartment buildings, suggesting a dense, urban residential area. The buildings are tall, with numerous windows, and have a slightly reddish-brown hue, typical of many New York City apartment blocks. There's little visible activity on the streets or in the buildings, adding a deserted or tranquil feel to the urban landscape. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, muted light over the scene, which contributes to the overall moody and slightly retro aesthetic of the photograph.","title":"'Manhattan scofflaw'","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556707","555475","547797","556713","549882","549856","556709","548331","557878","555922","557052","554297","547954","548238","556718","549881"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["hydrant","car","apartment","fire","street","luxury","fin","regulation","bumper","tail"]}
