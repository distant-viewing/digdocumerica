{"path":"554234.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a snow-covered ski resort. In the center and left parts of the image, there are several ski lifts in operation, with people seated on the chairs dressed in winter sportswear ascending the slope. The ski lifts are supported by poles with cables running over them. The background features rolling snow-covered hills dotted with sparse vegetation and a clear blue sky.\n\nBelow the ski lifts, numerous skiers can be seen navigating the slopes. Some skiers are actively skiing, while others appear to be standing or slowly making their way down the hill. The foreground shows a more leveled area where two people, one male and one female wearing winter clothing, are walking with their skis.\n\nThere are several buildings visible at the base of the ski slope. These buildings have a rustic design, with visible stonework and exposed beams, blending with the wintry landscape. Some have large windows and balconies that face the ski area. Around the buildings, there are areas cleared of snow, and a few small piles of shoveled snow can be seen near the paths.\n\nOverall, the scene is vibrant with the activity of winter sports enthusiasts enjoying the snowy environment at a ski resort.","title":"Chairlift goes by condominiums built alongside the ski slope at snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554235","554254","554245","554247","554236","550017","554242","550004","554248","554292","554267","554237","554279","554244","554275","554253"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["lift","snow","skier","winter","ski","resort","slope","skis","stonework","wintry"]}
