{"path":"556891.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a heavy-duty railroad track maintenance machine in action. The image is taken during the day under clear skies. The machine is large, appears to be made of heavy metal and is primarily orange in color. It is fitted with various mechanical parts, including chains, platforms, and control mechanisms, some emitting dust or smoke as the machine operates.\n\nThe machine is engaged in work directly on the railroad track, evidenced by a trail of deformed or altered track structure behind it. The terrain consists of large chunks of gravel or ballast stones commonly used to stabilize railroad tracks. The focus is primarily on the machine, but the background reveals a straight railroad extending into a flat, open area with slight vegetation and utility poles running parallel to the track.\n\nThe lighting is natural, seemingly from a low sun given the rich color saturation and long shadows that contribute to a somewhat dramatic feel. There is a palpable sense of motion and heavy industrial activity, characteristic of rail maintenance or construction scenarios. The image gives off an air of rugged functionality and the essential, often unseen, labor that goes into maintaining critical infrastructure.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way machinery, used to improve the roadbed. In 1974 the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in track maintenance, the highest in the industry. That year Southern laid 91,808 tons of rail and placed 2,278,318 railroad ties. The maximum safe speed on the company's track is usually 60 miles per hour for the entire 10,531 miles of the system. In comparison, another company has a maximum of eight miles per hour on one of its sections.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556883","556889","556901","556892","556885","556862","556894","556878","556875","556872","556895","556899","556890","556887","556869","556881"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["machine","railroad","track","maintenance","chunk","mechanism","saturation","duty","chain","functionality"]}
