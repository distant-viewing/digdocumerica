{"path":"551448.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman sitting alone on a wooden bench in an urban setting. She is dressed in casual, light blue denim overalls and a red tank top, with her long, blond hair falling loosely around her shoulders. The woman is seated with her legs pulled up to her chest, arms wrapped around her knees, and is barefoot. Her footwear, a pair of black sliders with white stripes, are placed neatly on the ground just in front of the bench.\n\nThe woman is gazing to her left with a contemplative expression, seemingly lost in thought or observing something out of frame. Behind her is a textured stone wall, possibly part of a large building, lending an architectural element to the backdrop. On the right side of the frame, a white shoulder bag with a dark strap rests on the bench, indicating she might be in transit or resting during a busy day.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is one of solitude and reflection, highlighted by the woman's relaxed yet introspective posture and the quiet backdrop. The setting and her attire suggest a casual, possibly summer day in an urban environment. The photograph uses natural lighting, adding to the candidness and realism of the scene.","title":"Waiting for the bus--on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553156","553534","551439","547175","549322","546474","557842","553501","552961","543835","553165","550940","546564","544742","551922","546223"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["bench","woman","shoulder","realism","footwear","strap","overall","chest","knee","transit"]}
