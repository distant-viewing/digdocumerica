{"path":"544881.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a striking landscape scene characterized by natural beauty and contrasting elements. In the foreground, there is a group of tall wildflowers with vibrant yellow blooms, which appear to be in sharp focus. The flowers are framed against a vast and scenic backdrop that includes a rugged mountain range.\n\nThe mountains in the distance display prominent rocky peaks, some of which are capped with remnants of snow, suggesting this photograph might have been taken in late spring or early summer. The slopes have patches of green, likely indicating grass or low bushes beginning to thrive after the winter season.\n\nBeneath the mountains, the middle ground is lush with dense coniferous forest. This green band provides a rich contrast to both the rocky mountains above and the meadow in the foreground. \n\nThe sky above the scene is almost clear with only a few fluffy, white clouds, contributing to the overall serene and pristine atmosphere of the setting. The photo captures the essence of a peaceful, natural landscape, likely taken to highlight the beauty of an alpine environment during a vibrant, blooming season.","title":"Alpine meadow","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544938","545723","555666","545714","545296","550439","544443","544848","549225","552442","544936","554562","544857","545703","555682","543582"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","season","coniferous","meadow","band","bloom","wildflower","remnant","beauty","essence"]}
