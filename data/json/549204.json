{"path":"549204.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a natural and construction landscape. The foreground shows a muddy construction site with tire tracks, indicative of heavy machinery use. There's a staple marked with a red ribbon at the left side, probably used for surveying or marking specific points. The middle ground features large cylindrical objects, which appear to be pipes, resting horizontally across the field. These pipes seem to be black and have a metallic sheen, typical of large industrial pipes possibly for plumbing or construction purposes.\n\nBeyond the immediate work site, the background transitions into a more natural setting with a slight hill dotted with numerous pine trees. The forested area extends across the entire horizon, illustrating a typical wooded hill area likely in a rural or semi-rural region. The sky is clear with a hint of cloud, suggesting a fair weather condition at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the scene is a blend of construction activity within a natural forest environment, likely related to infrastructure development such as laying pipes or constructing a facility in a less urbanized area.","title":"A railroad is being constructed through the sarpy basin area to transport coal from the westmoreland coal company culvert pipes must be laid so that railroad can follow its course-diagonally across creek bed in foreground","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["553453","554809","549169","557733","543785","549255","552814","556940","543111","543112","555542","543109","544438","546064","550350","555583"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pipe","construction","ribbon","site","mark","sheen","lay","transitions","pine","tire"]}
