{"path":"556858.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a casual outdoor gathering of primarily African American individuals. The setting appears to be a grassy field with some trees in the background, and the scene is slightly overcast. Many of the people are donning construction hard hats, suggesting they might be workers on a break or involved in some form of outdoor work-related gathering.\n\nThe people are scattered across the grass, mostly seated, with some lying down. Many are holding plates with food, indicating a communal meal such as a picnic or outdoor meal break. Thereâ€™s a relaxed, convivial atmosphere amongst the group, with individuals engaged in conversation or smiling towards the camera.\n\nAround the scene, there are various ephemera related to a meal outdoors - paper plates, utensils, and disposable cups can be seen littered around the area, showing signs of ongoing consumption. Some people are dressed in work jackets, while others wear more casual clothes.\n\nIn the left part of the image, there are metal barrels and makeshift seats possibly made from wooden planks and boxes, adding to the impromptu, functional nature of the setting. This candid shot captures a moment of leisure and social interaction during what might be a work-related pause, blending a sense of community with the environment of manual labor.","title":"Southern railway track repair crew takes a lunch break near Culpeper, Virginia.
