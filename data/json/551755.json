{"path":"551755.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph features a lush rooftop garden with a view of an urban skyline in the distant background. The garden is densely populated with various plants, predominantly roses in shades of yellow and pink, and surrounded by a black metal railing. A standout feature in the garden is a statue, which appears to be a classical bust atop a pedestal, situated to the right in the garden space, adding a sculptural element to the natural setting.\n\nThe left part of the image shows parts of an overgrown wall with vines and other green foliage climbing up it. Notably, there is a gardening tool, perhaps a watering can, that is suspended in the air, creating a playful and somewhat surreal element in the composition.\n\nIn the background, the city skyline is visible, showing a variety of buildings, including tall skyscrapers, under a clear blue sky. This suggests that the garden is located in a high-rise building within a densely urban area, offering a green refuge from the city environment.\n\nOverall, the image beautifully contrasts the serene, private garden filled with nature against the backdrop of a bustling city, highlighting a blend of urban life and natural beauty.","title":"Antique pottery sets off elegant hybrid roses and other flowering plants on this penthouse terrace at central park west and 59th street, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551756","551743","551625","551627","551626","551777","550764","551775","548442","550055","551746","551785","551702","551744","551728","551685"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","city","skyline","rose","vine","pedestal","gardening","climb","statue","suspend"]}
