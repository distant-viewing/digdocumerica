{"path":"545830.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a maritime scene with multiple ships navigating a broad waterway. The image is captured from an aerial perspective, highlighting the vessels and their movement through the water.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large cargo ship is seen traveling down the waterway, creating a long, frothy wake as it moves. This ship is dark-hued with visible structures possibly indicating its cargo-holding capacity. To its right is another smaller, possibly a cargo or tanker ship, following a similar course. It too generates a sequence of waves behind it as it advances.\n\nCentered in the image is a long, flat barge loaded with rounded, tank-like structures. The barge appears stationary or moving very slowly compared to the ships. Itâ€™s positioned perpendicular to the cargo ships, spanning across almost the complete width of the photo.\n\nThe waterway itself bends slightly around a piece of land visible on the right side of the image, which appears to be a narrow spit extending into the water. The land is sparsely vegetated and features patches of greenery, possibly wetlands or reclaimed lands, alongside small, sandy areas. The overall setting suggests a coastal or river environment near industrial or dock areas, evidenced by the presence and activity of the ships and the engineering of the waterway.\n\nFurthermore, the background scenery includes a distant horizon where additional landforms and possibly industrial structures faintly appear, adding a sense of scale and activity typical of a busy maritime hub. The photograph captures a dynamic moment of industrial maritime operations, emphasized by the multiple ships in motion and the strategic waterway layout.","title":"Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545845","548201","551990","552020","555810","551991","555788","546828","551599","555722","555721","551565","552000","546925","557816","552008"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","waterway","cargo","barge","sequence","tanker","lands","rounded","capacity","reclaim"]}
