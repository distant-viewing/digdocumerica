{"path":"553540.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph focuses closely on the action of tattooing. A personâ€™s arm is shown, with the tattoo artist's hands using a pen-like tool to apply a tattoo on the inner part of the forearm. The observed tattoo appears to be a small, simple design resembling a fish.\n\nThe foreground prominently features the arm and the tattooing process. The person being tattooed is wearing a black shirt and distressed blue jeans with a noticeable hole and frayed edges near the knee. The background is dimly lit and indistinct, providing no details beyond the immediate setting, which emphasizes the intimacy and focused activity of tattooing.\n\nThe image communicates a sense of casual or informal tattooing, possibly homemade or amateur, given the simplicity of the setting and the equipment used. The atmosphere seems relaxed and personal.","title":"Doodles of dale watkins, one of nine children in a mulky square biscuit worker's family an isolated, poor, and deteriorating neighborhood, mulky square faces major disruption from a new interstate highway","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553504","551360","553545","553482","558376","553496","546313","546366","543627","544360","558357","556229","556655","549930","556633","553217"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["tattoo","artist","arm","apply","intimacy","hole","pen","communicate","knee","person"]}
