{"path":"547470.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene that seems somewhat neglected or in disuse. The foreground is littered with various discarded items including numerous old tires, bits of wood, pieces of metal, and other debris. The center of the image is dominated by several large, rusting containers or dumpsters. They are painted in dark colors and are partially open, revealing more discarded materials inside.\n\nTo the right, there is a dilapidated truck or trailer that is covered in graffiti. Behind these foreground elements, the midground features a large building with a weathered brick facade. This building is partially covered in climbing plants or vines, which adds a touch of nature reclaiming the man-made structure. The windows of the building appear old and some are boarded up, suggesting the building may not be in active use.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial chimney emitting a plume of dark smoke, which enhances the industrial feel of the scene and may indicate some ongoing industrial activity nearby, contrasting with the abandoned feel of the foreground. The sky is a pale blue with light clouds, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon. Overall, the scene is a stark depiction of industrial decline, interspersed with signs of nature and ongoing activity.","title":"Allens avenue on the water-front is an industrial center auto shredder in background","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555521","556324","547152","542975","546084","549307","546913","546191","552154","545993","551033","552190","552189","547582","550328","550343"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpster","vine","abandoned","climbing","reclaim","discarded","decline","disuse","graffito","building"]}
