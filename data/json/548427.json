{"path":"548427.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of an urban landscape, focused predominantly on a complex of river crossings and associated infrastructures. The scene captures multiple bridges over a winding river, connecting densely populated districts with numerous high-rise residential buildings. The bridges vary in design, including both suspension and lift bridge types, contributing to a diverse industrial aesthetic.\n\nOn the left side of the river, an expansive highway curves beside the water, guiding numerous vehicles through the urban scene. Construction or industrial activity is evident near the bridges, with areas sectioned off, construction equipment visible, and ongoing work on piers or riverbanks.\n\nThe river itself is busy with activity, featuring moving boats that create white foam trails on the water. Buildings line the riverbanks, ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller commercial buildings, creating a packed metropolitan environment.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a bustling urban setting, showcasing the interplay between architectural engineering and the natural flow of the river, all under a slightly overcast sky that casts natural, soft light over the cityscape.","title":"Harlem River--Harlem on left.
