{"path":"546771.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a construction worker involved in the act of roofing. The image primarily focuses on the worker who is bending over, engaged in the application of roof shingles. The worker is wearing a long-sleeved blue shirt and brown gloves, with a red hard hat for safety. His posture suggests concentration and physical effort as part of the roofing process.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there are primarily bundled stacks of bright red roof shingles, laid systematically but varying slightly in orientation due to the construction activity. The background is somewhat overexposed, primarily showing a bright, clear sky that suggests the photography took place outdoors under good weather conditions.\n\nThe worker is using a tool, possibly a hammer, which is visible next to him, further indicating the nature of the work as involving nailing or securing the shingles to the roof structure.\n\nTools and small debris can also be spotted near the worker, adding to the sense of an active and functional construction site. The angle of the photograph is quite dynamic, taken from a lower position looking up towards the worker, emphasizing the steep angle of the roof and the challenging conditions typical of roofing tasks.","title":"Unloading lumber at the Dundalk Marine Terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["556186","544828","557731","546869","546929","546414","553921","542497","556154","543594","547858","553618","547218","553603","550273","557730"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","roofing","shingle","roof","construction","application","angle","bundle","orientation","involve"]}
