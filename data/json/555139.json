{"path":"555139.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a forest scene that appears to be recently logged or cleared, characterized by considerable debris and scattered tree remnants. The foreground of the image is dominated by a chaotic scattering of broken branches, felled trunks, and stumps, suggesting a phase of either forestry activity or natural disturbance. Amidst this tangled undergrowth, the soil and ground vegetation can be seen, adding a textural contrast to the wood debris.\n\nAround the middle of the image, several tall, slender trees remain standing, stretching vertically towards the sky. These trees vary in species, as indicated by the differences in bark texture and branching patterns. The background features a denser collection of evergreen trees that are darker and fuller, providing a dark green border around the lighter, open space in the middle.\n\nThe sky, partially visible through the gaps in the tree canopy, is overcast with soft, white clouds diffused across a light blue backdrop, suggesting either a late morning or early afternoon time. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of quiet natural disruption, with a focus on the cyclical nature of forest growth and management. The image conveys a sense of solitude and the raw aftermath of tree clearing.","title":"Private tract of forest liquidation thinned two miles east of the Simpson dry log sorting area near Matlock, Washington.
