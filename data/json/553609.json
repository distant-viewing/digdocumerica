{"path":"553609.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, there is a close-up of an individual who appears to be a manual laborer, given the dirt and grime visible on his face and attire. He is wearing a white hard hat, which is noticeably soiled, suggesting he has been working in a potentially industrial environment. His face and clothing are covered in dirt, indicating either dust from the work site or perhaps mud.\n\nHe is also wearing clear glasses, which are splattered with the same substance covering his face. His expression is cheerful or light-hearted, as he is smiling and showing his teeth, adding a lively contrast to the otherwise tough working conditions implied by his appearance.\n\nHis clothing consists of a dirty and worn light blue t-shirt. The background is out of focus with muted tones, making it difficult to discern any specific details, thus keeping the focus tightly on the man himself.\n\nOverall, the image captures the resilience or positive attitude of a worker amidst what appears to be physically challenging conditions.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. A \"cat skinner\" works in post-fire salvage operations. Caterpillar tractors are used to haul logs to \"landing area\" (seen here), where they are loaded onto trucks.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["542783","553618","554953","544382","556391","547163","558312","544171","542779","556345","553634","553610","553025","556867","544835","542497"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["face","tooth","grime","working","clothing","dirt","substance","close","mud","dust"]}
