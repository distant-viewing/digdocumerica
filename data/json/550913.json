{"path":"550913.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a bird's-eye view of a large tugboat moving through a body of water, presumably an ocean or sea, under what appears to be strong sunlight. The surface of the water is dark, yet it glimmers significantly due to the reflection of the sunlight, creating a pattern that sparkles intensely around the ripples and wake generated by the moving boat. \n\nThe tugboat, positioned centrally in the frame and slightly toward the upper part of the photo, is surrounded by water that is textured with waves and frothy trails. This trailing wake fans out in a distinctive V-shape pattern that expands as it extends away from the tugboat, indicating the boat's movement through the water.\n\nThe boat itself is visible in clear detail, showing a robust, compact structure typical of tugboats, designed for strength and maneuverability. It features several levels of decks, a central superstructure, and what appears to be a small chimney or smokestack, suggesting that it is likely powered by a diesel engine. No persons are visible on the deck, leaving the focus purely on the boat and its interaction with the watery environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—featuring the contrast between the dark, textured water and the glistening light reflections—emphasizes the solitary journey of the tugboat as it navigates the expansive and shimmering sea.","title":"Towboat maneuvers into position behind barge on the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["546938","550893","550872","550901","551179","550914","550894","546845","551990","555798","546832","548067","550892","551542","550906","557815"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","boat","wake","deck","glimmer","expand","fan","sea","reflection","glistening"]}
