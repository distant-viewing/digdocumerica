{"path":"549680.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene dominated by a striking, large Gothic cathedral with an intricate facade and a tall spire. The cathedral features detailed architectural patterns including sharply pointed arches and is primarily in shades of gray with a patterned, tiled roof in contrasting colors. The viewpoint appears to be from an elevated position on an adjacent building.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, various elements of busy city life are evident. The square in front of the cathedral is bustling with activity, with several market stalls covered with red and blue tarps, suggesting an outdoor market is taking place. The area is also filled with pedestrians moving across the square and interacting around the market.\n\nThere is a visible presence of different types of vehicles adding to the urban vibe. A prominent light blue bus is parked on the street, and other vehicles and trucks are visible around this central area, likely used for transporting goods for the market.\n\nBuildings surrounding the square present a traditional European architectural style featuring facades with multiple windows. The left side of the frame shows a partial view of a modern building contrasting with the historic setting of the cathedral.\n\nThis photograph effectively records a moment of daily life in a historic city setting, showcasing a blend of architectural beauty, commercial activity, and the dynamism of urban life.","title":"St. Stephens Cathedral and subway construction on the street below","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549991","547229","551788","556240","551796","551866","549681","549659","551786","551804","542797","551493","556020","549662","551789","549974"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["market","square","facade","dynamism","tarp","record","life","stall","spire","city"]}
