{"path":"554629.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural scene, likely taken during dusk or in low light conditions, adding a moody, atmospheric quality to the image. It shows a calm river running through a densely wooded valley. The river reflects the sky and the surrounding vegetation, creating a mirror image on the water's surface. The banks of the river are covered with lush greenery, primarily thick forests that slope up into the hills on either side. In the distance, fog or low clouds hang over the hills, partially obscuring them and adding a layer of mystique to the upper portion of the image. The overall color palette is composed of dark blues, greens, and hints of purples; no human activity or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the untouched nature of the landscape. The composition balances water and forest, with the river acting as a central element leading the viewerâ€™s eye through the scene. It appears to be a tranquil, secluded spot, likely far from urban settings.","title":"Rechannelized course of Calamity Brook around Lake Sanford which has been filled in with titanium tailings.
