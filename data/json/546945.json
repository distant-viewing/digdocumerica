{"path":"546945.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph shows a large body of water, likely the ocean, with a noticeable wake pattern composed of frothy white waves. This trail is winding and seems to stretch from the foreground into the distant background. The water is dark blue and relatively calm, with the surface reflecting bits of light, possibly from the sunlight. The perspective suggests that it might have been taken from a boat or a higher vantage point in the water, focusing specifically on this zigzag pattern left by a moving vessel that has likely passed through the area previously.\n\nThe horizon is visible, and at a distance one can also notice hints of land or perhaps islands. The sky takes up a minor portion of the top of the frame, and it appears to be clear with no visible clouds, indicating good weather conditions. The overall composition focuses on the intriguing texture of the water's surface and the contrast between the serene vastness of the sea and the disruptive pattern of the wake, highlighting the interaction between human activity and the natural environment.\n","title":"Dead menhaden float along the tide line just north of chesapeake bay bridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["551564","547674","547685","556911","555715","555708","555701","547276","542697","552166","557818","545043","552921","552269","544142","546049"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["wake","zigzag","pattern","notice","pass","island","water","trail","bit","vessel"]}
