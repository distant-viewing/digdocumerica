{"path":"552271.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aquatic scene where a person is engaged in the activity of fishing. The main focus is on the dynamic splash of water around a large fishing net that is partially submerged, suggesting the moment when fish are being scooped up. Within the net, several fish can be discerned, indicating the success of the catch.\n\nThe person, only partially visible in the frame, is shown from the waist down. They wear dark pants and rugged, waterproof boots, suitable for the wet environment. The person is holding a wooden pole that is likely attached to the net, aiding in maneuvering it through the water.\n\nThe water itself is a prominent feature in the image, swirling around with splashes and ripples that catch sparks of light, hinting at the vibrancy of the environment. Droplets of water are scattered throughout the air, catching the light and adding a sparkling effect to the photo.\n\nIn the background, although obscured by the focus on the immediate action, dark silhouettes of dense trees can be seen, suggesting that this fishing activity is taking place in a river or lake near a forested area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on action and the environment, conveys a sense of vigorous outdoor activity and interaction with nature.","title":"Commercial salmon harvest, Domsea Aquaculture site Manchester","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552321","551393","551387","553332","552274","550313","548190","542561","544714","551410","554519","554520","551024","552320","555576","545212"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","catch","fishing","splash","fish","action","person","spark","scoop","waist"]}
