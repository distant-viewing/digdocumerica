{"path":"546401.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, darker scene of a wet road surrounded by nature. The road takes up the forefront and middle of the image, curving slightly as it disappears into the distance. A noticeable aspect of the road is a large, colorful oil slick which adds vibrant blue, pink, and yellow hues to the otherwise dark asphalt. This adds a colorful anomaly in an environment dominated by muted tones.\n\nThe surroundings are densely wooded, with trees flanking both sides of the road. The sky is overcast with gray clouds contributing to the overall somber tone of the scene. At the vanishing point of the road, a road sign is visible, though its details are unclear due to the perspective and lighting.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late evening due to the lack of strong shadows and the dim light. The overall ambience is one of quiet and solitude, potentially after a rainstorm, as indicated by the wet road and the reflective sheen on the surface, including the oil slick. This image likely evokes a sense of calmness mixed with a bit of melancholy due to the subdued natural and man-made elements depicted.","title":"Road near San Juan, Puerto Rico","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547659","557011","556986","544598","545367","544116","556943","554832","545875","545402","550216","542858","547168","554130","556983","552521"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["road","oil","sheen","asphalt","ambience","calmness","lack","bit","forefront","tone"]}
