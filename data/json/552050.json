{"path":"552050.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a serene maritime scene dominated by bright blue water under a clear sky. There are three main vessels in view: on the left, there's a cabin cruiser boat with a white hull and blue trim, cruising gently on the water. It has a small canopy and at least two people can be seen aboard. Towards the center and slightly in the background, a sailboat with a white sail is gliding smoothly, adding a leisurely and elegant touch to the scene. On the right, closer to the foreground, a small motorboat with two passengers wearing life vests speeds across, creating a light spray in its wake.\n\nThe water is shimmering under the sunlight, indicating it might be midday or early afternoon. The horizon is marked by a distant line that could be a landmass or a breakwater, and this adds a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The overhead conditions suggest a pleasant day for boating, with no visible clouds, which suggests good weather ideal for maritime activities. The entire composition evokes a sense of calmness with recreational undertones, typical of a leisurely day out on the water.","title":"Buffalo harbor and boats on Lake Erie","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["555718","545057","552316","544021","549411","548736","548247","547781","546317","544667","548516","542904","548520","552292","543305","542903"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["cruiser","undertone","breakwater","glide","cruise","landmass","motorboat","boat","shimmer","calmness"]}
