{"path":"556047.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph displays an urban setting with a prominent foreground and a detailed background. In the foreground, a large vertical sign stands prominently. It advertises a commercial property for sale, listing the available area as 20,000 sq. ft. and providing a phone number to call. The text \"Fort Worth Chamber Development Corporation\" indicates the location and the organization involved. A clear blue sky provides a bright background for the sign.\n\nThe middle ground shows a patch of unkempt, grassy land leading to a sidewalk demarcated by a worn curb. Small patches of grass and weeds are visible in the cracks of the pavement, suggesting a less maintained urban area.\n\nIn the background, there's a large, two-story red brick building with distinctive architectural features such as multiple arched windows topped with white accents and a design that incorporates both traditional and industrial elements. The structure has a flat facade accompanied by a sloping roof on one side. A few cars from the period (possibly 1970s or 1980s based on their style) are parked along the street in front of the building, and another road runs parallel to the building.\n\nThe overall image evokes a sense of a commercial area with interest in redevelopment or sale, as suggested by the signage and the architecture of the surroundings. The clear weather and daylight conditions highlight the features of the urban landscape effectively.","title":"Fort worth, Texas, passenger train station which serves the lone star traveling between Chicago and Houston, Texas.
