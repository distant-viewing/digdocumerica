{"path":"542616.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of logging activity in a forested area. In the image, a large yellow logging machine, labeled as a \"745 H Hough Payloader,\" is in the process of loading massive cut tree trunks onto the bed of a white semi-truck equipped with a timber trailer. The truck is marked with a prominent white cab and a blue front, featuring the distinctive grille and logo of an older model Freightliner.\n\nThe loader has a set of heavy-duty forks attached to its front, lifting one of the logs. Each log appears to be several feet in diameter, emphasizing the scale of the logging operations and the size of the trees being harvested. The ground around the vehicles is muddy and shows evidence of heavy tire tracks, suggesting recent and extensive use of heavy machinery.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest of tall pine trees stretches out beneath a blue sky scattered with few clouds. Snow-capped hills or low mountains are visible in the distance, indicating that this logging activity is occurring in a mountainous region.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph highlights the industrial aspects of logging, juxtaposed against the natural forest environment, and may evoke thoughts about resource extraction and its impact on natural landscapes.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["542790","554419","554416","542856","552202","542624","542855","552201","554418","542854","555154","545046","554417","554420","550707","542852"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["log","loader","truck","evidence","grille","cab","front","forest","cut","extraction"]}
