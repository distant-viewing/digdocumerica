{"path":"552337.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and stunning view of the setting sun against a dark sky. The sun, positioned centrally in the frame, dominates the image with its bright yellow and orange hues fading into a deeper red along the edges. The upper portion of the sun appears slightly obscured by an atmospheric anomaly or a cloud, resulting in a soft, uneven top edge that contrasts with the otherwise perfectly round shape.\n\nThe sky surrounding the sun features gradient shades ranging from intense orange near the sun to darker, almost purple tones at the periphery, suggesting that the sun is very low on the horizon. Below the sun, there is a dark horizon line that could be either a distant landscape or the sea, adding a layer of mystery and depth to the composition. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of tranquility and awe, typical of a sunset that invites contemplation. The picture's relatively low light conditions reinforce the serenity and peacefulness of an evening drawing to a close.","title":"Puget sound and the San Juan islands at sunset, seen from overlook at larrabee state park","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["542679","542680","557629","542678","553844","555070","554396","547719","543144","557957","555164","543410","552896","548123","552335","549847"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","stun","deeper","periphery","atmospheric","serenity","mystery","result","peacefulness","horizon"]}
