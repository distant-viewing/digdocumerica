{"path":"549100.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, a man stands on a rocky shoreline observing a large body of water. The water is predominantly dark blue but is speckled with numerous white patches, which appear to be some form of pollution or organic material such as foam. The man is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, and he has his hands placed on his hips as he looks out over the water.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes a tree-lined bank on the opposite side of the water, suggesting a river setting. The sky is clear and mostly cloudless, indicating a sunny day, which is reinforced by the bright sunlight reflecting off the water and the rocks.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a peaceful yet troubled atmosphere, as the natural beauty of the landscape contrasts with the apparent pollution in the water. The manâ€™s posture and the direction of his gaze suggest concern or contemplation regarding the state of the environment.","title":"Waste floating on Colorado River 5 miles south of Parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["555867","550268","545014","545032","544784","550826","548741","542556","542976","546799","554848","545940","555547","544527","554040","545854"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["pollution","water","hip","foam","gaze","concern","man","contemplation","direction","bank"]}
