{"path":"547169.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph displays an outdoor scene characterized by a flooded area. The central focal point is an orange buoy hanging from a bent, slender metal pole, which is partially submerged in the water. The background contains leafless trees and another larger, greenish pole or tree, suggesting a possibly vast and partly wooded floodplain.\n\nThe water’s coverage is quite extensive, stretching across the image, and hinting at recent significant rainfall or an overflow of a nearby river or lake. The surface of the water reflects the ambient light, creating glittering spots, indicative of a possibly sunny or partly cloudy day.\n\nIn the distant background, a building and another structure are slightly discernible. These elements, along with a vehicle moving along a road running parallel to the water, provide a hint of human presence and activity in this area, subtly positioned further away from the flooded zone.\n\nThe image evokes a tranquil yet somber mood, represented by the stillness of the water and the subdued, natural winter or early spring colors. The overall composition and subdued colors help focus the viewer’s attention on the singular, brightly colored buoy amidst the expansive, serene waterscape.","title":"Flooded area in zion after winter storm on lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552270","548740","552853","552834","555570","552440","547677","550788","545008","546109","557444","550832","552852","555637","546066","545923"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["buoy","waterscape","pole","overflow","water","coverage","rainfall","stillness","woode","represent"]}
