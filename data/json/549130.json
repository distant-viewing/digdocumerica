{"path":"549130.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an upward angle view of a barren, rocky slope under a bright and vivid blue sky scattered with fluffy, white clouds. The composition emphasizes a stark contrast between the rugged texture of the ground and the smooth, expansive sky.\n\nThe earth in the foreground is gritty and covered with small stones and pebbles, exhibiting shades of grey and traces of white salt deposits. There are very few signs of vegetation; only some sparse, dry brushes appear at the very top of the slope, blending into the horizon line which is barely visible due to the perspective.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights the rough texture of the ground while also casting deep shadows, adding a sense of depth and roughness to the terrain. The sky occupies the upper third of the photograph, serving as a vibrant backdrop that complements the earthy tones of the slope.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a desolate, almost otherworldly landscape under a dynamic sky, creating a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of nature.","title":"No vegetation grows on this 20-year old spoil pile from a strip mine at Colstrip.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555642","549183","549132","549179","549136","548673","544401","555885","546385","545724","552685","545895","555573","543838","544027","543635"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["slope","trace","brush","salt","deposit","pebble","third","grey","texture","ground"]}
