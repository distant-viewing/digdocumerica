{"path":"543001.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area beside a large body of water, likely a port. In the foreground, there are large piles of materials and several industrial buildings. Prominent in this scene is a factory from which thick white smoke is billowing out into the sky. This smoke disperses across the sky and blends into low clouds, creating an overcast or polluted atmosphere.\n\nThe landscape is dominated by a grid-like pattern of roads and smaller buildings, which indicates a densely populated or well-developed area. A bridge spans the body of water, connecting different parts of the industrial area. Beyond this immediate industrial scene, the environment transitions into what appears to be a residential area, with numerous houses aligned in neat rows.\n\nIn the background, mountains are visible, partially obscured by haze or fog, which might be pollution-related. The overall color tone of the picture is cool, with a blue and gray cast, suggesting either the natural light conditions at the time or a filter effect in photography. The image conveys a sense of environmental impact, illustrating the contrast between industrial activities and natural landscapes.","title":"Smog over industrial Humboldt Bay-Eureka area","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555769","555770","548068","551053","545268","550866","551567","544058","548107","552193","547696","544999","557246","550706","550862","548340"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["polluted","smoke","disperse","photography","port","prominent","fog","billow","transition","grid"]}
