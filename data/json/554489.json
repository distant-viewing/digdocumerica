{"path":"554489.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of adults and one child engaged in an outdoor activity. The scene is set in a lush, green environment, likely in a rural or suburban area given the presence of abundant foliage and trees in the background. The sky is partially cloudy, suggesting it might be a cool or overcast day.\n\nThe group consists of six adults and a small child. They are gathered on a wooden deck adorned with a railing, which suggests it might be raised above ground level. The adults' attire varies, including casual and slightly dressier outfits, ranging from patterned shirts to simple pullovers and pants. One adult, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans, is bending over what appears to be a large, white, vintage ice cream freezer or a similar device, actively engaging with it or fixing something. This individual's action suggests the group might be preparing or enjoying homemade ice cream or engaged in a similar communal activity.\n\nOne woman in a cardigan and pants appears to be holding the child, who seems to be observing the activities or being shown something by another individual. Others in the group are focused towards the ice cream device or the activities surrounding it, suggesting a moment of leisure and communal enjoyment.\n\nIn the background, there's an implication of a blue ski lift chair, hinting that this location could either be multifunctional (serving as a recreational area in different seasons) or that it is near a resort or park equipped with such facilities. Electrical or cable lines are visible, cutting across the upper part of the image, typical of a developed area. Overall, the photograph exudes a sense of leisure, recreation, and shared experience among family or friends in a natural, serene setting.","title":"Tourists are helped onto ski lift chairs operated in summer for scenic sightseeing, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at the mccauley mountain ski area","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543234","557779","552033","547756","555947","543609","554667","557933","551004","552036","553498","550026","551413","553065","545267","545311"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["cream","ice","adult","group","child","device","implication","leisure","cardigan","fix"]}
