{"path":"548030.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic, tranquil water landscape, likely captured during the day, under partially cloudy skies. The viewpoint is from the edge of a grassy area extending into a large body of water. The foreground is dominated by a thick layer of green marsh grass, which leads viewers' eyes towards the water.\n\nThe expanse of water is calm, with light reflections visible on its surface, enhancing the serene atmosphere. On the right side of the frame, there is a small structure, resembling a floating house or shack, adding a focal point and a sense of human presence. This structure is isolated and sits directly on the water, supported by what looks to be a floating base.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a range of hills or low mountains, stretching across the horizon and providing a sense of depth. The sky, featuring wispy clouds against a gradient of blue, covers the upper portion of the image, contributing to the overall peacefulness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its natural color palette and calm water, evokes a tranquil, somewhat isolated environment, potentially indicative of a remote or less inhabited area. The presence of the floating structure suggests human activity, possibly related to fishing or simply a dwelling in a unique location.","title":"The mouth of Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548034","545008","556928","552916","550778","550324","543058","550750","554527","543611","550493","544567","542870","552141","550357","542908"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["float","isolate","water","shack","dwelling","marsh","hills","scenic","peacefulness","tranquil"]}
