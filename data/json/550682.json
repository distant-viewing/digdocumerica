{"path":"550682.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scenic natural landscape dominated by a wide, fast-flowing river. The river has a shimmering surface, reflecting sunlight in various shades of silver and blue. It appears swollen, possibly due to recent rains, covering a substantial width of the frame. Surrounding the river are thickly wooded areas with dense collections of trees, predominantly coniferous, suggesting a location in a temperate or cooler forested region.\n\nThe foreground is framed by tree trunks and overhanging branches, contributing to the composition's natural framing and depth. These trees cast shadows across each other, and dappled sunlight filters through the leaves, creating patterns of light and shadow on the grassy riverbank.\n\nThe background reveals lower hills or mountains, which add a sense of scale and distance. The sky is partly cloudy, with large clouds that suggest the possibility of changing weather, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil scene.\n\nOverall, the photographâ€™s composition, the interplay between light and shadow, and its depth through the use of natural elements skilfully capture a serene yet wild riverside landscape.","title":"Androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550700","550658","550656","548156","542537","553855","544861","550680","550562","550542","542653","555076","553653","550531","542523","545068"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["possibility","river","temperate","dapple","width","riverside","silver","sunlight","framing","shimmering"]}
