{"path":"549072.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic scene featuring a biplane during what appears to be either crop dusting or low-level flying over a field. The plane is shown in silhouette due to the time of day, which seems to be either dusk or dawn, creating a striking contrast as it moves through the air. Massive plumes of dust or spray trail behind the aircraft, billowing in large, dense clouds that partially obscure the rear view of the plane. The plane itself is characterized by two main wings stacked one above the other, with supports between them, typical of classic biplane designs. The unobstructed part of the background hints at a flat horizon, suggesting that this activity is taking place in an open, possibly agricultural area. The overall mood is dramatic and intense, underscored by the subdued lighting and the dynamic activity captured.","title":"Crop duster in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553873","548884","542504","542503","542500","542501","542506","553044","542496","542495","542508","548883","548841","542717","542499","542502"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","biplane","dusting","wing","fly","aircraft","spray","billow","dust","trail"]}
