{"path":"543477.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seen relaxing on a sunny beach under the shade of a large, colorful umbrella which predominantly features red, yellow, green, and blue segments. The man is lying on his back on the sand, with his hands behind his head, sporting a white T-shirt and a straw hat to shield his face from the sun. \n\nThe beach around him is somewhat cluttered with various items scattered around, including towels, a bucket, clothing, and other beach essentials, reflecting a casual beach-going experience. The sand appears fine and light-colored, typical of many beaches. In the background, several seagulls are visible walking on the sand, adding a natural, lively element typical of coastal settings.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a typical leisurely moment at the beach, emphasizing relaxation and the enjoyment of a sunny day by the seaside. The presence of seagulls and a messy arrangement of beach gear contribute to the authenticity and unstaged feel of the scene.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["548624","554160","547503","553685","550932","553882","548541","550931","547628","550928","553686","547491","545162","550930","550936","553683"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","seagull","sand","essential","authenticity","seaside","towel","umbrella","straw","segment"]}
