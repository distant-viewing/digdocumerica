{"path":"546513.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene golf club setting. In the foreground, a golf bag with clubs inside lies on its side on the grass, suggesting a player has just taken a break or is nearby. The middle ground features a lush green golf course with manicured lawns stretched out towards a clubhouse. The clubhouse itself is prominently displayed in the background. It has a modern design with large windows that span the entire length of the building and a slightly pitched roof. It looks two-storied, with a structure that partly extends over a terrace or patio area supported by thin columns.\n\nOn the left side of the image, two individuals are visible; one is standing at the edge of the putting green, appearing to either be observing the course or waiting for someone. Paths lead up to the clubhouse, suggesting accessible walkways for visitors and golfers. The sky is clear and blue, signifying a bright and calm day, which adds to the tranquil and leisurely atmosphere typical of a golf course setting.","title":"Otter Creek clubhouse and golf course, built in 1964","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["554149","543633","549069","546959","554492","554148","554167","552608","548821","546509","557512","545249","558098","547286","543262","553980"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","course","club","patio","terrace","player","break","walkway","lawn","visitor"]}
