{"path":"543059.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene aerial view of a waterfront scene, where nature and tranquility are the main themes. The image is dominated by a large expanse of dark blue water which indicates it might be deep navigation water rather than a shallow beach area. \n\nIn the center and upper parts of the water, there is a congregation of numerous small sailboats, clustered together, likely engaged in a sailing event or gathering. These boats, with their sails down, are scattered in a fairly random pattern across the water's surface. The calmness of the water suggests there isn't much wind, making for stable conditions for such an event.\n\nProminently in the lower half of the photo, there is a sandy beach bordering the water body. The beach curves gently and ends at the water’s edge, forming a clear, smooth boundary with the water. The sand appears pristine, without significant markings or debris, enhancing the untouched natural appearance.\n\nSurrounding the central focus of boats and beach are various birds, spotted both flying above the water and resting or gliding on the surface. Their presence adds a dynamic component to the scene, enlivening the otherwise calm and orderly landscape.\n\nThe lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, with the angle of the light casting delicate shadows and enhancing the textures of the water and sand. Overall, the composition of the photograph—ranging from the arrangement of boats to the natural landscape and wildlife—creates a peaceful yet engaging scene, highlighting leisure activities in a beautiful natural setting.","title":"Birds feed at low tide in the waters of Humboldt Bay.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547781","548247","552355","552234","544021","552345","542904","544669","542903","543305","542907","555718","552292","548118","547757","543119"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["beach","water","boat","sand","congregation","event","navigation","calmness","half","sailing"]}
