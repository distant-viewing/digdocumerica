{"path":"543244.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene enveloped in a hazy, possibly foggy atmosphere. The scene is viewed from an elevated vantage point overlooking choppy ocean waves in the foreground. The sea exhibits dynamic movement with whitecaps visible on the surface, suggesting windy conditions. The water is a deep, dark blue, contrasting with the white foam of the breaking waves.\n\nFurther ashore, the sandy beach is visible, appearing relatively deserted and stretching across the middle part of the frame from the left to the right side. The sand is a pale golden color and is mostly empty, indicating a tranquil, uncrowded setting.\n\nOn the beach, several structures, possibly beach houses or storage sheds, are situated. These buildings vary in size and shape, featuring what appears to be weathered wood siding, suggesting they are well-used and exposed to the elements. The architecture has a rustic, utilitarian feel, typical of seaside facilities. They are clustered towards the right side of the photograph.\n\nThe overall tone of the photograph is muted, with a soft palette dominated by blues, grays, and browns, which, along with the haze, gives the scene a dreamy, timeless quality. The horizon is barely discernible due to the haze, blurring the line between sea and sky which enhances the sense of isolation and calmness. There are no visible people or active movement on the beach, reinforcing a sense of stillness and quiet solitude. This composition evokes a nostalgic or contemplative mood, possibly from an early or mid-20th-century setting, given the color saturation and quality of the image.","title":"California--Zmudowski State Park area","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543091","543078","547607","542890","543287","543081","547612","548757","543493","543089","548221","547492","543069","545280","547600","542886"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","haze","whitecap","wave","sea","movement","quality","calmness","saturation","foam"]}
