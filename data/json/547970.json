{"path":"547970.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site likely involved in roadwork or building foundations. A cluster of large, rough stones dominate the foreground; these are potentially being moved or positioned using the heavy machinery visible. The machinery includes a crane with a mechanical grabber that is actively engaged with the stones, suggesting it is either placing or rearranging them.\n\nTwo individuals, likely construction workers, are present in the scene. One of them is walking in the foreground, dressed in a white hard hat and dark clothing, and carrying something in his hand. The other worker is operating the crane, though not clearly visible due to the angle and focus of the image.\n\nThe background provides a broader context of a coastal area. The sea is visible on the extreme left, hinting at a coastal road construction project. A road runs parallel to the construction site with street lamps and seems fairly tranquil with minimal traffic. There are a few buildings and construction fences, indicating ongoing development or a lightly populated area. \n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and mechanical assistance in a construction setting, emphasizing development in a coastal environment. The clarity and vividness of colors suggest the photo might be from an older film camera, given the slight grain and saturation typical of film photography.","title":"Seawall is rebuilt over pipes of new sewage system at the entrance to Sandy Hook state park","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["547216","547171","545631","546252","546833","549308","545648","549664","545858","545070","553375","547181","548559","545657","545665","550274"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","film","crane","worker","assistance","stone","development","foundation","machinery","site"]}
