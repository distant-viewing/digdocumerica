{"path":"548356.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph shows a somewhat industrial and grim setting featuring a large barge loaded with debris in a canal or river. The barge, prominently visible in the foreground, is heavily laden with chunks of broken concrete, rubble, and assorted debris. It's marked with the letters \"DS 111\" on its side, suggesting it might be designated for dumping or hauling debris.\n\nIn the background, there are partially visible industrial buildings, including one with visible doorways and windows, appearing somewhat dilapidated or run-down. Beyond these structures, you can see three tall chimneys or smokestacks emitting no visible smoke, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe area surrounding the barge and buildings looks neglected, with sparse vegetation and muddy shorelines. The weather appears overcast, casting a dull light over the entire scene and enhancing the bleak, utilitarian aspect of the environment.\n\nThis setting likely depicts an industrial or post-industrial landscape, possibly involved in construction, demolition, or waste management activities. The focus on the debris-laden barge suggests the primary activity at the time of the photo was related to the transportation or removal of industrial waste or rubble.","title":"Garbage scow at Fresh Kills on Staten Island, just east of Carteret, NJ.
