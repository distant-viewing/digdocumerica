{"path":"548702.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a solitary mangrove tree standing in a large body of water, likely an ocean or a very large lake. The sky, which occupies the upper third of the image, is dusky, suggesting early evening or late afternoon timing. There are a few scattered clouds in the sky, but they are thin and sparse.\n\nThe tree itself is notable for its resilience, growing directly out of the water, and features a dense cluster of dark green leaves. Its roots are twisted and exposed above the water surface, characteristic of mangrove trees which are adapted to saline coastal environments. \n\nThe water appears calm with gentle ripples, and there are no visible landforms in the immediate vicinity, giving the impression that the tree is isolated. In the distance, under the expanse of the sky, the horizon line is clearly visible, subtly blending the water with the sky.\n\nThere are no people or man-made objects present in the image, highlighting a natural and serene setting. The color pallet is mostly subdued with blues, greens, and grays dominating the scene, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the photograph.  \n\nThe composition of the photo, with the tree centrally placed against the vast expanse of sky and water, draws attention to its solitary nature and the expanse around it, emphasizing themes of resilience and solitude.","title":"Mangrove trees growing off-shore from the state park at long key.
