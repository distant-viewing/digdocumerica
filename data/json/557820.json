{"path":"557820.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil and picturesque natural waterfall surrounded by a wooded area. The waterfall streams down from the top center of the image over a series of rock formations and cascades forcefully into a clear pool at the bottom. The water flow is captured with a smooth, silky appearance likely due to a slow shutter speed, giving it a dreamy, ethereal quality.\n\nThe waterfall is framed by rugged, mossy boulders on the left side, and similar rock formations partially obstruct the view on the right side, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the cascading water. The forest surrounding the waterfall is thick with tall, dense trees displaying hints of seasonal change in their foliage, with colors ranging from deep greens to subtle hints of yellow and brown.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is soft and diffused, possibly indicative of an overcast day, enhancing the rich colors of the forest and the glistening wet surfaces of the rocks. The overall composition and the natural setting suggest a peaceful, secluded spot, likely far from urban distractions. This picture invites the viewer to appreciate the serene beauty and timeless quality of this undisturbed natural landscape.","title":"Waterfall from Flume Brook falling into Flume Gorge in the Franconia Notch State Park, south of Franconia, New Hampshire. The flume is a natural 800-foot long chasm formed before the Ice Age. Other attractions in the state park include an aerial tramway that carries passengers to the top of 4,200-foot Cannon Mountain, and the Old Man of the Mountains, a 40-foot profile made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The area is part of the White Mountain National Forest.","placename":"Franconia Notch State Park (N.H.)","location":"Franconia Notch State Park, New Hamshire","nn1":["554408","555073","558087","555220","554409","545878","550979","545839","542594","544348","545874","555210","546180","551349","544456","557745"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","rock","formation","mossy","cascade","distraction","shutter","forest","hint","quality"]}
