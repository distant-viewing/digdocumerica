{"path":"545691.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a vibrant magenta-pink thistle flower. The flower's many slender, spiky petals radiate from a central point, resembling a burst or an explosion of color. Below the flower, the plant shows its characteristic sharp, spiny leaves that are quite dense and tangled.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, providing a natural backdrop that primarily consists of dark green and brown hues, hinting at surrounding vegetation and the natural environment typical for thistles. This blurred background helps in emphasizing the sharp details and the striking color of the thistle flower in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the photo harmoniously combines vibrant color, detailed texture of the plant, and a natural setting to deliver an eye-catching botanical portrait.","title":"Thistle grows in upper water canyon, named for the spring of pure water it contains, a rarity in this dry area","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["554841","554839","544578","557545","547815","543200","555053","558079","554595","550462","542970","545707","554843","547613","553588","557167"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","deliver","radiate","burst","tangle","portrait","petal","plant","strike","slender"]}
