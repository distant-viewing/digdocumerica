{"path":"544684.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene during twilight or sunset, creating a visually striking silhouette of an industrial facility against a vibrant sky. The sky transitions from dark blue hues at the top, suggesting it's either early evening or dusk, to warm golden tones near the horizon.\n\nThe industrial facility features multiple tall structures, possibly smokestacks, from which three thick plumes of dark smoke are billowing into the sky. The smoke plumes are denser near the stacks and gradually disperse as they rise and travel leftwards across the sky, colored by the sunset.\n\nThe foreground is indistinct, but features additional parts of the industrial installation, including what might be more machinery and interconnected structures suggested by their outlines against the sky. There are also multiple power lines crisscrossing at varied angles, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of heavy industry and possibly pollution, emphasized by the contrast between the dark, smoky output of the stacks and the natural beauty of the evening sky.","title":"Sunset and smoke","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["546384","544696","545446","553847","544708","545414","544688","547090","545438","545425","544173","545433","552164","552165","544700","548851"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["stack","plume","sunset","output","evening","smoke","facility","sky","installation","twilight"]}
