{"path":"553083.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene rural landscape featuring a narrow water channel or irrigation ditch, extending straight into the distance, bordered by grass and undergrowth. The picture is taken during the day under clear skies with few clouds, casting natural light across the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the water channel is lined with dense, lush green vegetation and a few scattered trees further back. The right bank of the channel is slightly more cultivated, visible with trimmed grass and a few large, leafy deciduous trees providing shade. A wire fence runs parallel to the channel on the right side, which encloses a grassy field, offering a sense of rural farmland management.\n\nThe middle ground features more open fields framed by trees, suggesting a spacious rural environment. Further in the background, the sky dominates with its expansive, light blue canvas sprinkled sparsely with white clouds, indicating a peaceful, idyllic day.\n\nThe photograph conveys a calm and tranquil rural setting, perhaps used for small-scale agriculture or livestock, emphasized by the presence of fencing and managed vegetation. The reflection in the water adds a touch of stillness and symmetry to the image, enhancing the placid nature of the setting.","title":"Irrigation ditch near Fallon","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["544678","552733","553652","553080","557091","545040","551304","544535","546126","544470","551332","558016","550778","558002","555575","555596"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["channel","ditch","irrigation","symmetry","canvas","fencing","farmland","undergrowth","livestock","field"]}
