{"path":"543296.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a scenic beach landscape. Two prominent trees with angled trunks and horizontally spread branches frame the left side of the image. Their leaves create a natural canopy, leaving parts of the scene in silhouette against a bright background sky.\n\nThe beach itself is expansive, stretching across the image towards the right. The shoreline is wide, with a mix of wet and dry sandy surfaces that reflect the sunlight, creating a shimmering effect on the beach. The surf is gentle, with small to moderate waves visible near the shore.\n\nIn the distance along the beach, there are several people scattered around. Some appear to be walking, while others might be standing and enjoying the view. The background features a line of trees or forest running parallel to the beach, reinforcing a secluded and natural setting.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a hint of blue peeking through, suggesting that the photo was taken either early or late in the day, given the angled and soft quality of the light. Overall, the composition uses natural framing and a wide perspective to highlight the beauty and tranquility of this coastal scene.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543303","554159","547697","546970","546953","543287","548757","544989","545280","547592","543252","554120","548221","547596","545106","557529"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","surf","framing","canopy","trunk","shoreline","wave","shore","branch","silhouette"]}
