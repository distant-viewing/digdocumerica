{"path":"545761.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a breathtaking view of a rugged landscape, presumably around dusk given the soft lighting and long shadows. The photograph provides a vivid portrayal of expansive, layered rock formations and deep canyons characteristic of a desert, possibly in a region similar to those found in the American Southwest.\n\nIn the foreground, a narrow dirt trail or ledge runs into the composition from the bottom right corner, leading the viewer's eye into the vast, layered terrain. This trail appears precarious, hugging the side of a steep incline, and is bathed in the warm tones of the setting sun. \n\nBeyond this trail, the landscape unfolds in a spectacle of deep reds, browns, and oranges, indicative of sedimentary rock formations. These layers create a complex texture across the landscape, displaying a natural history of geological processes. The formations are intricately carved, featuring plateaus, sharp cliffs, and winding valleys that suggest the presence of water erosion over millennia.\n\nThe middle distance shows a more flattened area with what seems to be a road or riverbed snaking through it, hinting at human interaction with the landscape or the natural path of a now-dry river. \n\nThe backdrop consists of a vast horizon under a vast sky, lightly brushed with thin, wispy clouds. The clouds catch some of the fading light, adding a dynamic and colorful element to the sky, contrasting subtly with the more shadowed, profound elements of the terrain below.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph emphasizes the awe-inspiring, untouched feel of a vast wilderness. The lighting enhances the textures of the landscape, creating a dramatic yet serene natural scene that invites contemplation of nature's grandeur and the passage of geological time.","title":"Looking south over the cliffs, buttes, and mesas of the dead horse point region to the Colorado river, almost hidden in its canyon 2000 feet below","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["544745","545750","545799","544392","545783","545748","545802","545696","545805","545790","544429","545796","545771","552690","545800","545791"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["trail","formation","millennia","riverb","hug","incline","spectacle","unfold","awe","landscape"]}
