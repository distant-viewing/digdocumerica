{"path":"548247.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and peaceful maritime scene, likely taken during the early morning or late afternoon, as evidenced by the low sun shimmering across the water's surface, giving it a sparkling appearance. The image features several boats of varying sizes and types moored on calm waters. To the left, a small boat with a lone individual, possibly engaged in fishing or simply rowing, adds a human element to the natural landscape. \n\nIn the foreground and towards the center, there are larger boats, including one with a tall mast typical of a sailboat, which is docked and not currently sailing. The silhouette of another small motorboat is visible to the right. On the far right, a bird is captured in mid-flight, accentuating the sense of freedom and tranquility that permeates the scene. \n\nThe background shows a landmass that possibly hosts more foliage, indicating a coastal area. The lighting and composition of the photograph, with the vivid contrast between the dark silhouettes of the boats and the brightly lit water, create a dramatic yet calm tableau, inviting contemplation of nature and solitude. The sky is clear, contributing to the brightness and reflective quality of the water.","title":"Pigeon cove lobstermen returning at day's end to rockport harbor","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["542903","550039","542904","542872","547549","543119","547556","543059","542907","543545","547553","544661","549374","545015","552292","547234"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","sai","permeate","silhouette","landmass","freedom","tableau","motorboat","sparkling","host"]}
