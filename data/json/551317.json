{"path":"551317.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a musician playing an electric guitar, captured in a dramatic red lighting that enhances the moody, artistic vibe of the scene. The focus is primarily on the musician and their guitar. The musician, most likely a male, is partially visible; only his hands, the guitar, and a fragment of his face, including his glasses, are in the frame. He appears to be deeply engrossed in playing, which suggests a live performance or a moment of creative focus during a practice session.\n\nThe guitar is a hollow-bodied electric model, distinguished by its visible f-holes and several control knobs. The image shows the musician's fingers on the guitar strings and his other hand on the neck of the guitar, indicating he is either in the midst of playing a note or chord.\n\nThe surroundings are obscured by the low lighting and the narrow depth of field, leaving the background nearly indistinguishable and focusing all attention on the musician and his instrument. The overall composition of the photograph, dominated by shades of red, creates an intimate and intense portrayal of a musician immersed in his art.","title":"Rock band at millstone lodge, a lakeside cocktail-and-dancing lounge at gravois mills","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["553890","558387","554283","553152","556305","556312","556307","551318","551479","558263","558213","553305","556474","548560","554345","556311"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["guitar","musician","playing","knob","play","session","immerse","finger","string","hole"]}
