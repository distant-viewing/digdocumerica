{"path":"545501.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly African American man sitting next to a large, yellow cart with text that reads \"POP'S HOT PEANUT 10Â¢ BAG.\" The man is dressed in a formal dark suit and tie and wears a distinctive silver-crowned cap, which gives him a unique and dignified appearance. He is seated on a metal chair, arms resting gently on his lap, against a city backdrop where partial reflections and indistinct shapes of a busy street can be observed in the windows behind him.\n\nThe expression on the man's face is serious, perhaps reflective, as he looks directly at the camera with a slight frown. The vivid colors, the detailed textures of his attire, and the worn-out look of the peanut cart add to the depth of the setting, suggesting a story of long-held tradition or daily routine.\n\nThe focus and composition of the image lead the viewer's eye from the man to the cart and back, indicating a strong connection between him and his peanut-selling business. The background blurred slightly, making the man and the cart the clear subjects of this portrait, evoking a sense of everyday life and perseverance.","title":"\"Street scene\"","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556149","553090","556133","548426","556137","547313","554845","556147","556285","547179","547330","556483","554857","548218","553176","552103"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["cart","man","tradition","lap","portrait","silver","routine","tie","connection","chair"]}
