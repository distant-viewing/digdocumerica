{"path":"555027.jpg","date":"June 1971","photographer":"","caption":"This is an image showing a detailed view of a rock surface covered with moss and small plants. The rocks appear rugged and uneven, with a mixture of sharp and smooth areas, and are mostly dark-colored with irregular edges. Bright green moss thrives in patches over the surface of the rocks, creating a vibrant contrast with the darker rock colors. Amongst the moss, there are small green plants with visible leaves emerging from the crevices, suggesting a moist, possibly shady environment conducive to such growth.\n\nThe background is out of focus and dark, highlighting the foreground's textures and colors. The lighting in the photograph is quite subdued, emphasizing the moisture in the environment and enhancing the greens and grays of the rocks and vegetation. Overall, the image captures the feel of a damp, natural setting typically found in forested or mountainous areas where moss and small plants would thrive on the mineral-rich rocks.","title":"Moss and seedlings growing in cracks of exposed rock face collecting moisture, absorbing rock nutrients and slowly dissolving rock in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543147","555026","550483","554571","555025","553358","555018","558086","554572","555074","554554","555182","543185","555212","555884","558080"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["moss","rock","plant","crevice","moisture","mixture","growth","gray","surface","leave"]}
