{"path":"545325.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage scene set during dusk or early evening on an urban street. The primary focus is a retro-style taxi, observed from a slightly rear angle. The taxi is an old model car with prominent rounded fenders and a bulky design typical of mid-20th century automobiles. It's painted in a two-tone color scheme, possibly yellow and black, and the words \"WHITE CHERRY TAXI\" are visible on a sign mounted on the roof of the car.\n\nThe environment includes a bustling street lined with various signs, suggesting a commercial area. Noticeable among the signage is what appears to be a road sign for \"US 16,\" hinting at the location being near or on this route. The sky behind the scene presents a mixture of blues and oranges, indicating a time around sunset. Reflections of the taxiâ€™s rear lights and street lights are seen on the surface of another vehicle, likely where the photograph is being shot from, giving a reflective quality to the image.\n\nThere are other cars visible in the distance, enhancing the busy urban atmosphere of the scene. The overall quality of the photo, with its grainy and slightly blurred aesthetic, evokes a sense of nostalgia and timelessness, typical of snapshots taken during earlier decades.","title":"Thunderbird club in background","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["549876","549869","554330","549848","554331","549859","554294","549868","554315","549873","548331","554316","554310","549862","554314","554293"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","street","fender","car","timelessness","sign","nostalgia","quality","automobile","scheme"]}
