{"path":"553988.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an oceanic scene during what appears to be sunset, featuring rich natural and serene elements. In the foreground, two people are visible in the water, sharing an inflatable, bright orange watercraft, likely a boat or raft. They seem to be enjoying a peaceful time on the water, paddling or stabilizing their craft.\n\nThe ocean around them is calm with small ripples, and there are dark rocks and rock formations scattered across the water, creating a rugged yet picturesque shoreline. These formations are partly submerged, and the reflective quality of the water provides a mirror effect that adds depth to the scene.\n\nThe horizon is dominated by a colorful sky at sunset, featuring hues of blue, orange, and gray with cumulus clouds floating above. On the left side of the composition, the silhouette of a hilly landscape is visible, possibly an island or a coastal hill, enhancing the feeling of isolation and escape.\n\nIn the distance, one can also discern additional bluish mountains or ridgelines, suggesting that this location might be part of a larger archipelago or coastal area. The overall ambiance is one of tranquility and natural beauty, emphasized by the gentle colors and the secluded setting. The presence of the people on the raft suggests a moment of leisure and interaction with nature.","title":"Hawaiian children swim at dusk in Manele Bay.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["550296","547550","554002","550303","551960","543143","552333","545238","552293","552310","550771","550292","547556","543411","552123","547230"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["raft","sunset","formation","watercraft","cumulus","escape","craft","rock","mirror","island"]}
