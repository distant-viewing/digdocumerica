{"path":"552658.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This is a vintage color photograph depicting a parade scene, presumably taken during an event called \"Strawberry Days\" in Glenwood Springs in 1973. The photograph highlights two young women, titled as \"Strawberry Days Queens\", named Karen Schiesser and Lori Wichlund. Both are seated atop a parade float.\n\nThe float features a large banner across the front with the text \"Glenwood Springs Presents 1973 Strawberry Days Queens\" in bold, red letters, outlined by stars and accentuated by names “Karen Schiesser” and “Lori Wichlund” on either side. The women are dressed in festive, period-specific attire; one in a white, flower-patterned dress paired with a tiara, and the other in a floral pink dress, also wearing a tiara.\n\nBoth queens are seated on a shiny, reflective surface, possibly a decorated vehicle, that is adorned with green garlands and white floral decorations. They are smiling and appear to be engaging with the parade audience or possibly posing for the photo, creating a cheerful and celebratory atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, some spectators can be observed standing and sitting along the side of a street, which is lined with typical town buildings including a market named \"Foodliner Market\". The surrounding environment has a small-town feel, and mountainous scenery is faintly visible in the distance under a cloudy sky. The setting provides a glimpse into community celebrations and small-town culture in the early 1970s America.","title":"Labor day weekend brings the annual garfield county fair parade","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["557045","552660","552654","552659","552657","557711","556282","557709","557714","556280","557716","557710","557715","556274","552651","546991"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["parade","town","name","float","call","banner","seat","star","audience","celebration"]}
