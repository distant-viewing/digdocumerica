{"path":"551046.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene focused on a man working aboard a vessel. The image is shot from an elevated angle looking directly down on the deck of the boat. The deck is primarily a rusty brown color, with visible patches of black substance that might be oil or grime. On the deck, there are several nautical elements like coiled ropes, two cylindrical objects marked \"80\" and \"90\", and a large painted number “57”.\n\nA man stands on the vessel, amidst these objects, holding onto a heavy-looking rope that extends off the frame. He is wearing a hard hat, and his outfit suggests he is engaged in manual labor, possibly related to docking or mooring the boat. His posture and the tension in the rope suggest he is either pulling it or holding it tight to maintain tension.\n\nThe water surrounding the boat is murky, suggesting perhaps a harbor or industrial area. The edge of another boat or dock is visible at the bottom left corner, marked by a brighter patch of yellow.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a strong sense of maritime activity and seems to capture a moment of physical exertion related to boat operations. The setting indicates a working environment possibly related to shipping, transport, or industrial maritime work.","title":"A Coalburg tug and eight coal barges go downstream through the London locks, one of three lock systems on the Kanawha River.
