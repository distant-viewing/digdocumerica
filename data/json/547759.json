{"path":"547759.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two men standing next to a police car in a daytime outdoor setting. On the left is a man wearing a light green, short-sleeve shirt, glasses, and a tan cowboy hat. He has a badge on his shirt indicating he is a sheriff, and his outfit is completed with a black belt adorned with what appears to be a gun holster and a radio. He is smiling and leaning slightly on the car, pointing towards something out of frame with his right hand.\n\nOn the right is another man, slightly taller, wearing a vertically striped shirt in shades of brown with a tan cowboy hat. He also has a similar belt with a gun holster and is resting his hand on the car, smiling warmly towards the camera.\n\nThe background shows a rural or semi-rural area with sparse trees, some overgrown grass, a few cars in the distance, and a power line. A bridge or some industrial structure can be seen in the further background, contributing to a somewhat industrial rural setting. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be a cloudy day.","title":"Deputy sheriff of Longview and partner.
