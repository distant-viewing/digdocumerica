{"path":"557604.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a great blue heron standing alone. The image has a dark, almost moody quality, with the heron illuminated against a predominantly dark background. The heron is positioned vertically in the center of the frame and is standing on a small pile of rocks by water, as indicated by the visible shimmer of water at the bottom of the image.\n\nThe heron itself is shown in profile, facing to the left of the frame. It has a long, straight neck and a sharp beak, typical of its species. The plumage appears to be textured, showcasing various shades of gray, and the bird is poised in a stately manner, giving it a dignified presence.\n\nDue to the lighting and focus, the surroundings are largely obscured, emphasizing the heron as the central subject. The background is uniformly dark, enhancing the contrast and making the heron stand out prominently. This focused composition draws attention to the bird and its natural environment, creating a powerful, solitary portrayal of wildlife.","title":"Great blue herron in the timberland along the nitinat river on vancouver island, british Columbia.
