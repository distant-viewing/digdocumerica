{"path":"545507.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a background of dense, orange-pink smoke billowing from tall chimneys into the sky, suggesting heavy pollution. The setting is a large industrial complex featuring multiple buildings, including long, low warehouses and tall processing plants typical of a mid-20th century steel mill or a similar heavy industry facility.\n\nIn the foreground, an extensive network of railway tracks converge and diverge, indicating a major transportation hub integral to the operation. Several railcars are parked on the tracks, hinting at the transport of materials either to or from the facility. The presence of a few vehicles alongside the tracks further emphasizes the industrial activity in the area.\n\nThe buildings themselves appear weathered and functional, with no decorative elements, underscoring the purely industrial and utilitarian purpose of the complex. The lighting in the photo, filtered through industrial haze, gives the scene a slightly muted look, except for the striking contrast created by the vividly colored smoke against a paler sky.\n\nOverall, this image documents a moment in industrial history, highlighting the environmental impact and the extensive infrastructure associated with such facilities. The photograph likely aims to draw attention to the environmental concerns posed by industries of this era, marked by visible emissions and massive industrial complexes.","title":"Red-orange smoke pours from steel plant chimneys on edge of railroad.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["549967","550983","546884","545503","557214","551054","545445","545447","557218","550981","546908","547531","550868","557215","550982","550168"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["complex","track","facility","industry","railcar","diverge","smoke","converge","mill","hub"]}
