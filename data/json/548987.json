{"path":"548987.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features three horseback riders on a dusty road. The setting appears to be a rural or possibly desert-like area, given the wide-open space and sparse vegetation visible.\n\nThe first rider, leading the group, is wearing a pale blue shirt, denim jeans, a white cowboy hat, and is riding a brown horse. The rider's posture is relaxed, and he is facing forward as he rides down the center of the road.\n\nBehind this rider, slightly to his right, are two more riders side by side. The rider on the left wears a darker shirt, possibly denim or another dark material, with tan pants and a darker cowboy hat, riding a dark horse. The rider on the right is in a white shirt, light-colored jeans, and also sporting a cowboy hat, astride another dark horse. All horses are equipped with Western-style tack, including saddles and bridles.\n\nThe road itself is a dirt path, kicking up dust around the horses as they move. The background is somewhat obscured by the dust, but it appears flat and vast, contributing to a sense of openness and wilderness. There is a clear sky above, which enhances the brightness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene moment of traditional Western riding and evokes a strong sense of freedom and exploration.","title":"Cowboys ride ahead of cattle they are herding along imperial county highway near el centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548838","553103","553102","554690","543366","557781","544309","543841","553116","553109","544362","557992","548830","553113","557047","548828"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["rider","horse","ride","cowboy","denim","dust","hat","riding","bridle","jean"]}
