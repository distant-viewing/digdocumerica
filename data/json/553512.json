{"path":"553512.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant outdoor scene taking place in a grassy urban park. The focus is on a group of children engaged in a playful activity. In the foreground, one child with blond hair and a striped tank top raises their hands in the air, possibly reaching or preparing to catch a ball. Nearby, another child in a dark outfit runs towards the left edge of the frame.\n\nThe center and background of the image show several more children in action; some are running and one appears to be throwing a ball. The kids are dressed in casual attire suitable for play, including T-shirts and pants or shorts.\n\nThe park itself is surrounded by a chain-link fence and beyond this boundary, one can see a multi-storied residential backdrop that includes both modern and older architectural styles. Tall buildings, possibly apartment blocks, dominate the skyline and mix with greeneries from trees, adding a contrast between natural and urban elements.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment filled with youthful energy and the simple joy of playing outdoors, framed against a city environment.","title":"Playing football at Mulky Square Park, a city facility","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["551768","556287","552755","555931","557410","551769","549318","547201","551721","556136","553096","555901","555946","552024","546453","554072"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","ball","kid","play","run","throw","apartment","joy","t","chain"]}
