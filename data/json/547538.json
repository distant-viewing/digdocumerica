{"path":"547538.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural rural landscape featuring a trail or pathway that cuts through a lush, green meadow. The meadow is filled with tall grass that shows different shades of green. The trail appears less grassy, almost like a beaten path, and it extends from the foreground deep into the background of the composition.\n\nSurrounding the meadow area are clusters of trees, many of which are tall and fully leafed, suggesting that the photo might have been taken during the late spring or summer season. This is supported by the vibrancy and density of the greenery in the scene. The trees vary in type, presenting a mix of foliage density and shades, and in some small gaps between the trees, a bright blue sky is visible. The sky appears clear, contributing to the overall serene and tranquil vibe of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph draws the viewerâ€™s eye along the path which leads deeper into the scene, inviting one to wonder about what lies beyond the visible part of the trail. There is a peaceful, untouched, and natural quality to the scenery, with no visible human or artificial elements. The color tones are rich, creating a vivid and immersive experience of a simple yet captivating natural environment.","title":"Abandoned farm in South Kingstown","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["556990","557099","549236","554982","551370","549139","545588","549218","557087","555215","557782","557191","544439","547536","543581","553464"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["meadow","trail","density","path","gap","vibrancy","shade","experience","vibe","scenery"]}
