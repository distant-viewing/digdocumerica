{"path":"554501.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment in a forest setting, where three hikers are seen trekking near a small, sparkling waterfall. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the lush greenery and the patterning of sunlight through the leaves.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on a brightly colored red and yellow backpack, likely placed on a large rock. Behind this, one of the hikers, wearing green attire and a red backpack, has paused on another boulder, gazing possibly at the pathway or adjusting his stance. He sports a beard and appears to be in casual hiking gear, suitable for the rugged terrain.\n\nTo the right, another hiker is partially visible. This person is wearing a hat and appears to be moving, possibly navigating through the rocky stream.\n\nThe waterfall itself cascades down a rocky face surrounded by birch trees, creating a delightful backdrop. These white-barked trees stand stark against the darker hues of surrounding foliage, enhancing the natural beauty of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph suggests a journey through a tranquil, yet invigorating natural landscape, likely providing the hikers with a refreshing and picturesque experience in the wilderness.","title":"Backpackers cross a bridge near the falls of macintyre brook on the trail up algonquin mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554558","553397","554663","554705","554502","554509","553413","545512","543388","550979","544305","554408","554513","545878","558087","543331"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["hiker","backpack","waterfall","birch","cascade","hiking","sparkling","pause","stance","beard"]}
