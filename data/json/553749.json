{"path":"553749.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene centered around a large, prominently displayed warning sign. The sign is white with bold, black lettering and reads, \"WARNING DO NOT ANCHOR SEWER LINE CHANNEL.\" The sign is mounted on a sturdy structure with orange and white barriers at each end, likely for enhanced visibility.\n\nThe sign stands on a stony shoreline at the edge of a body of water that reflects the bright daylight. Beyond the shoreline and the sign, the background is dominated by dense, lush green vegetation, suggesting a natural or semi-wild environment. In the distance, several utility poles are visible, which along with the sign itself, indicate human activity and management in the area.\n\nThe overall tone of the scene is somewhat industrial due to the presence of the sewer line warning and man-made objects, yet it has elements of natural beauty with the clear water and abundant greenery. The photograph likely serves a functional purpose to alert nearby boaters of the underwater hazard, merging safety with environmental management.","title":"Raw sewage is discharged into the ocean three miles from Waikiki Beach.
