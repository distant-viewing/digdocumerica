{"path":"544349.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph presents a vivid scene, likely captured in a Western or rural setting. In the foreground, an elderly man with deeply creased skin is sitting in the passenger seat of a black pickup truck. He is wearing a dark brown wide-brimmed cowboy hat and a black jacket. The expression on his face is serious, and he appears to be looking slightly off to the side.\n\nIn the background, to the right of the man in the foreground and slightly out of focus, stands another man facing away from the camera. This man is dressed in a light pink long-sleeve shirt and a lighter brown cowboy hat. He appears to be either standing by the truck or possibly engaging in some activity near another object thatâ€™s not entirely visible in the frame.\n\nThe truck's design is utilitarian, typical of models used in farm or ranch work, with visible features like a sturdy white bumper and rugged tires emphasizing its functionality.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that feels distinctly atmospheric, suggestive of rural life and ranching, highlighted by the attire of the individuals and the style of the vehicle. The lighting conditions suggest late afternoon or early evening, casting deep tones and shadows across the scene, augmenting the contemplative mood conveyed by the older man's expression.","title":"Navajo goes to town on Saturday morning","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["546092","556547","546176","552561","553091","549042","547679","552087","554860","556595","554025","543849","557370","543478","549058","549120"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["cowboy","truck","man","ranching","ranch","bumper","hat","pickup","expression","skin"]}
