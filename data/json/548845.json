{"path":"548845.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a roughly circular wooden sign mounted on a vertical post, set in a barren, plowed field. The sign is hand-painted with black lettering, though noticeably weather-worn and slightly damaged, particularly around its edges. The text on the sign is written somewhat haphazardly, with words packed tightly together. It reads: \"NO TRESPES PRIVET PROPERTY NO FISHING ALLOWD KEEP OUT.\" It appears there are some letter omissions and misspellings in the message, indicating \"No Trespassing, Private Property, No Fishing Allowed, Keep Out.\"\n\nThe sign is linked to a barbed-wire fence that extends across the photograph in front of the sign, suggesting it serves as a boundary marker for the property. The field behind the sign looks vast and barren without any visible vegetation, just rough, dry soil, indicating it might be fallow or recently harvested. The sky in the background is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny, cloudless day. No buildings or other structures are visible in the distance, just open land, which emphasizes the isolated and rural setting of the scene.","title":"Sign along the Colorado river--misspelled but clear","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548836","548846","557441","545159","554103","549129","547910","548248","544245","552076","555582","555628","557474","547123","544845","544220"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["property","sign","fishing","barbed","plow","harvest","marker","field","write","lettering"]}
