{"path":"555220.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of a dense forest intertwined with a multi-tiered waterfall. Two main cascades are visible: the upper fall splits into two streams that merge into a pool, then overflow into a more robust singular fall in the foreground, creating a white, frothy splash at the base. The vibrant green foliage densely envelops the entire area, with various shades from dark to fresh bright greens, suggesting the photo was taken either in late spring or during summer.\n\nA prominent fallen log is horizontally oriented in the foreground, bridging across the lower part of the frame and providing a stark contrast in texture to the smooth water and soft greenery. The log is large, weathered, and displays signs of age and mossy growth, blending it into the natural surroundings despite its initially disruptive appearance.\n\nThe environment appears quite wild and is likely in a remote location, given the absence of human structures or intervention visible in the image. The lighting seems natural and offers a vivid illumination of the waterfall while casting subtle shadows throughout the foliage, enhancing the depth and richness of the woodland. The overall mood is peaceful yet dynamic, emphasizing the natural beauty and power of the waterfall within its forest sanctuary.","title":"Spoon Falls in Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554408","545878","558087","555073","543578","557820","554409","555210","550979","542594","545839","546180","554113","544456","545874","550843"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","fall","log","mossy","cascade","richness","dark","forest","foliage","intervention"]}
