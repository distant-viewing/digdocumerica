{"path":"555341.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a Caucasian man in a semi-outdoor environment, evidently engaged in the maintenance or installation of solar panels. He has long, dark brown hair and a mustache, and wears a light gray button-down shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows.\n\nThe man appears focused on his task, holding two components of a solar panel system â€” one in each hand, seemingly on the verge of connecting them. The solar panel itself is large and tilted, consisting of numerous horizontal stripes that imply a ribbed texture, possibly for heat absorption or deflection.\n\nThe background includes a glimpse of a blue swimming pool, suggesting the setting is a residential area. Additionally, there is a rustic-looking fence and sparse vegetation visible behind him, contributing to a suburban or semi-rural vibe. An overall sunny and clear day enhances the scene, emphasizing the relevance and utility of solar power in such an environment.","title":"Picture shows the cusp-shaped solar heating panel used for heating a swimming pool at a home near Tucson, Arizona.
