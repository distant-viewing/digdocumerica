{"path":"544986.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor culinary event, likely by a coastal or lakeside area given the presence of water and a boat in the background. The setting is characterized by sandy ground, scattered grass, and trees which provide a natural canopy. In the foreground, a man dressed in a white chef's uniform, including a white apron and pants, is seen tending to a long grill filled with what appears to be seafood on skewers. There's a pronounced presence of smoke or steam rising from the grill, suggesting the food is being actively cooked.\n\nTo his left, another man in similar attire is busy presumably preparing or monitoring additional food items on the grill. Meanwhile, several other individuals can be seen in the background. Some are clustered near a table, possibly engaged in either food preparation or casual interaction. \n\nOne can also observe trees in the area and a boat floating in the water behind them, providing a serene backdrop to the communal activities taking place. Overall, the setting suggests a relaxed, outdoor social gathering focused around food preparation.","title":"Salmon bake, fund-raising affair for the community of Browns Point.
