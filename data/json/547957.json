{"path":"547957.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat cluttered and run-down outdoor scene, likely a backyard or a similar informal setting. In the foreground, there is a variety of scattered objects and debris. This includes wooden planks, metal barrels, a small overturned table, and some building materials scattered haphazardly over a dirt ground. There's also an old, rusty white boat with the registration number \"NY372AS\" turned on its side, suggesting disuse or abandonment.\n\nIn the center, there is a large shed or small building clad in distressed, grey siding with a steep red roof. This structure has a door and a window visible on its side, both appearing worn. There are two propane tanks placed upright next to the building, hinting at some form of utility use or storage.\n\nThe background beyond the shed shows more residential areas with homes and another shed in the distance, indicating that this scene is within a populated area. There are overhead electrical wires and poles throughout, adding to the cluttered and somewhat neglected feel of the scene.\n\nThere is also a visible contrast in care and upkeep between the foreground area and the houses in the further background, which appear more maintained. The photograph captures a moment of static disarray and aging infrastructure, likely in an urban or semi-urban environment.","title":"This house on hunter's point has no sewage facilities adjacent to the john f.
