{"path":"555573.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a rugged and barren landscape characterized by steep, layered rock formations under a clear blue sky. The terrain is primarily composed of rocky hills with varying hues of browns and beiges, indicative of sedimentary rock layers. Notably, there is a solitary, thin tree inclined at an angle towards the left side of the frame, anchored seemingly precariously on a slope.\n\nThe vegetation is sparse, limited to the lone tree and possibly some low shrubs near the base of the hills, which are not clearly visible due to distance. The foreground is somewhat shadowy compared to the brightly lit background, highlighting the texture and stratification of the rocks. No human activity or any other signs of life are visible, emphasizing the desolate and natural environment. The overall composition captures a sense of isolation and the stark beauty of geologically rich, arid terrains.","title":"Lone tree struggles for life among buttes created by coal company strip mining off route #100","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["544401","555642","544921","545804","545754","545696","544429","545800","543635","552685","545789","544027","543838","545724","544926","550395"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","stratification","incline","limit","layer","beige","anchor","hill","terrain","compare"]}
