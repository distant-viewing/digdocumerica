{"path":"556972.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The image presents an aerial photograph of a rural landscape, most likely captured from an aircraft or a drone. The photograph showcases a densely wooded area with variegated shades of green, interspersed with patches of open land.\n\nThe central part of the image depicts a small community. There is a collection of buildings that appear to be houses, surrounded by a network of roads. Some of the houses have large yards. The roads are mainly curved, following the natural contours of the terrain, and are bordered by trees which add a sense of seclusion to the area.\n\nIn the bottom left of the image, there's an open field possibly used for agriculture, as it is cleared of any trees and shows different coloration compared to the surrounding forest, possibly indicating cultivated land.\n\nThe background of the image offers a larger view of the expansive forest and multiple small lakes or bays visible near the horizon, suggesting that this area is near a water body. The water body is large, reflective, and parts of other land masses can be seen in the distance across the water.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rich natural setting, highlighted by patches of civilization, offers a serene and verdant landscape viewed from above, invoking a sense of calm and isolation.","title":"Aerial view of the Central Valley quadrangle which is bounded by Tracyton, Illahee, Brownsville and Silverdale.
