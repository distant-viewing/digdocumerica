{"path":"555803.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive ocean scene under a clear, broad sky. The horizon bisects the image almost perfectly in the middle, creating an almost symmetric division between the bluish hues of the sea and the lighter blue of the sky. The sea itself has a gradient of colors, ranging from dark blue at the bottom, where the water appears deeper, gradually merging into a turquoise near the center of the image. Notably, this region shows a slight disturbance or perhaps a different water current or substance mixing into the ocean, as indicated by the differing color and texture compared to the surrounding water. The surface of the water sparkles under the sunlight, suggesting the time of day might be around midday or early afternoon. There are no visible landmarks, boats, or people; the view is unobstructed and purely natural, emphasizing the vastness and serene beauty of the oceanic landscape.","title":"Industrial acid wastes dumped 15 miles offshore in the New York bight.  They make up 90 per cent of all industrial wastes dumped into the bight.  More than three million cubic yards of acid wastes were dumped in the bight during 1974.
