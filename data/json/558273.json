{"path":"558273.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Abrams, Nancy","caption":"This photograph captures a historical reenactment scene, likely from the period of the American Civil War. The primary focus of the image is a young man in the foreground, dressed in a period-appropriate military uniform, which includes a dark coat with buttons, decorative accents, and a traditional military hat. He holds a long cleaning rod or rammer, typically used for artillery.\n\nTo his right stands a cannon positioned on a wooden carriage with large wheels, denoting it as a field artillery piece used in the 19th century. The cannon is pointing slightly upward, positioned to simulate readiness for firing.\n\nBehind the young man and the cannon, several other reenactors can be seen. One notably carries a red flag, suggesting his role as a standard-bearer, which is crucial in battlefield communications and unit identification during that era. Other figures in similar military attire are scattered, some standing while others appear to be operating or preparing another piece of artillery in the background.\n\nThe setting is an open field with a clear sky, illuminated by bright sunlight that casts contrasting shadows. In the distant background, modern elements such as parked cars are visible, juxtaposing the historical reenactment with the present day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is designed to evoke the ambience and gravity of a historical military setup while blending elements of educational or commemorative reenactment with subtle reminders of the contemporary setting.","title":"Members of the New Ulm battery with equipment which is a part of the heritage of New Ulm, Minnesota.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558274","558277","558275","558276","558272","549698","549705","549700","549701","549699","549703","549735","558271","549697","549729","546814"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["reenactment","period","gravity","identification","cleaning","reminder","carriage","piece","readiness","communication"]}
