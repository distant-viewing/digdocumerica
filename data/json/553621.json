{"path":"553621.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, the scene is captured under low light conditions with a mystical, almost ghostly ambiance. The primary focal point is a silhouette of a large vehicle, possibly an old steam train or machinery, emitting a massive cloud of steam or smoke. Partially obscured by the smoke, there appear to be at least one or two individuals situated on top of or near the machinery, possibly tending to its operation.\n\nThe background is quite dark and shadowy, enhancing the mysterious effect of the image. Dark tree silhouettes can be made out, looming in the backdrop, which suggests that this activity is taking place in an outdoor environment, likely amidst a wooded or rural area.\n\nThe combination of steam, darkness, and the silhouettes contributes to a dramatic and moody atmosphere. The details of the machine and the people are not clear due to the backlit setting and the dense smoke, leaving much to the imagination about their specific actions or expressions. The overall composition draws the viewer's attention to interpret the interaction between man, machine, and nature in this evocative setting.","title":"In august, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora, California salvage operations on acreage owned by the pickering lumber company of standard, California., began promptly.  \"caterpillars\" work in dust and soot hauling logs to landing area where they will be loaded onto trucks","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553623","557956","557381","557375","551030","552188","542925","545541","542999","555959","557214","550174","543007","542544","553023","545446"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","silhouette","smoke","machine","interpret","ten","machinery","backlit","loom","darkness"]}
