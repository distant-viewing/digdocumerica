{"path":"553372.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a waterfall cascading over a man-made dam. The dam, having a straight top, stretches across the frame, and the water overflows along the entire width of the dam, creating a consistent, smooth curtain of water. Below the dam, the water churns into a foamy, vigorous whitewater indicating strong currents and turbulence. The river appears wide and full, and the water has a muddy brown color, suggesting it might be carrying a significant amount of sediment.\n\nThe surroundings visible in the upper parts of the image show urban infrastructure, including a concrete structure parallel to the dam and a few buildings partially obscured by distance and foliage. A tree branch intrudes into the frame from the bottom left corner, adding a natural element to the otherwise industrial scene. \n\nThe photograph portrays a sense of powerful, uncontrolled natural force being harnessed by human engineering.","title":"Water pollution control facilities will be built at Nashua on the Nashua River.
