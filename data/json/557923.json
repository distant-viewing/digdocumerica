{"path":"557923.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a woman inside a car, viewed from the perspective of the passenger seat. She is seated in the driver's seat and appears to be in the process of turning the ignition key with her right hand. The interior of the car looks vintage, characterized by a large, thin, black steering wheel, and simplistic dashboard controls.\n\nThe woman, showing only her profile, has long, light-colored hair and appears to be focused on starting the car. She wears a black jacket with white details resembling a checkered pattern or part of a shirt collar.\n\nOutside the car, through the windshield, you can see a rainy day setting, and the exterior environment includes a building with a sign reading \"Goodyear\" and another sign that says \"Kendall\". There is a classic car parked in the background, adding to the retro feel of the scene. The overall ambiance suggests a mundane yet intimate moment, possibly from a bygone era.","title":"After her car failed the emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, this young woman heads for a service station and engine adjustment.  All light duty spark ignition powered motor vehicles must pass carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions tests annually as well as a safety check that has been in effect since 1940.  All other type vehicles registered in the city must undergo only the safety check.
