{"path":"553522.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a dimly lit room with a somber atmosphere. In the foreground, an older style metal bed frames the scene, with indistinct bedding that appears to be disheveled and possibly worn. On the bed lies a person, facing away from the camera, mostly obscured by blankets. The person is dressed in dark clothing and seems to be either resting or sleeping.\n\nTo the right of the bed, there is a small bedside table or stand holding various indistinct items, including what looks like an open book, a bottle, and other small personal objects, contributing to the impression of a lived-in space.\n\nThe window, directly behind the bed, is framed with a light-colored curtain pulled back into a draped valance, decorated with a floral pattern and perhaps slightly faded. The window reveals a view obscured by condensation or dirt, indicating either a cold or neglected environment outside.\n\nOverall, the room gives an impression of simplicity and possibly neglect, illuminated by soft, natural light that suggest a quiet, introspective atmosphere. The sceneâ€™s rustic and somewhat disordered elements evoke feelings of solitude and tranquility.","title":"Weekends for this mulky square biscuit company worker and father of nine mean beer and sleep.
