{"path":"545027.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a striking and dramatic pose of a large, stylized model of a shark. The shark is designed with exaggerated features, primarily its wide open mouth displaying an array of sharp, pointed teeth, and eyes set high and towards the sides of its head, giving it a menacing appearance.\n\nThe shark is presented in an upright position, as if emerging vertically out of water, with the lower part vaguely mimicking the animalâ€™s body transitioning smoothly into a simple, untextured base, possibly intended for stability. The skin of the shark is painted dark on the back and fades into a lighter shade, probably gray or white, on the belly, capturing the typical coloration of many real-life shark species.\n\nThe background consists of a dimly lit setting with lush green trees partially visible in soft focus, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken either during dusk or in a shaded area with limited sunlight. The natural backdrop contrasts with the artificial appearance of the shark model, enhancing the focus on it as the central element of the photograph.\n\nThis creative representation can evoke different emotional responses, possibly aimed at either instilling a sense of thrill or fear, or it might be part of a themed park or exhibition aimed at education about marine life. The atmosphere created by the lighting and the forested background adds to the mystique and allure of the image.","title":"\"Oregon's rain forest\" park","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["548074","548073","545169","548713","543901","555556","544546","544528","548717","551597","543189","548712","548711","545165","557496","543046"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["aim","mystique","model","tooth","allure","education","thrill","mimic","stability","response"]}
