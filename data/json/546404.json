{"path":"546404.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a water-filled irrigation ditch in a rural agricultural setting. The irrigation ditch is curving and extends from the foreground deep into the middle of the image, surrounded on both sides by raised earth that appears freshly dug or tilled. The water reflects the sunlight, creating a slightly shimmering surface.\n\nIn the background, agricultural fields can be seen on either side of the ditch, suggesting the presence of various types of crops. Beyond the fields, there are trees and rolling hills under a partly cloudy sky.\n\nAdditionally, notable in the far background is a plume of dark smoke that rises above the horizon, possibly suggesting activity like burning or industrial work related to or apart from the agricultural use of the land. This element adds a dynamic aspect to the scene, hinting at human activity even though no individuals are visible in the photograph. The overall composition conveys a sense of rural land management and the harnessing of water resources for farming purposes.","title":"Sugar refinery and drainage ditch","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553652","553083","553432","548875","548869","543650","548877","549178","548950","555555","546398","548991","543777","544678","549064","548901"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["ditch","irrigation","burning","till","land","dig","field","resource","farming","crop"]}
