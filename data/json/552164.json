{"path":"552164.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents an industrial scene captured during twilight. The composition features two prominent smokestacks releasing plumes of smoke into the deep blue evening sky, which is artfully brushed with streaks of clouds. The background reveals subtle hints of an orange and pink sunset near the horizon, offering a stark contrast to the darker foreground.\n\nForeground elements include various industrial buildings and structures, among which a water tower is distinctly visible, standing next to one of the smokestacks. Several lights illuminate parts of the buildings, glowing warmly in the dim light and further emphasizing the ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of quiet yet continuous industrial life, underlined by the silhouettes of the structures against the fading light of the sky, creating a blend of natural beauty and human industrial effort. This scene encapsulates a moment of peaceful coexistence between nature's grandeur and human industrial presence, all captured under the shroud of dusk.","title":"Smoke and steam from lumber and pulp mill stacks","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551140","544684","547200","546384","545433","545425","557381","545414","552165","551030","550819","544173","545438","544708","552156","547090"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["smokestack","streak","coexistence","grandeur","twilight","plume","effort","light","sunset","dusk"]}
