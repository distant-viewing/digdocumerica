{"path":"545154.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene at a coastal tourist area, filled with a variety of signs advertising different businesses and services. The scene is densely packed with signage, creating a busy, colorful tableau typical of a bustling waterfront district catering to both tourists and locals.\n\nMost prominently, the signs advertise a range of attractions and services including \"SEA TROLLERS Sport Fishing,\" \"SALMON FISHING,\" and \"SEAFOOD LUNCH & DINNER\" at \"CAPTAIN JIM'S GALLEY.\" There are also signs for a \"Dairy Queen,\" the \"Karmelkorn Shop\" offering \"SALT WATER TAFFY HOT POP CORN,\" and another mentioning \"GIFTS FILMS SOUVENIRS.\" Other notable mentions are a banner for \"Sea View,\" \"COAST GUARD,\" and a ticket office. The \"Pepsi\" logo is also visible on one of the signs, reinforcing the mid-20th-century Americana vibe.\n\nIn addition to the commercial establishments, there are people visible in the scene. A few individuals are walking along the sidewalk, engaged in their activities, possibly tourists exploring the area. There's also a man in the foreground, dressed in a light brown jacket and dark hat, facing away from the camera.\n\nThe architecture is simple and utilitarian, typical of coastal shops designed more for function than form, with wood siding and straightforward designs. The weather appears overcast, suggesting a cool or foggy day, which adds a slightly muted tone to the colors in the image.\n\nOverhead wires run along the street, contributing to the slightly cluttered look typical of such tourist areas, where practicality often overrides aesthetics. The photograph offers a nostalgic glimpse into the character and atmosphere of past seaside leisure destinations, highlighting popular culture and leisure activities of the time.","title":"'Visual pollution'","placename":"Depoe Bay (Or.)","location":"Depoe Bay, Oregon","nn1":["551495","551494","554550","546770","549113","550127","551323","549017","542812","545155","553017","550114","545618","554185","552414","549008"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["tourist","sign","service","mention","practicality","corn","leisure","local","ticket","pop"]}
