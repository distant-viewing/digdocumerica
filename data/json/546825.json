{"path":"546825.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features an agricultural scene focused on irrigation equipment. Prominently, the image captures water being sprayed from a series of large sprinkler systems. The sprinklers are attached to a central pivot, stretching across the frame, which allows the nozzles to systematically water a vast field. The foreground shows a multitude of water droplets captured in mid-air, creating a dynamic and somewhat shimmering effect against the sunlight.\n\nThe water jets form an arc that glistens under a clear blue sky, suggested by the intense light and minimal clouds visible at the top of the image. The field, although not in sharp detail because it is overshadowed by the spray of water, appears to be densely sown with crops.\n\nThe background includes distant landscape features that are slightly obscured by the haze of water, but it indicates a flat and open rural setting, typical of large-scale farming operations. The overall composition of the photograph, with the emphasis on the equipment and the spraying water, highlights the technology and methods used in modern agriculture to irrigate crops efficiently.","title":"Longshoreman unloading cargo at Dundalk Marine Terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548953","546949","543650","548875","548877","553432","548950","548991","548869","554014","549178","543777","546829","548901","553652","546404"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["spray","crop","water","nozzle","overshadow","arc","irrigation","method","jet","multitude"]}
