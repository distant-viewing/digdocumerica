{"path":"545262.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a densely wooded area with a winding dirt road. In the foreground, several fallen tree branches and logs are scattered chaotically on the ground. These logs vary in size and are partially covered with moss, suggesting they have been there for some time.\n\nTowering pine trees dominate the frame, densely packed and stretching upward into the sky. Their bark is rough and dark, typical of coniferous trees. Between the trees, the background reveals more of the forest and a glimpse of the road curving around the wooded landscape, potentially following the natural contour of the terrain.\n\nThe light filtering through the trees suggests it may be late afternoon, with the sun casting shadows and spots of light that illuminate parts of the road and forest floor. The environment looks natural and undisturbed aside from the road, indicating this might be a remote or protected area, possibly used for hiking or logging access. The overall mood evoked by the image is one of peacefulness and natural beauty, tinged with a sense of wilderness and isolation.","title":"Logging road on orcas island","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544860","555127","556976","556933","542753","550567","549226","555116","549234","550791","555147","542745","545488","543487","554976","554958"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["log","road","tree","tinge","hiking","forest","peacefulness","protect","bark","moss"]}
