{"path":"546610.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime scene on a busy, rain-soaked street where multiple lanes of traffic are congested with cars. The cars, lit by their headlights, form luminous lines along the street, with their brake lights glowing red. Reflections on the wet asphalt add a glossy, shimmering effect to the surface, enhancing the overall atmosphere created by the illuminated lights. The angle of the shot is elevated, possibly taken from a bridge or a higher building, looking down at an angle onto the traffic. The image has a slightly blurry and grainy quality, conveying a sense of movement and the bustle of city life at night. There are no people visible outside of the cars, focusing solely on the movement of traffic and the play of light on the wet road. The overall ambiance is one of urban congestion and the glow of city lights under wet conditions.","title":"23rd street, nw - typical homebound traffic jam","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546739","546644","546591","546586","553894","547051","546747","555431","546629","556681","546744","555381","553893","555425","553681","546606"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","glow","angle","from","congest","soak","congestion","bustle","nighttime","movement"]}
