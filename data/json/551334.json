{"path":"551334.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful moment shared between two older women who are embracing each other warmly. The woman on the right, who is more prominently visible, is wearing glasses and has short, curled hair. She is laughing or speaking with evident happiness, her eyes creased in a smile. She is dressed in lighter-colored attire and has an ID badge clipped to her top.\n\nThe other woman, whose back is to us, has her face partially visible; she is turned towards the first woman and has a gentle smile. She similarly has curled hair, wears earrings, and is dressed in a striped shirt.\n\nThe background is out of focus and gently illuminated, primarily in shades of blue, which gives the photograph a soft and intimate atmosphere. The focus and depth of field emphasize the emotional connection between the two women, suggesting a touching and sincere moment of reunion or deep conversation. The overall composition, enhanced by the emotional facial expressions and warm hug, conveys a scene of affection, friendship, and shared joy.","title":"Old friends embrace at Linn Creek's second reunion. Linn Creek prospered until the late 1920s when the Bagnell Dam was begun. The town was evacuated, buildings razed, and sidewalks inundated. The inhabitants set up two new communities, the smaller at New Linn Creek, the larger at Camdenton. The first reunion of old Linn towns-people was held four years ago in the New Linn Creek schoolhouse in June, 1973, they met again in the same place.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["556176","552962","551436","547379","556299","552931","547358","543863","556593","553178","553171","553543","553536","554907","556092","553484"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Groups Of People"],"terms":["woman","smile","friendship","affection","happiness","earring","hair","badge","joy","connection"]}
