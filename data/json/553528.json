{"path":"553528.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a domestic scene featuring two young children in what appears to be a living room. On the right side of the image, a child with blond hair is asleep on a long couch, which is covered with a velvety beige-brown blanket. The child is wearing a multicolored striped shirt and white shorts. Their right arm is draped over their head, and they are barefoot, suggesting a relaxed or impromptu nap.\n\nOn the left side of the image, another child, also with blond hair, is seated on a black-and-white checkered floor. This child is wearing a striped shirt and white pants, and appears to be engaged in playing, with a small orange bowl and what might be a toy between their legs. The child's footwear features prominently, with one shiny black shoe visible.\n\nThe room's ambiance is highlighted by the checkered floor pattern which contrasts with the solid colors of the couch and the bedding. The background is relatively dark compared to the brightly lit area near the window, suggesting natural light coming in from outside. The overall scene gives an impression of quiet and everyday domestic life, with elements like toys and a disarrayed room indicating the presence and activity of children.","title":"Young Kevin Watkins goes to sleep while his nephew (his second brother's son) eats a bowl of cereal on the living room floor.
