{"path":"544884.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents an up-close view of a dense, lush grassland environment focusing predominantly on tufted grasses. The foreground features a large, well-defined cluster of grass with needle-like green blades that radiate from a central point, creating a bushy appearance. The texture of the grass is quite pronounced, with each blade sharply detailed against the softer background.\n\nThe background includes several similar patches of grass, although they are less distinct due to a shallow depth of field which renders them slightly out of focus. This contributes to a sense of depth, emphasizing the main subject in the foreground. The lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light highlighting the tops of the grasses and creating a vibrant green hue that dominates the visual palette.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the natural beauty and simplicity of the grassland, devoid of any visible human or animal intervention, presenting a tranquil and untouched natural scene. The overall effect is a serene depiction of natural flora, suitable for emphasizing themes related to nature, environment, or plant biology.","title":"Colorado--Uncompahgre National Forest","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["549232","557104","557499","551370","552485","557191","549251","545069","553084","547924","552554","557098","557559","555187","557189","552504"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","blade","grassland","biology","needle","intervention","depiction","flora","depth","simplicity"]}
