{"path":"547123.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image portrays a rustic and slightly menacing scene within what appears to be a dense forest area. Central to the image is a fallen tree limb lying horizontally across the foreground. Attached to this limb is a handmade sign with the text \"KEEP OUT! Trespassers will be EATENâ€¦\" crudely scribbled in black marker. This whimsical warning adds a humorous yet foreboding element to the scene.\n\nSurrounding the tree and sign is thick underbrush, including various kinds of small trees and plants, predominantly in shades of green and brown. The forest floor is uneven and covered with moss, fallen leaves, twigs, and other natural debris, which is typical of a woodland ecosystem. The background fades into a blur of similar foliage, with no distinct features visible apart from the dense greenery.\n\nThe color tone of the image, coupled with the forest setting and the hand-drawn sign warning off intruders, creates an intriguing and slightly eerie atmosphere, suggesting the scene is remote and untamed. The photograph may have been taken during the day but the thick canopy of the forest diminishes the light, lending a gloomy feel to the overall scene. No human or animal presence is visible, enhancing a sense of quiet isolation.","title":"Along Lake Michigan. Sign reads: Keep out.
