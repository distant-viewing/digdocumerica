{"path":"555491.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a crowded junkyard filled with a jumble of old and damaged cars, closely packed together in a chaotic arrangement. The cars, primarily from the mid-20th century, show a variety of colors and states of rust and decay. Some prominent design elements noticeable include distinctive tail fins, chrome trim, and rounded body shapes typical of automobile design from the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe cars are stacked in layers and some are tilted at severe angles, suggesting they have been haphazardly placed or have shifted over time. The paint on many cars appears faded, and windows are either broken or entirely missing. No people are visible in the image, focusing all attention on the mechanical relics.\n\nThe setting is entirely occupied by these cars, so no discernible background apart from other cars is visible. The light is natural, possibly overcast, casting soft shadows and muting the colors of the cars' rusted and weathered surfaces. The overall mood evoked by the photograph is one of abandonment and decay, highlighting a graveyard of automotive history.","title":"Stacked autos are crushed and shipped to japan, then return to the united states as toyotas and datsuns to begin the cycle once again","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555492","545365","543166","552739","552999","553004","545340","546268","553005","542590","542656","547476","545303","552738","553006","546249"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","decay","1950","junkyard","fin","mute","tail","chrome","shift","automobile"]}
