{"path":"556414.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up portrait of an adult woman gazing thoughtfully to the side, slightly upward, with her face resting on her hand. She wears large, round glasses that have thick, dark frames, and the reflections in her glasses suggest she is near a window or outdoors. Her hair is styled in a simple, short bob and her bangs neatly trimmed just above her eyebrows.\n\nThe woman has a light, fair complexion and her lips are partially open as if she is deep in thought or about to speak. She is donned in a shirt with a geometric pattern comprising shades of red, white, and navy blue. The fabric has a checkered design with intricate, smaller patterns inside each square, adding a unique textural effect to her appearance.\n\nThe background is quite blurred and neutral in color, emphasizing the subject's facial expression and features. The overall mood conveyed is one of introspection or contemplation, highlighted by the soft natural light and the composition focusing on her reflective expression.","title":"Mrs. Leona Hall, Gallagher, West Virginia, is a secretary in the United Mine Workers of America district headquarters in Charleston.
