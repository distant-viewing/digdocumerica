{"path":"544883.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up of two columbine flowers (Aquilegia sp.), captured against a deeply shadowed, almost black background that serves to highlight the delicate features of the plants. The primary flower, vividly in focus and appearing towards the lower right of the image, exhibits petals that blend from a soft, creamy yellow at their base to a striking pink at the tips. These flowers are distinctive for their backward-extending spurs, a hallmark of the columbine, which in this specimen are colored in a deep rosy pink.\n\nHanging gracefully from slender, arching stems, the flowers possess a fragile and ethereal quality. Several young, unopened buds and a small number of green leaves emerge along these stems, completing the composition. The leaves are thin and somewhat sparse, spaced along the stem in a way that suggests the plant’s delicate nature.\n\nLighting in the image accentuates the translucency of the flower’s petals and spurs, with subtle gradations of color and texture enhanced by the sunlight filtering through or reflecting off the surfaces. This setup not only spotlights the beauty and intricate structure of the columbine flowers but also creates a serene and somewhat contemplative mood, inviting the viewer to appreciate the subtle complexities of natural flora.","title":"Near East Dallas Creek","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["553588","543623","543597","555106","544875","555056","553368","553366","557167","554574","547613","554595","542970","543596","557618","554840"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stem","petal","pink","specimen","spotlight","possess","gradation","bud","appreciate"]}
