{"path":"543129.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural setting under what appears to be early morning or late evening light. Dominating the scene is a vibrant, double rainbow arching across an overcast sky. The rainbows provide a significant contrast to the muted colors of the landscape.\n\nThe foreground features rough, scrubby terrain with small bushes and patches of grass typical of a semi-arid environment. There is an unpaved road or perhaps a dry riverbed meandering through the terrain. Partially visible in the mid-ground is a rustic wooden fence that stretches horizontally across the image, emphasizing the rural character of the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a small structure that resembles a traditional wooden barn or shed with a slanted roof, contributing to the agricultural feel of the environment. Nearby, a series of poles—possibly for telegraph or electricity—line the road, adding a touch of human presence and development.\n\nThe atmosphere is quiet and expansive, suggesting a remote location. The overall composition, with its natural and man-made elements, paints a picture of tranquility and the beauty of rural landscapes under spectacular atmospheric conditions.","title":"Rainbow above Mono Lake.
