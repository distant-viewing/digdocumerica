{"path":"557806.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph shows a street scene with a European-style architectural influence. The main focus is on two buildings in the frame, likely shops or cafes, each adorned with charming and decorative details. These buildings feature white walls and red-brown trim, with distinct arched entries and wooden balconies. The balconies are decorated with cascading flower plants, adding to the quaint and picturesque appearance.\n\nVisible in front of the buildings are three parked cars of various models from the 1970s or 1980s, suggesting the photo might be from that era. The cars have a typical American style, consisting of two larger sedans and a smaller car, reflecting the automotive design of the time.\n\nOn the rightmost building, a sign reads “German Import” and another beneath it says \"Willkommen,\" which is German for \"welcome,\" indicating that the store might specialize in German products or is promoting a welcoming environment to German speakers. There’s at least one person visible walking past the shopfront, providing a sense of scale and everyday life activity.\n\nThe setting has a festive feel, possibly during a holiday season, suggested by the additional floral and garland decorations. There's a lamp post in front of the left building adorned with a hanging flower basket, contributing to the overall quaint small-town European vibe of the scene.","title":"The mountaineer dress shop, a retail outlet for clothes manufactured by the local Orbit Manufacturing Company, left, and the House of Tyrol, specializing in alpine and Bavarian imports, are part of the Main Street shopping center in Helen.
