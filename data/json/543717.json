{"path":"543717.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking industrial mountain landscape. In the foreground, there is a deep blue lake surrounded by rocky terrain and dotted with some sparse vegetation. A few small trees with reddish foliage suggest a change in seasons, likely autumn. The reflection of the surrounding elements can be seen in the calm water of the lake.\n\nThe background is dominated by a mountainous area with visible patches of snow, showing that it might be at a high altitude. On the slopes, there appears to ongoing industrial activity. There are constructed elements such as large buildings or structures, possibly related to mining or manufacturing, considering the visible tailings and industrial equipment.\n\nTo the right of the lake, a paved road curves around its edge, leading towards the industrial site. The road appears to be bordered by piles of white material, potentially snow or industrial byproducts, adding to the rugged terrain.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, casting a slightly moody tone over the landscape, and the overall scene captures a blend of natural beauty with the harsh realities of industrial operations.","title":"Colorado fuel and iron company feldspar mine on monarch pass.
