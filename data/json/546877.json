{"path":"546877.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling marina densely populated with a variety of boats, primarily sailboats with a few motorboats interspersed, anchored tightly next to one another. The scene captures a cloudy day, with a calm, glassy water surface reflecting elements of the vessels and masts. \n\nThe background shows a green tree-lined shore with buildings nestled between the foliage. These buildings appear residential in style, with visible features like roofs, windows, and walls painted in different colors. To the right-hand side of the photo, there's a continuation of these buildings, perhaps suggesting a small coastal town or community adjacent to the marina.\n\nThe multitude of masts rises vertically, creating a forest of lines and geometrical patterns against the sky. The names and some details of the boats are visible, such as \"PEREGRINE\", \"NORDIC\", and \"PIPE DREAM\". The boats are of various sizes and designs, indicative of their use for both recreational and possibly functional purposes.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of organized congestion and recreational maritime activity, typical of a marina setting in a coastal area. The overcast skies add a muted, serene atmosphere to the bustling marine scene.","title":"Yacht basin crowded with sail and power boats","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["542871","542902","552028","552027","542912","556191","544248","542904","548075","546853","546388","548078","548547","543246","557450","548969"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["marina","mast","boat","congestion","continuation","multitude","motorboat","maritime","vessel","name"]}
