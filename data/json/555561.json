{"path":"555561.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph vividly captures a work scene at an outdoor location with industrial characteristics. There are three workers engaged in activity on a railway track. The ground appears wet or muddy and is littered with small debris. One of the workers, standing on the rail track with his back partially facing the camera, is wielding a tool that seems to be digging into the ground. This individual is wearing a jumpsuit and gloves, indicating labor-intensive work.\n\nTo the right, another worker is operating a large flexible hose connected to a tank truck labeled \"Ohio Hydrovac\" from Findlay, OH. The truck looks equipped for heavy-duty tasks, possibly involving fluid transport or high-pressure cleaning. This worker wears a blue shirt and jeans coupled with boots and a hard hat, suggesting safety regulations are in place.\n\nFurther in the background, there is a red Chevrolet pickup truck and a red cabin-like truck, parked beside what appears to be a stockpile of wood planks and slabs. A wooded area is partially visible behind the industrial equipment, blending the work environment with natural surroundings.\n\nOverall, the scene is an illustration of manual labor involving equipment and vehicles designed for specialized tasks, set in an industrial yard where railway maintenance or similar work is being performed. The muted colors and cloudy sky contribute to a somber but busy industrial atmosphere.","title":"EPA authorities were called upon to supervise cleanup when a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building was desTroyed June 20, 1974. Authorities believe the fire was caused by lightning. Here workers use a vacuum on sludge and chemicals at a railroad siding behind the plant. Some chemicals spilled into the Olentangy River, causing a major fish kill.","placename":"Delaware (Ohio)","location":"Delaware, Ohio","nn1":["556899","556871","555866","556884","556859","556883","556901","556896","556872","556881","556012","556869","556898","556885","556862","556860"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["worker","truck","work","railway","labor","jumpsuit","track","slab","pressure","illustration"]}
