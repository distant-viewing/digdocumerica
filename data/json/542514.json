{"path":"542514.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a complex network of paths or roads traversing across a rugged and uneven landscape. The patterns of these paths are intricate and appear somewhat dendritic, resembling the branches of a tree or veins. The terrain varies in color from dark brown to lighter shades of brown and beige, suggesting differences in soil composition or vegetation. The surface looks dry and is possibly sandy or desert-like.\n\nToward the top edge of the photo, the terrain becomes more rugged and features subtle elevation changes, with some areas appearing slightly raised. Small clusters of vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees, sporadically dot the landscape, adding sporadic touches of dark green hues to the otherwise earth-toned palette.\n\nAlong the right edge of the image, a body of water is visible which contours against the land, reflecting the irregular shape of the adjacent land. The water’s presence contrasts sharply with the dry appearance of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe purpose or origin of the network of paths is not immediately clear from the image alone—it could be indicative of past or present human activity possibly related to agriculture, mining, or another form of land use.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a distinct and textured glimpse of a geographically and possibly geologically complex area, viewed from above, highlighting the interplay between natural and human-made landscapes.","title":"Motorcycle tracks along Isabella lakeshore","placename":"Kern River Flood Canal (Calif.)","location":"Kern River Flood Canal, California","nn1":["543868","555888","550395","554164","543767","555873","544764","555865","542838","554165","555553","544446","542511","549016","542836","542821"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["path","land","network","brown","difference","origin","like","vein","past","agriculture"]}
