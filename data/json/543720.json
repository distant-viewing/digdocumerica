{"path":"543720.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a picturesque, expansive landscape set against a backdrop of dramatic mountain peaks covered in snow. The scene captures a broad valley floor that gradually slopes upward to meet the towering mountains. The valley is dotted with various elements of rural life.\n\nIn the foreground, you can see a series of farm structures, possibly barns or stables, and fenced areas suggesting this is an area used for livestock or agricultural purposes. There is a scattering of animals, likely cattle, spread across the plain.\n\nThe color palette is rich yet natural, with darker tones prevailing in the foreground, transitioning to lighter and whiter hues on the snow-capped mountains in the distance. The sky is slightly overcast, with hints of blue peeking through gaps in the clouds, providing a mood of serene solitude.\n\nThis setting is suggestive of a remote, possibly high-altitude location where farming or ranching is practiced amidst a rugged mountainous landscape. The overall composition beautifully contrasts the human-made elements in the valley with the natural grandeur of the snowy mountains.","title":"Colorado--near Loveland","placename":"Loveland (Colo.)","location":"Loveland, Colorado","nn1":["553073","544857","543763","545313","553811","552593","543654","550634","543750","550504","543640","556341","550516","550415","550502","550497"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["valley","mountain","snow","ranching","scattering","cattle","gap","livestock","barn","farming"]}
