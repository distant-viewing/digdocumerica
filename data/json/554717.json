{"path":"554717.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural wetland or boggy area, characterized by still waters that reflect a cloudy, overcast sky. The landscape is thick with dense forest in the background, primarily made up of coniferous trees, hinting at a cooler, possibly northern climate. The middle ground and foreground are dominated by a marsh-like environment, with sparse deciduous trees that appear to be in a state of decay â€” their bare, skeletal branches standing stark against the sky.\n\nThe water is predominant in the central area of the image, surrounded by patches of brownish-red vegetation, which could be marsh grasses or mosses typical of a wetland ecosystem. This suggests the photograph might have been taken in the fall or in an environment where vegetation is sparse. There are pieces of deadwood and tree stumps partially submerged in the water, contributing to the raw, natural aesthetic of the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil yet somber, with muted colors and a sense of undisturbed wilderness. It speaks to the quiet beauty of such ecosystems and their untouched, somewhat melancholic charm. The composition allows your eyes to wander from the water in the front, through the scattered trees, and into the dense woods, giving a sense of depth and expansiveness.","title":"Typical black spruce-tamarack swamp partially dammed by beavers at Stillwater Road.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550788","550345","553856","546066","546205","554716","554608","550789","544515","550341","552834","547589","544530","550750","545008","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","ecosystem","expansiveness","marsh","stump","tree","water","moss","fall","charm"]}
