{"path":"551141.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a hazy cityscape, likely at dawn or dusk, as evidenced by the soft light and layers of mist that obscure distant details. The foreground features a variety of buildings, including industrial structures and warehouses, as well as some residential or commercial low-rise buildings. The architecture is nondescript, with flat roofs and a few visible windows, mostly square and small in scale.\n\nIn the mid-ground, several distinct large industrial facilities or factories are visible, punctuated by tall smokestacks that contribute to the haziness of the scene. These facilities dominate the skyline in this part of the image, suggesting a heavily industrialized area.\n\nToward the background, a notable bridge spans across what might be a river, though the water itself is not visible. The bridge appears to be of a truss design, featuring multiple connected elements forming triangular units.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image is dominated by shades of purple and gray, creating a moody and somewhat somber atmosphere. The clarity of the air decreases with distance, adding to the feeling of depth but also pollution.\n\nThe hills or low mountains in the furthest background layer suggest that the city is located in a valley or a similarly enclosed geographical area. The overall composition and the elements within it reflect a blend of industrial activity and urban environment, intertwined with natural geographical features.","title":"Industrial Charleston in heavy haze","placename":"Charleston (W.
