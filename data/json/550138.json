{"path":"550138.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures an urban street scene characterized by a row of old, multi-story buildings, suggesting a somewhat historical or downtown area of a city. The buildings have a somewhat vintage, perhaps early 20th-century architectural style, featuring decorative elements like arched windows and cornices.\n\nThe setting is overcast, giving a muted tone to the colors in the photo. This atmosphere adds a somewhat gloomy or subdued feel to the scene. The street is busy with activity; several vintage cars are visible, indicating that the photo may be from the mid-20th century based on the style and design of the automobiles.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a truck labeled \"The Bettermeats & Provisions Co.,\" suggesting that one of the ground-level businesses is involved in meat distribution. Other visible signage includes \"Metro Meats Freezer Service,\" indicating themes of commerce centered around food and provisions.\n\nFurther in the background, the silhouette of a tall tower, likely a church steeple, rises into the overcast sky, marking a point of interest and hinting at the presence of significant buildings or a religious landmark further down the street.\n\nOverall, the photograph documents a moment in everyday life on an urban street, illustrating elements of commercial and architectural history, and gives a sense of the city's character during the mid-20th century.","title":"This block of storefront apartment buildings on Detroit Avenue will be razed to make way for public housing.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550108","545333","549267","546428","546440","548330","556225","556224","545216","549872","553840","542586","547651","552933","550118","552526"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","vintage","century","meat","cornice","steeple","distribution","city","commerce","downtown"]}
