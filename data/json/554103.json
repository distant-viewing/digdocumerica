{"path":"554103.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene focused on a large, prominent \"POSTED NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT\" sign that is affixed to what appears to be an exterior wall of a building. The sign has a bold, black border with black lettering on an orange background, signaling a strong warning against unauthorized access. The sign is weathered, and there are visible marks and patches where the paint has peeled away, indicating age and exposure to elements.\n\nTo the left of the sign, installed on the white, painted wall of the building is an old-fashioned, round outdoor lighting fixture, which is also showing signs of weathering. The wall has patches of dirt and mildew, enhancing the sense of neglect or abandonment.\n\nThe background beyond the building unfolds as a lush, green landscape with dense trees and vegetation, presenting a stark contrast to the stern, forbidding signage on the building. There are indications of a path or driveway leading away from the building into the forested area, partially obscured by overgrowing grass and plants, inviting yet contradicting the warning on the sign.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during the early morning or late afternoon, as the natural light is soft and diffused, casting a tranquil and quiet atmosphere over the scene, which contrasts with the message of the sign. The overall composition captures a snapshot of human intervention in a natural setting, underlined by themes of privacy, boundary, and exclusion.","title":"Closed-off area earmarked for development.
