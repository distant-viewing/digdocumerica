{"path":"555056.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of two unique flowers. The flowers predominantly display a greenish-bronze hue on the outer parts of their bell-shaped structures, with noticeable velvety textures that highlight the fine hairs lining the edges. Inside each flower, there is a glossy black bulb, which starkly contrasts with the surrounding softer colors and textures.\n\nThe flowers are connected to a fresh green stalk, with leaves that appear healthy and robust, evidence of this plant's vitality. The leaves have visible veins, which add to the texture and depth of the plant's appearance.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, highlighting the flowers as the main subject of this photograph. The blurred greenery in the background suggests a natural, outdoor environment, which aids in complementing and amplifying the color and vitality of the flowers in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition skillfully focuses attention on the intricate details of the flowers' structure and contrasting colors, making it a compelling and visually engaging image.","title":"Berries of a shrub in a climax sitka spruce forest on an ocean strip in the pacific coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554840","554587","547613","553366","543597","543623","553361","544875","545707","554574","553368","550464","543596","554575","554586","557617"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","vitality","greenish","bronze","aids","bulb","amplify","stalk","texture","vein"]}
