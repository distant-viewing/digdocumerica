{"path":"551613.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of an institutional or possibly educational facility situated in a suburban or semi-rural setting. The main focal point is a large brick building with multiple sections visible. It has a significant front lawn, neatly trimmed and bordered by clean walkways. There is a larger, white dome structure adjacent to a wide road that looks quite modern compared to the main building. Behind it is another sizable structure with a flat roof and a gray facade that resembles an industrial or utility building.\n\nSurrounding the facility are patches of wooded areas with dense trees, interspersing some open grassy spaces. To the left in the image, you can see several houses with pitched roofs, reinforcing the suburban character of the area. \n\nA large parking area in front of the main building holds numerous cars, suggesting an active day with several visitors or staff present. The roads curve gently through the scene, shaping the layout of the land and the positioning of the buildings.\n\nThe overall scene is settled and quiet with no visible movement or activities, typical of an aerial perspective that captures a wide view without close-up details on individual actions. The focus here seems to be on the layout and the institutional architecture in the context of its natural and suburban surroundings.","title":"National water quality laboratory, a government facility","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["558056","544503","550547","546702","546456","548866","546464","549626","546473","546460","558146","546624","542593","549360","557750","556978"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["layout","building","staff","positioning","front","facility","pitch","roof","grassy","resemble"]}
