{"path":"543246.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a serene marina scene, showing an array of boats, predominantly sailboats, docked along the calm water. The water itself reflects the masts and sky, indicating a calm, perhaps slightly overcast day. The docks appear neatly arranged, extending into the distance where more boats are moored.\n\nIn the foreground, on the right, thereâ€™s a verdant area with shrubs and a patch of exposed ground, suggesting a small, somewhat unmaintained grassy area beside the marina. Looking beyond the immediate marina, the background features muted, indistinct architecture, likely industrial or warehouse buildings given their size and low profiles.\n\nThe overall atmosphere implied by the image is that of a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon at a harbor where the water is tranquil and the environment is peaceful. The color tone and quality of the photograph suggest it might be a bit older, or taken with a film camera, adding a vintage feel to the scene.","title":"Fishing fleet","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["542904","543545","546388","542872","548235","556191","542871","549407","546935","544248","548247","544661","546877","543247","548515","542903"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["marina","boat","mast","harbor","sailboat","film","profile","warehouse","vintage","bit"]}
