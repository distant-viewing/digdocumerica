{"path":"550268.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive outdoor scene primarily characterized by a large, irregularly shaped body of water, possibly a lake or a pond, with a vibrant hue of blue. The water is flanked by rugged, uneven terrain with patches of sparse vegetation, indicative of a landscape undergoing erosion or land reclamation efforts. The setting suggests a rural or semi-industrial environment due to the visible excavation marks on the surrounding earth and the somewhat barren nature of the vegetation.\n\nIn the foreground, on a narrow strip of land that juts into the water, stands a solitary figure, a man dressed in dark clothing. His stance and positioning, facing the water, suggest he might be engaged in contemplation, surveying the area, or perhaps preparing to engage in an activity like fishing. \n\nThe background of the scene is marked by gently rolling hills and sparse trees, which give way to a clearer sky above, filled with light clouds. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet solitude, possibly hinting at the theme of human interaction with natural or modified landscapes. The light and color in the photograph suggest it might have been taken during late morning or early afternoon, under fair weather conditions.","title":"Reclaimed land of keller coal company near Alliance surrounds an artificial lake that is stocked with fish.
