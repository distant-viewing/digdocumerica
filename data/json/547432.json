{"path":"547432.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive wheat field under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, the focus is on golden wheat stalks, some of which are captured in detail showing the grains close-up on the heads of the wheat. These details give a textured and vibrant look to the field.\n\nIn the middle and back portions of the image, a red combine harvester is visible parked amid the wheat field. It appears dormant, suggesting either a pause in activity or the completion of its task. The combine harvester adds a contrasting industrial element to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe background also includes distant mountains under the vast, cloudless sky, enhancing the sense of openness and vastness of the landscape. This rural, agricultural setting is typical of large-scale farming operations, showcasing the machinery used and the natural environment in which it operates.","title":"Palo verde valley wheatfield borders on the Colorado river","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547730","548976","553810","552458","548979","548985","548982","548964","544050","548981","544046","555619","542589","554044","548820","544552"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["wheat","harvester","field","combine","completion","stalk","pause","grain","openness","farming"]}
