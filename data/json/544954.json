{"path":"544954.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a rural setting with a prominent structure centrally located within the image. This structure appears to be an industrial burner or kiln, characteristic of lumber processing operations, likely used for burning wood residue. It has a conical shape at the top and is emitting thick, dark smoke, which is billowing upwards into the sky and dispersing with the wind.\n\nThe scene takes place in a grassy field that stretches across the foreground, leading up to the kiln. The field itself is fairly open and barren, without much vegetation or other significant features visible.\n\nIn the background, beyond the kiln, there are additional industrial or farm buildings with metal and wooden structures evident. These buildings contribute to the impression of an operational industrial or agricultural site. There is a fence running parallel to the kiln, partially enclosing the area.\n\nThe landscape is framed by wooded hills or mountains, which are visible in the distant background under a mostly clear sky with some light cloud cover.\n\nOverall, the composition draws attention to the environmental impact of industrial activities in rural settings, highlighted by the smoke emission from the kiln against the natural backdrop.","title":"\"Teepee\" burner incinerates woodchips and sawdust from lumber mill","placename":"Pagosa Springs (Colo.)","location":"Pagosa Springs, Colorado","nn1":["544958","543009","542860","542620","543749","551056","546236","548157","551060","543733","546141","550998","551054","545990","551059","557374"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["burner","residue","smoke","lumber","characteristic","field","emission","cover","wind","farm"]}
