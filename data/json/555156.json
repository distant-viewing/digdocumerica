{"path":"555156.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of a wildfire. The main focus is on bright and fiery red flames consuming a sloped forested area. The fire's glow illuminates the smoke and airborne particles around it, creating a thick, dense atmosphere. The landscape is steep, suggesting it might be a hillside.\n\nIn the background, amidst a haze of smoke, the silhouettes of tall conifer trees are faintly visible, emphasizing the depth and scale of the fire's environment. The trees appear somewhat obscured by the smoke, highlighting the intense impact of the fire on the visibility and air quality in the area.\n\nThe overall composition uses natural light from the fire itself, casting a reddish hue on everything, which adds to the urgency and danger typically associated with wildfire events. The image effectively conveys a sense of chaos and the raw power of nature through the wild spread of the flames and the engulfed vegetation.","title":"Burning slash on a 75-degree slope in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548591","553843","557577","555157","553128","555160","548590","548597","543908","553560","548592","548595","542712","547728","557578","548593"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","wildfire","flame","smoke","danger","urgency","particle","chaos","spread","hillside"]}
