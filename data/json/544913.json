{"path":"544913.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph portrays a scenic view within what appears to be a forested area, overlaid with a prominent information sign in the foreground. The background reveals a lush landscape of greenery, including a variety of trees like spruce and fir showing sporadic signs of logging, with some areas densely populated with trees and others more sparse. This natural scenery is underlaid with rugged terrain and small fallen branches, all set against a distant backdrop of majestic, craggy mountain peaks that further enhance the wilderness aspect.\n\nThe informational sign, taking center stage in the image, is painted in dark blue with white text and symbolic illustrations such as a tree, a saw, and ax. The sign reads as follows:\n\n```\nThe spruce and fir were cut in\npatches so young trees would\nstart life on bare soil without\ncompetition from other trees.\nThe debris left from the\nlogging operation helps retain\nsoil moisture and protects\nseedlings from too\nmuch sunlight.\n\nThrough \"proper\"\nmanagement, the Forest\nService is helping\nto maintain the\nproductiveness of\nyour Forest.\n\nManage a forest\nwell and it will\nyield its treasures\nforever.\n\nUMPHAGRE National Forest\nAssisted by John Plyet Timber Products\n```\n\nThis sign provides educational content concerning forestry management practices in the Uncompahgre (possibly misspelled as \"Umphagre\" on the sign) National Forest, emphasizing sustainable and protective measures for young seedlings and forest productivity, contributed to by John Plyet Timber Products.\n\nThe composition juxtaposes human intervention and educational efforts within a natural, rugged environment. Such imagery underlines themes of conservation, sustainable resource management, and the balance between using and protecting natural forests.","title":"Public relations by logging company","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544841","542789","545045","555198","542834","555109","556922","542823","555143","542835","542609","553573","544239","542568","555147","543724"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["fir","sign","management","forest","competition","productivity","soil","illustration","imagery","tree"]}
