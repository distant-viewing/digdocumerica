{"path":"553081.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene by a calm body of water, likely a canal or a small river. In the foreground, two people are engaged in fishing. They are seated on the grassy bank. The individual on the left, presumably male, wears a white T-shirt and an orange cap and is seated looking at the water with a fishing rod in hand. To his right, another individual, appearing to be female, is focusing on her fishing task. She is wearing a horizontal striped top in white and various shades of blue, and her back is turned toward the camera.\n\nBehind them, a bridge spans over the water. It's a simple, modern structure with a metal railing and supports. The road on the bridge seems to carry a light amount of traffic, as a couple of vehicles, including what looks like an old-style red truck, are visible in the distance.\n\nThe landscape around the water features sparse vegetation and a few scattered pieces of grass and shrubs. The terrain beyond the bridge is relatively flat and open with visible utility poles and wires stretching across the landscape, contributing to the rural or semi-rural ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe sky is nearly clear with soft lighting, suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon. This photograph depicts a quiet, leisurely moment in a tranquil outdoor setting, focusing on the simplicity and peacefulness of fishing in nature.","title":"Diversionary canal of the Truckee River at Fernley is part of the Newlands Irrigation Project.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["549935","551024","544216","550851","551025","550666","557971","543516","551537","542564","548737","548138","550217","549933","548141","550313"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","bridge","canal","seat","peacefulness","rod","male","water","outdoor","amount"]}
