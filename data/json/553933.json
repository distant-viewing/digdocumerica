{"path":"553933.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural landscape with industrial elements. In the foreground, a vast field of crops, which appear to be corn based on their tall, slender stalks and tassel-topped appearance, dominates the view. This golden-green field undulates slightly with the terrain, suggesting gentle hills or uneven ground.\n\nIn the midground, a large industrial chimney stands prominently, emitting a thick plume of dark smoke that disperses into the sky. The chimney is the most visually striking man-made structure in the scene, signifying industrial activity in an otherwise natural setting.\n\nBeyond the chimney, the landscape features flat terrain with scattered patches of greenery and water bodies, which could be small lakes or ponds. The horizon is fairly level, and the sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, suggesting a calm day.\n\nThe contrast between the natural agricultural foreground and the industrial midground creates a juxtaposition of rural life against industrial impact, highlighting themes of environmental and economic interactions.","title":"Oahu sugar company mill at waipahu belches black smoke over its green sugar cane fields","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["546398","543159","545971","546394","545013","543668","544676","543013","545247","542620","552091","545989","546073","542553","557293","543813"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","midground","corn","stalk","disperse","field","signify","undulate","pond","crop"]}
