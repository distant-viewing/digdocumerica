{"path":"543261.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging scene in a natural, mountainous setting. At the foreground, a medium-sized, shaggy, reddish-brown dog sits facing away from the camera, positioned on a stony ground with sparse vegetation. The dog is looking upward towards the snow-covered mountains in the distance, which dominate much of the upper half of the image. The mountain appears to be steep, with exposed rocks and patches of snow clinging to the slopes, suggesting a cold and possibly rugged environment. The middle distance between the dog and the mountain is filled with dark, possibly volcanic rocks and sparse bushes, hinting at a possibly harsh terrain. The composition and mood evoke a sense of solitude and contemplation, with the dogâ€™s attentive pose and gaze adding a thoughtful or expectant quality to the scene. This setting conveys a serene, yet somewhat stark atmosphere, typical of alpine or high altitude environments.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["554627","554537","544874","550415","550502","550504","550416","550408","543763","543831","552173","553089","550421","550521","550645","554532"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["dog","mountain","snow","cling","rock","half","altitude","contemplation","pose","distance"]}
