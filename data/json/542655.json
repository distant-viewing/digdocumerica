{"path":"542655.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and busy scene of what appears to be a group of young people engaged in an environmental or community cleanup activity on a sandy stretch beneath an urban setting. The foreground prominently features two young women working cooperatively to fill large burlap sacks with debris or litter from the sand. The woman on the left wears a long-sleeve dark t-shirt paired with striped pants, and her long hair is being tousled by the wind. She is intensely focused on opening the sack. The other woman, positioned to the right, is dressed in a floral print blouse, vest, and denim jeans, concentrating on the task at hand.\n\nIn the background, the environment is bustling with additional activity. Several individuals are scattered across the scene, many of whom are children and teenagers. Some are bent over picking up debris, while others carry sacks or engage with one another. Their attire varies widely, reflecting casual and functional clothing styles typical of a voluntary cleanup event. The background also features a dilapidated concrete structure and a large industrial pipe, providing a stark contrast to the natural sandy area. Further behind, visible infrastructure includes poles and a hint of a metal fence, suggesting the proximity of more urban or industrial developments.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of community effort and environmental awareness, underscored by the earnest involvement of young individuals in improving their local area. The activity is set under clear skies and bright daylight, enhancing the vividness and energy captured in the moment.","title":"Eighth grade students from St. Bonaventure High School spend recess period picking up trash on beach near oil wells.","placename":"Huntington Beach (Calif.)","location":"Huntington Beach, California","nn1":["551427","543927","552951","551421","552948","548191","544800","550060","548198","550056","542657","551391","545535","546863","543439","553423"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["sack","cleanup","woman","awareness","teenager","print","community","involvement","debris","litter"]}
