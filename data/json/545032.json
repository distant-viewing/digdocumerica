{"path":"545032.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures an older man by a water body, actively involved in examining something in his environment. The man is balding with a red tuft of hair, wearing glasses, a black t-shirt, and black pants. He is kneeling on one knee near the shore, holding a chunk of dirty or oily substance in his right hand, while his left hand holds a piece of cloth or paper.\n\nThe background features a broad expanse of water that meets the horizon under a clear blue sky. Along the shore, there is a visible collection of either pollutants or natural organic material. Further out, small pieces of land or vegetation are visible scattered across the water body.\n\nHis expression appears focused, perhaps suggesting an interest in environmental issues or pollution, as indicated by his attention to the substance in his hand. The overall atmosphere seems quiet, with no other individual in sight, suggesting a secluded or isolated setting.","title":"Coos Bay District Attorney Bob Brasch examines \"sulphite liquor\" from the Menasha Pulp Mill settling pond.
