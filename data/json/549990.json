{"path":"549990.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of communal outdoor ice hockey on a frozen pond in an urban park setting. The focus is on five individuals, likely a mixed group of adults and youths, actively involved in a casual game of hockey. They are equipped with hockey sticks and, judging from their attire including jackets, gloves, and casual winter clothes, the temperature appears to be chilly.\n\nThe central figure is a young male in a white jersey with red and blue stripes on the sleeves, dark pants, and hockey skates, maneuvering the puck with his stick. Surrounding him, other participants also dressed in warm winter clothing engage in the play, with one person in tan pants poised to interact with the puck next.\n\nIn the background, a dark ornate metal bridge is a prominent architectural element crossing over the pond, connecting two parts of the park. The setting includes leafless trees, indicative of winter, and a clear sky. Additional figures can be seen around the area, including some spectators on the bridge and others walking around the park. There are a couple of dogs, hinting at the park's welcoming multidimensional use. The overall composition provides a slice of urban life, outdoor recreation, and community interaction against a backdrop of public infrastructure and natural elements, presenting a nostalgic yet timeless urban winter activity.","title":"Stalwart new englanders play ice hockey in the public garden","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["558199","558198","558201","558200","558202","549986","551721","551932","551769","551768","556162","551776","554229","558247","543512","558229"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["winter","stick","pond","park","bridge","welcome","crossing","poise","temperature","youth"]}
