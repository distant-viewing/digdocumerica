{"path":"546950.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of environmental alteration, showing a yellow bulldozer actively engaged in clearing a wooded area. The bulldozer, positioned in the center-right of the frame, is surrounded by a substantial amount of debris, indicating recent activity in tree and underbrush removal. Numerous felled trees and branches are scattered across the foreground and around the bulldozer, highlighting the scale of deforestation.\n\nBehind the bulldozer, there is a small fire, producing a plume of smoke that adds a hazy atmosphere to the scene. This fire, likely used to burn the cleared vegetation, contributes to the environmental impact evident in the image.\n\nThe setting is predominantly natural, with a backdrop of standing trees that are yet untouched by the clearing activity. These trees look tall and are possibly a mix of pine and other species, suggesting that the location might be a forested area.\n\nThe ground is visibly disturbed, muddy, and tracked by the machinery, indicating recent and ongoing heavy use. The overall composition of the photograph portrays a stark interaction between machinery and nature, emphasizing themes of development, environmental management, or conservation concerns.","title":"A bulldozer gouges out part of a forest for a golf course on the Seabrook Island development on John's Island.","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547000","543105","554544","556456","542614","548807","542851","553624","545950","542948","553619","547254","553468","549950","543114","551947"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["bulldozer","clear","fire","removal","fell","deforestation","machinery","alteration","burn","produce"]}
