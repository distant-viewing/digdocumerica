{"path":"555881.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a wide, expansive landscape likely taken during dusk, given the soft, subdued lighting. The foreground and midground are dominated by vast and varied textured terrain marked by patches of vegetated and barren lands. There are several dirt roads intertwining across the field, leading to different directions but they all seem to converge at a central point where a small structure stands isolated. This small, white structure appears simplistic, possibly a utility or storage shed, and is the only built element visible in this otherwise natural scene.\n\nThe landscape is not uniform; it includes areas that look slightly wet and possibly muddy, creating patches of darker soil compared to the surrounding lighter, dry land. In the distance, the terrain flattens out significantly and leads to a horizon that is a mix of land and sky, blending almost seamlessly due to the haze. The vast open skies suggest a remote or rural setting, lacking any signs of urban development or high vegetation.\n\nThe composition leverages a high point of view, offering an extensive view of the land's vastness and the intertwining roads, suggesting a blend of natural and slightly human-altered landscape. The color palette is primarily earth-toned with hints of muted greens and blues, evoking a quiet, almost serene atmosphere. Overall, the scene captures the essence of a tranquil, expansive outdoor environment void of any immediate human presence or activity.","title":"Aerial view of Five Acre Pond covered over with earth after cleanup operations were complete. The cleanup resulted in some 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil sludge being removed and treated before disposal at a nearby site. The work was supervised by EPA personnel and prevented possible contamination of nearby Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["554803","549182","549156","554807","550598","549179","550399","547292","552903","548673","557087","555397","550397","549261","550489","549180"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["land","intertwine","leverage","flatten","alter","converge","blend","lead","point","isolate"]}
