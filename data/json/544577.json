{"path":"544577.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image depicts a vibrant and somewhat surreal landscape, possibly altered for artistic effect. It features a serene body of water, reflective and calm, that stretches horizontally across the frame. The foreground is dominated by tall, slender grasses or reeds with burgundy and purple hues, which are uncommon colors for such vegetation, suggesting either the effects of infrared photography or some form of color enhancement.\n\nThe midground is lined with lush trees displaying vivid red foliage, also suggesting an alteration in the natural colors, reminiscent of infrared photographic techniques. These trees are densely packed and stand out starkly against the sky.\n\nThe background reveals a clear blue sky, dotted with fluffy, white clouds, contributing to the dramatic and colorful presentation of the scene. The cloud formations enhance the depth and add a dynamic element to the serene waterscape below.\n\nOverall, the composition is picturesque, emphasizing the contrast between the unusual coloration of the natural elements and the serene setting. It exudes a sense of tranquility while simultaneously captivating with its vivid and unusual color palette.","title":"Grass along TaMiami Canal near the Shark Valley park entrance","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550750","544679","558093","548030","554527","543611","557111","552429","547488","542994","550735","554753","550691","546963","555637","552318"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["waterscape","burgundy","effect","presentation","alteration","technique","coloration","reed","photography","cloud"]}
