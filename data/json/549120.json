{"path":"549120.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man wearing a straw cowboy hat and a plaid, button-up shirt in blue tones. The man's expression is approachable and friendly, with a slight smile and his eyes slightly squinting, which could be from the sunlight or an indication of a candid moment of amusement or laughter. His face shows some signs of sun exposure and outdoor work, suggesting he might be involved in work or activities that are outdoorsy in nature, like farming or ranching.\n\nThe background is blurred, but it appears to be a natural, outdoor setting with a broad expanse that could be a field or pasture, shown in shades of green. Out of focus in the background, there seems to be a yellow object, potentially a piece of agricultural machinery, which supports the idea of an outdoor, rural environment. This element adds to the rustic and natural feel of the image. The overall atmosphere feels informal and genuine, capturing a moment likely in the life of a rural worker.","title":"John Redding, one of the ranchers in Sarpy Basin.
