{"path":"553336.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene involving a person canoeing through turbulent river waters. The canoe, mostly submerged in the foaming white water, is tilted towards the left-hand side of the image as the individual maneuvers it with a paddle. The paddleâ€™s blade is partly visible above the water, and the paddler, wearing obscured dark attire, is leaning into their stroke to navigate through the rough current.\n\nThe river itself is tumultuous, with swirling rapids and splashes of water creating a chaotic environment that illustrates the intensity and challenge of the activity. The background is mostly dark and indistinct, suggesting a heavily shaded area, possibly a river surrounded by dense forest.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of action and the adventurer's skill in tackling the powerful forces of nature. The viewer can almost hear the rush of water and feel the thrill of battling the challenging rapids.","title":"Tilted kayak equals wet kayaker","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549439","553333","550659","550663","558070","549440","549447","550657","554465","549437","545733","549463","553335","550980","550653","545729"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","paddle","river","hear","thrill","rapid","rush","skill","water","blade"]}
