{"path":"555252.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows a man examining or operating a Perkin-Elmer 521 Grating Infrared Spectrophotometer, which is a complex scientific instrument used for measuring the infrared spectra of samples. The man is standing, wearing a light pink shirt with a checkered pattern, his hair neatly combed and short. His focus is intently on adjusting or reading the output from the machine, which appears to be printing out data onto a roll of paper that feeds out from the device.\n\nThe machine itself is large and boxy, made of metal with various dials and buttons on its panels. Labels on the machine clearly state the brand and model. In the background, a bright window covered with horizontal blinds suggests an office or laboratory setting, providing a source of natural light that softens the room. The atmosphere gives a sense of a professional, possibly research-focused environment.\n\nThe overall image captures a moment of scientific inquiry or data analysis, hinting at the technological context of the era, which appears to be from the mid-20th century given the style of the equipment and the man's attire.","title":"An infrared spectrophotometer is used to identify pesticide compounds at the environmental protection agency Mississippi test facility laboratory in bay st.
