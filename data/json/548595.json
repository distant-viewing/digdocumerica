{"path":"548595.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a large-scale landscape fire, most likely a wildfire or prescribed burn. The scene is filled with thick, heavy smoke that obscures much of the view. The smoke ranges in color from light gray to dark blue, indicating the intensity and heat of the fire below. In the foreground, a dense forest can be seen, with numerous trees in various shapes and sizes, predominantly conifers based on their silhouette.\n\nThe trees are partially obscured by the voluminous smoke, suggesting that the fire is burning within or very near this forested area. The atmosphere of the image is murky and hazy due to the smoke, which blurs the boundary between the forest and the sky. The overall impression is one of a dramatic and dynamic natural event, deeply affecting the landscape shown.\n\nIn the upper sections of the photo, the sky can be glimpsed, showing a blurry, somewhat overcast day, which may be further obscured by the smoke from the fire. The colors in the photograph are subdued, with the cooler tones dominating due to the smoke and the natural lighting conditions.\n\nThe composition of the image focuses on capturing the spread and impact of the smoke, creating a compelling visual narrative about the fire's effect on the environment. The vastness of the smoke spread suggests a significant fire event, with critical implications for the area's ecosystem and air quality.","title":"Forest fire in the everglades, collier county.
