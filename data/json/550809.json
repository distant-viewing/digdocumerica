{"path":"550809.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene view of a water surface densely covered with lily pads. The lily pads are largely circular, overlapping each other, and have a deep purplish-green hue. Among these, several vibrant pink water lilies are in bloom, adding a splash of color to the scene. The flowers are partially open, revealing their pale pink petals and yellow centers.\n\nThe water is still, with the light creating a gleaming effect on the surface, highlighted by tiny sparkles where sunlight hits the ripples and the wet surfaces of the lily pads. The background is out of focus, suggesting a secluded, natural setting, likely a pond or a calm lake, surrounded by shadows that indicate dense foliage or trees around the water body.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, focusing on the details and textures of the lily pads and the delicate appearance of the water lilies.","title":"Water lilies on the Wisconsin river at merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["543598","550808","544474","544592","555080","554584","544588","554583","545387","558095","547639","550775","543561","555044","557587","551352"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pad","gleam","hit","overlap","water","surface","sparkle","petal","bloom"]}
