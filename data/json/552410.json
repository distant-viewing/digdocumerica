{"path":"552410.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph is framed by an archway covered with leafy branches, creating a natural vignette around the scene. Through this arched view, we see a park-like setting with an expansive, neatly manicured grassy area and mature trees in the background. In the middle ground, there is a traditional well or wishing well constructed of stone, around which several people are gathered. The well is at the center of a paved circular area, possibly functioning as a gathering or focal point within the setting.\n\nThree people are visible in close proximity to the well. There is a woman to the left, looking towards the others, and two men on the right, one of whom is interacting with the well, possibly throwing something in or making a wish. The people are dressed in casual attire suitable for a day out in a park â€“ the woman in a white sweater, and the men in light-colored shirts and trousers. One of the men carries a bag, suggesting they may be tourists or visitors to the area. \n\nThe overall composition and atmosphere suggest a tranquil, leisurely day at a public park, with people engaging in casual social activities and enjoying the outdoor environment. The photograph has a slightly faded or vintage quality, adding to the timeless feel of the scene.","title":"\"wishing well\" in the gardens of the canadian school of horticulture, on the niagara parkway north of Niagara Falls ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["557985","555947","553065","551682","544808","551017","552036","550074","552033","552396","552736","553149","550302","547756","551858","557259"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["people","park","vignette","archway","throw","manicure","tourist","woman","sweater","man"]}
