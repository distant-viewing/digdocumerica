{"path":"547376.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a dimly lit bar or tavern. The setting features a group of four elderly men seated around a circular tabletop, deeply engaged in a card game. The card players are dressed in casual, dated attire, with three of the men wearing hats which suggest a rural or working-class background.\n\nIn the background, there's a bar counter where a bartender is interacting with another customer. The bartender appears to be wearing a white hat and there are shelves with bottles and other items behind the counter. The lighting in the bar is provided by fluorescent tube lights, which cast a stark, overhead illumination that contrasts with the otherwise shadowy ambiance.\n\nOn the near right, another table is visible with what seems to be a lone male customer seated at it. The walls and the general decor have a minimalistic and functional appearance, typical of a local tavern frequented by regulars. The scene conveys a sense of everyday social interaction, possibly in a small town setting. The mood is quiet, perhaps reflective, as these individuals participate in their routine social activity.","title":"At the \"Pastime Bar\" in Geneva","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547794","548234","546140","550323","553518","551279","543975","553798","543990","546025","554866","547796","557152","546089","556543","545984"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["bar","card","customer","counter","class","player","hat","tube","decor","shelf"]}
