{"path":"548383.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a cityscape during either sunrise or sunset. The image captures the silhouette of several tall buildings against a dimly lit sky with a subdued palette. The central building is notably taller and more prominent compared to the others, dominating the composition with its stark, rectangular shape. \n\nThe sun is visible in the background, positioned just behind this main building, suggesting either the early hours of the morning or the late hours of the evening. Its light is diffused, creating a hazy glow that softly illuminates the sky and casts a gentle reflection on what appears to be a body of water in the foreground. The water adds a subtle texture to the lower part of the image, indicating calm and perhaps slow-moving water.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is moody and somewhat mysterious, emphasizing the shapes and forms of the buildings as geometric silhouettes against a softly lit sky. The colors are muted, with shades of dark blues and greys dominating, and there is a slight graininess to the image, possibly due to the film or the conditions in which the photo was taken.","title":"Office buildings in lower Manhattan at sunset","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545406","545499","555736","548328","548337","552264","548384","548339","550011","549970","555716","553788","548360","543969","549620","553821"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["hour","graininess","silhouette","shape","building","sunrise","film","grey","compare","diffuse"]}
