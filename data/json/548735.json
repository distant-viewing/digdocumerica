{"path":"548735.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in fishing aboard a small power boat. The image is taken during daylight and reflects a peaceful, recreational moment on a body of water. The boat appears compact and functional, equipped with an outboard motor and simple fishing rods held by the individuals.\n\nThe two figures, dressed in casual, possibly swimwear attire, are actively fishing. One is standing at the bow with a fishing rod, looking intent and focused on the activity, while the other is near the stern, handling another rod or perhaps adjusting equipment. Their posture and attention are directed towards their lines, indicating their engagement in fishing.\n\nThe water around the boat glistens lightly under sunlight, suggesting good weather conditions for outdoor activities. The distant background is out of focus, emphasizing the peaceful isolation of the scene on the water. The overall composition and the natural light contribute to a serene and focused fishing experience, captured in this moment.","title":"Fishing near Marathon in the central Florida keys","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["552317","548499","552282","552324","552326","546001","546053","552313","548738","552308","548160","546972","554198","545093","552123","545178"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","boat","intent","fishe","motor","glisten","stern","bow","experience"]}
