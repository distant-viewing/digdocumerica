{"path":"554551.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays a bustling and crowded street scene that typifies a busy commercial area, possibly from the 1970s judging by the style and design of the vehicles. The image captures a line of stationary vehicles as seen from an elevated, possibly second-story perspective, giving a clear view over the cars and into the street scene beyond.\n\nThe vehicles in the photo are diverse, including sedans, station wagons, and a few trucks, mostly vintage from the mid-20th century, characterized by their distinctive body shapes and sizes. The color palette of the cars ranges from light blues and reds to darker hues. Notably, one of the closest cars to the camera is a station wagon with a discernible license plate marked “HRS-89.”\n\nThe street is lined with a variety of small shops and businesses. Visible signage includes one that mentions “Sales,” suggesting a retail venue. Pedestrians are scattered along the sidewalks, contributing to the lively atmosphere of what seems to be a main thoroughfare in a small to medium-sized town.\n\nOverhead, utility poles and lines crisscross above the street adding to the somewhat cluttered aesthetic typical to many urban environments of that era. Trees prominently frame the sides and median of the roadway, providing a pleasant contrast to the built environment and the lineup of cars. The overall composition conveys a typical day with bustling town activity, and provides a nostalgic glimpse into urban life from a previous generation.","title":"Traffic jam on a summer weekend at Lake George, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556709","542586","545216","547369","556724","556718","551913","557705","554297","549872","551135","551324","556734","556753","548388","545614"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["street","wagon","car","town","station","median","lineup","vehicle","judging","thoroughfare"]}
