{"path":"550108.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a city street scene dominated by a row of aged and architecturally diverse buildings. The main building in the center appears to be a three-story structure that is somewhat dilapidated, with boarded-up windows on the ground floor and visible wear on its façade. The building is made of brick and features arched and rounded windows that suggest a blend of architectural styles, typical of older urban districts.\n\nOn the ground floor of this central building, there are large wooden boards covering what might have once been windows or a storefront. Advertisements or company signs stating \"Feighan\" and \"Socha\" are affixed to these boards, suggesting a commercial use or an advertisement space.\n\nTo the left and right of this main building are other buildings that appear to be in slightly better condition, with cleaner façades and more visible maintenance. The one on the immediate right has a rounded upper façade that adds character to the street’s architectural diversity.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there’s a street where a pedestrian, dressed in a long coat and possibly carrying something, is walking. This provides a scale to the scene and adds a human element, emphasizing the urban environment. Parked alongside the curb is a dark-colored vintage car, which assists in dating the photograph, underlining an older era.\n\nThe overall atmosphere evoked by this photograph is one of a past era with a blend of neglect and enduring urban life, typical of many downtown areas before revitalization. The power lines stretching across the top of the frame further contribute to the urban setting, capturing the intricate network of city infrastructure.","title":"Burned out building at 2520 Detroit avenue.
