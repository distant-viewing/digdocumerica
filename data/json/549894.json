{"path":"549894.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid urban scene, likely captured in the bustling streets of New York. Central to the image is a bright yellow taxi cab, evocative of the iconic New York City taxis. Inside the taxi, a driver is visible, wearing a light-colored cap and engaging attentively with the road.\n\nBehind the taxi and occupying much of the middle ground of the image, is a large vehicle labeled as the 'Department of Air Resources Mobile Laboratory'. This vehicle belongs to the Environmental Protection Administration of New York, as indicated by its signage. The truck is blue and silver, suggesting its utilitarian purpose and government ownership.\n\nThe environment suggests a dense urban setting with other elements indicative of city life, though these are largely obscured by the two prominent vehicles. The top of another vehicle, white in color, occupies the foreground at the lower edge of the photograph.\n\nNotably, the photograph offers a glimpse into environmental monitoring practices and the everyday functionality of transportation in a major city, as well as hinting at the regulation and maintenance of urban environmental health through the mobile laboratoryâ€™s presence.","title":"New York Environmental Protection Administration Mobile laboratory in Midtown Manhattan.
