{"path":"557629.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dramatically large and luminous sun setting behind a silhouetted horizon. The sun dominates the image, appearing nearly at the center, and is cast in vibrant shades of orange and red, transitioning into a deeper red hue as it radiates outward. The bottom edge of the sun is slightly obscured by the horizon line, which is irregular, suggesting a landscape with varied elevations such as hills or distant mountains.\n\nThe horizon is dotted with the silhouettes of sparse trees and possibly some small structures or natural features, creating an uneven, textured outline against the glowing backdrop of the sun. The sky surrounding the sun is steeped in deep purples and blacks, enhancing the stark contrast between the bright, fiery sun and the dark foreground.\n\nThe left and right edges of the image frame the scene with dark silhouettes of thicker forestation, suggesting this view could be from a vantage point looking through a gap in a forested area. The overall mood is serene yet powerful, emphasizing the majestic and overwhelming scale of the sun set against the earthy, subdued forms of the landscape. This juxtaposition conveys a sense of awe and tranquility, capturing a moment of natural grandeur.","title":"Rising or setting sun","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552337","542680","555070","553844","547719","555164","542678","557957","543410","542679","557560","554396","548123","557447","549847","543144"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","forestation","horizon","silhouette","awe","gap","radiate","black","elevation","edge"]}
