{"path":"554597.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a squirrel sitting on a pebbly surface, feeding on what appears to be scattered pieces of food. The squirrel is predominantly brown with a soft, bushy tail. The animal is holding a piece of food in its hands, which it eats as it sits upright. The focus of the photo is sharp on the squirrel, while the background is softly blurred.\n\nThe ground is a mix of soft earth and pebbles, indicative of a natural setting, possibly a park or a forest area. The contrast between the pebbly area where the squirrel is and the muddy area behind it adds a textural dimension to the image. In the blurred background, hints of green suggest low vegetation or grass. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph is natural, lending a warm and organic feel to the scene. This setting and the squirrelâ€™s calm demeanor provide a serene glimpse into a moment of wildlife in its natural environment.","title":"Red squirrel (tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["550468","543265","550472","550469","555668","545564","545560","545556","542629","554599","557615","545549","550470","550431","542630","551376"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["food","piece","dimension","feed","sit","eat","pebble","tail","demeanor","wildlife"]}
