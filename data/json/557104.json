{"path":"557104.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful natural landscape, primarily focusing on tall grasses in the foreground. The grass, exhibiting hues of green and topped with brownish seed heads, stands prominently against a softer, out-of-focus background. \n\nThe background reveals a serene setting of an open field with more scattered grasses somewhat blurred, enhancing the depth of field and directing the viewer's focus to the foreground. Beyond the immediate field, there are hints of lush green trees under a clear, bright blue sky. \n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, as the lighting appears soft and warm, which accentuates the natural tones of the grass and gives the whole scene a calm and tranquil atmosphere. The composition effectively uses natural elements to create a soothing, pastoral scene, likely to evoke feelings of peace and the simplicity of nature.","title":"Example of one specie of tall grass, big bluestem, making a comeback in overgrazed pasture near Troy, Kansas, in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state. Conservationists say this area is unique because it contains the only hardwood forest in Kansas in addition to tallgrass prairie.","placename":"Troy (Kan.)","location":"Troy, Kansas","nn1":["557191","545069","546154","551370","557559","544884","552312","557111","549251","557190","556990","549146","557098","549232","549229","555567"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","field","seed","peace","simplicity","feeling","head","focus","green","lighting"]}
