{"path":"551907.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents a busy and extensive construction site, seemingly in an urban area. In the foreground, multiple trams, characterized by their streamlined shapes and red-and-white coloring, are parked or stationary on a set of tram tracks that provide a lead-through line across the composition. The roof of one tram is clearly visible, featuring vent-like structures.\n\nBeyond the trams, the construction site is filled with various materials, equipment, and debris, indicating heavy ongoing work. There are scattered wooden planks, metallic rods, and framework structures. Multiple cranes, one prominently visible on the right, tower over the site, suggesting the scale and intensity of the construction activity.\n\nIn the background, damaged or partially demolished urban buildings frame the scene, adding a sense of dense, industrial atmosphere. There is noticeable architectural diversity in the building styles, from more modern, blocky structures to older, ornate designs, suggesting a mix of different eras.\n\nAbove the site opens a clear, blue sky that contrasts with the industrious, somewhat chaotic activity below. This photograph captures a moment of transformation within an urban space, emphasizing the blend of transportation infrastructure and large-scale urban redevelopment.","title":"Construction of a subway is a major part of Vienna's plan to reduce, by 95%, surface traffic in the city's cultural and commercial center.  \"temporary\" trolleys run through subway construction area around karlskirche, a cathedral","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551906","549913","551908","551909","553886","556852","548479","551966","549664","550274","549665","549912","551877","547235","546701","555742"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["tram","site","construction","transformation","coloring","vent","stationary","designs","scale","intensity"]}
