{"path":"550808.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph is a serene, detailed depiction of a water lily pond. The image focuses on the surface of the water, densely populated with water lilies. Most of the lily pads outline the surface in various shades of greens and purples, reflecting sunlight which gives them a slightly shimmering appearance. In the middle of the frame, a single vibrant pink water lily flower stands prominently, surrounded by the floating lily pads. \n\nThe water itself is dark, suggesting depth and adding a rich contrast to the lighter tones of the lily pads and the vividness of the flower. The background of the image, out of focus and overshadowed by the lily pads, appears dark and indistinct, enabling the viewer's focus to remain on the water lilies and the interplay of light on water.\n\nReflections on the water add a texture of light and small, sparkling flecks, hinting at the gentle movements on the pond's surface caused perhaps by a breeze or subtle water currents. Overall, the photograph conveys a tranquil and picturesque aspect of nature, highlighting the delicate balance of flora in a water ecosystem.","title":"Water lilies on the Wisconsin river at merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550809","543598","544592","555080","544474","554584","558095","545387","544588","554583","543561","550775","551352","550784","547639","555044"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pad","water","pond","enable","fleck","overshadow","flower","surface","breeze"]}
