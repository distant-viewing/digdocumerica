{"path":"556430.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph presents an industrial scene dominated by heavy machinery and equipment, likely related to coal mining or processing. The focal point is a large yellow wheel loader, positioned on the left side of the frame. The loader is equipped with a heavy-duty arm, used for lifting and transporting materials, currently moving a large bucket filled with coal into an open-top hopper car.\n\nThe hopper car, bearing the label \"N&W 76589,\" is situated on railway tracks and appears designed for bulk transport, likely of the coal being moved by the loader. We can see another similar hopper car to the right of the frame, indicating a line-up suggesting ongoing loading operations.\n\nIn the background, a series of hills or low mountains add a natural backdrop, densely wooded and fading into the distance, providing a contrast to the industrial foreground. This geographic setting suggests the location might be in a region typical of mining operations, possibly in an Appalachian area given the terrain type.\n\nAt the far right and center, there are additional industrial equipment and structures: more railway tracks, another loader or similar machinery, and several utility poles and other structures possibly used for sorting or storing materials. The trees around the area are in bloom, suggesting that the season is either spring or early summer.\n\nThe scene is busy but organized, reflecting a typical day of operations in an industrial or mining environment. There are no visible people in the photograph, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the equipment and operation depicted.","title":"Coal loader near Chattaroy in the southwestern part of West Virginia, near Williamson.
