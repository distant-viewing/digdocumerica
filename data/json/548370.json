{"path":"548370.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph features a gritty urban scene focused on several large golden-tan plastic garbage bags that are tightly sealed and piled together on a grey, stained sidewalk. On the left of the image, there's a large cardboard box, partly crushed and laying on its side. Attached to one of the bags on the right side of the frame, there appears to be a rudimentary drawing or silhouette of a wheelbarrow cut from white material, which could be another plastic bag.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured by the garbage, is a commercial window display which seems to be part of a restaurant or food-related business. Visible in the window is an advertisement for \"The Blimpie Burger,\" priced at 99 cents, featuring the image of a hamburger. The tagline below reads \"Made for each other.\" To the left, the window displays slogans promoting beef and a character resembling a cow.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests urban neglect or decay, emphasizing themes like waste, consumption, and perhaps a critique of commerce or fast food culture. The window and the garbage interact visually and thematically, creating a contrast between commerce and waste products.","title":"Outside a restaurant in harlem","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549840","549833","545494","545506","549839","548214","547878","545502","544831","547827","549752","549746","549820","543825","556640","556158"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","bag","commerce","food","window","waste","seal","consumption","drawing","tan"]}
