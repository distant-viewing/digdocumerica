{"path":"548739.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a ground view of a coastal or dune environment covered with dense vegetation. Much of the ground is obscured by a thick mat of low-growing plants. The plants have succulent-like appearances, characterized by plump, reddish-brown stems and green leaves, suggesting they are adapted to dry, sandy conditions possibly to conserve water.\n\nThe substrate appears to be sandy and white, indicative of a beach or sand dune ecosystem. There are no significant landmarks, animals, or people visible in the image, focusing attention solely on the botanical aspects and the ground's texture.\n\nThe composition is naturalistic, with an abundance of intertwining plant stems creating a somewhat chaotic yet organic pattern across the frame. The image has a gritty texture, likely due to the sandy ground, and the color palette is dominated by earth tones with variations of green, brown, and hints of yellow in the plant parts. The lighting appears natural, possibly sunlight, enhancing the textures and colors of the plants and sand.","title":"Tangled branches of mangrove at Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key half of the land area of this small island has been cleared to make room for one of the \"travel-trailer\" camps now proliferating on the Keys.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["543192","543188","552428","544886","544879","543201","555019","555029","545579","545724","552434","555886","555093","550459","543196","547015"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["plant","dune","stem","sand","ground","mat","texture","abundance","adapt","intertwine"]}
