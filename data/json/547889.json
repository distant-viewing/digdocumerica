{"path":"547889.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene featuring a large, cylindrical structure, which appears to be a storage silo or a gas holder. The structure is multi-tiered with several horizontal layers and is constructed of metal with a ribbed design that gives it a textured appearance. The building is remarkably tall, towering over the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe silo is set beside a body of water, possibly a river or a canal, reflecting the structure partially on its surface, which adds a tranquil element to the otherwise stark industrial setting. In the foreground, there's a patch of rough, muddy ground covered with sparse vegetation, including some small plants and grass patches, indicating a somewhat neglected or undeveloped industrial area.\n\nThe background behind the structure features a slightly cloudy blue sky, and there are some faint outlines of other industrial buildings or equipment, though these are not detailed enough to discern their purpose or design. This setting lacks human presence, focusing entirely on the industrial architecture and its interaction with the natural surroundings. The overall mood evokes a sense of quiet industrial decay or solitude.","title":"Oil storage tank in the Gravesend Bay area of Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556390","546752","545992","547969","551998","543258","542975","545273","542591","544179","542705","542587","556402","545912","542997","545998"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["silo","holder","canal","structure","design","gas","patch","outline","decay","purpose"]}
