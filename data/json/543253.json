{"path":"543253.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic seaside scene. In the foreground, you see a sandy beach wet from the ocean waves, with the foam and bubbles indicative of the tide's movements. The focal point is a large, dark boulder positioned at the center of the image, around which the ocean waves are crashing dramatically. \n\nThe waves are captured in the act of breaking against and over the rock, with white, foamy water splashing upward and around it, creating a lively interaction between the sea and the stone. The background shows the open ocean extending to the horizon under a clear blue sky, indicating it might be a sunny day. This backdrop contributes to a strong natural light that enhances the vivid contrast between the dark tones of the rock and the bright white of the splashing waves. The overall impression is one of nature's vitality and the enduring calm of the sea against transient moments of motion.","title":"California--Garrapata Beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547609","543019","543251","543250","543092","543309","545122","543308","543295","547486","554087","543139","543289","554088","543055","545086"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["wave","ocean","splash","vitality","sea","bubble","seaside","tide","crash","endure"]}
