{"path":"548389.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a busy toll plaza and its adjacent multilane highways. The toll plaza features a series of toll booths lined in a row, forming a barrier across the width of the highway. Each booth appears to be occupied with vehicles, suggesting a moment of peak traffic or congestion.\n\nThe highways on either side of the toll plaza are filled with vehicles, characterized by various colors and sizes, indicating diverse types of road users. The density of vehicles decreases slightly as the roads extend away from the toll area, although they remain heavily trafficked.\n\nSurrounding the toll plaza and roads are areas of dense greenery, suggesting the presence of trees and possibly a park or natural preserve nearby. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the highways, the rest of the area is not visible, indicating the primary focus of the image on the transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe composition of the photograph emphasizes the scale and complexity of traffic management in metropolitan areas, highlighting how toll plazas function as crucial nodes in road networks, managing the flow of vehicles and likely contributing to significant traffic patterns. The perspective offered suggests that the image was taken either from a high vantage point or from an aircraft, giving a comprehensive view of the traffic dynamics and infrastructure layout.","title":"Entrance to the tappan zee bridge","placename":"White Plains (N.Y.)","location":"White Plains, New York","nn1":["548338","548341","547780","546686","544642","547770","552709","548401","546734","548332","546721","546713","546714","552719","550282","546709"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["plaza","highway","traffic","vehicle","road","decrease","booth","congestion","dynamics","infrastructure"]}
