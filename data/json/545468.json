{"path":"545468.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph displays a single, large industrial smokestack emitting a voluminous plume of thick, billowing smoke. The smoke appears dense and textured, almost cloud-like, swirling as it rises into the air. The sky in the background contrasts with the smoke, showing patches of blue and light clouds, suggesting it might be a relatively clear day aside from the pollution emitted by the smokestack.\n\nThe smokestack itself is a tall, cylindrical column, colored a dark grey with visible signs of wear and age. It stands stark against the lighter sky, dominating the frame visually with its industrial presence. There is no other industrial apparatus or machinery visible in the immediate vicinity of the smokestack, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the emission of smoke. The composition of the photograph centers on the environmental impact of industries, captured by framing the smoke plume vividly against the sky, evoking a sense of scale and concern about air pollution.","title":"U.S. Steel operates two plants in Birmingham, at Fairfield and at Ensley.
