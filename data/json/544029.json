{"path":"544029.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This is a photograph of a person sailing a small boat on a body of water. The boat appears to be a compact, single-handed sailing dinghy, with yellow hulls and green and white striped sails. The sail has roughly ten alternating green and white horizontal stripes and is triangular in shape, prominently displayed and billowing with the wind.\n\nThe person, who is seen managing the boat, wearing a dark swim trunks without a top, seems to be intently focused on navigating. His posture and position on the boat indicate active engagement with sailing, as he leans slightly to balance the boat against the force of the wind on the sails.\n\nThe surrounding environment features a calm, expansive lake with a serene water surface, reflecting some of the sunlight. In the background, a gentle hill with sparse vegetation can be observed under a clear blue sky. The setting suggests a peaceful, natural outdoors area likely favorable for such water sports.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a moment of leisure and sport, emphasizing both the calmness of the environment and the active involvement of the sailor with his small yet vibrant sailboat.","title":"Lake Pleasant","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["543953","543937","548521","543941","549421","548532","548062","548508","548514","552345","547273","549425","549409","549405","549386","548517"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","boat","sailing","sport","wind","sailor","swim","involvement","calmness","person"]}
