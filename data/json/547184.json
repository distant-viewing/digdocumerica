{"path":"547184.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a quaint, seemingly rural diner or cafe during what appears to be the daytime, as natural light streams in through the windows. The focus is on a group of elderly patrons engaged in a meal or conversation around several tables.\n\nOn the left, there is an elder woman with curly gray hair, seated alone facing towards a counter or other seating area. She is dressed in a winter jacket, suggesting it might be cold outside. Nearby, there’s an open-front refrigerated display case, possibly for desserts or cold drinks.\n\nIn the center and right part of the image, a group of people are seated together at a table. Their backs are to the camera, obscuring detailed views of their faces, but they appear to be engaged in conversation. The table is equipped with typical diner amenities—napkins, sugar dispensers, and menus, which add to the authenticity of the diner setting.\n\nThe surroundings are modest with utilitarian decoration. The ceiling has simple, square tiles, and a fluorescent light fixture provides additional illumination from above. The walls are lightly colored, and there is a menu board visible in the background, indicating various offerings of the diner.\n\nAtmospherically, the setting is somewhat retro, evoking a sense of a small community gathering spot. The indoor lighting, combined with the daylight, creates a serene and timeless ambiance, evoking a sense of everyday life and the social habits of the depicted group.","title":"A restaurant in Pentwater","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["554866","547779","556843","554265","547789","552626","557152","548625","547760","545984","552625","550679","557795","552622","552621","548439"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["diner","menu","table","group","dispenser","case","patron","conversation","authenticity","offering"]}
