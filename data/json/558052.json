{"path":"558052.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a vast expanse of lush, dense forest as seen from a high vantage point. The forest predominantly covers the foreground and extends into the midground of the image. The canopy appears thick with various shades of green, suggesting rich biodiversity and a healthy ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, the natural scene transitions to a glimpse of urban environment, visible through a haze that slightly mutes the colors. A cluster of large, white buildings stands prominently amidst the greenery, suggesting a boundary where the forest meets a developed area. These buildings likely represent residential apartments or a commercial complex, and their uniform height and structure create a marked contrast to the uneven and organic forms of the trees.\n\nOn the far right side of the background, there is also an isolated structure, possibly a water tower, which is a common sight near suburbs or small towns.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the juxtaposition between nature and human habitation, illustrating how the two environments exist side by side, yet distinctly apart. The view is expansive and provides a sense of calm and isolation, despite the presence of urban elements in the distance.","title":"View of the coliseum as seen from a lookout point at the Virginia Kendall Park which is a part of the Akron, Ohio metropolitan park system. The park is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The law calls for expenditure of $34.5 million for land acquisition, but it must be appropriated by Congress.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557003","556955","556937","556916","550643","545488","553567","555109","553594","556907","546947","545001","556915","557107","556938","556920"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","suburb","biodiversity","sight","apartment","habitation","calm","midground","boundary","vantage"]}
