{"path":"551009.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial landscape, dominated by a factory with visible emissions. In the foreground is a body of water with a muddy, rocky shore. A prominent feature in this area is a larger cylindrical tank, positioned horizontally on a support structure above the water, and a small construction with a ladder leading down to what appears to be a drainage or outflow pipe directly into the water.\n\nIn the middle of the image, behind this setup, are multiple industrial structures including a building with several noticeable pipes and vents. Rising above everything are four tall chimneys emitting dark smoke, suggesting heavy industrial activity, possibly from a power plant or manufacturing facility. The sky is overcast, enhancing the gritty, industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is framed by a hill covered with dense trees, offering a stark contrast to the industrial foreground. Overall, the image captures an impactful view of environmental, industrial, and possibly ecological themes.","title":"Monsanto chemical company smokestacks seen from the kanawha river at Nitro","placename":"Charleston (W.
