{"path":"548878.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a traditional cattle drive on a dusty rural road. In the foreground, numerous cattle are predominantly facing the camera as they move along the road, whose dry dirt surface is contributing to a haze of dust partially obscuring the distant view. One rider on horseback is prominently visible, guiding the herd. This rider is wearing stereotypical cowboy attire including a wide-brimmed hat and a checked shirt.\n\nThe setting appears to be a flat, open plain with a sparse, flat horizon and clear skies, which suggests a vast, rural area typical of regions used for extensive cattle ranching. The lighting in the photo indicates it could be late afternoon, which gives a soft golden tint to the scene, enhancing the dust's visual impact.\n\nThis image captures an essence of ranch life and livestock management, emphasizing themes of rural work and the expansive outdoors. The elements in the photo—dust, cattle, horse, and rider—combine to convey a sense of motion and the scale of operation in cattle drives.","title":"Moving cattle along a highway","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548830","548829","548828","549033","553104","548838","552698","552565","543776","553105","553100","543634","554128","553814","553110","548954"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cattle","rider","dust","ranching","drive","herd","horseback","ranch","tint","cowboy"]}
