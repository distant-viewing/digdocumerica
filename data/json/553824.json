{"path":"553824.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This is a photograph of an abandoned, dilapidated Victorian-style building captured under daylight, suggesting urban decay. The structure is two-storied, constructed with bricks, and showcases distinctive architectural features such as rounded bay windows and detailed cornices. Many of the building's windows are open or broken, adding to the neglected ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, a young boy is seen walking on the left side of the street. He is wearing casual attire and appears to be in mid-stride, possibly playing or walking briskly across the scene. On the right side of the image, an adult male stands on a raised area next to the building, seemingly posing or looking towards the photographer. His presence on the building's elevated base contrasts with the boy's position at street level.\n\nThe overall setting appears urban with untended grass and debris around the building, indicating a lack of maintenance. The atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of neglect and decline, typical of certain urban landscapes transitioning through socio-economic changes.","title":"37th and Prairie streets.
