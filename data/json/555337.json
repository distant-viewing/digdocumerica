{"path":"555337.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a tomato plant bearing several tomatoes at different stages of ripening. The tomatoes are clustered together, with one tomato showing a vivid red hue, suggesting it is fully ripe. Adjacent to it are several other tomatoes which are still green or in a transitional state turning from green to orange, indicating they are not yet ripe.\n\nSurrounding the tomatoes, there are lush green leaves with prominent veins and variable shades of green, providing a dense backdrop that highlights the tomatoes. The leaves appear thick and slightly wrinkled with a few facing the sunlight, casting subtle shadows within the foliage.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph comes from a natural source, likely sunlight, which illuminates the scene softly, creating a play of light and shadow that adds depth and texture to the image. Looking into the background, it fades into a blurred mixture of more greenery, suggesting that the plant is part of a larger bush or garden setting.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the natural beauty of the tomatoes in their growing state, showcasing the lifecycle of fruit from unripe to ripe through natural color progression. The image captures the essence of growth and ripeness in a garden environment.","title":"Tomatoes being raised in the solar greenhouse of the university of Arizona's laboratory near Tucson.
