{"path":"555247.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a workplace scene involving three men seated around a cluttered office table. The man pictured from behind is engaged in reading or showing a document to his colleague, who is facing the camera directly, he has a focused expression and a serious demeanor. The third man, sitting next to him, appears relaxed and is passively listening or observing the interaction. \n\nDetails of the room suggest itâ€™s an office or a meeting room: the table is cluttered with various items including a tape dispenser, papers, coasters, a cigarette ashtray filled with cigarette butts, and a drinking glass. There are personal items like wallets and keys visible as well. There is also a bag from \"Value Village\" containing items that can't be clearly distinguished, and a cupboard in the background hints at a typical office environment. The style of clothing, furniture, and other items suggests that the setting could be dated around the 1970s or '80s based on the fashion and office equipment style. The overall atmosphere is that of a serious business conversation or meeting, possibly involving planning or evaluation.","title":"An environmental protection agency pesticides inspector hands a receipt for samples taken during a routine inspection to an official of the valley chemical company (foreground), greenville Mississippi, the third man is an epa inspector in training","placename":"Mississippi","location":"Mississippi","nn1":["555234","555233","547368","552616","548237","552388","557037","546299","547407","552617","556668","556383","556028","557856","552392","552390"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["office","item","meeting","cigarette","room","table","drinking","dispenser","80s","colleague"]}
