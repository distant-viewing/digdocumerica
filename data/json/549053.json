{"path":"549053.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, the primary focus is a large, circular industrial valve positioned in the foreground, dominating the upper half of the image. The valve has a metallic rust and wear, signaling age and frequent use. The wheel of the valve is connected to a central, vertical threaded shaft that appears to be a part of a mechanism for controlling water flow, typical of gates or sluices. This mechanism is part of a larger framework, visible only minimally, which creates a symmetrical square framing within the image itself.\n\nThe view through the center of this geometric frame shows a flat, calm body of water, likely a river or canal, reflecting a bright, clear sky. On the far edge of the water body, a small embankment is visible. Positioned centrally on this horizon line is a person clothed in bright attire, likely engaged in a task at the water's edge. The simplicity and stillness of the water creates a stark contrast to the industrial, structured nature of the valve in the foreground.\n\nThe setting appears remote, given the lack of any other human activity or structures in the visible surrounding area, suggesting a location primarily functional or utilitarian, possibly part of a water management or agricultural system. The overall lighting implies the photo was taken during daylight hours under a clear sky, enhancing the visibility and the reflective quality of the water.","title":"Irrigation canal near Parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["547578","549063","549078","543810","549056","547037","543795","549064","547948","546067","556944","558016","552928","546829","551532","546907"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["valve","mechanism","water","shaft","embankment","gate","canal","half","part","framing"]}
