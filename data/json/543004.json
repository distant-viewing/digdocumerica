{"path":"543004.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a night-time scene of an industrial setting. In the background, there are large structures with silhouetted profiles accentuated against a dark sky, likely industrial buildings or part of a factory setup. One tall chimney stands prominently, emitting a steady stream of smoke or steam that blends into the dark sky. Visible lights, some possibly from working areas or street lamps, dot the scene, suggesting ongoing activities despite the night setting.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water that appears smooth, possibly a river or lake, reflecting some of the dim light and colors from the factory above. A series of old, broken wooden posts stretches across the water, leading from the bottom left towards the center of the image. These posts, sticking out of the water, create a striking linear perspective that draws the viewerâ€™s eye towards the industrial backdrop.\n\nOverall, the composition and the subdued color palette suggest a quiet yet ongoing industrial operation, captured from a distance to include both the water body in the foreground and the industrial buildings in the background. The photograph has a hauntingly calm yet somewhat somber tone, emphasizing themes of industry and nature.","title":"Heron in Humboldt Bay outlet, Georgia Pacific lumber mill in background.","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["546118","547702","552188","557376","551140","557220","550819","552194","547084","547667","552210","552179","557381","546864","550820","545996"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["night","post","factory","water","profile","lamp","stream","steam","chimney","industry"]}
