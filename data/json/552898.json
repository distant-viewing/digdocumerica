{"path":"552898.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a birdâ€™s eye view of an expansive outdoor scene, likely taken from a high vantage point. The landscape features a large campsite area bustling with activity, where numerous people appear to be engaged in various recreational outdoor activities such as setting up tents, cooking, or resting.\n\nThe campsite is spread out and dotted with colorful tents, small groups of people, and camping gear. In the foreground, the terrain is rugged with several large boulders, adding a natural, rocky character to the scene. The ground around the campsite appears to be relatively flat and consists of dirt and sparse vegetation, which suggests a possibly arid or semi-arid environment.\n\nA particularly striking feature of the image is the large shadows cast by the cliffs or mountains nearby, indicating that the photo was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when shadows are typically elongated. The background stretches out into plains or flat areas that show vehicle tracks, which could indicate accessibility or previous usage of the area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, combined with the vibrant colors and the sunlight casting dramatic shadows, creates a lively yet peaceful representation of an outdoor group camping adventure.","title":"Stone fireplace on the east shore of Pyramid Lake, a favored place for primitive camping","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["554515","554480","545780","545698","549450","548796","545782","544855","554181","557514","545776","553133","545160","545601","543599","554464"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["campsite","tent","camping","cooking","plain","accessibility","shadow","representation","usage","group"]}
