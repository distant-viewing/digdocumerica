{"path":"547251.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene in a park-like environment. The focus of the image is on a concrete structure, a small arched bridge or culvert over a body of muddy water, likely a creek or small river. On the edge of this concrete bridge, an individual is sitting, dressed in dark casual attire, and seems to be looking at the water or possibly engaging in a solitary activity like fishing or simply enjoying the peaceful surroundings.\n\nIn the background, there are various signs of a bustling urban park setting. There is lush green grass and several blooming flowers, signaling springtime. Leaf-bare trees suggest that the season is just beginning to turn. Beyond the park area, a busy street is visible with cars in motion, suggesting the proximity of this tranquil spot to city life. A cyclist can be also seen on the pathway that borders the street, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph creates a contrast between the serenity of the natural environment in the foreground and the busy urban life in the background. The natural light appears soft, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon. The general atmosphere is peaceful, with human presence minimal and mostly engaged in leisure activities, underscoring a sense of escape or relaxation within an urban context.","title":"Raw sewage flows into the potomac at georgetown gap.
