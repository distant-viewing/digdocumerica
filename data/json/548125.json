{"path":"548125.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy industrial maritime setting, possibly within a shipyard or a commercial dock. The central focus is a large cargo ship named \"Silver Light,\" which is docked and involves some on-deck activity. Its hull is painted black with the ship's name in white letters on the side. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a bustling scene involving several individuals who appear to be workers. They are positioned on what looks like a raft or a makeshift floating platform densely packed with what could be barrels or bags, perhaps part of the cargo operations. These workers are wearing helmets, suggesting that they are engaged in a manual and possibly hazardous task. They seem to be either loading or unloading these materials, or possibly securing the cargo.\n\nThe background features cranes and other maritime machinery, indicative of heavy lifting and transportation tasks typically associated with such environments. There are additional workers visible on the ship; some can be seen standing or moving about the deck area, suggesting ongoing operations. \n\nThe overall atmosphere is industrious, with elements such as the visible safety gear, industrial machinery, and cargo indicating a scene of active maritime commerce. The lighting and color tone, dominated by shades of blue and grey, convey a hard-working industrial setting.","title":"Freighters at the Columbia River mouth about to take on a cargo of logs for export to japan","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["552149","555797","546016","552303","548127","552148","547474","545147","546934","546881","546860","550910","546917","546762","550918","555270"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["cargo","ship","worker","name","involve","dock","shipyard","lifting","unload","machinery"]}
