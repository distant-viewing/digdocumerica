{"path":"549562.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, powerful waterfall with substantial amounts of water cascading over a rocky ledge. The waterfall forms a wide, white curtain of water that crashes into a river below, creating a misty spray. The river in front of the waterfall has a rough, choppy surface indicating strong currents.\n\nAt the top left of the image, on a bank adjacent to the waterfall, there is a crowd of people. They are gathered behind metal railings, observing and perhaps photographing the scene. Some individuals are visible standing closer to the waterfall edge on a rocky outcrop, offering them a closer view. Alongside the river, there is a small, single-story building, possibly serving as a visitor center or a facility related to the site.\n\nThe background features a green landscape with trees and a distant bridge spanning the river. This adds a natural frame to the waterfall and the gathering area. The entire scene conveys a lively atmosphere of outdoor engagement where people come to admire the natural beauty of the waterfall.","title":"American Niagara Falls and Prospect Park seen from Goat Island at the brink of the cataract","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549467","549557","548021","549563","549535","549629","549466","549534","550738","549545","550697","549560","553386","549536","549546","542699"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","river","ledge","outcrop","spray","current","curtain","amount","crowd","visitor"]}
