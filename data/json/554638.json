{"path":"554638.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic landscape primarily composed of dense forest and mountains under a moody, overcast sky. The foreground consists of a variety of trees, including evergreens and trees with foliage that suggest autumn, showcasing hues of gold and dark green. The middle portion presents more dense forestry, gradually rising up to form the base of a mountain range in the background. Dominating the horizon are multiple mountain peaks, their lines softly blending into a cloudy sky filled with varying shades of blue and gray. The lighting suggests either dawn or dusk, creating a somber yet serene feel to the scene. It visually represents a peaceful yet vibrant wilderness, typical of mountainous regions in the fall season.","title":"Top of the mountains at 4,000 feet are bare of leaves in october while trembling Aspen are still yellow at 2,000 feet in the Wilderness mountain area south of blue ridge road","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554642","548025","550478","550602","554761","554639","550604","555130","543582","554634","554637","554647","542923","552695","543569","550521"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["evergreens","forestry","mountain","mountains","moody","represent","autumn","varying","dawn","cloudy"]}
