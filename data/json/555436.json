{"path":"555436.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a young girl with a joyful expression, riding a bicycle. She has her mouth open in a broad smile and her eyes squinting slightly, which suggests she is in a moment of delight. Her dark hair is pulled back off her face into two small side buns, emphasizing her cheerful facial features.\n\nShe is wearing a white T-shirt that features a colorful graphic design and the text \"JOIN THE ENERGY CORPS\" along with an illustrated character resembling a Native American motif, incorporating a feathered headdress and holding a torch. The design on the shirt uses vibrant colors including yellow, red, green, and black.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused but hints at a residential setting with portions of houses and possibly a brick structure. The lighting appears to be natural, suggestive of an outdoor setting in a community or home environment.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of lightheartedness and youthful energy, centered around an outdoor activity that is enjoyable to many children.","title":"It seems people don't consider something as a crisis or national issue until it is reproduced on a tee shirt.
