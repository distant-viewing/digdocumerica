{"path":"548059.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a serene river scene dominated by the activity of log towing. In the center of the image, a small, green tugboat is making its way through the water, pulling a large raft of logs. These logs are loosely organized, floating en masse, covering much of the river's surface visible in the foreground. The water appears calm, reflecting a light grayish-blue tone, suggesting a bright, clear day.\n\nThe tugboat, with a noticeable structure including a cabin and a chimney emitting no visible smoke, seems to be in motion as indicated by the small ripples and waves forming around its body. It's painted predominantly green, providing a stark contrast to the natural brown and wet sheen of the logs it tows.\n\nIn the background, a thick line of trees borders the river, stretching across the image. These trees provide a dense canopy, appearing lush and providing a rich backdrop of varying shades of green. Beyond the trees, faint outlines of mountains or higher landforms are visible, adding to the depth and layers of the landscape.\n\nThe photograph has a quiet, industrious feel, capturing a moment of regular work within a natural setting. It reflects both human activity and the tranquility of a river landscape. The framing and wide-angle capture of the scene contribute to a sense of expansive activity, emphasizing both the breadth of the river and the scale of the logging operation.","title":"Log boom with tug on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551148","548067","555401","548187","550901","557235","550951","545037","551179","551210","546938","556481","548148","551150","545073","551008"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["log","river","tugboat","breadth","masse","tow","raft","landform","sheen","provide"]}
