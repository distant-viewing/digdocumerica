{"path":"550496.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts two large, sculptural items resembling the neck and head of a mythical creature, set against a dramatic outdoor landscape. The sculptures are elongated and curve towards each other, their open mouths barely visible. Both are identical in appearance and are seemingly made of a smooth material, with a light hue that stands out against the dimly lit surroundings.\n\nThe background reveals a stormy sky filled with an array of clouds ranging in color from dark gray to white, indicating significant cloud movement. This sky spans the majority of the image and sets a somber and mystical tone. Below the sky, a distant line of low mountains or hills can be seen, shrouded partially by the misty weather conditions.\n\nThe landscape around the sculptures appears to be a flat, grassy area, with the immediate ground around the sculptures slightly shadowed, making details difficult to make out. The overall ambiance is moody and evocative, possibly suggesting a scene from a fantasy or a dramatic thematic installation in a natural setting. There is no visible human presence or artificial structures, enhancing the isolated and wild character of the scene.","title":"Half of a partially gnawed, weathered caribou rack near mile 140.
