{"path":"557684.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a busy scene at a parking area or roadside stop. In the background, there is a charming building with a red and brown facade, adorned with decorative white trims and a balcony. This building has a serene, rustic appeal, typical of a countryside setting. Surrounding this establishment are rolling hills covered partially by trees.\n\nProminently in the foreground are several people engaged in different activities, suggesting a moment of pause during their travels. On the left side of the image, a person, facing away from the camera, is dressed in a vertically striped shirt paired with jeans, and is standing near the open trunk of a car, which is packed with various items.\n\nAt the center, there is an older individual leaning into another car's trunk, appearing to either retrieve or store some belongings. This car is tan-colored with a visible license plate, adjacent to which another individual is observing or assisting.\n\nOn the far right, another figure, possibly wearing a cap, is near a white scooter, contributing to the scene's vintage feel.\n\nThe vehicles in the scene include a range of different styles and periods, including a van and a station wagon, indicative of the diversity typically seen in such a communal space. The overall atmosphere is one of a restful break in a journey, with people in casual attire and an informal, relaxed posture.\n\nThis snapshot offers a glimpse into a momentary pause in the travels of these individuals, possibly in a small town or rural area, highlighting a mix of interactions, personal tasks, and the simple architecture of the United States during what could be the 1970s or 1980s based on the vehicle designs and fashion styles.","title":"Jimmy Wilkins, president of Orbit Manufacturing Co (sportswear), stands beside his golf cart which is being repaired by Chief Westmoreland (Bending over cart), the local \"Mr. Fix-It\" in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. \"Chief won't ever send me a bill,\" Wilkins said, \"so once or twice a year I send him a check for $100.\" This is not an unusual way of conducting business between Helen residents.
