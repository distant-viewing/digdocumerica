{"path":"552715.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a cityscape viewed from a vantage point that overlooks a river. The water appears calm, with some areas of light pollution or debris creating ripples and swirls on the surface, indicating possible water contamination.\n\nThe river is bordered by greenery on the near side, with a concrete embankment on the opposite bank, leading up to a dense assortment of buildings. A bridge spans the river, featuring a simple design with a flat roadway supported by piers in the water.\n\nThe city skyline includes a mix of architectural styles with various building heights. Notably, there are a few taller skyscrapers that dominate the view, one of which is notably prominent and partially blocks the view of smaller structures behind it. The overall feel of the city suggests a bustling, urban environment, with the photograph capturing both natural and human-made elements coexisting.\n\nThe lighting in the image, likely taken during daylight, softly illuminates the scene and gives the colors a slightly muted, vintage look, typical of older film photographs. The overall composition balances the natural foreground with the urban background, offering a snapshot of a moment where nature and urban life converge.","title":"The polluted Schuylkill River and Center City in background","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546706","548416","548407","546669","545913","546865","548317","548390","551188","548347","550214","548334","548339","550729","547263","557273"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["river","contamination","swirl","embankment","city","assortment","film","skyscraper","roadway","pier"]}
