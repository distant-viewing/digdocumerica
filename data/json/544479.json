{"path":"544479.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a detailed close-up view of a butterfly perched on a flower. The butterfly, primarily grey in color with intricate white and brown patterns on its wings, exhibits an elegant pose with its wings slightly open. It has long, delicate antennae and a segmented body visible, reflecting characteristic features of its species.\n\nThe butterfly is atop a small white flower with a cluster of yellow-orange centers, typical of wildflower species. The flower is attached to a slender, green stem with a couple of other buds and blooms visible, suggesting it may be part of a larger plant.\n\nThe background is softly blurred with tones of green and light hints of other foliage, suggesting that the setting is outdoors in a natural habitat, likely a meadow or a field. The focus is on the butterfly and the flower, highlighted by natural lighting that enhances the vividness of the colors and the intricate details of the butterfly's patterns.\n\nThis composition beautifully captures the interaction of an insect with its environment, emphasizing themes of nature, wildlife, and delicate ecological interactions.","title":"Butterfly and wildflowers","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544619","544517","544553","543603","544618","544514","547818","551381","544566","544614","554839","544603","548284","544590","548283","554842"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","specie","antennae","insect","bud","meadow","stem","bloom"]}
