{"path":"553554.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a child peering out from behind a screen window. The child's face, partially visible, is framed by the dark interior of a room and the edges of the worn window frame. The screen on the window is slightly damaged and tattered, which adds a textural element to the image. The expression on the child's face appears to be one of curiosity or attentiveness. The child has dark hair and seems to be looking directly at the camera.\n\nThe window frame is visibly old and weathered, with peeling paint and signs of wear, which suggests the picture might have been taken in an aged or possibly neglected building. The color tones of the photograph are somewhat muted, dominated by darks and dull grays, enhancing the moody atmosphere of the scene. This simple yet evocative composition focuses on the subject's gaze and the texture of the materials, creating a poignant moment that hints at themes of isolation or introspection.","title":"Mulky square child looks out of screen door on a rainy day his family occupies part of a building that will soon be razed to make way for a new interstate highway (i-635).
