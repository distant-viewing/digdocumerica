{"path":"544311.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly woman, featuring prominently in the foreground, gazing directly towards the camera. She is wearing large, round glasses with black frames and a light blue headscarf that covers her hair entirely. Her shirt is floral with multiple colors (orange, yellow, white) on a light background.\n\nIn the background, one can discern a market setup with what appears to be fruits (peaches, oranges) arranged in baskets. The baskets are placed on tables or stands, suggesting this might be an outdoor market stand. The light is subdued, suggesting either an evening time or overcast weather. The composition offers a sense of candidness and immediacy, bringing the viewer into a close, almost intimate proximity with the woman, while still capturing a sense of her surroundings.","title":"Selling produce","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["557129","554051","556594","557177","551439","555530","547379","556414","557039","558319","556498","556151","551822","554798","554945","553499"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["basket","market","immediacy","fruit","headscarf","discern","bring","woman","proximity","gaze"]}
