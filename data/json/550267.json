{"path":"550267.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an overhead view of a large concrete-lined flood control channel, commonly found in urban settings. In the foreground, a bridge spans across the channel, with part of the bridge railing visible. Below the bridge, on the channel floor, two individuals are seen walking, giving a sense of scale to the expansive cement-laden surfaces.\n\nThe channel runs along the width of the image, appearing mostly dry with some areas of water and debris scattered throughout. On the left side of the channel, several vehicles and pieces of construction equipment such as bulldozers are parked, suggesting ongoing maintenance or construction activity.\n\nVegetation surrounds the channel, with prominent green trees in the lower left corner of the frame, adding a touch of nature to the predominantly gray and industrial scene. Beyond the channel, the environment transitions into a dusky, grassy area, which further extends to what looks like a dusty road or a dry river bed at the very top of the image.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a juxtaposition of natural elements with human-made structures, highlighting the engineering efforts for flood control within a metropolitan area.","title":"Unfinished Interstate 90, looking east from West 14th Street.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546046","546868","552813","547948","544674","547890","549469","558007","548928","552022","549304","551423","558008","550214","555550","542510"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["channel","flood","bridge","control","cement","construction","width","bulldozer","engineering","bed"]}
