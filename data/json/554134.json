{"path":"554134.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, somewhat haunting landscape dominated by a narrow wooden boardwalk that recedes into the distance amid a sparse forest. The boardwalk, constructed of weathered wood planks, guides the viewer through a wetland or marsh area, weaving subtly left and right and disappearing into the horizon.\n\nOn either side of the boardwalk, the landscape features low vegetation, which looks lush and slightly overgrown, contrasting with the stark dead trees that emerge dramatically from the ground. These trees are leafless, with thin, twisted branches that stretch up into the sky, giving an eerie, desolate feel to the scene.\n\nThe sky is overcast, with a diffuse light that saturates the entire scene with a soft, cool tone. The absence of people and animals in the photograph reinforces a feeling of solitude and quietness, focusing attention on the interplay of natural elements. The overall atmosphere is one of calm yet poignant natural beauty, evoking a sense of contemplation and perhaps a touch of melancholy.","title":"\"devastation trail\" is the name given to this boardwalk through skeletons of trees desTroyed by the 1959 volcanic eruption in Hawaii volcanoes national park","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554135","554717","550345","554136","550788","544241","546066","557018","553579","544632","555215","550789","553578","555002","545213","543621"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boardwalk","haunt","quietness","weathered","disappear","saturate","marsh","recede","weave","emerge"]}
