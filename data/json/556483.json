{"path":"556483.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a smiling elderly African American man with a salt-and-pepper colored beard, posing to the side of the frame. He has a warm and gentle expression, illuminating a sense of joy or fond memory. He wears a dark jacket over a black shirt, and the focus on his face suggests a close and personal portrait style.\n\nBehind him, a prominent element in the composition is a framed photograph hanging on a red wooden wall. The photograph within the photograph shows a uniformed man (possibly military) and a woman, both looking directly at the camera with serious expressions. The oval frame of the photo is ornate, providing a contrast against the rustic, deep red wall which has signs of wear and tear, including visible cracks and paint that seems slightly weathered.\n\nThe lighting in the image focuses softly on the elderly manâ€™s face, subtly highlighting the texture of his skin and his facial features while casting shadows that add depth to his expression. The contrasting themes of personal history, memory, and the passage of time are all subtly interwoven in the setup and mood of this image.","title":"Harvey thaxton, 64, lives with his mother in Rhodell, West Virginia (see picture #14030), near Beckley.
