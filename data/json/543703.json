{"path":"543703.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial setting, specifically a bottling process. We see three brightly colored red bottles in a row, being held and likely filled or capped by metal machinery. These bottles are being manipulated by precise equipment which grips them from the top, potentially as part of a conveyor system for mass production. \n\nThe lighting in the image accentuates the vivid red color of the liquid inside the bottles, which catches and reflects the light, adding a glassy shine to the scene. The background is dark and blurred, directing the focus purely on the bottles and the mechanisms handling them. This setup indicates a mechanical and automated process typical of a factory environment, focused on efficiency and throughput.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any human figures, highlighting the automated nature of the process and the industrial context in which it takes place. The overall composition conveys a sense of mechanical precision and industrial activity.","title":"New beer bottles on assembly line after being molded from 100% old glass.
