{"path":"544958.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image features an industrial setting with an ominous appearance. In the foreground, a large wooden structure resembling a conical tower stands at the center, emitting a thick plume of dark smoke from its apex. The structure likely functions in some form of industrial processing, possibly a kiln or smokestack. Worn and tattered, the cone is made of wooden slats and supported by external metal beams. It dominates the landscape, giving the scene a dramatic focal point.\n\nThe environment around the structure is bleak; the ground is barren and scattered with debris and patches of dirt, suggesting a heavily used industrial site. Another similar structure, with a metallic surface, is visible in the right background, also connected with pipelines. The background features a range of mountains, hinting at a remote, possibly desolate location.\n\nAbove, the sky is overcast with clouds varying from bright white to dark gray, which might indicate either an approaching storm or lingering pollution from the siteâ€™s activities. This atmospheric condition contributes to the overall grim and gritty feel of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a scene of industrial activity with strong visual impact and possibly environmental implications. The subdued color palette and cloud-covered sky contribute to the somber mood of the image.","title":"\"Teepee\" burner incinerates woodchips and sawdust from the lumbermill.","placename":"Panguitch (Utah)","location":"Panguitch, Utah","nn1":["545447","544966","557220","548157","557374","544777","542975","546760","551026","557373","550172","550328","551054","550982","545239","550939"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["apex","implication","slat","cone","pipeline","site","storm","cloud","structure","function"]}
