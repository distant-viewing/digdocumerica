{"path":"555883.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph portrays a vast, dry landscape with distinct marks of human activity. The foreground features prominent tracks created by vehicles, deeply furrowed into the arid, sandy soil, suggesting frequent movement across this area. The tracks form intricate patterns, leading towards the background.\n\nIn the middle distance, a small, possibly derelict building can be seen, accompanied by what appears to be a tanker truck and another small structure. This setup hints at some form of industrial or agricultural operation, although the specific nature of the activity is not clear from the image alone.\n\nThe background is dominated by a mountain range lying under a broad, hazy sky, which suggests either dust in the air or the onset of dusk. This backdrop adds a sense of isolation and expansive wilderness to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interaction between the rugged natural environment and the signs of human intrusion, underscored by the tracks which draw the viewer's eye across the landscape towards the human-made structures and the natural horizon beyond.","title":"Down to earth view of the five acre pond covered with earth after cleanup operations were complete.  The cleanup resulted in some 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil sludge being removed and treated before disposal at a nearby site.
