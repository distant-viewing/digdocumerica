{"path":"552859.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a nostalgic and candid moment involving two people with contrasting expressions, against the backdrop of what appears to be a weathered structure. On the left side of the image, an older man is leaning out of a window of a white, rough-textured building. He's resting his arms on the window sill and his pose suggests a casual, relaxed demeanor. He is wearing a striped shirt and has a slightly disheveled look with visible facial expressions showing contentment or thoughtfulness.\n\nIn the foreground on the right side, a younger individual, possibly a teenager, is standing with his back partially turned towards the camera. He has dark hair and is dressed in a light yellow or cream-colored button-up shirt over a white shirt. His expression appears contemplative or he seems to be looking intently at something out of frame, giving a sense of distraction or deep thought.\n\nThe background is simple and does not provide much detail about the location, which focuses the viewer's attention more on the interaction—or lack thereof—between the two individuals. The age difference and their expressions might suggest a generational gap or differing viewpoints, adding a layer of storytelling to the image. The photograph balances a sense of intimacy with anonymity, as the context of their interaction is left largely to the viewer’s interpretation.","title":"Oyster fisherman's son aboard boat on Lake Borgne","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["543849","554097","552931","553202","553519","557907","549285","545970","552962","557033","553536","553217","557358","557863","549299","553558"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["expression","anonymity","sill","contentment","difference","interpretation","teenager","distraction","intimacy","shirt"]}
