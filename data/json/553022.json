{"path":"553022.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a striking juxtaposition between industry and consumerism. In the foreground, a vast parking lot densely packed with rows upon rows of new cars in various colors, from red and blue to white and yellow, suggests a dealership or manufacturing site. These cars are neatly arranged, emphasizing their multitude and uniformity.\n\nRising behind this sea of automobiles is an industrial complex. The facility features multiple structures, including towering silos and intricate networks of pipes. The main, central structure appears especially complex, adorned with various tanks, stairways, and platforms. Despite appearing somewhat weathered, the facility is clearly operational, evident from the visible infrastructure and maintenance pathways.\n\nThe scenery is set under an overcast sky, casting a soft, diffuse light that slightly mutes the colors in the scene. No humans are discernible, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention purely on the contrast between manufactured goods ready for consumption and the industrial might used to produce them. The overall composition draws a narrative on manufacturing, distribution, and consumption in a modern economic landscape.","title":"Datsuns on Terminal Island.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
