{"path":"550361.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene focused on rugged, rocky terrain which extends into a calm body of water. To the left, the shoreline is defined by large boulders that create a small cove, with darker, wet rocks visible, suggesting recent contact with water, possibly from tides or waves. The right side of the image consists of more expansive, rough rocks, forming the main foreground and leading the eye towards a significant point of interest in the mid-ground: a traditional lighthouse.\n\nThe lighthouse, painted in a vibrant white and red pattern, stands prominently atop a well-vegetated rise. It is surrounded by dense flora, mainly coniferous trees which suggest a cool, temperate maritime climate. Utility poles next to the lighthouse, barely visible, indicate some human presence and infrastructure. The horizon is faintly visible, a blend of misty sky and distant landforms or water bodies, which adds to the allure and isolation of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition leverages natural light, possibly captured during an overcast day, creating diffused illumination which enhances the colors and textures of the natural landscape. This photograph exudes a quiet, contemplative atmosphere, typical of secluded coastal areas, making it a visually rich and serene depiction of a maritime environment.","title":"Lighthouse on campobello island, looking north toward shipping channel.
