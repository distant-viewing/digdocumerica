{"path":"548349.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view that appears to be from an elevated perspective looking across a body of water, likely a harbor. It prominently features the Statue of Liberty, positioned towards the right side of the image on what seems like a small island. The statue is a distinguishable silhouette against the background, with its raised torch clearly visible.\n\nTo the left of the Statue of Liberty, across the water, there's a view of a cityscape which includes tall buildings or skyscrapers, possibly representing a part of Lower Manhattan. Another notable feature is a smaller island located approximately in the center of the image, possibly Ellis Island, with what looks like a cluster of low-lying buildings on it.\n\nIn the foreground, closer to the viewer, there is a dock or pier on which several boats are moored. The water is calm with minimal ripples, reflecting the overcast sky. The sky itself is filled with thick clouds, suggesting an impending or recent storm, contributing to the overall moody and dramatic tone of the image. The color tone of the photograph is somewhat muted, dominated by blues and grays which enhances the somber feel of the scene.","title":"Statue of Liberty and Manhattan skyline","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548352","553862","548351","555723","549760","555740","554351","548327","549803","555732","547932","554350","548390","549761","552268","552265"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["island","statue","harbor","storm","skyscraper","pier","tone","ripple","gray","cityscape"]}
