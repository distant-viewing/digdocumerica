{"path":"554897.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image captures a lively and casual gathering in a room that suggests a casual, communal atmosphere, likely from the 1970s based on the apparel and hairstyles. The room has wood-paneled walls and a textured ceiling, contributing to a rustic or retro aesthetic. There's a distinctive blue pendant light hanging from the ceiling, emitting a soft glow that adds to the ambiance.\n\nThe photograph shows around ten individuals, both men and women, most of whom are seated on the floor or on simple furniture. They appear relaxed and engaged in conversation or enjoying the moment; some are laughing, while others are more subdued. Their clothing is casual, typical of the 1970s style, with some wearing long hair, reflecting the era's fashion.\n\nIn the background, on a small round table, there are bottles and glasses, suggesting that beverages are being shared among the group. The presence of a woven rug and a wall hanging further emphasizes the informal, cozy setting.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is convivial and spirited, capturing a moment of social interaction and enjoyment among friends. The photograph's somewhat faded and greenish-blue tint lends it a vintage feel, enhancing the time capsule effect of the scene.","title":"Den behind a store which caters to the teenage group in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552646","545496","546025","551320","551278","543041","545985","554866","547794","551267","558223","547358","547371","555290","551279","555906"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["ceiling","room","apparel","1970","round","wall","beverage","tint","friend","hairstyle"]}
