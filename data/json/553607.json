{"path":"553607.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a man leaning against the side of a yellow pickup truck that has its door open. The man appears to be a worker based on his attire: he is wearing a dirty white T-shirt, dark trousers also smeared with dirt, a hard hat, and glasses. His expression is cheerful as he looks off to the side with a smile, suggesting he is engaging in a conversation or observing something out of frame. He holds a black bag and his attire and the setting suggest he might have been involved in some form of manual labor.\n\nThe background shows a partially visible dirt road and dense greenery, indicating that this scene is likely outdoors in a rural or undeveloped area. The truck is parked on a muddy surface, which also contributes to the rugged, outdoor work environment this image portrays. The overall mood appears candid and captures a moment of respite or informal interaction amidst physical labor.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
