{"path":"551978.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large body of water with numerous scattered, dilapidated dock structures that appear abandoned or in disrepair. These old docks and piers, constructed from what seems to be wood and concrete, vary in size and shape, creating a somewhat chaotic appearance on the water's surface. Several of the structures are partially submerged or have significant water damage.\n\nThe scene also shows other maritime elements, including vessels—a few ships and boats—are visible moving around or stationed near the docks. Some smaller buoys or marine markers dot the waterscape.\n\nIn the background, a city skyline can be observed along the horizon, suggesting that this area is in close proximity to an urban center. Prominently visible is a large bridge spanning over a section of the water further in the distance, adding an element of infrastructure and connectivity to the scene.\n\nThe body of water is calm with minimal waves, and the sky above is mostly clear with a hint of haze, implying a tranquil yet somber atmosphere over a seemingly abandoned or under-utilized industrial waterfront. The photo captures an overall mood of desolation and neglect, echoing a past era of bustling maritime activity now faded.","title":"Shutters island, at the mouth of Arthur Kill, is a graveyard for sunken barges and derelict vessels.
