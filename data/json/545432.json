{"path":"545432.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a multi-lane highway during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the warm, subdued lighting. The image shows several vehicles—sedans and station wagons, indicative of automobile design from the 1960s or 1970s—travelling in both directions on the highway. The cars are spaced out, with some lanes denser than others.\n\nIn the background, a city skyline can be seen, featuring a mix of mid-rise and high-rise buildings that suggest a modest urban center. The architecture displayed includes a prominent square structure, and several other buildings of varying heights and designs. The city is set against a backdrop of lush green hills, which are partially shrouded in haze, conveying a sense of depth and atmosphere typical of a cityscape view from a highway.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the flow of traffic along the curving roadway, with the urban landscape setting a distinct contrast to the organic hues of the hills, underlined by a soft, golden light that bathes the entire scene, creating a serene yet dynamic tableau.","title":"Birmingham, a major industrial city, is located in a valley the smoke from its continuously operating plants is a constant presence","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["552712","542682","553722","549890","542764","549857","553721","545467","545451","557230","547811","545884","553726","555437","546686","546571"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","tableau","curving","denser","city","hill","underlin","wagon","shroude","roadway"]}
