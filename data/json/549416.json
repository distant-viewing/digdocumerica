{"path":"549416.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene with a central focus on traditional rowing boats on a body of water, possibly during a maritime festival or similar event. The image shows a predominantly blue and watery backdrop, bathed in natural light that suggests it was taken on a clear and sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a dark wooden rowing boat manned by several rowers. The rowers appear engaged in either starting to row or in steady motion, with one visible oar dipping into the shimmering water, creating ripples. The crew comprises both men and women, casually dressed, suggesting a leisurely activity rather than a competitive event. A smaller rowboat is tethered to the main boat, bobbing lightly in the water beside it.\n\nThe middle ground is animated by various other boats, including several sailboats with their sails hoisted, gliding gracefully over the water. These boats vary in size and type, indicating a diverse gathering of maritime enthusiasts. The clear skies and calm waters complement the tranquil mood of the scene.\n\nThe background merges seamlessly with these middle elements, with more sailboats dotting the horizon under a hazy sky, contributing to a sense of depth and expansiveness in the image. The overall composition balances elements of human activity and the natural environment, underscored by a theme of nautical tradition and leisure.","title":"Viking image on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549411","549419","549414","548247","555718","546819","547781","543059","550054","542903","551679","547556","549417","552355","547549","552316"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","boat","rowing","tether","glid","dott","dip","rowboat","row","event"]}
