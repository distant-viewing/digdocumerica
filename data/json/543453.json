{"path":"543453.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape likely during a warm season. It features a river gently winding through a broad valley, bordered by lush, dense forests of tall pine trees. The river's water appears clear and calm, reflecting a slightly cloudy blue sky. In the middle of the river that edges a gravelly bank, there is one person, seemingly engaged in fishing. The individual is positioned in the water, possibly wearing boots suitable for wading, and appears to be casting a fishing line into the river.\n\nThe background shows rolling hills partially covered by forests, and beyond them, mountainous terrain under a slightly overcast sky. The landscape is rich and verdant, suggesting a healthy, natural environment. The composition is tranquil, dominated by shades of green and blue, evoking a sense of peace and solitude in nature.","title":"California -- Mono Lake","placename":"Mono Lake (Calif.)","location":"Mono Lake, California","nn1":["542744","542740","550217","550665","543628","542529","554520","543444","550656","555576","554519","550666","552976","542509","542522","544861"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["river","forests","fishing","wading","peace","pine","boot","win","evok","bank"]}
