{"path":"546656.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a vivid urban scene highlighted by the motion blur of city life. The photograph shows a moment on a rainy street, focusing on a white and red bus in the foreground, which takes up a significant portion of the lower image. The bus is shown from an elevated angle, likely taken from an adjacent building or overpass.\n\nOn the side of the bus and the roof, a few water droplets are visible, indicating recent rain. Next to the bus, a pedestrian with a bright red umbrella is walking, providing a sharp contrast to the otherwise mostly metallic and subdued colors in the scene. This figure serves as a focal point amidst the dynamic background and helps humanize the urban environment depicted.\n\nThe street itself is slick with water, reflecting light and adding to the overall mood of the scene. In the background, other vehicles are visible, including a car blurred by motion as it passes by. The movement of the car contrasts against the stationary appearance of the bus, adding a sense of speed and activity.\n\nOverall, the composition blends static elements with motion, and the wet conditions enhance the reflective quality of the surface, making it a compelling depiction of city life during inclement weather. The photographer has effectively utilized a high vantage point and selective focus to draw attention to the pedestrian, making them stand out in a bustling environment.","title":"Orange-vested traffic cop keeps cars moving at busy intersection","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546643","546660","546742","546639","551869","549891","553822","551471","556807","551863","553188","557882","551445","556749","551235","546666"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","motion","pedestrian","blur","inclement","rainy","photographer","overpass","stationary","umbrella"]}
