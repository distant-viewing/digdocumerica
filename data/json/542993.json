{"path":"542993.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a tranquil, almost ethereal coastal scene at dusk or dawn, characterized by its soft light and serene atmosphere. The foreground prominently features old, weathered wooden posts sticking out of still water, creating a striking reflection on the glass-like surface. There are around ten of these poles, some intact while others are broken off at various lengths. The calm water appears slightly tinged with colors from the sky, hinting at purple and pink hues.\n\nA gentle curve of a sandy shoreline meanders through the middle ground, leading into the water, which further enhances the sceneâ€™s tranquil mood. The background is muted and includes the silhouette of distant mountains and a hazy sky, which suggests fog or mist, blurring the line between the sky and the mountain ridges.\n\nThe overall composition and the interplay of the natural elements evoke a sense of peace and solitude, typical of serene coastal landscapes. The image itself has a grainy texture, likely due to the film photography, which adds an element of vintage charm and authenticity to the scene.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543058","542870","543091","547044","547143","547483","557508","545911","545000","543068","545145","542994","543054","550389","548184","553989"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["authenticity","grainy","blurre","intact","peace","mountain","hazy","stick","photography","tranquil"]}
