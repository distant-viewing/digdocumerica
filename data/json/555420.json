{"path":"555420.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a multi-layered scene beside a highway. In the foreground, prominently displayed, is a newspaper (\"The Oregonian\") laid open on what appears to be the hood of a vehicle. The headline of the paper reads \"Washington state cuts speed limit to 50\" alongside other news pieces, including a story on Watergate.\n\nAbove this headline, aligning perfectly in the frame, is a roadside speed limit sign showing \"SPEED LIMIT 50\", reinforcing the news printed below. The sign is crisp and stands out against the soft-focused background.\n\nIn the midground of the image, we see the highway itself. A few cars are visible, traveling on the road which moves under a concrete overpass. The overpass architecturally is simple, with plain concrete barriers and supports.\n\nThe overall setting is outdoors during what seems to be a day with good weather, given the bright lighting and clear blue sky glimpsed at the top left corner of the photo. The green grassy slope beside the road adds a touch of nature to the otherwise urban infrastructure scene.\n\nThe photographerâ€™s shadow is subtly captured at the edge of the newspaper, suggesting the source of perspective and adding a personal touch to the image. This juxtaposition of printed media, road signage, and an everyday highway scene encapsulates a moment of regulatory change impacting public life and hints at the broader context of national news events, as indicated by the reference to Watergate.","title":"Highway sign along Interstate #5 shows the 50 mile an hour limit imposed by officials in that state as well as Oregon before a federal order asked motorists throughout the nation to slow down.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543907","555477","555435","549879","545463","543874","553127","549857","550182","555437","550143","545455","546738","549902","557471","556785"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["speed","headline","limit","highway","overpass","newspaper","medium","road","reference","touch"]}
