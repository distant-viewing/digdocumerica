{"path":"554087.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic seaside scene characterized by a series of rocks and rocky formations covered in moss or seaweed, scattered across the foreshore and amidst swirling seawater. The central focus of the image is a prominent, dark, moss-covered rock around which the seawater is in motion, creating blurred swirls and patterns due to the long exposure of the shot.\n\nThe seawater varies in color from deep browns near the foreground to lighter shades towards the background. The depth of field and motion blur suggest a turbulent, yet rhythmic movement of the ocean water washing over and retreating from the rocks. This gives the scene an ethereal, somewhat moody ambiance.\n\nIn the distance, more rocks are visible, and some are being hit by breaking waves producing white splashes, which contrast with the darker tones of the water and rocks, adding to the dramatic effect of the composition. The backdrop is less distinct, possibly due to mist or sea spray, with a hint of a horizon where the ocean meets the sky in a muted, overcast light.","title":"Surf near kihei.
