{"path":"548000.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a scene with a prominent industrial feel at a waterfront, capturing the activities centered around wooden construction or repair work. In the foreground, several large, dark wooden beams are organized in a crisscross pattern, creating an elaborate framework. Some of these beams form part of an incomplete structure jutting out over calm blue water, likely a river or canal.\n\nA man in protective work attire, including a helmet and possibly a jacket, is positioned on the wooden framework. He seems engrossed in his task, although his specific activity isn't clearly visible. His presence indicates that the structure is under construction, maintenance, or repair.\n\nIn the background, contrasted against a clear sky, stands a tall industrial tower with a clock showing the time as 3:55. The towerâ€™s design is narrow and vertical, featuring a pointed roof that may suggest its function as part of the industrial facility or a nearby landmark.\n\nThe setting also includes some grassy and bushy areas next to the water, and there are other industrial elements like distant cranes visible, which reinforce the industrial theme of the environment. The overall composition highlights the interaction between human activity and industrial structures in a waterfront setting, under a bright, clear sky.","title":"Construction at site of expo 74 on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555796","553923","553375","555795","553352","543894","551954","547579","546823","546917","544753","552135","549308","545979","550910","547019"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["repair","framework","tower","jutt","construction","landmark","not","clock","crisscross","beams"]}
