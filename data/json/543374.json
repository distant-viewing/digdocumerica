{"path":"543374.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a striking coastal landscape. The viewpoint is elevated, looking down over steep cliffs towards a vast, expansive body of water, which appears to be an ocean or a very large lake, reflecting a deep blue hue glistening under sunlight. The foreground shows a steep cliff covered with dense greenery, primarily coniferous trees, with one prominent tree standing slightly apart from others at the bottom right of the frame, suggesting the photo was possibly taken from a forested area.\n\nBeyond the immediate cliffs, the coastal landscape extends towards the left, showing additional precipitous cliffs interspersed with patches of green vegetation. Further still, the coastline curves gently into the distance where it meets with more mountains, demonstrating varying shades of blue and green under the sunlight, adding a sense of vast depth to the scene.\n\nThe mountains in the background have a more arid appearance with less vegetation visible, mainly showcasing bare rocky surfaces or sparse greenery, which contrasts with the densely wooded areas in the foreground. The sky above is clear, enhancing the vivid colors of the natural landscape. There are no human activities or structures discernibly visible, emphasizing the natural and possibly remote setting of this coastal view. The picture captures a serene, untouched aspect of nature, offering a sense of tranquility and grandeur.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
