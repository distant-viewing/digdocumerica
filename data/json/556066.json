{"path":"556066.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photo captures a cheerful moment at a train station during a sunny day. A man, clad in a red jacket and dark pants, stands on the ground by a train car, which features a white upper half and red, blue, and light blue stripes along the bottom. The man smiles and holds the hand of a young boy who is descending the steps of the train. The boy, wearing a multicolored sweater and dark pants, seems to be carefully navigating the step under the guidance of the adult.\n\nOn the steps inside the train, a woman helps by holding a pole and extending her other hand towards the boy, aiding his descent. She has curly hair and is dressed in a knitted multicolored top. Her expression is attentive as she assists the boy.\n\nThe train carriage, marked with the number '92', shows a series of windows through which another figure can be barely seen inside, observing the scene. The train station environment is composed of a cracked concrete platform and a couple of industrial buildings in the background, with clear blue skies overhead.","title":"Passenger car attendant helps passengers from the Turboliner at Springfield, Illinois, on the train's route between St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago.
