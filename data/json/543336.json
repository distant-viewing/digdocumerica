{"path":"543336.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a picturesque coastal scene likely taken during the golden hour, based on the warm lighting and long shadows. The image prominently features a modern architectural home situated precariously on a rugged cliff overlooking the ocean. The house has a distinctive flat roof with a wide overhang, extensive use of glass, possibly for maximizing the panoramic views of the sea, and integrates seamlessly into the landscape with its low profile and neutral colors.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, a large, gnarled tree with windswept branches frames the composition, pointing towards the ocean, emphasizing the coastal winds shaping its form. This tree is most likely a Monterey Cypress or similar, typical of coastal California.\n\nThe ocean itself is visible to the left with rocky outcrops protruding from the water, suggesting a rugged coastline. The horizon meets a clear blue sky dotted with a few scattered clouds, enhancing the serene and pristine quality of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of harmony between modern architecture and natural landscape, showcasing both human ingenuity and the beauty of natural settings. The use of natural light and composition highlights the dramatic location of the house and contributes to the overall tranquil and exclusive feel of the scene.","title":"California -- Carmel beach","placename":"Carmel River (Calif.)","location":"Carmel River, California","nn1":["543338","543346","551963","543334","553931","543340","543337","543355","557429","543291","543426","545110","557523","543362","543249","545052"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","overhang","harmony","house","use","outcrop","profile","hour","coastline","wind"]}
