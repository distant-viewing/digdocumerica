{"path":"552078.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures an eerie, yet poignant scene in a natural setting, which appears to be a field or clearing. The foreground of the image prominently features a discarded, crumpled female mannequin head lying on the ground among sparse vegetation. The mannequin's face is pale with detailed makeup, including penciled eyebrows, eye shadow, and painted lips, contrasting starkly with the surrounding dirt and minor vegetation.\n\nAround and beyond the mannequin head, the field is scattered with bits of debris, suggesting neglect or abandonment. Other similar mannequin parts or white debris are visible in the distance, adding to the overall disarray and surreal quality of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the landscape includes dense tree lines suggesting a border to the field. The sky is overcast, casting a subdued light over the entire scene, which enhances the somber and peculiar mood of the image. The combination of natural elements with the human-made, discarded mannequin parts creates a powerful commentary on themes such as consumerism, waste, and perhaps isolation or loss.","title":"A broken doll's face by the river edge--silent commentary on man's use of nature as a junkyard.
