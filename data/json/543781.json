{"path":"543781.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a man in a rural outdoor setting, focusing on agricultural activity. He is bending over a narrow water channel, possibly cleaning or examining it, using a long tool that extends into the water. The man is dressed in a practical manner for outdoor work; he wears a cap, a denim jacket, and darker pants, carrying a backpack.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features lush green grass on either side of the water channel, suggesting a well-watered area, maybe a pasture or farmland. In the background, aligned along the left side of the image, there is a rustic wooden fence that follows the path of the channel, reinforcing the rural theme. The time appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, warm lighting and long shadows cast across the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the intersection of human activity and the natural environment, emphasizing a moment of solitary engagement with the land.","title":"Worker irrigates field with water from the San Miguel River.","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543792","545371","544371","545386","548831","552570","552571","549056","548956","552574","552110","549036","558108","549259","548299","544250"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["channel","pasture","clean","farmland","backpack","intersection","manner","water","denim","outdoor"]}
