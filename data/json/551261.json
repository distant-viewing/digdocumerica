{"path":"551261.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a compound located in a forested area on the edge of a cliff during dusk. The main focus of the composition is a large building complex that includes a central rectangular building surrounded by what appears to be a flat, open courtyard or light-colored ground cover, possibly concrete. Attached or adjacent to this central building are several smaller structures, which could function as supporting facilities or living quarters.\n\nThe building complex is interestingly isolated, surrounded by dense trees, and occupies the plateau of the ridge with no other buildings in close proximity. The cliff on which the compound is situated has a steep, rugged face dropping away into shadows, suggesting significant elevation.\n\nIn the background, the land gently slopes away and is covered by a broad expanse of forest, extending into the distance under a hazy sky. The coloration of the scene is subdued with muted greens, blues, and earth tones, emphasizing the near-twilight setting. The remote and isolated setting of the building along with its placement at the edge of the cliff creates a dramatic and somewhat mysterious atmosphere.","title":"Aerial view of expensive private home on cliff at Horseshoe Bend, half a mile from Business Route 54","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544503","542593","556917","550520","551260","546473","546468","548022","557750","545809","542675","546472","550587","550565","543437","546702"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["compound","cliff","complex","building","courtyard","plateau","quarter","drop","coloration","placement"]}
