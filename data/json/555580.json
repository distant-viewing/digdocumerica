{"path":"555580.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on the porch of an aging, two-story wooden house. The house is painted in a faded white and shows signs of wear, such as weathered siding and a partially slumping roof. The setting is lush and verdant, indicating a warm, possibly summer season.\n\nOn the porch, shaded by its roof, sit two older adults—a woman and a man—suggesting a couple enjoying a quiet moment together. The woman, seated on a porch swing, appears engaged in reading a book, donning a casual, sleeveless dress. Beside her, the man is relaxed in his posture, wearing a dark shirt and lighter pants. He is accompanied by a small dog seated on his lap, adding a companionable and homely feel to the scene.\n\nThe porch itself is simple, with a modest swing and railing, which coupled with the overall rustic appearance of the house and the natural surroundings, portrays a tranquil domestic life. Two large bushes flank the front side of the house, one obscuring part of it, adding to the sense of a private, intimate space held within a green, leafy embrace. The lawn in front is well-maintained, further indicating the occupants' care for their home environment. The calm and quiet captured in the scene evokes a timeless slice of everyday life.","title":"Residents of an older home, built in the 1850's, take advantage of the summer weather to sit on their front porch off Route #800.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["557672","545525","557761","543314","556489","557363","557360","546994","545510","544219","555581","553483","546209","552489","557362","554697"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["porch","swing","house","occupant","lap","care","roof","aging","dog","woman"]}
