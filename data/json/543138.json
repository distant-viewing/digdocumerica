{"path":"543138.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic ocean scene at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the low angle of the sunlight reflecting off the water. The entire image is filled with turbulent sea waves that exhibit a rough texture, underscoring a sense of powerful oceanic movement. The sunlight strikes the water, creating a sparkling effect on the waves, which vary in size and intensity across the frame.\n\nThere are no visible landforms or sky, focusing all attention on the sea itself. The color palette predominantly features dark blue and black tones, with shimmering gold and silver reflections from the sunlight on the waterâ€™s surface. This composition highlights the natural beauty and dynamic energy of the ocean, emphasizing its vastness and the play of light on its constantly changing surface.\n\nNo people or man-made objects are visible, adding to the impression of an untouched natural environment. The overall mood is somewhat moody and dramatic, showcasing nature's power and the infinite textures of the sea.","title":"Sunset on ocean waves","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["553852","543025","543251","543092","542808","555713","547475","557814","553857","544718","547638","547143","548704","547057","547609","547091"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sea","sunlight","ocean","wave","landform","gold","silver","intensity","play","energy"]}
