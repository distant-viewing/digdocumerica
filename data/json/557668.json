{"path":"557668.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene suburban setting, likely taken during the daytime given the bright outdoor lighting. The scene is composed of a well-maintained street that stretches back into the distance, flanked by residential properties. To the right of the image, there's a single-story brick house with a red roof and light-colored trim around the windows and doors. The house has a small porch area with columns, and a driveway leading up to a covered carport. In the yard of this house, a blue-and-yellow tent is pitched, suggesting recreational or temporary outdoor living, perhaps for children playing or a family event.\n\nDirectly in front of the brick house, thereâ€™s a paved area that looks like it could be used for various outdoor activities. The lawn is green and trimmed, indicating regular maintenance. Adjacent to the sidewalk, there's a slightly raised grass verge.\n\nAdditional features include another home visible on the left side of the street, partially obscured by trees, and a car parked in the distance. The background of the photo shows lush green trees and a hilly landscape, providing a scenic backdrop. The atmosphere is tranquil, typical of a quiet, residential neighborhood.","title":"Low income government financed housing at the foot of Dye Street in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The village of some 270 residents is located 90 miles northeast of Atlanta. It was typical of small mountain communities in the area until 1969 when local officials, store owners and residents began Renovating the exteriors in the business district using a Bavarian alpine theme. Success of the project has led to new commercial growth and a surge of tourism.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546430","546441","556426","556950","547433","556433","556601","558157","550315","546435","557094","550121","553705","547769","549279","558039"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["house","brick","driveway","tent","street","trim","living","daytime","property","outdoor"]}
