{"path":"553859.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a sign from the Alexandria Health Department, with a body of water and activities in the background. The sign, prominently positioned in the foreground on the left-hand side, is a square with rounded corners and displays three icons accompanied by text. Each icon is enclosed in a red circle with a diagonal line, indicating prohibitions: \"No Swimming,\" \"No Water Skiing,\" and \"No Scuba Diving.\" Below the icons, text warns that the water is a health hazard containing harmful bacteria and viruses, advising to wash any part of the body or any animals that have been in contact with the water.\n\nIn the softer focus background, there is a sailboat actively sailing and oriented towards the right side of the frame. The sailboat has a single sail, marked with \"1071\" near its top, and appears to be crewed by at least one individual. The background beyond the boat features a serene expanse of water leading up to a distant landmass with indistinct buildings. The overall composition combines the immediate clarity and concern of the warning sign with the seemingly peaceful yet possibly hazardous water-based activities in the background.","title":"Potomac river.
