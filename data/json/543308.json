{"path":"543308.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures an overhead view of a coastal landscape where the interaction between land and water forms diverse textures and patterns. The top section of the image shows sandy shores mixed with dark, wet areas that appear to have a lighter sediment deposition. This part of the shoreline curves inward, suggesting an inlet or a calm bay.\n\nIn the middle of the scene, the ocean waves transition into frothy white foam as they meet the land. The dynamics of the water create swirling patterns proximate to the shoreline. The changes in the water's appearance—from clear to frothy white—emphasize the natural energy of the beach.\n\nTowards the bottom right corner of the image, there appears to be a rocky protrusion that extends into the darker, calm water. This creates a distinct boundary between the sandy landmass and the sea.\n\nThe photograph includes variations in color and texture, from the murky underwater sand visible through the clear water, to the dry sandy beaches, and to the lively foam of the breaking waves, showcasing nature's diverse palette of earthy and aquatic elements. The overall composition of the image gives a vivid impression of a rugged coastline viewed from above, highlighting the serene yet dynamic interaction between land and sea.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542867","543309","543427","543289","552922","551554","547609","543019","545106","543067","543297","554156","543085","543300","543088","543287"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["foam","land","deposition","shoreline","beach","protrusion","sea","inlet","water","landmass"]}
