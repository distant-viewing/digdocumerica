{"path":"548631.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features an aerial view of a unique landscape that includes both natural and human-modified elements. Most dominant in the image are two long, parallel rectangular pits filled with a blue-tinted liquid, possibly water. These pits are bordered by thick white embankments made up of piled material, likely dredged up during the excavation of the pits. The clear geometric lines of the pits contrast with the surrounding natural environment.\n\nThe surrounding area is a marsh or wetland, characterized by irregular patches of darker and lighter green vegetation, interspersed with shallow, murky water bodies. This indicates a coastal or estuarine ecosystem. These wetlands are crisscrossed by narrow white pathways that could be roads or levees, linking various parts of the landscape.\n\nIn the top left corner of the image, a small developed area can be observed. It includes buildings and other infrastructure, suggesting human habitation or a functional facility near the wetland. The overall layout, including the road network, appears organized, indicating planned development.\n\nThe background of the photo extends to more greenery and some visible bodies of water, possibly indicating proximity to a larger water body or coastline. Overall, the scene captures a striking interaction between human activity, represented by the excavation and infrastructural development, and the natural coastal wetland environment.","title":"Land development at cudjoe key, one of a cluster of small islands near the western tip of the Florida keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["555862","547098","550405","555859","551611","548640","544438","544670","553051","552991","543697","548779","544498","543861","551612","544635"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pit","wetland","excavation","development","modify","embankment","marsh","plan","body","liquid"]}
