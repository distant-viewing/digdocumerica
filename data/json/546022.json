{"path":"546022.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph displays an intriguing and artistic structure created from a large stack of old, used car tires. These tires are piled up high in a spiral formation around what appears to be a central wooden pole scaffold. Each tire looks worn and bears various degrees of dirt and aging, suggesting they have been exposed to the elements for a long time.\n\nThe structure is situated on a grassy and slightly muddy area that extends into a flat, open field. In the background, you can notice a similar, though smaller, tire structure aligned perfectly in the background along what seems to be an old railway track or a straight pathway, enhancing the depth and symmetry of the composition.\n\nThe environment and lighting suggest this photo was taken during either sunrise or sunset, as indicated by the soft, warm glow that bathes the scene, casting long shadows and lending a serene, almost ethereal quality to the image.\n\nNo people are visible in this scene, focusing entirely on the environmental and sculptural aspects of the displayed objects. The overall mood is quite peaceful and leaves a strong impression of re-purposing industrial waste into a form of environmental art or commentary.","title":"A huge stock of rubber tires awaits burning at the Christmas Eve bonfire.
