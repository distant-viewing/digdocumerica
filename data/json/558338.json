{"path":"558338.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"The photograph features an elderly woman resting in a hospital-style bed. She is wearing glasses and a dotted gown, emphasizing a sense of delicacy and frailty in her posture and expression. Her eyes are closed, and she appears to be either sleeping or resting quietly. Her hands are gently placed on top of the white bedsheet that covers her. \n\nThe bed is equipped with metal railings on the sides, suggesting that it is adjustable or designed for patient care. It is positioned in a room with a plain, light-colored wall and a patterned curtain hanging beside the window, adding a small decorative touch to an otherwise stark environment.\n\nThe lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows and giving the room a calm atmosphere. The overall mood is quiet and somber, with an intimate glimpse into a moment of rest or possibly recuperation. The surrounding setting is simplified, focused solely on the subject, underlining the personal and vulnerable nature of the scene.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire. There is a close community responsibility towards older people no matter what their financial position might be. Older citizens and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community facilities, Alexander Home and Highland Manor. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["554849","545407","553522","545408","558335","558337","556459","553035","545399","553532","543906","552611","558319","558178","553545","544232"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["bed","room","gown","hospital","care","curtain","rest","railing","subject","glimpse"]}
