{"path":"552608.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and picturesque golf course during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening, considering the low lighting and long shadows. In the foreground on the right, a golfer in a white shirt and black pants is captured mid-swing, with a focus sharply freezing this moment of action. To the left in the background, two golf carts are stationed near a flowerbed; occupants are engaged in quiet observation or discussion.\n\nThe backdrop is dramatic, dominated by rugged mountains that soar into a vivid blue sky scattered with voluminous white clouds casting shadows. The landscape is lush, with meticulously maintained fairways that offer a vibrant contrast to the ruggedness of the mountain. The shadowed areas and the quality of the light suggest the sun is setting, creating a beautiful interplay of light and shadow across the scene. The composition effectively balances the quiet activity of golf with the grandeur of the natural environment.","title":"Rifle, southeast of the piceance basin, beneath the oil shale bearing book (or roan) cliffs, is the major community in this region of sheep and cattle ranches","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["554149","557512","549069","554492","543633","546959","554167","554148","548821","546513","545249","553980","558098","547286","543262","543312"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["golf","flowerbed","soar","statione","freeze","occupant","consider","cart","shadowed","mountain"]}
