{"path":"547139.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic and textured beach scene, possibly during a winter season based on the icy conditions. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a broad expanse of sandy beach covered with a thick layer of tangled, brown reeds or sea grass, suggesting recent strong tides or storms may have deposited these here. The reeds give a sense of a rugged coastline enduring harsh weather conditions.\n\nThe middle ground introduces more dramatic elements with what appears to be a series of frozen structures. These might be vegetation or small trees encased in thick, glistening ice, giving them a sculptural, almost ghostly appearance. This icy encasement suggests very cold temperatures that have allowed the spray from the sea or nearby water body to freeze upon contact with these objects.\n\nBeyond this icy spectacle, the background of the scene shows a robust wooden barrier or perhaps a jetty, extending horizontally across the photo. This barrier serves as a breakwater, with large violent waves crashing against it, sending white spray high into the air. This not only adds a forceful dynamism to the scene but also highlights the power of the natural elements at play.\n\nThe sky above is clear and vividly blue, offering a sharp contrast to the chaotic and chilly activities at ground level. This clear sky might hint at a break in weather systems or the crisp clarity that can follow a winter storm.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully juxtaposes the serenity of the blue sky with the ferocity of the ocean and the stark cold indicated by the icy conditions on the shore.","title":"Waves, whipped up by a northeast gale, crash against the seawall and spray the ice-encrusted bushes.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["548184","543287","543081","543244","546970","543308","543069","545122","547609","543048","551554","551553","547607","542890","543309","548757"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["spray","reed","storm","barrier","winter","beach","condition","breakwater","dynamism","sea"]}
