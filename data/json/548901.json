{"path":"548901.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of agricultural fields. The image captures a vast landscape intersected by a series of irrigation canals and roads which separate various plots of land. Some fields are lush and green, indicating healthy, thriving crops, possibly different types of vegetables or cereals. Others are covered in water, reflecting sunlight, suggesting they are either flooded for rice cultivation or are undergoing some form of water treatment.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple bright, rectangular fields aligned parallel to each other, filled with standing water. The reflection of the light on these fields gives them a silvery-white appearance. These waterlogged fields contrast sharply with the green, land-based crops.\n\nAt the edges of the photograph, natural landscapes or less intensely cultivated areas can be spotted, including distant mountains or hills providing a natural border to the flat farmland.\n\nThe photograph likely illustrates aspects of modern agricultural techniques, such as crop rotation, irrigation management, and possibly sustainable farming practices. The divisions between the fields, the presence of access roads, and the water management systems underscore the technological and planning aspects involved in large-scale agriculture.","title":"Irrigated fields near parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548817","549098","542708","548907","552858","549094","548908","553977","548991","558414","553047","542710","554053","548820","555880","542730"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","crop","irrigation","aspect","management","waterlog","vegetable","cultivated","undergo","silvery"]}
