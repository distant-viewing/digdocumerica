{"path":"547084.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene viewed from a water body. In the forefront of the image, choppy dark blue waves of the water fill the bottom portion, suggesting the photograph is taken from a boat or the opposite shore.\n\nDominating the middle and background is an industrial complex with various large structures, including tall smokestacks from which thick plumes of smoke are being emitted upwards into the sky. The smoke clouds are voluminous and dense, taking up a significant portion of the sky in the image. Some of the smoke has a pinkish hue, likely from the reflection of the sunset or ambient light conditions, adding a stark contrast to the darker elements of the industrial setup.\n\nThe sky itself is tinged with purple and blue, suggesting either dawn or dusk lighting. The industrial facilities appear busy, perhaps engaged in manufacturing or processing, evident from the smoke output. This scene provides a striking juxtaposition between natural elements (the water and sky) and human-made industrial activity, highlighting themes of environmental impact and industrialization.","title":"Steel mill on southern shore of Lake Michigan at Beverly Shores","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547172","547696","550821","550344","552179","547702","545268","557225","547539","544173","551054","548107","548068","557246","545438","551566"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","output","portion","industrialization","tinge","manufacturing","plume","forefront","dawn","smokestack"]}
