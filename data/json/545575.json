{"path":"545575.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, expansive desert landscape that is predominantly dry and arid. The scene features a dirt road that meanders through the terrain, flanked by sparse vegetation, mostly small bushes and scattered grasses typical of desert environments. In the distance, there are massive flat-topped mesas and layered rock formations, suggesting this might be a region similar to those found in the American Southwest, possibly within a desert plateau.\n\nThe sky above is clear and predominantly blue, indicating a sunny day without any visible clouds. The color palette is a mix of earth tones—browns, reds, and muted greens—that reflect the natural hues of the desert and rock formations.\n\nFurther into the scene, on the dirt road, there are two small figures visible, likely people, adding a sense of scale and life to the otherwise barren landscape. Their presence suggests human activity or exploration in this remote area. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the vastness and the quiet solitude typical of such desert environments.","title":"Cattle are permitted to graze on this land just outside Canyonlands National Park.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["549016","544016","544027","545604","544043","544401","545789","545583","544400","544178","544428","555885","548897","545800","545771","545760"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["desert","plateau","mesa","formation","dirt","rock","road","exploration","vastness","red"]}
