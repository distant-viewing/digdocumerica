{"path":"547571.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene focusing on multiple parallel pipelines that stretch from the foreground into the distance, converging towards large storage tanks. The pipelines are painted white and appear somewhat weathered, with visible rust and wear marks. These pipelines are mounted on supports above the ground, characterized by a tangled mix of concrete, debris, additional pipes, and other structural elements indicating a utilitarian and possibly neglected environment.\n\nIn the middle distance, five large white storage tanks dominate the scene under a partly cloudy sky. They are cylindrical in shape and feature flat roofs. The area surrounding the pipes and tanks is somewhat unkempt, with patches of grass and visible rubble or waste materials.\n\nUtility poles with power lines are also seen beside the pipelines, enhancing the industrial theme of the scene. The photograph offers a look into industrial infrastructure, possibly related to oil, gas, or chemical storage and processing. The overall atmosphere suggests functionality paired with a lack of aesthetic concern, typical of such industrial sites.","title":"Oil pipelines from unloading docks to storage tanks at Getty Terminal","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545615","546221","542587","546108","555777","549975","549960","546064","556402","552021","549977","542528","548932","551987","555775","545997"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["pipeline","tank","storage","pipe","rubble","mark","oil","functionality","concern","gas"]}
