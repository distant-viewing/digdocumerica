{"path":"554771.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph appears to capture an industrial or construction site at night. The central focus is a brightly illuminated section of what could be an excavation or building site, showing rocky textures that gleam under the harsh light. The activity seems to be taking place within a large excavation as the brightly lit area forms a sharp cut into a darker mass which might be earth or rock.\n\nArtificial lighting is prominent in the scene, with several bright white lights directed towards the site, enhancing the contrast between the lit area and the surrounding darkness. There are a few faint lights and possibly reflective surfaces scattered around the perimeter, suggesting additional equipment or vehicles present at the site. The night setting of the shot creates a stark atmosphere, with most details shrouded in shadows beyond the main illuminated area.\n\nOverall, the scene likely depicts nighttime work at an industrial or construction site, highlighting the intensity and scale of operations typical in such environments.","title":"Coal shovel being worked at night off route 9, most of the machines are used seven days a week, 24 hours a day","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["545646","557398","543734","545631","552475","547225","545635","542989","547240","543020","544008","556893","544374","555794","553866","544390"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["site","night","excavation","light","gleam","perimeter","mass","construction","shroud","intensity"]}
