{"path":"542907.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene maritime scene with a focus on a quaint harbor that is nestled against a backdrop of gentle hills. The main elements in the foreground consist of several boats moored on calm blue waters. These include a prominently visible white boat anchored closer to the viewer, and two sailboats with white hulls floating at a slightly greater distance. The masts of these boats, along with others, create slender vertical lines that contrast with the horizontal calmness of the water.\n\nThe middle ground of the scene introduces a small coastal town. The architecture appears residential with compact houses, many of which seem to sport pitched roofs and are spaced closely together. Some buildings feature exterior colors like red, adding a splash of color against the natural tones. There's also an interesting building on a pier, possibly a warehouse or boathouse, which supports the town's maritime activities.\n\nBeyond the town, the background encompasses rolling hills that rise gently into the distance. These hills exhibit a mixture of green and earthen tones, suggesting they might be covered with grass or low vegetation. The top of the hills seems to disappear into a soft, misty haze, indicating either fog or low-lying clouds typical of coastal areas.\n\nThe photograph's overall composition uses natural light that enhances the peacefulness of the setting, giving the image a warm, golden hue, likely indicative of sunset or sunrise. The serenity of the scene suggests a quiet, perhaps early morning moment where the water remains undisturbed and the town has not yet stirred into full activity. This image likely invites viewers to appreciate not only the tranquil beauty of the maritime environment but also the small-town charm of the coastal community.","title":"The hills overlooking Bodega Bay are to be developed for vacation housing.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif.)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542877","542872","542903","548249","548247","542910","542870","546998","554101","542913","542904","542878","547556","548235","542876","545026"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["town","hill","boat","boathouse","serenity","mast","maritime","harbor","peacefulness","calmness"]}
