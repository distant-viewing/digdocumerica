{"path":"543531.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a serene lakeside scene with several focal points. In the foreground, you can see what appears to be a sandy and slightly rocky lake bed submerged under clear shallow water, giving a textured and rippled appearance. The sandy formations are wide, exhibiting patterns that could be due to wave action or currents.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, the water appears deeper and is a darker blue, indicating increased depth. Floating on this deeper water is a sailboat, anchored and still. The boat is white and appears small in comparison to the expansive lake.\n\nFurther in the background, the lake continues towards a panoramic view of distant mountains. These mountains are capped with snow, suggesting a cooler climate or season when the photo was taken. The sky is clear and devoid of clouds, adding a feeling of tranquility and openness to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its clear layers from the sandy foreground through the sailboat on the water and culminating in the distant snow-capped mountains, creates a calm and picturesque lakeside landscape. The clarity of the water and the quiet, untouched nature of the scenery adds to the peacefulness of the setting.","title":"Scum on lake","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543626","552222","550324","543618","543546","548034","557562","551207","552894","555703","557416","543613","543547","543548","555692","547754"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lakeside","sailboat","lake","mountain","snow","cap","comparison","increase","deeper","water"]}
