{"path":"549448.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, natural landscape that appears to have been taken in a mountainous region. The image shows a rugged, rocky terrain with prominent mountain peaks enveloped in various shades of green, suggesting vegetation though it is not particularly lush.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an attention-grabbing element: a wooden stake with a pink ribbon tied around it. On the ribbon or the wood (it's a bit unclear) there is handwriting that includes \"SE corner\" suggesting this might be a marked survey point or a boundary marker in a geographic study or land division process.\n\nThe landscape includes a calm body of water that reflects the surrounding mountains, enhancing the tranquility and isolation of the scene. The water could be a lake or a wide river, nestled tightly within the encircling mountains.\n\nThe overall scene has an untouched, wild feel to it, but the marked stake implies human interaction or exploration, possibly for mapping, surveying, or environmental studies. The lighting is soft, potentially indicating an overcast day, which casts evenly diffused light across the view without harsh shadows.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in this scene, highlighting the solitude and untouched nature of the location. The viewpoint from which the photo is taken makes the observer feel as if they are discovering this place, peering out over the grasses into the broader landscape below.","title":"Campsite on the Snake River in Hells Canyon between Idaho and Oregon.
