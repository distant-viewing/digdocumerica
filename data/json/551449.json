{"path":"551449.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene depicting daily urban life. In the foreground, a large fountain with dramatic sprays of water dominates the view. The fountain features multiple jets that create an energetic and refreshing ambiance. A statue, possibly depicting a figure holding an item above its head, is part of the fountain, adding an artistic element to the scene.\n\nOn either side of the fountain, there are groups of people seated on benches. Two young women sit together on the left, both dressed in light summer clothing, engrossed in a conversation. On the right, a woman sits while reading, isolated and engrossed in her material, next to an older man who appears to be resting or watching the surroundings.\n\nThe background includes a vibrant urban setting with a glimpse of a restaurant sign advertising \"Excellent American & Cantonese Food.\" The sign indicates the ethnic diversity of the area, suggesting the location might be near or within a multicultural neighborhood.\n\nThe overall composition illustrates a typical urban park setting where people enjoy casual outings, interacting or relaxing by a fountain, on a seemingly warm, sunny day. The photo captures a slice of urban leisure and community interaction, surrounded by elements of nature and art in the city environment.","title":"Oasis in the city--block square park at east 5th and market streets","placename":"Saint Paul (Minn.)","location":"Saint Paul, Minnesota","nn1":["551772","550747","557258","550752","553289","551793","551663","551647","549982","553207","551480","557282","551792","553224","551453","551636"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","engross","refresh","urban","restaurant","relax","sit","jet","outing","statue"]}
