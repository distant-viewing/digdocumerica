{"path":"554148.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene golf setting with a picturesque ocean backdrop. In the foreground, there is a sloping golf course with several people engaged in the sport. One person, standing on the right, appears to be taking a shot, possibly finishing their swing. Nearby, on the left, there is a golf cart parked on the edge of the grass, with two individuals seated inside, enjoying the activity or possibly waiting their turn to play.\n\nThe middle of the image presents a well-manicured lawn bordered by tropical vegetation, including some vibrant red flowers that add a splash of color to the mostly green and blue scene. Beyond the golf course, the composition features tall palm trees that stand under a hazy sky, framing a view of the shimmering ocean that extends to the horizon.\n\nThe overall ambience of the photograph is peaceful and leisurely, set in a beautiful coastal location that blends the green expanses of the golf course with the natural beauty of the seaside landscape.","title":"Golf course built on lava bed near Kailua on the west coast makes good use of land which might not have been suitable for agriculture.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554149","549069","543633","546959","548821","552608","554492","557512","554167","546513","553980","547286","558098","545249","546509","543262"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["golf","course","ocean","swing","turn","cart","ambience","palm","splash","lawn"]}
