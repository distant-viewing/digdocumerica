{"path":"555480.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic scene in an industrial or possibly a commercial area. A large, black car, which seems to be a vintage model from around the 1960s or 1970s, is featured prominently in the foreground. The carâ€™s hood is up and there is a substantial fire blazing violently from the engine compartment, sending flames upwards. The front and back windows of the car appear to be open or broken, and smoke is rising both from the open windows and the engine area.\n\nThe setting is somewhat grim and desolate, suggesting the photograph might have been taken in an area not frequently attended by pedestrians. In the background, there is a pale-colored, nondescript building, which could be an industrial warehouse or a similar structure, and a chain-link fence is also visible. Additionally, there are small puddles on the pavement, possibly from firefighting efforts or recent rainfall.\n\nBehind the burning car, partially obscured by the smoke and flames, a red fire truck can be seen. This gives a sense of ongoing emergency response. The overall mood of the image is tense and urgent, compounded by the dim, overcast lighting which adds a sense of gloom to the scene.","title":"Actual demonstration by the fire department training station showing what would happen after a rear end accident if a five gallon can of gasoline was carried in the trunk of an auto (picture number three in a series of six.)","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555479","555481","547597","555917","555483","554302","543002","550020","547587","547917","547481","543933","547484","546373","553488","555540"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["flame","engine","fire","car","compound","response","smoke","emergency","compartment","attend"]}
