{"path":"554604.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a large section of a tree trunk that has been freshly cut or snapped, likely depicting a method of chopping trees by making deep, angular cuts. Its texture is prominent and detailed with many thin, jagged layers of wood fibers showing signs of splintering. The exposed inner surfaces of the trunk are lighter in color and exhibit rough, uneven patterns due to the cutting technique. \n\nThe setting of the photograph appears to be in a natural environment; shadows and hints of green foliage are visible at the bottom corner of the frame, suggesting this tree might be among others in a forest or wooded area. The lighting focuses on the detailed textures of the wood, creating a distinct contrast between the sharp, torn fibers of the tree and the softer, blurred background, which includes hints of other vegetation, lending an organic and natural feel to the scene. \n\nNo persons or other distinct objects, other than the tree part, are depicted, keeping the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the textures and details of the chopped wood.","title":"Marks of beaver that had gnawed on downed yellow birch tree, in the forest preserve.","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555141","553640","554974","553587","542749","553586","557616","557583","555001","544662","550792","543488","557621","551355","542623","555059"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wood","trunk","cutting","texture","tree","method","technique","cut","hint","corner"]}
