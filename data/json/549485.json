{"path":"549485.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of Niagara Falls, showcasing its majestic and powerful beauty. The image presents a comprehensive view of both the American Falls to the left and the larger Horseshoe Falls to the right, separated by Goat Island, seen in the middle with tree cover.\n\nThe American Falls is depicted with water cascading over a rocky cliff, creating a mist at the bottom as the water crashes into the river. Next to it, the Horseshoe Falls forms a massive, curved waterfall, a spectacle with vast white sheets of water plunging powerfully into the basin below, also generating thick mist.\n\nIn the surrounding environment, you can see various elements such as roads, pathways, and parking lots, hinting at the accessibility and urban development around the natural site. Some small buildings are visible near the cliff edges, possibly facilities for tourists. The surrounding water is dark and contrasts sharply with the white froth of the falls.\n\nThis image captures the scale and natural beauty of the Niagara Falls, emphasizing the contrast between the serene landscapes and the vigorous flow of one of the most renowned waterfalls in the world.","title":"The \"american falls\" at Niagara Falls.
