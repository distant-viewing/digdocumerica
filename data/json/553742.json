{"path":"553742.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an interesting framing technique, using the silhouette of a person's head and hand in the foreground to frame a distant shipping port scene. The person is likely looking out or gesturing towards the scenery. The focus of the image is on a large cargo ship, marked by a prominent \"M\" on its funnel, docked at the port. This ship is flanked by large cranes and surrounded by an abundance of shipping containers stacked in neat rows. The containers display a variety of markings, suggesting diverse contents and origins.\n\nThe background reveals a clear sky, hinting at good weather, while a hint of natural landscape is visible far in the distance, beyond the industrial port setup. The lighting in the image suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, giving the scene a slightly muted yet vibrant feel. This composition artistically combines elements of human interest with industrial activity, emphasizing depth and perspective.","title":"Unloading a matson liner at Honolulu pier","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["555270","550910","544655","551577","555261","555722","555283","555760","552303","550918","555271","548127","546828","552244","550906","551558"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["port","shipping","ship","container","funnel","origin","abundance","technique","contents","flanke"]}
