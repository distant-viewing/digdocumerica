{"path":"557296.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a view of industrial smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke against a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, emphasizing a sense of restricted access. Attached to this fence is a sign with bold lettering. The sign reads “$32 MILLION WET SCRUBBERS ENVIRONMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT” and features a logo that includes elements reminiscent of the U.S. flag, with horizontal stripes and a circle possibly representing stars.\n\nThe photograph clearly contrasts the industrial activity marked by the smokestacks and the environmental initiative highlighted on the sign. The smoke billowing from the chimney stacks twists into unusual shapes as it rises into the sky, possibly influenced by winds. The focus on environmental improvement in the presence of heavy industrial output illustrates a tension or effort towards balancing industrial development with environmental conservation.","title":"Smoke from stacks at the Philips Power Station owned by the Duquesne Light Company and located on the Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh. The sign in the foreground notes a $42 million environment improvement project to install wet scrubbers to minimize emissions. Some corrosion with the scrubbers during the shakedown phase.","placename":"Beaver County (Pa.)","location":"Beaver County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557297","545241","550998","546141","550169","544735","551034","557373","550981","545468","557302","543013","550905","545910","550184","545990"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","output","fence","smoke","tension","sign","circle","link","star","conservation"]}
