{"path":"547544.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural marsh scene. It prominently features a body of water that meanders through a landscape populated with dense grass and other marshland vegetation. The water is calm, with little reflection, suggesting either overcast lighting or diffusion through the marsh grasses.\n\nThe foreground displays tall, green marsh grasses partially submerged in the water. These grasses have a vivid and somewhat glossy texture, suggesting moistureâ€”either from the water or possibly from a recent rainfall. There is a gentle curve in the water's edge, leading the viewer's eye towards the middle and background of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the water opens up into a broader expanse. More marsh vegetation can be seen scattered throughout this larger water body. The background also hints at more dense foliage and possibly some gently sloped landforms in the distance. \n\nThe color palette is natural and earthy, with various shades of green, brown, and hints of blue from the water. There are no visible human activities, buildings, or any artificial structures which signifies that the area is relatively untouched and natural. The overall composition and natural lighting evoke a tranquil, wild atmosphere typical of marshland environments.","title":"Tiverton salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547500","547604","547589","553085","544515","547532","550788","547547","544765","550345","544773","547924","545008","553856","554717","547017"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["marsh","grass","water","diffusion","landform","rainfall","signify","moisture","meander","open"]}
