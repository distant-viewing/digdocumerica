{"path":"546468.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph features a distinctive building set against a natural landscape. The building, which is the main subject, has an unusual architectural design resembling a pyramid or triangular prism shape, featuring a pointed top. It has a dark facade, possibly made of shingles, and includes a singular circular window near the apex with a white or light-colored emblem that resembles an R within a circle.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows an expansive, gently sloping lawn scattered with numerous small white objects that could be flowers, stones, or litter. A few young, sparsely branched trees are visible on the lawn, suggesting a park or a similarly landscaped area.\n\nThe backdrop is composed of mature trees, mostly leafless, which may indicate that the photograph was taken during autumn or winter. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a somewhat muted and somber tone.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the striking geometry of the building and its contrast with the natural surroundings. The photograph appears to have been taken from a distance to encompass the complete setting, emphasizing the solitary prominence of the architectural structure within a natural context.","title":"First baptist church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546473","546484","546472","546469","546481","546480","546542","546463","556628","546464","556623","548866","556644","555318","548946","542593"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["lawn","apex","pyramid","resemble","prominence","circle","encompass","emblem","shingle","autumn"]}
