{"path":"546975.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene inside an old, rustic arcade or game room. The architecture of the room includes an all-wooden interior with wooden beams supporting the roof, and wooden planks making up the walls and floor. The room appears to be spacious, with ample ambient light filtering in, likely from openings not visible in the image.\n\nIn the room, several recreational games and activities are underway. To the left, there is a table football (foosball) game, where a man in shorts and a tank top is actively engaged in playing. Another person, a shirtless man with his back to the camera, is paralleled on the other side of the foosball table. Nearby, a third individual, also facing away from the camera, is engaged with a pinball machine.\n\nOn the right side of the room, there are three young women sitting on a wooden bench. They are conversing and enjoying each other's company. Two of them have their backs to the camera, while the third faces the camera directly with a smile. Above them is a wooden staircase leading to a higher level, adding to the architectural interest of the scene.\n\nThroughout the room, various old-style arcade games and pinball machines line the walls, providing a nostalgic ambiance. Signs on the walls enhance the vintage feel, with one noticeable sign that reads \"ONE NITE ONLY.\" This possibly suggests a special event or limited-time gathering at this venue.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of leisure and entertainment in a charmingly aged setting, filled with light-hearted interactions and traditional games.","title":"Fun and games on the popular ocean resort, Isle of Palms","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543975","543990","551290","546025","547794","558302","547376","551279","554897","551293","543041","551320","544198","554866","552646","551267"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["game","room","camera","machine","wall","table","football","back","entertainment","filtering"]}
