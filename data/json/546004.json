{"path":"546004.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph shows a vast accumulation of barrels, piled high and sprawling across the view, seen from behind a chain-link fence that occupies a part of the foreground. The barrels, predominantly bluish-gray with some showing rust or discoloration, are stacked haphazardly, suggesting they may be used for storage or as waste.\n\nIn the background, contrasting with the scattered appearance of the barrels, there are industrial structures. One noticeable feature is a large, round, tank-like structure, possibly a storage silo, which rises prominently against the sky. The sky appears to be overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, which, combined with the industrial setting, gives the photograph an overall gloomy and desolate atmosphere.\n\nThe focus through the diamond patterns of the chain-link fence adds a sense of separation or exclusion, emphasizing that the viewer is an outsider to this scene. This element adds a layer of texture and complexity to the composition, subtly directing attention towards the environmental and industrial implications of such a scene.","title":"A mountain of damaged oil drums near the exxon refinery","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546000","543806","552885","552884","552883","543762","542494","553433","555277","556324","547896","550301","542587","552248","550880","542705"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrel","chain","link","fence","implication","storage","diamond","separation","discoloration","accumulation"]}
