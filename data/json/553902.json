{"path":"553902.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a corrugated metal pipe extending from the foreground into the center of the image, laying horizontally across a barren landscape. The pipe is capped by a rectangular concrete block that sits on its open end, possibly serving as a crude cover or counterweight. The landscape around the pipe is covered in dark soil or sand, with patterns suggesting either wind erosion or vehicle tracks, leading to a minimalistic and slightly eerie visual effect. Sparse vegetation can be seen poking through the soil near the pipe, emphasizing the arid or desolate nature of the environment. The lighting suggests either dawn or dusk, as the sky appears relatively dark, providing a moody atmosphere to the setting.","title":"Sludge from Chicago has been transported by barge and pipe to this pond for experimental use as fertilizer.
