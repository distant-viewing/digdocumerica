{"path":"543613.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a vast body of water, likely a lake, showing a wide, calm expanse of water under a softly colored sky with hues of purple, blue, and hints of pink. In the foreground, there is a single sailboat with its sails down, anchored and stationary on the smooth water surface, reflecting a tranquil and still evening setting.\n\nThe background features distant mountains silhouetted against the sky, indicating that the lake is surrounded by a mountainous terrain. The mountains have a soft bluish hue, possibly due to the distance or the time of day. The sky above is filled with wisps of clouds that are dyed by the colors of the sunset, contributing to the peaceful and picturesque quality of the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests that the photo was taken during twilight, a time when the light is dim and the colors of the environment often appear more saturated and muted. There are no visible human figures or activities; the focus is entirely on the natural beauty of the landscape and the solitary sailboat, creating a reflective and secluded atmosphere. The overall composition of the photo, with horizontal layers of sky, distant mountains, and water, combined with the vertical element of the sailboatâ€™s mast, adds a balanced and harmonious structure to the scene.","title":"Lake tahoe at dusk","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552293","548118","552038","552039","553990","543143","543119","543626","551215","548117","551214","550758","547142","543618","554404","554759"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sailboat","mountain","sunset","wisp","lake","peaceful","sails","stationary","mast","time"]}
