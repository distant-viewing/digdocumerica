{"path":"551891.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image captures a bustling underground metro station scene, presumably from a control room or monitoring center. In the foreground, we see the back of a person, likely a station controller or operator, seated at a console facing several television monitors showing different angles of a metro platform. The operator is in partial view, with the focus mainly from the shoulders upward, discerning that they are wearing a white shirt.\n\nThe console is equipped with numerous old-fashioned monitors and various control equipment and buttons, suggesting the photo is from an earlier era, possibly the 1970s or 1980s given the style of the monitors and the overall setup.\n\nBeyond the glass window that separates the control room from the platform, a lively and somewhat blurred scene of passengers unfolds. People of various demographics are either waiting for trains, boarding, or alighting. The platform is covered, indicated by the arched ceiling, and metro trains are visible on both sides of the platform. The image captures a moment where the trains are stationed, and doors are open since many passengers are standing near the open train doors.\n\nThe station is equipped with bright fluorescent lighting and lined with large advertisements and signs that hang from the ceiling, giving a vibrant but busy aesthetic typical of metro stations during peak hours. The overall composition captures a sense of motion and everyday urban life, with the control room showcasing a juxtaposition of calm technology against the backdrop of the busy passenger movement.","title":"Closed-circuit tv monitors in the station are scanned by a transportation employee.
