{"path":"554906.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two young women in a natural setting. The woman in the foreground is seen from a profile view; she has long, wavy red hair and wears a blue headband. She is smoking a cigarette, holding it delicately with her right hand close to her lips, her eyes slightly closed as if savoring the moment. \n\nThe woman in the background, slightly out of focus, is observing the scene. She has straight, light brown hair styled in braids and is wearing a pink top under a black-and-white checked shirt. She appears relaxed yet attentive, sitting among thick tree roots.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, likely near a body of water as suggested by the presence of water and reflections visible behind the trees. The overall ambiance is serene and slightly rustic, enhanced by the visible textures of the tree bark and the natural light filtering through the foliage. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on the woman smoking and the blurriness of the background, directs attention to the expression and action in the foreground while maintaining a sense of depth and environment.","title":"One girl smokes pot while her friend watches during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas.
