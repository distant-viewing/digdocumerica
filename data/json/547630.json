{"path":"547630.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene from a beautiful wetland area. The main focus is a great blue heron standing at the water's edge. The bird is positioned on the right side of the image, standing tall and looking off to the side, possibly searching for food. Its reflection can be seen on the calm, glassy surface of the water, enhancing the tranquility of the scene.\n\nThe background is lush with green vegetation, including tall grasses and reeds that frame the heron and reflect lightly in the water, adding to the overall calm and natural ambiance of the image. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight appears soft and diffuse.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects visible in the photograph, emphasizing the untouched natural beauty of the wetland environment. This setting provides a habitat for the heron and speaks to the importance of such ecosystems for wildlife. The composition effectively captures the peaceful interplay between wildlife and their natural habitats, offering a moment of stillness and a glimpse into the quiet life of the heron.","title":"Black-crowned night heron","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["548731","545142","544480","544543","545967","543063","557604","550388","548729","545991","544484","544539","544838","544482","544489","548832"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["heron","wetland","habitat","wildlife","importance","reed","food","stillness","bird","ecosystem"]}
