{"path":"544566.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and vivid outdoor scene highlighted by a butterfly interacting with a natural environment. The butterfly, which appears to be of the species commonly known as the Queen Butterfly (Danaus gilippus), is showcased in the midst of a gentle landing or possibly collecting nectar on a slender, upright flowering plant.\n\nThe butterfly has distinctive bright orange wings marked with black lines and white spots towards the edges, a pattern typical for its species. It is positioned almost symmetrically at the top center of the photograph, slightly to the right, with its wings partly open, which adds a dynamic element to the still scene.\n\nThe plant that the butterfly is interacting with consists of a vertical stem, possibly part of a grass or a similar type of flora, which culminates in a dense, brush-like flower cluster. Several such flower clusters are visible in the scene, but focus is on the one that the butterfly is approaching. The flora is green, slender, and vertical, offering a stark, simple contrast to the more ornately patterned butterfly.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a muted blue-gray, likely the sky, which suggests that the photo was taken outdoors under natural light. This backdrop provides a calm, unobtrusive canvas that allows the colors and activity in the foreground to stand out more prominently.\n\nOverall, the composition leans towards a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on the interaction between the butterfly and the plant, making this natural moment the focal point of the visual narration. The imageâ€™s simplicity lends it a sense of tranquility and beauty, capturing a brief snapshot of daily life in nature.","title":"Butterfly and wild flowers near the Shark Valley ranger station","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544553","544479","551381","544517","544619","544603","547818","543603","544514","544618","544614","548284","548283","554839","548281","549144"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","specie","flora","plant","cluster","flower","landing","canvas","brush"]}
