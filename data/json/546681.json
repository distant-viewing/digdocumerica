{"path":"546681.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a busy multilane highway, likely captured during peak traffic hours, indicated by the high volume of cars. The highway stretches vertically through the image, densely packed with vehicles traveling in both directions. A prominent overpass intersects the highway approximately one-third from the bottom of the photograph, with several cars and buses crossing over it.\n\nOn either side of the highway, urban development is visible. To the left, a large structure which could be a warehouse or industrial building is seen, along with a parking lot filled with cars, suggesting a commercial or industrial area. On the right side next to the highway are more commercial-looking buildings, some featuring large parking lots filled with cars, indicating the presence of businesses that draw significant numbers of visitors.\n\nThe top and bottom of the image show more greenery, with trees lining the sides of the roads and a few grassy areas, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment. The overall scene captures a typical bustling cityscape, focused on transportation and commerce, with the infrastructure heavily oriented towards vehicular traffic. The quality and hue of the photograph suggest it might be from an earlier era, possibly the late 20th century, as indicated by the style and model of the vehicles as well as the faded color quality typical of older photos.","title":"Southwest freeway, looking east","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546686","546726","547780","546612","556194","547770","546734","547785","552719","546608","546617","546713","549890","548391","547811","553838"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","car","lot","parking","bottom","traffic","overpass","volume","commerce","quality"]}
