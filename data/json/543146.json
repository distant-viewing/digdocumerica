{"path":"543146.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water, possibly a lake or the ocean. In the foreground are dark silhouettes of rocky formations that create a natural frame for the image. At the center of the image, partially submerged in the water, is an old-fashioned vehicle, possibly a truck from its boxy shape. Beside the vehicle appears to be another smaller item, also partially submerged, which could be a smaller vehicle or perhaps luggage.\n\nBehind these objects, the sun is setting just at the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the water and illuminating both the water and the clouds above with hues of orange and yellow. The backdrop features distant mountains, shadowed in the low light, creating a layered effect in the landscape.\n\nThe tranquil surface of the water reflects the sunlight and the colors of the sunset, adding a peaceful ambiance to the scene. This is further enhanced by the dimly lit, muted colors which suggest the photo was taken during the late evening. The overall composition and the contrasting elements—between the rugged silhouettes in the foreground and the soft, luminous sky and water—create a striking yet tranquil scene, evoking a sense of solitude and the beauty of nature.","title":"The waterfront at sunset","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["554759","557447","552294","554404","543144","544707","550296","544711","552277","552335","550646","545149","547142","551215","547731","557497"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","submerge","water","boxy","vehicle","silhouette","luggage","shadowed","tranquil","illuminat"]}
