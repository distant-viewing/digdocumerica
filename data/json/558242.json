{"path":"558242.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of young people in a cornfield under a bright blue sky. The corn plants are tall, with mature ears and tassels clearly visible, indicating time around late summer or early autumn. The youth are dressed in varied casual attire reflective of cooler weather; this includes long-sleeved shirts, jackets, and a prominent red bandana worn by one individual.\n\nThe group appears engaged in an educational or recreational activity, possibly a field trip, given the natural, exploratory setting. They are scattered throughout the pathway created between the dense rows of corn, with some facing towards each other in conversation, while others are turned away, looking at the plants.\n\nIn the background, beyond the cornfield, there's a glimpse of a clear sky and additional greenery that might be trees or bushes, hinting at a rural or semi-rural location. The overall atmosphere is that of youth engagement with agriculture or nature, with an educational undertone.","title":"Teenagers beginning their summer day detasseling corn in fields near New Ulm, Minnesota.  The hybrid corn seed for the following year is obtained in this manner.  It is one way for young people to make money from the seed corn companies.  The youths earn their pay.  It can be cold, wet work early in the morning when the tall corn plants are covered with heavy dew.  Then it can get hot and muggy as the sun climbs overhead","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558245","558244","544821","557937","555648","558243","557160","543845","554922","545308","554665","543441","544003","543440","558106","555819"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["corn","undertone","ears","bandana","youth","shirts","facing","trip","group","plant"]}
