{"path":"556170.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban residential life, possibly from the late 20th century, judging from the style of the automobiles visible. On the left side, there is a sequence of brick row houses with notable architectural details such as stone trim around the windows and doorways, and metal awnings. Each home features a short flight of stairs leading to the front door, indicative of a classic urban townhouse layout.\n\nIn the center and right-side foreground, there is a street lined with mature, leafy trees that provide dense shade, creating stark areas of light and shadow on the ground. The street appears relatively quiet but maintained.\n\nThe photograph shows a group of children playing in the middle of the street, in the distance. They seem engaged in lively, casual play, typical of residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe general ambiance of the scene is peaceful yet lively, a slice of daily life in what appears to be a close-knit urban community. The clean, orderly appearance of the houses contrasts with some branches and debris on the ground, suggesting recent outdoor activity or maintenance.","title":"Black neighborhood on Chicago's west side.  The west side was hard hit by riots and fires in the mid and late 1960's.  The 1970 census noted that 22 to 29% of the area's residents lived below the official poverty level.  Black businessmen, helped by federal funding reached agreements with national franchises which resulted in pumping $20 million in jobs for residents by 1974","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552761","552743","547433","557365","555900","557290","553550","545398","555895","548441","549296","549287","545372","555940","552756","555905"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["street","sequence","townhouse","play","awning","house","knit","stair","automobile","flight"]}
