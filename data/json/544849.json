{"path":"544849.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures two young adults playing frisbee outdoors in a paved area that appears to be a park or recreational space. The lighting suggests it is either late afternoon or early evening, as the soft, diffuse light casts gentle shadows without harsh contrasts.\n\nIn the foreground, one individual is seen from behind, observing the game or waiting for the frisbee to come their way. This person is dressed in a dark t-shirt and light blue jeans, with their dark hair cut short.\n\nIn the background, the second person is in the motion of catching the frisbee, their stance open and one hand raised towards an incoming pink frisbee. They are dressed in a casual, light-colored t-shirt tucked into high-waisted blue jeans and wears brown sandals. They have medium-length dark hair and appear focused on the frisbee.\n\nBehind them, the setting includes trees lining the edge of the paved area, suggesting the proximity to a wooded or forested area which enhances the serene suburban or possibly semi-rural feel of the scene. There are no visible structures or other people in the immediate area, placing the full focus on the interaction and the simple, leisurely activity between friends.","title":"Frisbee tossing on campground","placename":"Rocky Mountain National Park (Colo.)","location":"Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado","nn1":["555934","557030","552024","551721","551967","551425","557738","557983","555947","556507","553903","547197","553065","551734","547756","551017"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["jean","sandal","tuck","hair","friend","stance","game","person","t","come"]}
