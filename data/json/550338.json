{"path":"550338.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view focusing on a large body of water. The image captures a striking accumulation of logs or driftwood densely packed together, creating an almost semicircular formation on the water's surface. These accumulated logs cover a significant part of the image, extending outward from a heavily forested shoreline. The dark water contrasts sharply with the light color of the logs, enhancing the visibility of the formation.\n\nThe surrounding area features dense, lush green forests, suggesting the setting is in a fairly remote or natural area, likely near a timber or logging operation. The forest forms the background on one side of the photograph, while the other side shows the expansive open water with specks of sunlight reflecting off it, which adds a glittery effect to the water.\n\nThe overall composition and overhead perspective provide a sense of scale and highlight the impact of logging activities on natural water bodies. The picture has a somewhat muted color palette with deep greens, and browns, and the shimmering effect of sunlight adds a dynamic texture to the water surface.","title":"Georgia pacific paper company pulp log boom in the st.
