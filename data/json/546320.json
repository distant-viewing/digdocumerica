{"path":"546320.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a lively and rustic outdoor setting where two people, a man and a woman, are engaged in an activity by a waterbody surrounded by tall grass. The man, shirtless and wearing dark blue shorts, is bending over the water, and it appears that he is pulling something out of the water or examining something in his hands. He has a focused expression and looks partially towards the woman.\n\nThe woman, with long blonde hair, is situated slightly behind the man, partially obscured by the dense, tall reeds. She is smiling, looking engaged in the activity, and appears to be in a crouching position in the water, suggesting they might be collecting or inspecting something together, possibly plants or small aquatic animals.\n\nThe setting is naturalistic, with clear daylight illuminating the scene. The background is mainly filled with reeds and tall grasses which blend into a sky that appears slightly overexposed, hinting at a sunny day. Overall, the atmosphere is casual, focusing on an exploration or activity in a natural environment.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory biologists on a field trip to a salt marsh.
