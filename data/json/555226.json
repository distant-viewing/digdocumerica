{"path":"555226.jpg","date":"May 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a pattern that appears both organic and fluid, reminiscent of flowing water or frost spreading across a surface. Characterized by intricate, swirling lines and patches, the pattern involves shades of white and gray against a predominantly dark background. The abstract shapes and dense formation of white lines suggest a natural, almost fractal-like motif, possibly showing ice formations or sediment patterns in flowing water. The image is void of any human activity or identifiable objects, focusing entirely on the mesmerizing texture and form, evoking a sense of natural artistry and complexity.","title":"The Raft River in Olympic National Timberland, showing pollution.
