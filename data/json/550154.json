{"path":"550154.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of waste collection in an urban setting, featuring various elements of everyday public service activities. In the center and foreground of the image, there are several garbage collectors working. These workers are wearing uniforms, which typically consist of light-colored shirts and darker pants, suggesting they are municipality employees.\n\nThey are engaged in the process of picking up trash from a series of metal garbage bins. These bins, which appear worn and somewhat battered, are scattered across the foreground, filled with assorted waste materials. The garbage workers are methodically collecting the trash from these bins and loading it into a large garbage truck positioned in the background. The truck is predominantly white with some text and logo insignia that are not clearly discernible. The vehicle has a mechanism at the back for possibly compacting and storing the collected waste.\n\nThe surrounding environment points to a residential area with tree-lined streets. One can observe bare trees suggesting that the season might be either autumn or winter. There is a residential element visible in the background, along with parked cars along the curb, indicating a peaceful neighborhood setup. The sky is clear and the overall lighting is bright, suggesting it is a sunny day.\n\nThe image provides a candid look at municipal workers performing the essential function of garbage collection, reflecting daily life and community service in an urban context.","title":"Sanitation department at work near East 125th Street.
