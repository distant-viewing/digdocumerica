{"path":"553413.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid natural scene featuring a fast-flowing river that meanders from the left to the right of the image. The water is turbulent and frothy, indicating strong currents and white water conditions, were likely due to recent rains or upstream waters.\n\nOn the right side of the river, there is a narrow, rocky shoreline where three individuals are walking. They appear to be engaged in some sort of outdoor activity, possibly hiking or exploring the area. The group is equipped with backpacks and casual outdoor attire, suggesting preparedness for a day in the wilderness.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is lush with dense greenery, including a variety of trees and bushes which frame the river and fill the background. The sky appears overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, which enhances the moody, natural ambiance. \n\nThe composition of the image, with its emphasis on the natural environment and minimal human presence, suggests a moment of adventure and exploration in a secluded, possibly remote location.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River.
