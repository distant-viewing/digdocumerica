{"path":"554934.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, three men are seen interacting beside a parked car on a roadside. The setting appears rural, evidenced by a road foregrounding open fields and dispersed buildings, under a wide, clear sky. One of the men is squatting on the ground, while the other two are standing. All three men wear hats, two sporting cowboy hats, and one wearing a cap that complements their casual, work-based attire, including jeans and jackets. Notably, the man in a white coat and cap evokes the look of a butcher or a craftsman.\n\nIn the center of the image, a collection of deer pelts and antlers are spread out on the ground, suggesting the men have been participating in hunting. The pelts and antlers are raw and freshly collected, placed directly on the grass. \n\nThe background includes another older building and parts of perhaps a small local community, underscoring a rusticity associated with rural life and outdoor activities typically found in such settings. The presence of an old car with a trunk slightly ajar adds a vintage feel to this scene, alluding to a period setting in the late 20th century. The photograph captures a moment of social interaction likely centered on the day's hunting endeavors.","title":"Farmer selling his furs to a buyer in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554925","552587","554675","546094","546132","554939","552585","552588","546137","557061","557145","554685","558313","546144","554922","554026"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["hunting","antler","man","cap","deer","hat","cowboy","endeavor","roadside","car"]}
