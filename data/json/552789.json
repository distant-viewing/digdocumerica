{"path":"552789.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a parking lot where a group of men are gathered around a white sedan with its hood open, seemingly engrossed in a discussion possibly about the car's engine or mechanical features. The car prominently features a circular logo that includes a green and yellow design.\n\nThe group consists of five men, four who are facing the camera and one whose back is turned. They appear professionally dressed, mostly in suits or formal attire, suggesting a business or formal event. Their attire and the setting hint at a possible corporate demonstration or inspection of the vehicle.\n\nThe background shows other parked cars and a van, typical of a spacious public or commercial parking area. Notably, there is a street sign indicating \"FIRE ROUTE NO PARKING ANY TIME\" in the upper left, emphasizing the setting in a regulated area.\n\nThe overall setting appears to be a cloudy day given the overcast sky, which adds a muted tone to the color palette of the scene. The landscaping includes small shrubbery and trees, suggesting a maintained outdoor area of a commercial or possibly governmental facility. The architecture visible includes low, flat buildings, likely commercial in nature.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor.
