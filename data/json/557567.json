{"path":"557567.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an exterior wall of a rustic wooden structure, likely a small shop or post office. The main focus is a vibrant, highly stylized mural painted on a protruding shelf above an entryway.\n\nThe mural features a series of bold, simplified illustrations of various objects against a red background. From left to right, the objects include a plate, a wine bottle, a heart shape, a large apple, sushi rolls, a soda can, a slice of bread, another round object, newspapers, a vegetable (possibly a lettuce), a carrot, and a hand holding a tool (possibly a grooming brush).\n\nBelow the shelf, attached to the wooden wall, is a traditional blue U.S. mailbox labeled \"LETTERS,\" demonstrating some usage wear such as paint chipping. Adjacent to the mailbox on the left, a small sign reading “CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY” is tacked above the mailbox, further suggesting that this building serves some commercial function. Next to the mailbox, there is a metal-framed window covered with a protective wire mesh and a sign inside indicating \"POST OFFICE,\" which confirms the facility's postal function.\n\nThe use of simple, colorful iconography on the mural contrasts with the utilitarian and somewhat weathered appearance of the post office setup, providing an interesting visual juxtaposition of art versus functional public service in a rustic setting.","title":"Country store with a painted front advertising items for sale at Malibu Lake in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located at the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549005","549006","557657","550991","549196","557950","555911","557759","547296","552468","547881","544113","544373","550141","556984","552511"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["mailbox","mural","shelf","function","office","object","roll","soda","entryway","illustration"]}
