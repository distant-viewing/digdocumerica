{"path":"547016.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet slightly somber riverside scene characterized by muted colors and early morning light. In the foreground, there is a vast spread of discarded oyster shells covering the riverbank, which adds texture and highlights environmental concerns. A wooden boat is moored in shallow water near the center of the image, and a single figure stands beside it, possibly arranging or inspecting something inside the boat. This person is dressed in dark, non-descript clothing, which contrasts with the lighter water and sky.\n\nBeyond the immediate scene, the river extends smoothly towards a misty background. On the right side of the photograph, there is a simple wooden structure built over the water, likely a dock or a platform related to aquaculture or fishing activities. This structure, along with a few sparse trees visible on the far bank, adds a sense of depth and tranquility to the scene. The entire composition evokes a quiet morning by the water, with a focus on daily work related to the oyster industry, underlined by an expansive but concerning accumulation of shells at the river's edge.","title":"At the blufton oyster co-op, a black-owned business","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["552806","557234","545005","551981","545095","552809","547965","551282","547549","546984","554147","548235","557239","545043","550831","544567"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["oyster","concern","aquaculture","arran","moor","boat","shell","morning","underlin","accumulation"]}
