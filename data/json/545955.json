{"path":"545955.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph displays a scene in an urban or semi-urban setting with automotive-related elements. Dominating the upper part of the image are large signs, with the topmost sign featuring blue letters on a yellow background spelling \"KEN.\" Below this is a larger billboard style sign that reads \"AUTO PARTS\" across it. There is additional text saying \"WHOLESALE AND RETAIL\" inside an oval and a phrase that seems to read \"Best prices in the city.\"\n\nBelow these signs, you can see a grounded scene that is quite intriguing. The main subject there is the front end of a yellow car (likely a vintage model due to its design) which is oddly buried nose-first into the ground with the rear end sticking up vertically. The vehicle is split almost symmetrically down the middle, and both its doors are detached and propped open to the sides. The backdrop consists of a red wooden fence that runs parallel to the car and signs, adding a rustic touch to the setting. Additionally, there is a reddish-brown gravel or dirt ground that covers the area.\n\nThis scene creates a visually striking and somewhat surreal depiction, highlighted by the contrast between the commercial signs and the bizarrely positioned car parts. The composition and the setting suggest a mix of commercial advertising and possibly an artistic or promotional stunt involving the car installation.","title":"Junked autoMobile parts and billboards deface city","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546816","542636","549871","553489","543680","554302","544720","554355","552995","553863","555492","544584","552083","553488","542640","549107"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["sign","car","end","spell","retail","detach","bury","phrase","prop","price"]}
