{"path":"551285.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals swimming in the ocean. The image is taken during the day with natural lighting that casts a glossy reflection on the water surface. The entire background is covered by the dark blue tones of the ocean water, which occupies the whole of the image. Both swimmers have their heads above water and appear to be mid-motion, suggesting they are actively swimming. Neither are wearing any visible floatation devices or swimming aids. The photo conveys a sense of leisure and relaxation, highlighted by the calm appearance of the water's surface.","title":"Swimming in the lake of the ozarks just west of bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557481","545853","543065","548844","553071","548835","553430","556295","548675","548834","544291","543397","554066","553444","552227","553449"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["swim","ocean","swimmer","swimming","aid","water","relaxation","device","surface","occupy"]}
