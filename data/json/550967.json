{"path":"550967.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"In this photograph, a small, informal group of three people is engaged in a friendly conversation on a city street beside a light blue vintage van. The scene captures a sunny day, and the environment suggests an urban setting with commercial buildings in the background. To the right, a building displays a sign advertising \"Borstelman\" and \"Salamies,\" indicating that these are likely business names.\n\nThe individuals in the photo include two men and one woman. The man on the left, partially obscured by the van, appears to be wearing a dark blazer and jeans. He seems to be looking at something the woman, located in the center of the group, is holding. This woman is dressed in a long, brightly patterned skirt and a dark sweater; she is also wearing sunglasses and seems actively engaged in the conversation, smiling and looking at the third person, another man, who is dressed in a light-colored shirt and khaki pants. This third man is focused on her, possibly listening or speaking.\n\nThere are several other elements visible in the background: promotional signs, other street fittings like light posts, and quite a few trees which indicate it might be a suburban part of a city or a town with some greenery. A distinctly 1970s feel permeates the photograph, suggested by the style of the van, clothing, and general aesthetic of the scene.","title":"Downtown Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
