{"path":"551084.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, rich in detail and activity, which seems to be taken during a sunny day. The setting appears to be a residential neighborhood with a mix of natural and man-made elements.\n\nForeground:\nIn the foreground, a group of young people is walking along a paved sidewalk. The group consists of five individuals in casual summer attire such as shorts and t-shirts, suggesting warm weather. Their attire and relaxed demeanor imply leisure or possibly heading to a nearby destination for recreation. On the right side of the image, two women are interacting with a large classic car of a blue tone parked by the curb. They seem to be engaged in conversation, possibly entering or exiting the vehicle.\n\nVehicles:\nThe prominent vehicle in the image is a classic, blue car parked on the street. It has distinctive chrome detailing and the shape suggests it could be from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Its vintage style adds to the nostalgic feel of the image.\n\nBackground:\nBeyond the immediate activity, there is a residential building painted red, which stands out against the greenery surrounding it. The presence of other residential buildings can be seen as well, each with distinct colors and styles, typical of suburban neighborhoods. Taller trees and lush green shrubs populate the area, complementing the grassy patches visible around the sidewalk.\n\nAdditional Elements:\nThere is also a visible sign that reads \"PENNSYLVANIA,\" hung on what looks like a railroad crossing sign, adding a slight industrial touch to the scene. Various utility poles and lines stretch across the field of view, typical of such residential areas.\n\nThe overall composition combines elements of everyday life with a palpable sense of a close-knit community ambiance, encapsulating a moment in time in this neighborhood.","title":"Off for a day's outing at glasgow swimming pool","placename":"Charleston (W.
