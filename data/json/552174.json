{"path":"552174.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely a logging or timber processing area. The foreground is dominated by tall, weathered, wooden posts and poles rising vertically from water, possibly part of a jetty or docking structure. Some of these wooden structures are jagged at the top, suggesting they are weather-worn or broken.\n\nFloating on the water there are logs and debris, organized in a somewhat haphazard manner. These logs could be awaiting processing or transportation. The surface of the water reflects some of the vertical posts, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe background features a panoramic view of distant mountains with visible snowcaps, suggesting this might be located near a mountain range or in a temperate region. Between the foreground and the mountains, a silhouette of tree tops and possibly other vegetation is noticeable, creating a contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo is somewhat eerie due to the silhouetted, stark features of the wooden structures against a pale sky, which likely provides a commentary on the impact of industrial activities on natural environments. The lighting seems to cast a bluish tint, giving the image a cold and desolate feel.","title":"Logs on mud flats of Snohomish River estuary at low tide","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552160","552249","552161","552240","552162","545256","545266","543749","547585","550332","552163","546236","550349","542944","552170","545260"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["post","mountain","log","processing","await","jetty","docking","commentary","timber","logging"]}
