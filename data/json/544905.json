{"path":"544905.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, vast natural landscape dominated by a dramatic sky. The foreground features a flat, open field lightly covered with snow and dotted with small dark green conifers. These trees are sparsely distributed across the landscape, adding a sense of sparse vegetation and ruggedness to the terrain. \n\nThe middle ground presents a bold contrast with a chain of mountains stretching across the image. These mountains are moderately covered with snow, indicating a cold climate, and they exhibit undulating peaks that add a sense of majesty and natural beauty to the scene.\n\nThe sky, taking up the upper two-thirds of the photograph, is the most dramatic element. It is filled with large, billowing cumulus clouds that are dense and voluminous, giving an impression of a dynamic and possibly changing weather system. The clouds are illuminated by sunlight, with varying tones of white and gray that suggest depth and texture. Intermittently, patches of blue sky peek through these clouds, creating a lively contrast.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its expansive sky, rugged terrain, and minimal human presence evokes a feeling of solitude and the untouched beauty of a natural wilderness environment. The color palette of cool blues and whites further emphasizes the chilly, serene atmosphere.","title":"Thunderclouds over grassy plateau","placename":"South Park (Colo. : Flat)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544901","550610","550408","550592","555662","550604","552173","550415","543712","544857","545907","542842","552906","550416","550399","550441"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["cloud","snow","cumulus","majesty","conifer","ruggedness","third","mountain","chain","terrain"]}
