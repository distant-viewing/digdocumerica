{"path":"552581.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a rustic rural scene during what appears to be the late evening, due to the long shadows and warm lighting. In the foreground, a man, likely a farmer or rancher, is seen standing by a wooden gate in a pen area. He is dressed in work attire which includes denim jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. He is adjusting his hat with both hands, and his posture suggests he might be either tired or taking a break.\n\nTo his right, there is a child seated on what seems to be a small four-wheeled cart or possibly a simplistic wooden toy. The child is observing the man, contributing to a relaxed and familial atmosphere.\n\nThe background features a large green field bordered by wooden fences that stretch across the scene, surrounded by rolling hills. A few buildings, perhaps farmhouses or barns, are visible in the distance, painted in a faded red. This combined with the lush greenery suggests a well-maintained rural property.\n\nThe scene exudes a serene ambiance, emphasizing a moment of casual interaction in a farm-setting with the elements of labor and nature beautifully intertwined. The long shadows cast by the late evening sun create dramatic patterns on the ground, enhancing the aesthetic and emotive quality of the photograph.","title":"At the oldlands' summer cow camp fifteen miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
