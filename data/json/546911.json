{"path":"546911.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene at a construction site. It features a worker suspended in mid-air. The worker is harnessed to a vertical cable, which is connected to a large hook and a series of mechanical pulleys or links, suggesting heavy-duty equipment typically used for lifting materials or personnel in construction settings. The person, dressed in safety attire including a helmet and work boots, appears engaged in a specific task or in the process of being transported to or from a work area within the site.\n\nThe background shows a clear sky with few clouds, which hints the photo was taken on a fair weather day. To the right of the person in the air, there is a massive concrete structure, possibly a column or pillar, part of the construction framework suggesting that this site is perhaps for a large building or infrastructure project. The overall composition highlights the heights and the risks involved in construction work, as well as the crucial role of safety equipment in such environments.","title":"Construction: A beltway bridge across Curtis Bay","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["544394","546929","544159","546837","557731","547218","556185","547989","546869","549529","553924","555373","543594","556186","553618","542857"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["construction","site","safety","work","worker","pulley","air","personnel","hook","link"]}
