{"path":"548113.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene and joyful moment at a body of water, capturing three girls enjoying their time in shallow water. The setting is dominated by the texture of the water surface, shimmering subtly under a seemingly bright day.\n\nTo describe the individuals and the scene more fully:\n- On the left, there is a girl seated on a black inflatable ring, leaning back with both hands placed on the ring, partially submerged in the water. Her expression is relaxed and she appears to be in mid-conversation with the others.\n- In the middle, there is a girl with her back to the camera. She is facing the other two girls and seems to be standing in the shallow water, engaging with the girl seated in the inflatable ring.\n- On the right, another girl, standing and facing towards the camera, appears to be slightly more submerged in the water compared to the others. She seems animated, possibly laughing or calling out, contributing to a lively atmosphere.\n\nEach girl wears a swimsuit, appropriate for the water setting. The general ambiance is quite typical of youthful leisure, with clear skies and a vast expanse of calm water creating a soothing backdrop. The photo captures a snapshot of friendship and carefree summer activities.","title":"Swimming is good at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["551160","555941","556295","553449","543458","552702","557740","556293","553431","547688","551409","544185","553435","554904","543466","544187"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["girl","ring","water","friendship","swimsuit","other","camera","snapshot","summer","expanse"]}
