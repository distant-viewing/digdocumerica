{"path":"553491.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene involving three individuals and several vehicles in what appears to be an urban environment, possibly a parking area near residential buildings. The focal point is an old black car with distinctive round headlights and a partial view of its vanity license plate. A key part of the scene involves a man lying partially underneath this car, his body from the waist up obscured beneath it, suggesting he might be working on or inspecting the vehicle. He is wearing a mustard-colored shirt and brown pants.\n\nStanding beside the car is another man, dressed casually in a white T-shirt and brown trousers, looking downward presumably at the man under the car. Behind them, another vehicle, a 1960s station wagon, is parked. Another man, appearing somewhat blurred, is nearby this second vehicle, dressed in dark clothing and observing the situation.\n\nThe background features older buildings with exposed brick and some white siding, enhancing the sense of an older urban neighborhood. The ground is littered with leaves, indicating either disuse or an autumn season. The overcast sky and diffuse lighting suggest it might be a cloudy day. This image captures a moment that seems both everyday and unusual, focusing on automotive maintenance or an issue in a dense cityscape.","title":"The watkins of mulky square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for i-635.
