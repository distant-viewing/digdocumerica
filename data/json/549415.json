{"path":"549415.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people enjoying a sailing experience in a distinctive and vibrant sailboat on what appears to be a calm body of water. The sailboat, predominantly red with heart-shaped patterns and other decorative elements, gives it an unconventional and lively look.\n\nThe image shows at least six people aboard this unique vessel. A man at the stern is actively engaged in handling the boat, either steering or manipulating some equipment. Nearby, another passenger is also engaged in some activity, possibly related to the operation of the boat. The remaining individuals are seated or squatting along the length of the boat, dressed casually and sporting relaxed, cheerful expressions, suggesting a leisurely outing.\n\nKey features include the large, colorful sail that is partially raised, fluttering slightly in what seems to be a gentle breeze. The boat also has additional riggings and ropes that add to its intricate appearance. A smaller black rowboat is visible tethered to the sailboat, contributing to the busy, utilitarian feel of the scene.\n\nThe backdrop is a tranquil water surface extending to a hazy, tree-lined shore, enhancing the idyllic, outdoorsy atmosphere of the scene. The sunlit water and clear skies suggest a perfect day for sailing, making the overall feeling of the photograph one of leisure and enjoyment in a unique maritime setting.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549410","549412","547465","548524","549413","549386","548513","549411","549397","549392","548509","549399","548511","547458","547453","548508"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["sailboat","boat","sailing","stern","rowboat","heart","rigging","maritime","breeze","outing"]}
