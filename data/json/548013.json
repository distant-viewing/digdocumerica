{"path":"548013.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a dam complex situated in a rugged landscape. The dam is large and spans across a body of deep blue water. It features several gates and has infrastructure including structures and roads leading up to and alongside it, indicating its substantial size and function. Power lines emanate from the dam, streaking across the lower part of the image. This gives a strong geometric pattern against the natural water and land surfaces.\n\nBehind the dam is a large, barren hill or mountain that dominates the background. Its surface is almost devoid of vegetation, primarily composed of rocky and dusty terrain displaying deep earthly tones. The steep slope of the mountain creates a dramatic backdrop, emphasizing the engineering feat of the dam in the foreground.\n\nIn the middle distance, behind the dam and on the left side of the image, there are some white buildings clustered together, looking like an industrial or administrative complex associated with the dam. These buildings contrast with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe overall composition captures a strong contrast between human-made structures and the rugged natural environment, showcasing human intervention in a stark, natural landscape. The clarity and brightness of the image highlight details like the texture of the mountain and the reflective surface of the water.","title":"The john day dam with martin marietta aluminum plant in background","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548927","548936","548920","548947","548975","548007","544166","548012","549004","548938","548003","553828","544140","544141","548940","548925"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","mountain","complex","gate","surface","emanate","streak","intervention","engineering","brightness"]}
