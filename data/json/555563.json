{"path":"555563.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor industrial or construction scene likely taken under overcast or dreary weather conditions. The central focus is on two men standing near a dirt pathway that edges a small, narrow waterway or ditch filled with muddy water. The surrounding area is densely populated with tall, wild grass and small shrubs, suggesting a somewhat neglected or undeveloped area.\n\nThe two men, both wearing hard hats, are engaged in what appears to be an examination or discussion regarding the site. The man on the left is dressed in a dark blue shirt and darker pants, and is facing away from the camera, showing just a side glimpse of his face. He holds a clipboard or some similar item, which suggests he might be taking notes or assessing the site. The man on the right wears a light-colored shirt with a distinctive pattern and lighter-colored pants; he is also partly facing away from the camera, looking out towards the ditch.\n\nIn the background, beyond the grassy area, there are indistinct structures that could be warehouses or industrial buildings, alongside utility poles which line the horizon. To the right side of the image, there is a yellow construction machine or equipment, possibly a crane or a mobile lift, which is parked beside the railroad tracks that intersect the photo from the right foreground to the center middle ground of the composition.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of professional assessment or inspection in a semi-rural or industrial setting, focusing on infrastructure or environmental conditions.","title":"Epa authorities supervise a hastily constructed holding pond containing water treated for removal of chromium.
