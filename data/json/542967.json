{"path":"542967.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features a large historic house in a scenic setting, predominantly capturing an architectural marvel surrounded by lush greenery. The house appears to be from the late Victorian era, evident from its architectural elements such as the decorative gables, a pointed turret, ornamental wooden trim, and expansive bay windows that allow ample light inside. On the right, there is a distinctive turret topped with a conical roof and a weather vane, which add to the vintage charm of the structure.\n\nA stately palm tree towers on the left side of the frame, complementing the height of the house and contrasting with the more traditional landscaping elements visible. This suggests that the property might be located in a region where such tropical vegetation and historical architectural styles coexist, possibly California or a similar climate.\n\nThe house is painted in bright, appealing colors that seem to highlight its detailed craftsmanship. The front garden area, partly visible, shows well-maintained greenery, stepping stones, and possibly a small decorative fence or border.\n\nThe background includes a partially visible building on the left, likely another period structure similar in style to the main house. This could suggest that the location is part of a preserved historical neighborhood or a specially maintained heritage site. The hills in the far distance under a clear sky give the location a serene, isolated feeling.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on historical architecture, majestic flora, and a serene backdrop, provides a visual narrative of a place rich in history and natural beauty.","title":"Victorian architecture survives in Eureka","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["558159","558156","548666","555578","548663","555579","557072","557076","542816","557071","546439","542818","557069","548659","548661","558150"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["house","turret","marvel","heritage","gable","craftsmanship","landscaping","palm","location","trim"]}
