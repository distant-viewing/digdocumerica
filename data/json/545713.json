{"path":"545713.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The image depicts a close-up view of numerous plant stalks or stems against a blurred, indistinct background. These long, slender stalks are vertically oriented and possess a dark hue, contrasted starkly by whimsical, lighter-colored curly cues twining around them. These curls look thin and delicate, with a white or silvery color that makes them strikingly visible against the dark stems. The curls vary in shape and size, ranging from tight small spirals to loose larger coils, giving the scene a texture that is both intricate and organic. The background seems naturally diffused, enhancing the focus on the detailed curl patterns and the texture of the stems. This composition captures the complexity and intriguing beauty of plant life, focusing on the unique physical features of the plant.","title":"Utah--near Moab","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["557625","555052","552554","555053","546156","555039","555106","555031","557169","542687","555184","545707","558077","557617","555049","555022"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stalk","stem","plant","dark","complexity","texture","shape","size","hue","pattern"]}
