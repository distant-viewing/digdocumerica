{"path":"552047.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph displays an industrial waterfront scene under a clear blue sky. The image is taken from the bank of a body of water, possibly a river, which reflects the structures on its surface. Prominently in the view are several large industrial buildings, including a grain elevator complex and a bascule bridge, which is partially raised.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a large, dark structure with multiple cylindrical and rectangular silos dominates the scene. Attached to these silos are smaller buildings and metal frameworks. Moving to the center and right portion of the image, there is a metal bascule bridge with one section lifted, allowing for river traffic. Beside the bridge, there are more industrial facilities, including a grey building with additional silos.\n\nIn the foreground, the shoreline is rocky and littered with bits of debris and several logs, leading up to a quay where a few small boats are moored. The water is calm and bears the mirror images of the structures that line the banks. The overall setting appears to be a busy, functional industrial area. No people are visible in the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention on the industrial architecture and the serene waterway.","title":"Lower portion of the Buffalo river before it joins the niagara river at the north-east tip of lake erie","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["546823","546876","552070","551609","548375","555731","551577","547890","547586","550890","555758","550900","552207","549976","551515","551980"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["silo","bridge","bits","banks","grain","lift","moo","waterfro","metal","river"]}
