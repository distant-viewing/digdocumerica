{"path":"553907.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures the scene of a man interacting with a piece of equipment outdoors. It is a daytime setting with a clear blue sky scattered with streaky clouds. The man appears to be conducting some kind of experiment or demonstration by a busy road, as evident by the vehicles in motion on the road visible in the background.\n\nThe man, positioned in the foreground but towards the right side of the frame, is wearing a casual buttoned shirt and slacks. His attention is focused on a large, box-like device which has knobs and possibly meters on its surface. He appears to be adjusting or manipulating these controls, suggesting the device is part of his work or experimentation.\n\nBeside him, to the left in the frame, stands a tall, narrow, triangle-shaped object that resembles a fin or blade, leading to an industrial or technological context for the image. This object adds a dramatic vertical element to the composition. Also noticeable are other pieces of equipment next to the man, possibly part of the setup for whatever task he is undertaking.\n\nThe image has a silhouetted quality due to the brightness of the sky in contrast with the darker foreground where the man and equipment are situated. This lighting creates a somewhat mysterious and dramatic mood. The busy road in the top third of the photo provides a sense of location and activity, hinting that this scene takes place next to a highway or major road, likely on the outskirts of a urban area given the distant view of buildings and billboards near the horizon.","title":"An epa-supported study on noise and its effects.
