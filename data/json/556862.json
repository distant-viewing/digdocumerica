{"path":"556862.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two workers engaged in railroad track maintenance activities. The scene is set outdoors, likely in a rural or semi-rural area, as suggested by the presence of trees and a house in the far background beyond the railroad tracks.\n\nOn the left side of the image, an older man is operating a heavy-duty, red and orange rail maintenance machine mounted on the tracks. He is wearing blue work clothes, a hard hat, and eye protection, focusing intently on his task. The machine appears complex, featuring various hoses, levers, and mechanical parts.\n\nTo the right, a younger man stands observing or waiting. He is dressed casually in a light blue shirt and khaki pants. His pose—hands in pockets and a contemplative expression—suggests he might be supervising the activity or preparing for his role in the operation.\n\nThe environment around the workers is lush with greenery, indicating it might be late spring or summer. The weather seems overcast, adding a subdued tone to the overall atmosphere. The railroad tracks stretch parallel into the distance, framed by gravel and intermittent grassy patches, emphasizing the linear perspective in the composition. The inclusion of these human elements highlights the ongoing maintenance essential for railroad safety and efficiency.","title":"Southern railway track repair crew removes old rails and replaces them with new quarter mile long rails in a regular program to improve the company's 10,531 miles of track.  On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to halt work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day.  The crew numbers 50 to 55 men, and southern has an average of four working throughout the system","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556883","556869","556872","556874","556881","556860","556897","556901","556898","556889","556899","556875","556884","556871","556887","556895"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railroad","track","maintenance","machine","worker","lever","efficiency","supervise","khaki","inclusion"]}
