{"path":"553530.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This is a photograph taken in a small, dimly lit bathroom. The composition includes a young woman standing to the left side of the frame, beside a clawfoot bathtub. She has shoulder-length brown hair and is wearing a dark dress or shirt. Her expression appears somewhat weary or concerned.\n\nNext to her, on the floor, there’s a peculiar arrangement where it seems like a doll’s legs are protruding from under the toilet, which has its lid up. The lower part of the doll is visible, and it lies on the patterned floor, contributing to a somewhat eerie or unusual atmosphere in the photo.\n\nThe toilet is positioned in the right foreground of the image, and there is a bucket inside it, possibly for makeshift plumbing or as a repair. A large container, labelled partly visible as “OXYDOL,” is placed on top of the toilet seat, adding a sense of clutter or disrepair to the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere is further defined by muted colors and an off-white curtain which diffuses light coming in from a window not visible in the frame. The overall low-light conditions and the color palette consisting mainly of dark and earthy tones enhance the photo's moody and almost surreal quality.","title":"Sandy Watkins, 12, does the family wash in the bathroom of her house in Mulky Square.
