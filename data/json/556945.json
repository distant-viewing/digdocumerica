{"path":"556945.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a coastal urban area. The image captures a dense layout of buildings and infrastructure adjacent to a large body of water. The coast curves slightly, and numerous docks extend into the water, indicating a function as a port or harbor.\n\nThe body of water is vast and calm with minimal visible wave activity, showing a faint reflection of the urban area. Several ships and water vessels are scattered across the harbor, varying in size, mostly parked alongside the docks. The topography surrounding the urban area consists of hills, covered partially by a mix of greenery and buildings, suggesting a combination of residential and forested areas.\n\nThe sky above is clear, indicating good weather conditions, and the overall color tone of the photograph leans towards a dull bluish-grey, possibly due to the camera or light settings when the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a comprehensive view of a busy, working port city, encompassing its maritime infrastructure and the interface between the urban landscape and the natural environment.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest toward the head of sinclair inlet, including the downtown waterfront of Bremerton.
