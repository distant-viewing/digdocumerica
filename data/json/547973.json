{"path":"547973.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil beach scene with prominent dune preservation efforts. In the foreground, a bold sign mounted on a dark pole reads \"KEEP OFF THE DUNES\" in white capitalized letters against a black background, indicating a conservation measure to protect the sand dunes. Adjacent to the sign, portions of broken fences made of wooden slats and wire are scattered and buried partially in the sand. This likely serves to stabilize the dunes and prevent further erosion.\n\nThere are wooden fences that are intact, running along the boundary of the dunes, which are covered with sparse vegetation. To the right and behind the sign, a large, sandy dune dominates the middle part of the frame, illustrating the natural landscape typical of coastal regions.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is visible, calm, with a clear horizon. There is a person sitting alone near the water, providing a sense of scale and solitude. The beach appears mostly deserted, giving the scene a tranquil and undisturbed atmosphere.\n\nThe sky above is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day, ideal for beach activities, although the emphasis of the image seems to be on the conservation of the natural dune environment.","title":"Visitors are warned off dunes as part of effort to protect the Sandy Hook beaches from erosion.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["547620","545109","547607","548220","545280","547015","557459","545248","543193","543192","554119","547596","543420","555400","547612","547836"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["dune","beach","conservation","sand","fence","slat","measure","preservation","sign","ideal"]}
