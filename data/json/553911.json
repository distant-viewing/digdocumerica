{"path":"553911.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows a classroom scene with a strong environmental or activist message. In the foreground, we can see a cardboard box with a sign that reads \"FIGHT FOR YOUR WORLD\" in bold, black lettering. The box is taped and appears to be used for collecting items or donations.\n\nThe classroom is filled with students sitting at traditional wooden desks. The focus is on a young student seated at a desk in the center of the image, actively raising their hand, possibly to answer a question or offer an insight. This student is a person of color, wearing a white shirt and focused intently towards the front, where a teacher might be situated. Behind this student, another student can be seen partially; this student has blonde hair and is wearing a patterned top, and is also facing towards the front of the classroom.\n\nThe room is well-lit, with natural light streaming in from large windows visible in the background, and features wooden floors and walls partially paneled with wood, giving it a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition with the environmental slogan in the foreground, and engaged students in the background, suggests a theme of youth involvement and education in environmental activism. The environment appears to be one of learning and participation, indicating a setting that encourages active involvement and awareness amongst students concerning environmental issues.","title":"Children in Fort Smith are learning that protecting the environment will take more than awareness.
