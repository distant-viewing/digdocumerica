{"path":"547575.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial harbor scene, characterized by a slightly dilapidated atmosphere. It is taken from a covered area, possibly under a pier or a dock structure, looking out towards a body of water and industrial buildings. \n\nIn the foreground, you see weathered wooden planks making up the flooring of the pier, and a rusty metal structure, likely part of the support for the pier, framing the left side of the image. The wood planks show signs of wear and disrepair.\n\nBeyond the pier, there is a body of water reflecting some light, indicating it might be either an overcast day or early evening. Across the water, you can see an industrial building with large square windows, some of which are broken or boarded up. The building has a flat roof and is constructed of materials that give it a sturdy, utilitarian look, typical of mid-20th-century industrial architecture.\n\nTo the right, another building painted in a darker color catches the eye. This building has a visible chimney or smokestack, adding to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nIn the water close to the pier are potentially small objects or debris, hinting at the industrial use of the area rather than recreational. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of abandonment or a past peak in activity, typical of many waterfront industrial areas that have seen declines. There are no visible human figures in the scene, reinforcing the sense of emptiness and quiet.","title":"State pier--600 feet along Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547577","547622","547582","549300","548105","546871","547594","551984","551985","547572","552240","547581","547579","543320","551978","546864"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pier","plank","emptiness","boarde","building","flooring","rusty","decline","harbor","sturdy"]}
