{"path":"550368.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph features an expansive view of a murky, possibly polluted water body with an interesting texture on the surface. The foreground of the image is framed by a line of thin trees and shrubs that are mostly bare, with a few leaves suggesting it might be either early spring or late autumn. To the left, a segment of railroad tracks runs parallel to the bottom edge, adding an industrial element to the scene. These tracks suggest human presence and might indicate the vicinity of a town or industrial area.\n\nThe water in the photograph has a swirling pattern of whites, grays, and darks, indicating either a mix of substances or reflections that could be from oil or other pollutants. The patterns on the water surface give off an almost marbled effect. The water forms small rippling waves and several lighter circular patches, hinting at possible chemical reactions or disturbances in the water body.\n\nThe setting appears serene yet unnervingly quiet, possibly in a less-visited area due to the conditions of the water. No animals or people are seen, which might further suggest the area's possible unsuitability for recreational or wildlife activities. The overall mood conveyed is one of neglected beauty, where nature endures despite adverse impacts possibly arising from human activities.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the St. Croix River at Calais, down river from the Georgia Pacific paper mill.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["549641","552054","550207","550734","557234","551559","545168","544673","542526","546109","547890","555626","550686","547893","550201","547493"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["water","track","reaction","pollutant","dark","segment","substance","railroad","disturbance","pattern"]}
