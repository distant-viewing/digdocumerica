{"path":"549149.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures the serene and structured beauty of agricultural land. The image predominantly features an expansive field with distinctive, curving swaths of freshly cut hay. These lines create a rhythmic pattern across the landscape, illustrating the methodical process of harvesting. The cut hay is arranged in neat, parallel lines that follow the natural contours of the land, showcasing a combination of agricultural efficiency and aesthetic appeal. \n\nThe background of the photo presents gentle, rolling hills under a wide, slightly overcast sky. Sparse tree lines are visible on the distant hills, adding a touch of greenery and breaking the monotony of the otherwise open landscape. The colors in the image suggest that it might have been taken during the late summer or early autumn, with a palette mainly consisting of golden-brown fields and subtle green shades in the distance.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is balanced between the detailed, patterned foreground and the serene, undulating backdrop, offering a picturesque view of rural farmland activities. The absence of any people or machinery in the shot emphasizes the tranquility and the scale of the agricultural operations.","title":"Hay fields on the john redding ranch in the sarpy basin redding is active in the fight against strip-mining operations of the westmoreland coal company","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549137","549252","549237","549138","545040","557183","554055","549258","552466","548979","551333","549141","555567","554030","554027","549257"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["hay","swath","monotony","efficiency","harvesting","farmland","land","field","line","appeal"]}
