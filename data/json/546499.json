{"path":"546499.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures the juxtaposition of architectural styles and elements, focusing predominantly on contrasting lines and shapes. On the left side of the image, there is a large clock tower clad in a blue material and topped with an ornamental metal lattice structure. The tower features a prominent clock face, just below the intricately designed crown, and stands against a clear, bright sky.\n\nOn the right side, the photo composition is dominated by a modern, linear structure, possibly a building or bridge, characterized by repetitive vertical and diagonal lines that create a geometric pattern. These lines, made of a darker material, contrast sharply with the historical and ornate design of the clock tower.\n\nThe angle of the photograph enhances this contrast; the progressive and stark lines of the modern structure are set against the classical, detailed architecture of the clock tower, illustrating a blend of old and new within the same frame. The juxtaposition not only highlights different architectural philosophies but also suggests a visual narrative about the coexistence of different eras within a single urban landscape.","title":"Courthouse tower with civic mall construction in foreground","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["550062","546557","549997","546490","550001","546503","551442","546508","546521","548649","550011","548057","557237","545873","542794","549880"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["clock","tower","juxtaposition","crown","line","lattice","material","coexistence","design","clothe"]}
