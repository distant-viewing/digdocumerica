{"path":"550611.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph portrays a striking aerial view of a vast landscape, possibly captured during late summer or early autumn. The terrain is a mixture of lightly forested areas and open tundra, stretching towards the horizon. In the foreground, a small, dark blue lake nestles close to the camera, surrounded by undulating hills blanketed in shades of green, brown, and yellow. The shapes of the hills create a pleasing rhythmic pattern, with shadows accentuating their contours.\n\nThe middle ground features similar scenery with additional small lakes scattered across the expanse. The vegetation appears to be sparse, allowing the earthy tones of the soil to show through. This suggests a northern biome, perhaps subarctic or boreal in nature.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic mountain range. The mountains rise sharply against a billowing cloud-filled sky. Patches of snow or glaciers adorn their peaks, hinting at their elevation and ruggedness. The clouds are large and fluffy, suggesting a dynamic weather system typical of such regions.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the serene and untouched nature of a remote wilderness area, offering a sense of tranquility and the vast scale of natural landscapes. There are no visible signs of human activity, emphasizing the wild and pristine quality of the environment.","title":"View north to the Alaska range from a point east of paxson lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550426","550541","550399","550642","550402","550617","550604","555712","555683","542842","550641","543761","550510","550403","556926","555698"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["tundra","glacier","ruggedness","mountain","hill","cloud","undulate","elevation","blanket","billow"]}
