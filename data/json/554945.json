{"path":"554945.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man standing in a somewhat dimly lit environment, likely a work or market area, with an intriguing backdrop. The man, wearing glasses and a red cap, has an expression that suggests both attention and curiosity, enhanced by his focused gaze. He is dressed in a white apron over a striped shirt, indicating he could be a butcher or vendor, supported by the context of his attire and surroundings.\n\nBehind him, there are several large, long pieces hanging, which appear to be meat or related productsâ€”a common sight in a butcher shop. The shadowy nature of the background with these items presents a stark contrast to the brighter foreground where the man stands. The lighting casts gentle highlights on his face and clothes, drawing attention to his central position in the image.\n\nTo the right, beyond the dim interior, an outdoor scene peeks through, suggesting the shop's location at the edge of a wider, possibly rural setting. The outdoor light subtly infiltrates the room, adding layers to the photograph's composition and setting a tone that blends everyday work life with a hint of personal narrative.","title":"Man who prepares fur skins for market in a buyers' shed has skins hanging overhead in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["547427","548218","554926","554941","548252","547313","547338","552103","547179","553516","556563","551340","558330","553176","556443","556084"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["shop","meat","apron","vendor","sight","peek","attention","market","product","curiosity"]}
