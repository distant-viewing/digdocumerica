{"path":"544694.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a striking natural landscape, predominantly featuring textured, hardened lava flows. The surface of the lava is rugged, bumpy, and characterized by a rich array of patterns that resemble wrinkles or brain-like folds. A distinctive feature in this image is a darker, smooth path that winds through the textured terrain, possibly representing a channel or path where lava once flowed more recently before cooling and solidifying.\n\nIn the center of the image, the path forms an unusual, almost circular swirl, where the lava appears to have pooled and swirled before hardening. This circular pattern contrasts with the more linear, chaotic streaks of the surrounding areas. The overall color palette is a blend of dark grayish tones that vary in darkness, possibly reflecting different cooling stages or chemical compositions of the lava.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the topography of the landscape, casting light and shadows that emphasize the depth and complexity of the terrain. There is no visible skyline or horizon line; the focus is solely on the texture and forms of the volcanic landscape, giving the viewer a sense of the dynamic geological processes that shaped this remarkable environment.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["555227","554140","544682","554141","543148","550813","551284","555793","546110","552424","555553","554090","552423","555885","543707","555084"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lava","cool","path","swirl","flow","wrinkle","fold","streak","topography","channel"]}
