The background is dark navy blue, and the text is presented in white and light blue, creating high contrast for clear visibility. The word \"ARRIVALS\" is displayed prominently at the top center in white uppercase letters.\n\nThe board lists several flight arrival times, gates, and cities of origin. Each line includes the scheduled arrival time (displayed in hour and minute, followed by \"AM\"), a gate number, and the city from which the flight is arriving. Examples of cities listed include Tokyo, San Francisco, Manila, Los Angeles, Portland, Guam, and Oakland. The gate numbers vary and are placed in the middle column, while the city names are on the right.\n\nThe format is orderly and structured, providing essential information for passengers or greeters about the flights that are arriving. The overall composition is utilitarian, focused on delivering information efficiently, with no additional decorative elements.","title":"Honolulu International Airport handles almost all of the island's visitors.
