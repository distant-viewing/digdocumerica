{"path":"558094.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene centered around a wide, reflective pond surrounded by lush greenery. On the left side of the image, two people are walking along the grassy edge of the pond, one dressed in a purple outfit and the other in blue, suggesting a leisurely, casual activity. Extending into the pond from the center to the right side of the image is a long wooden pier or boardwalk, which appears to be a viewing or walking platform, as no boats or swimmers are visible.\n\nThe pond itself is calm, speckled with what seems to be small lily pads or floating leaves, contributing to a tranquil natural atmosphere. The reflection of the sky and trees in the water adds a mirror-like quality to the scene. In the background, dense trees create a dark, contrasting backdrop to the bright sunlit water, enhancing the feeling of a secluded, peaceful setting. The overall composition of the photograph, with its rich colors and reflective water, evokes a sense of quiet and relaxation often found in natural park settings.","title":"Platforms float over the lake in the Virginia Kendall Park which allow visitors to observe fish swimming in the water under the water lilies. The park is part of the Akron, Ohio metropolitan park system which in turn is located within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Signed into law in December, 1974, the recreation area includes 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land situated in a 20-mile stretch between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["554591","547536","554776","550779","557783","558093","558095","554623","551776","557515","543561","550784","553410","546963","543611","555229"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pond","boardwalk","swimmer","lily","pad","mirror","relaxation","pier","platform","outfit"]}
