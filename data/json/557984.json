{"path":"557984.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a park entrance sign for \"Deep Lock Quarry Metropolitan Park\" within the Akron Metropolitan Park District. The sign itself is made up of large wooden beams stacked in a tiered fashion, with white text indicating the name of the park. It is positioned on a grassy area with trees in the background. To the right of the sign stands a large, circular stone structure resembling a millstone, mounted on a concrete base.\n\nIn the background of the image, there is a well-maintained lawn juxtaposed against a line of lush, dense trees. Two people are seen riding horses on a path that runs parallel to a fenced area, providing a recreational and scenic aspect to the setting.\n\nTo the left, parked cars are visible from the era indicated by their design, including a yellow car closest to the camera, reflecting the typical automotive styles of the time. The entire scene is bathed in natural light, suggesting it was taken during the day under clear weather conditions.","title":"Entrance to deep lock quarry park on riverview road near Akron, Ohio.  A mill stone from the former quarry is used for identification for the recreation area which is part of the Akron metropolitan park system.  The sandstone in the quarry was used in the 19th century for building material for the Ohio-erie canal and other projects in the area.
