{"path":"549691.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph shows a vintage car parked in an indoor testing facility. The car is a typical American sedan from the mid-20th century, featured in a metallic blue color. The rear view of the car displays large rectangular tail lights, a shiny chrome bumper, and a trunk with prominent badging that reads \"Air Pollution Test Vehicle,\" indicating its use for environmental or emission testing purposes. The license plate shows \"U.S. Government EPA-158.\"\n\nOn the rear windshield, there's a yellow sign with the number \"5\" and the text \"Evaporative Emissions Enclosure,\" suggesting specific testing for evaporative emissions being conducted. The testing environment includes a spacious garage-like area with walls and partial ceilings made primarily of glass panes held by metallic frames. This setup allows for natural light to illuminate the facility. In the background, visible through these glass walls, are various technical and mechanical equipment, likely used for monitoring and conducting vehicle emission tests.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a focus on automotive research, specifically concerning pollution and emission controls. The ambient lighting, the glass structures, and the neatly organized setting emphasize a professional, technical environment dedicated to environmental testing and regulation.","title":"Testing a new car in the evaporative emission enclosure of epa's ann arbor motor vehicle emission laboratory","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["542762","553895","549690","557930","557825","549692","549689","557850","552795","557889","552775","557853","546538","542763","542754","557905"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["testing","emission","conduct","car","test","regulation","glass","bumper","enclosure","windshield"]}
