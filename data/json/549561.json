{"path":"549561.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features a large boat named \"Maid of the Mist II\" captured from an aerial viewpoint, showing it navigating through vibrant blue water. The boat is densely populated with numerous passengers, who are mostly clustered on the deck. Notably, many of these passengers are wearing dark, matching raincoats, suggesting a preparedness for potential water spray or mist.\n\nThe boat itself is painted white with a red trim along its lower edge and a bold name label. The upper deck also shows a small canopy or shelter structure painted in bright yellow, likely serving as a protective space or a functional area for the crew. The front and rear parts of the upper deck have open spaces where passengers are gathered, visibly enjoying their ride.\n\nThe surrounding water exhibits patterns of waves and froth, indicating movement and the active navigation of the boat. These water patterns also reflect light, contributing to the vivid aquatic environment seen in the image. The overall scene is bustling, yet orderly, capturing a moment of leisure and exploration on water.","title":"\"maid-of-the-mist\" sightseeing boat at the base of the american Niagara Falls.
