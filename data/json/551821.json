{"path":"551821.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a woman standing on a street. She appears to be dressed in a striking and fashionable outfit consisting of a pink and white ensemble. The woman is wearing a pink and white vertically striped high-waist pants paired with a light pink, possibly sequined, camisole-like top. Over this, she has a white fur coat that rests gently on her shoulders. The outfit is accessorized with a dark belt around her waist and she is holding a black purse.\n\nHer long blond hair is loosely styled, flowing over her shoulders, and she appears to be looking off to the side, giving the photo a candid quality. Her expression is thoughtful and calm.\n\nIn the background, there's a blurred storefront with signage that reads “C.ERh,” suggesting an urban setting, possibly a shopping district or a busy street with commercial establishments.\n\nThe atmosphere evokes a sense of fashion-forwardness and city life, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s given the style of clothing and the overall composition of the photograph. This image captures a moment that blends glamour with everyday life.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
