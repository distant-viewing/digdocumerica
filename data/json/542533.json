{"path":"542533.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from agricultural farm work, likely taken during the mid-20th century. It features a man driving an old tractor, distinctly styled from past eras with its large metal frame and classic design. The tractor is painted in muted beige and light gray colors, equipped with bulky tires and a solid front grill.\n\nThe man, appearing middle-aged, is dressed in practical farmwork attire: a long-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a wide-brimmed straw hat to protect him from the sun. He is seated on the tractor, holding onto the steering wheel with both hands, perched directly behind the large engine compartment. His serious expression and focused gaze reflect a moment of concentration and labor.\n\nRight behind the tractor, visible through a cloud of dust, is a large circular object that could be either a piece of agricultural equipment or a part of another vehicle; its details are obscured due to the dusty conditions. The environment around the tractor is dusty and dry, suggesting soil that has been recently tilled or worked upon. The background includes a hint of green vegetation, hinting at a rural setting, possibly a farm or field setting under strong sunlight, as suggested by the overall lighting and shadows in the image.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a vivid moment of agricultural practice, highlighting the traditional methods of farming and the rugged nature of outdoor work.","title":"Bob martinez spraying grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["543671","544319","553664","557521","547436","555878","553665","544323","554204","557697","558305","554203","555619","544888","549259","543667"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","farm","bulky","till","work","method","grill","conditions","compartment","dusty"]}
