{"path":"558090.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts four individuals walking away from the camera along a rural road. They are wearing backpacks, three of which are visible and heavily adorned with various patches and emblems, suggesting they may be scouts or involved in a hiking or nature group. The figures are in casual outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, such as jeans, t-shirts, and hats, indicating a recreational activity. \n\nTheir environment consists of a gravel road flanked by green grass on both sides, and lush trees stand in the background under a clear blue sky, which suggests a serene, natural setting, typical of a countryside. The day appears to be sunny, bathing the scene in bright light, casting soft shadows on the road. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of adventure, exploration, and camaraderie among the group.","title":"Boy scouts hiking the Cuyahoga Trail which takes them along the edge of Bolanz and Akron-Peninsula roads in Northampton and Boston townships north of Akron, Ohio.
