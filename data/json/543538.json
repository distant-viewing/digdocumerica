{"path":"543538.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"In the photograph, three children are sitting on a wooden deck during a clear, sunny day. The scene appears to be set in a residential area with a background of pine trees and a row of houses that follow the rustic, cabin-style architecture, typical of a mountain or forest region.\n\nThe child in the center, who seems to be a boy, is partially obscured and wearing a blue and white plaid shirt with long sleeves and blue jeans. He is facing the camera but has his hand partly covering his face, suggesting shyness or a moment of playfulness.\n\nTo the left of the image, a girl is sitting on the wooden deck. She appears comfortable and relaxed, barefoot and wearing a plain denim skirt and no top, which might suggest a very casual, warm setting or that they are near a place suitable for swimming. She has her hair pulled back and smiles at the camera, raising her hand as if in greeting or to display something in her hand.\n\nOn the right, another boy is seated on the deck. He wears a white shirt with blue floral or leaf patterns and denim jeans. He sits with his hands clasped together, looking straight at the camera with a gentle smile.\n\nThe wooden deck the children are sitting on looks newly constructed or recently unweathered, possibly part of a house still under construction or renovation, given the plainness and cleanliness of the wood.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a seemingly casual and peaceful moment among children enjoying a sunny day outdoors, likely in a family or community environment surrounded by nature.","title":"Construction site off Lake Forest Glen","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["545436","553498","544310","545961","545509","547900","546897","554489","545383","556135","556525","544424","543511","547398","555546","543540"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["deck","child","hand","smile","denim","boy","camera","jean","playfulness","renovation"]}
