{"path":"555797.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a bustling scene on the deck of a large industrial ship involved in an operational activity at a harbor. The photography is from a higher vantage point, looking towards the front of the ship, allowing a detailed view of the deck and the surrounding harbor area.\n\nOn the deck, several large pipes and cylindrical containers are prominently visible, hinting at the shipâ€™s possible role in transportation or processing of liquids or gases. The deck is equipped with different types of machinery and equipment, including a massive yellow crane currently in operation. The crane is lifting or lowering a large pipe or conduit, attended by several workers. Three workers can be clearly seen: two are wearing safety helmets and seem to be managing the operation directly, standing next to the crane's base, while another is at a distance near the center of the image, seemingly overseeing the process.\n\nThe background reveals a spacious waterfront setting with multiple docks and other vessels visible at a distance. The skyline, likely of a nearby city, is faintly visible on the horizon, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the setting. The vast water body adjacent to the ship enhances the sense of activity within a significant commercial or industrial port area.\n\nThe color palette of the photo has a vintage look, suggesting an earlier era from when the photo might have been taken. The overall scene conveys a moment of intense industrial activity, typical of maritime logistics and operation environments.","title":"Loading sludge aboard one of the New York City sludge vessels at Tallman's Island sewage treatment plant. Sludge is mixed with water so it will flow through the pipes. The city owns four vessels which work around the clock collecting sludge at the treatment plants and discharging it in the New York Bight. The round trip to the sludge dumping area takes approximately six hours.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546881","546016","547474","552303","546934","545147","553739","555796","555799","552149","555261","548125","546828","550910","555270","546917"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["deck","ship","crane","harbor","pipe","operation","worker","conduit","logistic","liquid"]}
