{"path":"553053.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The image features an adult man holding a small cup close to his lips, seemingly about to drink from it. He is wearing rounded glasses, and his facial expression appears contemplative or focused. The man has short dark hair and prominent features. He is dressed in a worn blue denim shirt or jacket, which contributes to a rugged appearance, suggesting he might be outdoors or involved in physical work.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights his face and hands, drawing attention to the texture and details of his skin, as well as to the cup he's holding. His fingers are wrapped tightly around the cup, emphasizing a deliberate action or perhaps a moment of respite.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus and indistinct, adding to the emphasis on the man and what he is doing. The mood conveyed is intimate and somewhat reflective, possibly capturing a quiet moment in the man's day. Overall, the photograph is a close-up portrait that conveys a sense of immediacy and personal engagement with the subject's moment and emotion.","title":"Uranium miner at lunch.
