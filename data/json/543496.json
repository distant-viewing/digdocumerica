{"path":"543496.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a child seated on a sandy area, likely a beach or desert, engaging in play. The child, whose back is towards the camera, is wearing a colorful outfit with a predominantly yellow color and a pattern reminiscent of flowers or clowns. Next to the child lies a small, open picnic basket, suggesting a leisurely outing.\n\nDominating the scene is a dilapidated wooden structure that appears blackened and weathered, possibly the remnants of an old playground or a small building. It comprises several standing posts and some beams, forming a skeletal frame, with part of the structure collapsed into a heap. The structure's condition indicates long exposure to the elements and neglect.\n\nThe background is sparse and sandy, with a few tufts of grass and scattered rocks, suggesting a harsh, arid environment. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the child and the juxtaposition of play against a decaying structure, evokes a sense of isolation and the passage of time. The atmosphere is one of solitude and perhaps nostalgia.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["549674","553495","556166","548119","547182","544424","555398","552960","553538","557987","544372","548837","550263","544380","547786","544207"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","play","tuft","playground","picnic","nostalgia","basket","standing","heap","outing"]}
