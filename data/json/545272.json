{"path":"545272.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of heavy deforestation. The image is filled with a chaotic tangle of fallen trees, branches, and remnants of tree trunks scattered across the ground. The setting is a large area that has been cleared, with plenty of debris left behind from logging activities.\n\nIn the background, a dirt road winds through the cleared land, where a single truck, seemingly associated with the logging operations, is kicking up dust as it moves along the path. The surrounding landscape includes more forested hills, suggesting the larger, potentially untouched forests in the vicinity.\n\nThe sky is visible at the top of the photograph, showing a clear day with minimal clouds, adding a bright environment to the otherwise destructive scene on the ground. The overall mood conveys a sense of environmental impact and the magnitude of human intervention in natural landscapes.","title":"Clear-cutting of cedar trees in the Tahala Unit of the Quinault Indian Reservation.
