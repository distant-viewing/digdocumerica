{"path":"550198.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view over a dense urban landscape, likely captured from a high vantage point, giving a broad oversight of a city center. The image prominently features a tall structure, possibly a landmark building, with neoclassical architectural elements including a dominant tower standing apart by its height and intricate detailing. This tower is centrally located and towers above surrounding structures.\n\nThe surrounding area is packed with numerous buildings of varying architectural styles and sizes, which likely serve commercial and possibly government purposes, given the urban context and their grand, styled exteriors. A clear grid pattern of the streets is visible, lined with cars indicating active traffic, but no congestive build-up is evident.\n\nIn the distance, there's a river winding through the city, over which multiple bridges are visible, connecting different parts of the city. The river adds a natural element to the urban setting.\n\nThe atmosphere has a slight haze, suggesting smog or mist, which is typical in many urban environments. This haze softens the details in the distance, creating a gradient from clear to more obscured views towards the horizon. The overall mood is serene and somewhat nostalgic, enhanced by the image's cooler color tones and slight grain, common in older photographs.","title":"Terminal Tower, overlooking the Public Square, dominates the Cleveland skyline.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552394","550202","549979","551507","547253","548392","548416","548424","548317","551509","552395","548318","549477","550186","545429","547210"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["tower","city","haze","oversight","government","smog","build","grain","landmark","detailing"]}
