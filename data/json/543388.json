{"path":"543388.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This is a scenic photograph capturing a group of hikers on a rugged mountain trail. The setting is vibrant with natural beauty, featuring a prominent, aged tree in the foreground. The tree is characterized by a thick trunk and a wide spread of branches, with sunlight piercing through its foliage creating a striking visual effect.\n\nIn the immediate background, one can see a group of at least three hikers navigating the stony trail. These individuals are equipped with large backpacks, indicative of a long trek, and are dressed in typical outdoor attire suited for such activities. The pathway they are on appears narrow and rocky, surrounded by lower vegetation and sparser, smaller trees.\n\nThe background extends into a steeply descending mountainous terrain, covered with trees and fading into a misty or hazy atmosphere, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. This combination of elements—the path, the hikers, and the environment—evokes a sense of adventure and exploration in the wilderness.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the sunburst through the tree and the depth of the landscape, creates a dynamic and picturesque scene that highlights the beauty and the challenge of hiking in such a rugged environment.","title":"Mineral peak forms background for hikers from explorer post 397 of Los Angeles","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["544305","554558","543331","554663","543387","545700","554503","554508","542732","554501","543446","554502","554509","543382","554705","554504"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["hiker","trail","trek","pierce","tree","hike","backpack","descend","group","combination"]}
