{"path":"555272.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy freight container yard, showcasing a variety of shipping containers closely packed and arranged systematically in rows. The perspective is aerial, providing a comprehensive view of the yard's layout. The containers, visible in several colors predominantly red, brown, and white, are of different sizes but largely standardized, typical for maritime or rail transport.\n\nThe yard is densely populated with these containers, some stacked upon each other, while others are lined up single file along the designated slots marked with numbers like 91, 92, 93, visible on the ground. Several open containers can be seen, suggesting ongoing loading or unloading activities.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple industrial buildings, smaller structures, and other logistical equipment scattered throughout. The yard is expansive, extending to the horizon where other industrial or infrastructure features faintly appear. The scene indicates a well-organized operation, likely part of a larger transportation or logistics hub, crucial for handling large volumes of goods. There are no visible people in the picture, emphasizing the scale and the focus on the freight containers and infrastructure. The overall setting and the presence of cranes and forklifts suggest that this is a hub for commercial trade and transport.","title":"Shipping containers cover the docks at the port of Newark New Jersey, ready for loading onto ships and transport to various destinations","placename":"New Jersey","location":"New Jersey","nn1":["555759","555271","555261","555283","546910","542934","546881","547265","555270","548353","555760","547140","546719","552063","552200","555779"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["container","yard","freight","hub","transport","trade","unloading","designate","infrastructure","volume"]}
