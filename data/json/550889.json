{"path":"550889.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a formation of birds, possibly pelicans, flying in a clear blue sky. The birds are organized in a neat diagonal line that stretches from the bottom left to the upper right of the frame, suggesting a sense of motion towards the upper right. Each bird is spaced relatively evenly from the others, maintaining a consistent formation. Their wings are outstretched, and their bodies are aligned horizontally, which indicates that they are in flight. The simplicity of the composition, with its clear sky and the orderly arrangement of the birds, gives the image a serene and orderly feel. There are no other objects or distractions in the background; itâ€™s just the birds against the vastness of the blue sky.","title":"Pelicans fly in formation above the Houston Ship Channel.","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["554646","557203","550903","555554","557209","557125","553875","557208","544605","550887","550382","552238","549772","550888","557204","544609"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","pelican","formation","distraction","wing","flight","simplicity","arrangement","right","vastness"]}
