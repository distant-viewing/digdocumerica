{"path":"545141.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural landscape featuring a mix of natural and built environments. On the left side of the image, there is a small wooden bridge spanning over a narrow stream, which meanders through the scene. Adjacent to the bridge is a small, round-shaped hut, potentially a storage shed or a small utility building. The grassy area around these structures appears unkempt, with various grasses and small patches of dirt.\n\nIn the background, several small, single-story buildings are visible, presumably homes or commercial structures, given their size and simple construction. There is a building in the mid-right of the image with a sign on it; however, the text is not clearly legible from this distance. Additionally, there is a road that travels from the foreground into the distance with a visible utility pole and lines. The sign next to the road reads \"Drive Carefully.\"\n\nIn the far distance toward the center and right of the photo, one can see a broader expanse of the grassy and marshy field, which looks like a coastal area, evident from the hint of a water body or possibly the sea visible in the very background. The area appears quite open and flat, likely suitable for various outdoor activities or simply as a place for local residents to enjoy the natural surroundings. The sky is overcast, suggesting a gloomy or chilly weather condition at the time the photo was taken.","title":"Surfside Estates on Long Beach Peninsula. Originally, this area was dunes and marshes with a variety of wildlife, including ducks, geese, swans, deer, elk and bear. The drainage canal was cut through the dunes in 1966, grass was planted and \"development\" began.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["558005","558015","555609","557154","558048","556943","544607","548248","557025","558007","558060","554803","549010","555818","558051","551076"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["hut","utility","bridge","distance","resident","shed","road","stream","sign","building"]}
