{"path":"554225.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a hot tub or outdoor spa, bustling with people enjoying themselves in a communal setting. There's a sense of warmth from the surrounding steam that rises above the water, indicating the chill of the atmosphere around this cozy retreat. Various individuals, both men and women, can be seen interacting; some are engaged in conversation, while others enjoy beverages. The vibe appears joyful and relaxed with everyone dressed in swimwear, suggesting a social or recreational gathering.\n\nThe setting is partly enclosed by wooden structures, likely part of a spa or resort designed to blend with a natural, possibly mountainous, backdrop, considering the visible snow on the edges hinting at a winter atmosphere. From the angle of the image, it appears to have been taken from a slightly elevated position outside the tub, looking down into the scene, capturing the dynamics of the group and the steamy environment that envelops them. The use of natural wood and the rustic construction of the tub area contribute to a cozy, inviting aesthetic typical of such leisure destinations.","title":"Members of the Ski Club of Washington, D.C. soak out muscle fatigue at the Continental Inn pool.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554226","554224","554277","548549","548548","544339","554269","552012","555926","555891","544342","552703","552706","554237","556295","557029"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["chill","swimwear","retreat","resort","beverage","destination","dynamic","warmth","position","vibe"]}
