{"path":"555160.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of a fire at night. The focal point of the image is a bright, fiery blaze. The flames are captured as they erupt upwards and outwards in bright orange and yellow hues, creating a dynamic and almost fluid shape against the darker background.\n\nThe fire illuminates the surrounding area, revealing silhouettes of trees that stand nearby. These trees appear to be very close to the fire, which suggests that the fire could be in a wooded or forested area, raising concerns about a potential forest or wildfire.\n\nThe background is shrouded in darkness due to the nighttime setting, which contrasts starkly with the bright, vivid colors of the fire. This also enhances the visual impact of the flames.\n\nDetails such as what caused the fire or the specific location are not available in the image, but the photograph evokes a sense of urgency and the destructive power of fire. The mood is tense and alarming, capturing the unstoppable force of nature when it turns violent.","title":"Buffer strip burning in a slash burn in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557577","543908","555156","543900","553843","543933","555157","548591","553128","543904","546017","548590","542712","547728","553560","543002"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["fire","flame","wildfire","urgency","nighttime","darkness","force","concern","night","power"]}
