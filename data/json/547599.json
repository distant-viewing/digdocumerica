{"path":"547599.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a calm beach scene seen through foliage at the forefront. In the foreground, there are green plants, possibly beach vegetation, with some small purple flowers blooming. The branches and leaves partially obscure the view, framing the scene artistically with a focus on the natural environment.\n\nIn the middle ground, set against a backdrop of a sandy beach, a figure is walking. The figure is blurred, appearing to be in motion, and is dressed casually, appropriate for a beach setting. The sandy beach stretches out across the midsection of the photo and is a light, creamy color, enhancing the sense of a serene, quiet beach day.\n\nIn the far background, the scene fades into a misty or hazy horizon, indicating either the vastness of the ocean or a foggy day. The calmness of the sea and the soft ambient light suggest a peaceful solitude, typical of an early morning or later afternoon on the beach. The overall composition and soft focus of the photograph evoke a dreamy, tranquil atmosphere.","title":"A walk on the beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547596","547612","545280","547603","554159","547592","546953","546970","543078","543303","548757","547607","547600","547496","548088","543244"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","figure","calmness","bloom","forefront","vastness","ocean","solitude","flower","sea"]}
