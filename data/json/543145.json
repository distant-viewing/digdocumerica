{"path":"543145.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene featuring a prominent, silhouetted tree against a vibrant sky. The tree has a wide, sturdy trunk that divides into numerous sprawling branches, heavily laden with densely packed leaves. Its strong silhouette frames the image, creating a striking contrast against the twilight sky.\n\nBehind the tree, the sun is setting directly on the horizon of a calm sea. The sunlight scatters through the air, casting golden hues over the sea and sky. These warm colors gradient into richer shades of blue as they extend upwards into the higher skies.\n\nThe background is primarily composed of the gently undulating sea surface, meeting the line of the golden-lit sky. In the distance, just visible through the lower branches of the tree, a hint of land or distant hills appears soft and shadowy against the skyline, suggesting a distant coastline.\n\nOverall, the composition and timing of the shot emphasize tranquility and the beauty of nature, with the tree artistically framing the setting sun, enhancing the peaceful ambiance of a coastal sunset.","title":"The waterfront at sunset","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543137","554731","547719","543400","542625","552335","543016","543415","542927","557447","544601","543133","554403","542618","552338","554074"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sea","sunset","composed","timing","sun","branch","sprawling","tree","prominent","silhouet"]}
