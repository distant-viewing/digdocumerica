{"path":"552839.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a series of structures and small floating objects on a body of water, seemingly a lake or a calm sea bay. The structures appear to be floating platforms connected by walkways or small bridges. One of the platforms includes a hut-like construction, possibly made of wood, with a pointed roof. Some parts of the platform exhibit what look like extended docks or jetties into the water.\n\nVisible in the water are several tiny patches of vegetation or algae and some isolated pieces of floating debris. Toward the lower edge of the image, near one of the walkways, there is something that may either be a boat or additional floating material.\n\nThe surrounding water body is dark, indicating depth and potentially hinting at the clarity and cleanliness of the water. Toward the top right of the photograph, partially visible land forms or islets are observed, covered with lush green vegetation, suggesting a remote or natural setting. The overall aerial perspective provides an encompassing view of this unique and possibly makeshift or transitional human habitation on the water.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin.
