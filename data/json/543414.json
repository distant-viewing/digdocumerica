{"path":"543414.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a rustic scene highlighted by the warm glow of what appears to be a sunset. It captures a series of sturdy, wooden fence posts that are aligned in a diagonal line receding into the background. These posts are interconnected by strands of barbed wire, which stretch across the frame, suggesting the boundary of a field or farm.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts a rich, golden-red hue over the entire scene, accentuating the texture and details of the grassy ground which is shimmering under the influence of this warm light. The field is uneven and natural, filled with tall grass or possibly crops, which are illuminated to appear almost fiery or radiant.\n\nIn the background, beyond the boundary made by the fence, there's a haze or mist that further enhances the dreamy, almost otherworldly quality of the scene. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the fence and the field.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast between the structured, man-made elements of the fence and the wild, natural beauty of the landscape, bathed in an evocative light that adds a sense of tranquility and warmth to the rural setting.","title":"Sunset on Little Sur Riverbank","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546154","547404","542895","557212","543122","545823","549156","543660","553820","543774","543024","549154","547428","547514","545819","547522"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["fence","boundary","post","field","strand","influence","warmth","crop","farm","wire"]}
