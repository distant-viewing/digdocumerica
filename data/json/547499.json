{"path":"547499.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a beach scene, focusing primarily on a lineup of classic cars parked on a beachfront promenade. The perspective is shot from behind the cars, the foreground showing parts of at least two classic vehicles: one beige or yellow with a distinctive ventilation grille on its hood, and a dark-colored car directly adjacent on the left.\n\nThe background is lively and filled with people enjoying a sunny day at the beach. Numerous individuals, including men, women, and children of various ages, are scattered across the sandy beach. Some are walking, while others are seated on folding chairs or lying on towels, sunbathing. The ocean is visible in the distance, with waves crashing onto the shore under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe atmosphere seems festive and relaxed, typical of a busy beach day. The vintage style of the image, suggested by the design of the cars and the fashion of the beachgoers' clothes, evokes a sense of nostalgia, perhaps pointing to the mid-20th century. The composition balances the man-made elements of the cars in the foreground with the natural beauty of the beach scene, blending technology with leisure.","title":"Misquamicut State Beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["550934","547478","545857","545237","550925","557475","547495","545252","550922","546412","550933","550921","545849","548929","548698","546408"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["beach","car","lineup","beachgoer","ventilation","grille","nostalgia","towel","hood","clothe"]}
