{"path":"553484.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures two elderly women sitting next to each other. The first woman, seated on the left, is wearing a striped dress with a cardigan, and her arms are folded across her chest, suggesting a reserved or contemplative attitude. She is wearing sunglasses and appears to be gazing off to her right, not engaging directly with the camera. The woman on the right is wearing a blue dress and a white mob cap. She wears glasses and looks directly into the camera with a gentle expression, and her hands are clasped together in her lap.\n\nBoth women are seated on what appear to be metal folding chairs outside a dark, wooden structure that could be a house or a shed. There's a sense of casual, everyday life about the scene, emphasized by the womenâ€™s relaxed attire and unposed nature. The lighting is subdued, adding to the intimate and serene quality of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of quiet dignity and the stoic attitude often associated with the elderly. It seems to capture a moment of rest or reflection, each woman in her own thoughts yet together in the same space. The background is minimally detailed, keeping the focus on the two women and their expressions.","title":"Elderly residents of this building in the west 700 block of 16th street in mulky square must find other lodging soon.
