{"path":"544272.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an oil drilling rig, set in a tranquil rural environment. The main focus is a tall, metallic drilling tower, which rises prominently against a partly cloudy sky speckled with fluffy white clouds. The tower is equipped with various structural beams, ladders, and platforms, making it a complex and intricate piece of engineering.\n\nOn the lower part of the image, the rig is supported by a broad base with what appears to be machinery and equipment housed in a wooden structure. This base is encircled by a wooden fence, and there are additional pieces of equipment and materials, including metal rods and barriers, scattered around the site.\n\nThe rig is located next to a calm body of water, reflecting the image of the towering structure perfectly, creating a mirror image on the waterâ€™s surface. This adds a serene aspect to the composition, contrasting with the industrial nature of the oil rig. The water is bordered by lush greenery, including grass and dense bushes, enhancing the rural setting of the scene.\n\nThe natural light and the composition create a vivid and detailed snapshot of industrial activity within a natural landscape, capturing a moment of calm despite the inherent functionality and business of the oil rig. The photograph likely aims to convey both the industrial endeavors of human activity and the beauty of the natural environment, highlighting a coexistence in this particular setting.","title":"Texaco rig near Bayou Gauche","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544512","545963","552990","544511","545838","545834","557484","555634","544179","545827","546245","546064","546201","546170","545167","549209"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["rig","oil","tower","piece","base","encircle","ladder","equipment","endeavor","engineering"]}
