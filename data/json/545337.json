{"path":"545337.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph is a rich urban scene depicting an array of subjects and activities. A prominent feature of the image is a woman sleeping in the driver’s seat of a classic convertible car, which appears in the foreground through which the street scene is viewed. The car has its roof down, exposing a detailed interior with light-color upholstery.\n\nIn the background, on a city street, there are two young women walking side by side. The background also features a two-story brick building with visible numbers and iron-railed balconies on the upper floor and what appears to be a mix of windows and doors, some curtained, along the row.\n\nAdding to the vintage feeling of the photograph are two other older model cars parked along the curb of the street—one immediately in front of the convertible and another across the street, partly visible. The street is littered with some debris, typical of a busy city environment, and completed by a view of clear skies.\n\nThis image effectively captures a moment of daily life, contrasting the calm, still moment of the woman sleeping in the car with the movement of the women walking by on a seemingly warm, sunny day. The composition, using the interior of the convertible as a framing device, adds a unique perspective to this urban scene, encapsulating a sense of the era and the life within it.","title":"El Paso's Second Ward, a classic \"barrio\" on the border of Mexico.
