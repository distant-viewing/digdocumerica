{"path":"555165.jpg","date":"October 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph portrays an aerial view of an industrial complex, likely a factory or plant, situated along a waterway. The scene is densely packed with various industrial structures, including large cylindrical towers, factory buildings, and pipes. Multiple smokestacks emit white smoke, contributing to the industrial atmosphere. \n\nIn the foreground, log booms are visible in the water, indicating a logging or wood processing facility as part of the industrial operations. These logs are organized into clusters and surrounded by water on which several small boats can be seen, likely used for maneuvering the logs.\n\nThe surrounding area features additional industrial or storage facilities, with visible piles of materials that might be wood chips or coal. Roads and railway tracks are discernible, weaving through the complex and suggesting robust infrastructure for transport and distribution. \n\nThe background of the image gradually transitions to a more natural landscape, with a hill visible in the distance, offering a stark contrast to the heavily industrialized foreground. The photograph likely captures the environmental impact and extensive scale of industrial operations in proximity to natural water bodies.","title":"MacMillan-Bloedel, Ltd., a log processing plant in Port Alberni, Vancouver Island, Canada.
