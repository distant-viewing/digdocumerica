{"path":"555528.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This image captures a serene and industrious rural scene, likely taken on a sunny day given the brightness and shadows observed. At the heart of the scene is an elderly man with white hair and a weathered complexion. He is kneeling on the grass, engaged in the maintenance or repair of a large agricultural machine, possibly a plow, which has multiple metal teeth. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt and pants, both appearing slightly worn, which suggests practicality and a working environment.\n\nTo the right of the man stands a vintage tractor, labeled \"FARMALL,\" with large rear wheels equipped with what appears to be chain or strap-based wheel protection or traction aids. The tractor, painted in a faded red, invokes a sense of hard work and long service.\n\nIn the background, a small building, possibly a shed or barn, is visible with its wooden structure and sunlit facade contributing to the rustic warmth of the scene.\n\nA small dog, predominantly white with dark patches, stands near the tractor looking directly at the camera, adding a lively and loyal element to the composition.\n\nThe setting is lush with green grass, and the overarching foliage suggests that this might be taking place in a well-tended farmyard or rural property. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on traditional farming elements and the honest labor of the man, evokes themes of perseverance, the rural working life, and a close relationship with nature and animals.","title":"A 60-year-old bachelor farmer from Beantown, near Randolph, Vermont, adjusts the blades of his mower before going out to hay.
