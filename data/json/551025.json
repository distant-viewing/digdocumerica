{"path":"551025.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, outdoor fishing scene. A young person, shirtless and evidently male, is seated near the edge of a body of water, possibly a river or lake. They are seen from behind, gazing out at the water while attending to multiple fishing rods anchored in the ground with a makeshift rod holder. The person appears to be handling bait or a fishing line, as they reach towards a container.\n\nThe environment is lush and green, indicating a rich natural landscape. Dense foliage surrounds the body of water, and heavily wooded hills rise in the background, adding a sense of seclusion and peacefulness to the scene. The waters are calm, with faint ripples, reflecting the greyish hues of an overcast sky.\n\nIn the middle distance, across the water, there's a hint of human habitationâ€”a building nestled amidst the trees, painted in a light color, likely a home or a small facility, which blends fairly unobtrusively with the environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is tranquil, focusing on the quiet activity of fishing in a natural setting, away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The composition, with its focal point on the young fisher and the expanse of nature surrounding them, evokes a sense of solitude and connection with the environment.","title":"Young man fishes near a foul-smelling drainage ditch which flows into the Kanawha River","placename":"Malden (W.
