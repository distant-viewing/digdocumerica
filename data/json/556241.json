{"path":"556241.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and poignant scene of a church congregation engaged in a choral activity. There are multiple people of various ages, predominantly African American, singing from hymnbooks. The setting appears to be during a church service or possibly a choir event, indicated by the involvement and expressions of the individuals.\n\nForeground:\nThe focus is particularly on a group of individuals in the foreground. They are actively looking down at hymnbooks held in their hands. Each person exhibits a concentrated or emotive expression, reflective of being deeply engrossed in the hymn singing.\n\nApparel:\nThe attire varies but is mostly formal, suggesting the setting is an event of significance. Women are dressed in dresses with varied patterns (polka dots, stripes), and some wear hats, typical of traditional church attire. Men are seen in suits or smart shirts, also indicating the formality of the occasion.\n\nAccessories:\nSome individuals wear glasses, watches, and subtle pieces of jewelry. These details, along with well-groomed appearances, contribute to the dignified atmosphere captured in the image.\n\nBackground:\nThe background is less focused but shows more members of the congregation, similarly engaged. A sign with the word \"Garfield!\" is partially visible, hinting at perhaps the name of the church or a particular section or group within the congregation.\n\nOverall, the photo documents a moment of unity and shared devotion, with a strong sense of community and cultural identity reflected through the congregation's participation in the church service or choir event. The lighting and deep hues in the photograph add a sense of warmth and intimacy to the scene.","title":"Members of the jehovah's witnesses sing during outdoor worship services at the group's annual convention at Chicago's sox park, a baseball field on the city's south side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556238","558407","545381","556239","558408","545470","558382","558401","558388","552623","558391","558400","558389","558383","556234","545377"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["congregation","church","event","service","formality","unity","singe","groom","jewelry","polka"]}
