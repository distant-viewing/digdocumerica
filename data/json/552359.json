{"path":"552359.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an enthralling scene set against an early evening or late afternoon sky, transitioning from daylight to dusk. A man is featured prominently in the foreground. He is standing with his arms raised towards the sky, seemingly releasing or interacting with a model rocket. The rocket is connected to a string or wire that extends upwards and is attached to a large white balloon floating in the air. The balloon appears slightly higher in the sky and has a second, smaller red attachment. \n\nThe backdrop is a clear, deep blue sky that suggests a serene, uncluttered outdoor setting. The man is bald and wearing a casual short-sleeved shirt, and his posture conveys a sense of motion and involvement with the rocket and balloon setup. \n\nThis scene might be part of a hobby or scientific experiment involving model rockets or aerodynamics. The inclusion of the balloon indicates that the experiment or activity requires or is testing ascent in open air, likely observing the behavior of the rocket when launched or carried in such a manner. The simplicity of the setup and clear sky provide an ideal backdrop for such activities, focusing all attention on the experiment and the involved individual.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["556217","545983","544851","557718","553907","557798","557719","552361","552362","553308","553067","548881","557720","557799","557721","544839"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["balloon","experiment","model","setup","ascent","hobby","air","attachment","behavior","string"]}
