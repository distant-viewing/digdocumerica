{"path":"548049.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a gas station, showcasing a fuel pump with a prominent sign placed at the top. The sign reads \"10 GAL. LIMIT SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE,\" indicating a restriction on the amount of fuel that can be purchased per customer. The gas pump below the sign is an older model, as indicated by its design and the visible mechanical digits displaying the total sale and amount of gas dispensed. The total sale is shown as $6.69 for 10 gallons, with the price per gallon indicated but not clearly visible.\n\nThe pump displays the “Chevron” brand, recognized by the logo and name placed on the side of the white pump. An additional note on the pump informs of a gasoline tax of 11¢ per gallon. A detail that stands out is the side view of a vintage car's rear, visible on the right of the image, framing the gas pump. The car appears to be mid-refueling process, with its gas cap and rear lights in view.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the gas station's environment during what might have been a period of fuel shortages or rationing, explaining the necessity for a gallon limit. The focus is partially on the old, possibly worn-out gas pump, and the classic car, set against an out-of-focus background that suggests an everyday, utilitarian space. The setting is outdoor, with natural lighting contributing to the clarity and colors of the image.","title":"Gasoline shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["550092","555495","555486","555494","548173","548053","548047","548171","555465","555434","548169","555467","548170","550096","547874","555502"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["pump","gas","fuel","limit","sale","amount","station","car","restriction","shortage"]}
