{"path":"546050.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows a misty, somewhat eerie seascape under a dark, overcast sky. At the center of the image, a boat is partially visible, enveloped in a dense fog that adds a mysterious quality to the scene. The boat, which appears to be a smaller vessel, is facing towards the viewer. Its outline and details are not sharply defined due to the heavy fog. The sea itself is turbulent, with visible waves creating a textured surface that reflects a bit of light, possibly from the boat or a distant source. There is no visible land or other objects; the entire scene is dominated by the vast, open water and the obscured boat, enhancing the sense of isolation and atmospheric mood of the photograph. The overall tone is moody and somber, with a palette dominated by dark blues and grays.","title":"Small pleasurecraft pollutes the air with heavy diesel exhaust fumes","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544234","549380","544701","553991","545057","549374","548516","545900","547057","557813","555715","549601","557818","547044","554004","544672"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","fog","seascape","source","envelop","define","bit","vessel","gray","outline"]}
