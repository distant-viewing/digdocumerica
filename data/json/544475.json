{"path":"544475.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a wetland scene, characterized by shallow water densely populated by clusters of yellow flowers. The flowers are small and appear to grow on thin, elongated stems, rising above the water surface. They add vibrant yellow highlights to the largely muted brown and dark green shades of the background vegetation and water, generating a natural, calm setting.\n\nThe backdrop is made up of darker, possibly denser foliage, which blurs into a soft focus, contributing to the depth of the image. The waterâ€™s surface reflects parts of the flora and the diffused light, further enhancing the tranquility and natural essence of the environment. This type of habitat is typically supportive of a diverse ecosystem, including various types of aquatic plants and possibly attracting birds and insects.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures the natural beauty and serene quality of the wetland, accentuated by the scattered distribution of yellow wildflowers.","title":"Wild flowers by jetport","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550670","544525","550783","547488","550787","550786","557098","552503","548027","557498","547589","544443","545033","542554","544541","542704"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","flower","insect","type","distribution","attract","generate","stem","wildflower","grow"]}
