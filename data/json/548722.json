{"path":"548722.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater scene, vividly displaying the beauty and tranquility of an oceanic environment. At the top of the image, the outline of a diver is visible against the diffused sunlight filtering through the water, creating a silhouette effect. The blue-green hues of the water suggest the photo is taken at a significant depth.\n\nThe foreground and middle portions of the image are dominated by large, textured coral formations which have a rugged, porous surface, likely brain corals. These corals exhibit rich, dark hues, ranging from deep greens to blues, which contrast with the lighter water surrounding them. Small fish can be seen swimming near the coral, possibly seeking shelter or feeding on the small organisms that live within the coral structures.\n\nThe composition of the photograph directs the viewer's attention from the bottom left diagonally upward towards the top right, guided by the natural lines of the coral formations and the placement of the diver. This arrangement adds a dynamic element to the stillness of the underwater scene, suggesting both depth and the vastness of the ocean environment.","title":"Snorkeler inspects one of the more than 40 species of coral at john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548721","548676","548680","548681","548682","548683","548678","548675","548677","548719","548712","548713","548679","548717","548723","548711"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","diver","organism","seek","formation","feed","swim","live","placement","hue"]}
