{"path":"552629.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a night scene at an outdoor football game. The field is illuminated by several bright, overhead floodlights creating a contrast with the surrounding darkness. On the field, two teams are engaged in play, with one team huddled around the ball preparing for the next move. Spectators are gathered around the edges of the field, most of them seated on the grass. The crowd consists of various individuals including children and adults, attentively watching the game.\n\nThe photo, taken from a distance, shows the atmosphere of a typical high school or local sports event, with a sense of community involvement evident from the casual seating and active engagement of the spectators. The lighting from the floodlights casts a glow that highlights the central action on the field and dims towards the periphery. The entire setting conveys a typical Americana feel of a community gathered to support their local team in a serene and social evening environment.","title":"Rifle versus Aspen high school football game.
