{"path":"551280.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene at a lake. The image is dominated by cool, shadowy tones with a backdrop of a subtly colored sky transitioning from pink to a deep blue at dusk. On the left side of the image, there is an individual sitting in a small boat, mostly in silhouette, suggesting a moment of tranquility or perhaps preparation for a night of fishing. The person is facing away from the camera, looking towards the water, which reflects slight ripples and the muted colors of the sky.\n\nThe right side of the image shows the shoreline extending into the distance. Along the shoreline, there are a few rocks visible at the edge, and another indistinct figure of a person appears to be seated near the water. The overall setting is calm and undisturbed, marked by the natural beauty of the fading light and still waters, ideal for reflective solitude or quiet companionship.\n\nThe background features a line of trees silhouetted against the sky, further enhancing the sense of peace and isolation typical of a lakeside evening. A single bird can be faintly discerned in the sky, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still scene. The composition of the image, with its focus on the interaction of natural elements like water, sky, and land at dusk, evokes a feeling of tranquility and a closeness to nature.","title":"Fisherman launches his boat into the GRand Glaize Arm of the lake from the campgrounds in Lake of the Ozarks State Park.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["552225","554397","543577","543618","552311","554405","547230","554404","552124","551214","550299","543604","545911","552319","543143","550777"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["shoreline","dusk","closeness","silhouette","tranquility","companionship","peace","discern","person","preparation"]}
