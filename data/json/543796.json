{"path":"543796.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a large flat rooftop of an industrial or utility building. In the foreground, there's a prominent feature of large metal piping, perhaps part of a ventilation system or other mechanical infrastructure. The pipes are composed of sections with flanges and bolts, showcasing a mix of materials and colors including silver, black, and signs of rust or dirt particularly on the portion that curves downward.\n\nIn the background, slightly off-center, stands a solitary individual leaning casually against the rooftop's surrounding low parapet wall. This person, likely a worker based on the context, wears dark pants and a light blue shirt, appearing relaxed as they gaze across the expanse.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene reveals a lush, green, open park-like area with scattered trees that stretches into the distance under a clear blue sky. This suggests that the building is situated in a spacious, possibly semi-rural or suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image—dominated by the strong industrial elements in the foreground contrasting with the more serene, natural landscape in the background—tells a story of industrial functionality set within a peaceful environment.","title":"Anerobic digester.
