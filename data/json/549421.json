{"path":"549421.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph shows a vibrant scene of sailing on open water. It captures a small sailboat being skillfully navigated by two people. The boat itself is compact and mostly white in color, with a prominent red spinnaker sail capturing much of the frame. The spinnaker is adorned with bold text that appears to be a sponsor's name or type of event, though it's partially obscured, making it difficult to read fully. The main sail of the boat is also visible, predominantly white with a smaller size compared to the spinnaker.\n\nOn the boat, one individual, likely the skipper, is seated towards the rear, steering the vessel. He appears focused, looking towards the horizon. Another person, possibly a crew member, is handling details presumably relating to the sails; only portions of this person (like hands or a portion of the head) are visible occasionally as they move around on the deck.\n\nThe sea around the boat shows moderate waves, suggesting a breezy day, which is ideal for sailing. The sky is overcast with a muted light that casts everything in soft hues. In the background, a buoy can be seen floating on the water, likely marking the course or a boundary for a sailing race.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, including the energetic movement of the sail and the poised readiness of the crew, conveys a moment of active navigation and sport, set against a broad, natural seascape.","title":"Running before the wind on Chesapeake Bay in the Annapolis-Newport race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548526","549404","549426","547463","549386","548513","549425","549394","549405","544667","549406","549392","549388","548494","549424","548203"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","boat","crew","portion","race","readiness","buoy","course","seascape","navigation"]}
