{"path":"544277.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial exterior with a prominent metal electricity pylon in the foreground. The pylon is of a lattice structure commonly used in high voltage electricity transmission. The power lines connected to this pylon stretch out towards the top right of the photograph, slightly blurred against the sky. In the background, there is a glimpse of an industrial plant featuring tanks, towers, and piping. Several smoke stacks are visible, emitting plumes of smoke or steam into the air, indicating ongoing industrial processes.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting expansive atmospheric conditions. The foreground shows a patch of wild grass, which gives a contrasting natural element in front of the complex metal and industrial scene. The entire scene conveys a blend of nature and human-made structures, emphasizing themes of energy transmission and industrial activity in a green landscape. The colors are somewhat faded, suggesting the photo might be from an earlier period or intended to evoke a historical feel.","title":"Monsanto plant","placename":"Luling (La.)","location":"Luling, Louisiana","nn1":["547936","557977","542524","550168","557293","543823","545862","557298","548136","550982","544613","546122","544355","549190","549110","546170"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pylon","transmission","electricity","voltage","smoke","lattice","piping","metal","stack","plume"]}
