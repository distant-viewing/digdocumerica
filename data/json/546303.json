{"path":"546303.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a lab environment depicted with a distinct sense of regulation and caution. The foreground prominently displays a large signal-red and white sign that reads \"KEEP OUT HOT VIRUS LAB. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY,\" attached to a muted olive green wall to the left, indicating a restricted access area. The signâ€™s bold, uppercase lettering emphasizes the seriousness of the warning.\n\nBehind this sign, slightly to the right, we see a partial view of a laboratory setting. The room has a light sage green color scheme and is equipped with gray metal cabinets with glass windows, through which various lab instruments and possibly chemical bottles can be glimpsed neatly arranged. An individual, presumably a scientist or lab technician, dressed in a white lab coat, is visible. This person stands facing away from the camera, appearing to be engaged in work or observation of something on the bench or shelves in front of them.\n\nIn the far right, there's a hint of another doorway or perhaps a passage, mostly obscured by shadow, adding to the atmospheric depth and a sense of the lab's layout beyond the immediately visible areas.\n\nOverall, this image conveys a controlled, sterile, and secure scientific research environment, underpinned by the significant warning sign that restricts access to ensure safety and containment.","title":"Epa gulf coast water supply research laboratory, Dauphin Island: virology section.
