{"path":"545463.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy highway scene with a mix of vehicles traveling in both directions. The highway is lined with multiple lanes, seemingly during a time period that suggests early to mid-20th century given the styles of the cars visible, which include sedans and a Volkswagen Beetle among others. \n\nIn the background, a large industrial complex dominates the skyline, characterized by multiple smokestacks emitting plumes of white and darker smoke. This backdrop creates a stark contrast with the foreground activity and suggests a setting near an industrial area, possibly in a region known for manufacturing or similar industries.\n\nThe colors of the photo are somewhat muted, typical of film photography from past decades, with the cars and the industrial background under a hazy or overcast sky. Noticeably, there's a road sign indicating a speed limit of 60, which along with the multiple cars, give a sense of movement and daily activity on this thoroughfare. \n\nOverall, the composition captures a slice of life from a particular era, merging transportation and industrial landscapes, providing a glimpse into the economic activities and urban environment during that time.","title":"Smoke-belching chimneys and smog-obscured city","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545455","557230","553019","544723","547569","550182","549919","547811","547651","549857","555437","555505","542764","542682","549890","550175"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","car","thoroughfare","limit","time","photography","know","merge","speed","film"]}
