{"path":"543848.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a mining scene characterized by rugged terrain and industrial structures. In the foreground, there are large mounds of earth and rocks dominating the landscape, suggesting recent excavation or mining activities. The earthen tones of these mounds range from light beige to rust, organized in a pattern that appears to funnel down towards a central point near the bottom of the image.\n\nToward the middle of the photograph stands an imposing, rust-red metal structure, partially covered in shadows. This structure, possibly an old mining headframe, is associated with underground mining and is used to lower and hoist equipment and personnel. Attached to the headframe is a building that also sports faded red and brown hues, complementing the earthen environment.\n\nFurther in the background, the landscape transitions into a grassy field stretching to the horizon, offering a stark contrast to the industrial forefront. This green expanse is relatively flat and barren of trees or other significant vegetation.\n\nThe image also includes some smaller details like scattered debris, a few small outbuildings, and what appears to be the remnants of old mining equipment in the lower left corner near another small structure. These elements suggest a long history of mining activity, possibly abandoned or in disuse.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a vivid tableau of an old mining operation, blending industrial decay with the natural landscape. The juxtaposition between human-made structures and the rugged natural environment creates a sense of isolation and historical depth.","title":"Mill and mine tailings piles left from abandoned gold mill","placename":"Cripple Creek (Colo.)","location":"Cripple Creek, Colorado","nn1":["543836","552686","554763","544139","554764","544418","554768","549148","545529","544037","554836","543857","554769","555634","549174","550568"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","used","lower","funnel","personnel","outbuilding","hoist","toward","structure","tableau"]}
