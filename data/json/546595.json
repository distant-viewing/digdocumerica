{"path":"546595.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene featuring a woman from behind as she is about to enter a taxi. The woman is wearing a mid-length grey skirt suit, with a skirt that has a ruffled hem just below the knee. Over her shoulders, she drapes a long fur coat, which nearly touches the ground and appears very luxurious. She holds a small black handbag in one hand. Her hair is styled in a short, curly blonde bob.\n\nThe shoes she wears are distinctive; they are high-heeled and patterned in a manner that might be described as snake or reptile skin texture, suggesting a sense of fashion-forward elegance.\n\nThe scene includes details of an urban setting, possibly a street lined with cars. Behind her, parked by the curb, there is a light-colored taxi into which she is stepping. The taxi's rear door is open, waiting for her to enter. In the distant background, partially blurred, are other cars and possibly some pedestrian movement, contributing to a busy urban environment. The overall atmosphere suggests a chilly or cool weather, implied by her choice of clothing.","title":"Wearing and carrying mink, a guest arrives at the May Flower Hotel.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549863","551821","556711","549876","549645","556726","551824","554329","557039","549859","556804","556725","549862","556757","549925","556742"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["taxi","enter","skirt","describe","handbag","elegance","choice","fur","curb","street"]}
