{"path":"554510.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, rustic outdoor scene likely in a forested area. Three individuals, possibly friends or hikers, are gathered around what appears to be a makeshift campsite. The setting includes a dense backdrop of tall pine trees, suggesting a remote location.\n\nOn the left, a man wearing a green plaid shirt is turned towards the other two people, engaged in a conversation but not looking directly at them. He's leaning on a rugged wooden structure resembling a table or a bar, which is cluttered with various items such as clothing, a yellow bag, a strap, and assorted camping or hiking gear.\n\nIn the center is a woman laughing or smiling broadly, clad in a dark sweater and jeans, with a red bandana tied around her head. Her posture is relaxed and expressive, contributing a dynamic element to the group interaction.\n\nOn the right, another individual, wearing a light-colored hat and a dark raincoat, is slightly bent forward holding something small in their hands, perhaps engaging in some task or showing something to the woman in the center.\n\nThe ground is natural and uneven with visible rocks and pieces of wood, typical of a forest floor. The scene conveys a sense of camaraderie and adventure, typical of outdoor, back-to-nature experiences.","title":"Young campers at a state lean-to cook their breakfast beside lake tear of the clouds in New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["558096","554667","545786","543234","554685","557777","554672","543371","542732","554513","554539","557005","545512","554502","554679","543379"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["raincoat","bandana","campsite","hiker","laugh","bent","strap","camaraderie","hike","assort"]}
