{"path":"553542.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"In the photograph, the main focus is on the lower part of several seated individuals. The image is set indoors, possibly in a social setting given the closeness and informal positioning of the subjects. The foreground prominently displays the bare feet of one person, which are notably dirty and positioned close to the camera. Adjacent to these feet, other sets of feet wearing shoes are visible, one pair in black closed shoes adorned with gold accents and the other in black peep-toe slides decorated with white bows.\n\nTo the right side of the image, one can see a hanging piece of fabric or clothing with a red, black, and white checkered pattern, adding a touch of vivid color and pattern to the scene. There is a visible contrast in appearances, from the cleanliness and style of the footwear to the grittier presentation of bare feet. The floor is a patterned, tiled surface that looks worn, consonant with the casual, lived-in ambience of the setting. This composition suggests a dynamic of contrast and diversity among the subjects, perhaps pointing to a narrative or social commentary inherent in the moment captured.","title":"A barefoot Mrs. May Watkins, mother of nine, shares couch in her Mulky Square living room with two of her daughters.
