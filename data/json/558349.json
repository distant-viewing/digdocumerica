{"path":"558349.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows an older man wearing a light blue work shirt and a white paper hat labeled \"Dariy Isle.\" His shirt has a patch labeled \"Dariy Isle\" and \"A Dairy Guild Member.\" He is smiling, while standing behind a large metal tray filled with numerous small white cups of ice cream, each garnished with a small pink and green candy flower.\n\nThe background is dimly lit and slightly blurred, featuring commercial kitchen equipment including a large metal machine that appears to be part of the ice cream-making process. Additionally, there are signs hung up behind him, one of which reads \"CUPS & CONES,\" likely indicating prices or menu options in a dairy or ice cream shop where he is working. The close-ups of the ice cream cups in the foreground show the meticulous decoration of each piece, indicating a careful and dedicated approach to dessert presentation.","title":"Donald Dannheim and his family operate the New Ulm dairy bottling. Milk is the major part of the business, but the firm also sells ice cream. Dannheim is working hard to retain the 10-cent price for chocolate ice cream bars. He and his family frequently arise at 5 a.m. in the summer to hand make and hand wrap the bars. New Ulm is a county seat trading center in a farming area of southern Minnesota founded by German immigrants.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558347","547887","558352","554495","548540","558350","545453","558361","558360","548994","555390","554441","554215","542779","544835","547364"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["cream","ice","cup","label","menu","option","tray","kitchen","presentation","price"]}
