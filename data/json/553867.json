{"path":"553867.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a wide, textured surface that looks like mudflats or a salt flat. The predominant color of the ground is a rich dark brown with intricate patterns of light brown and yellow ridges that create a mesh or networked appearance. This interesting and complex pattern seems to be created by some natural process of drying or mineral deposit.\n\nTowards the far edge of the textured ground, there appears a broad expanse of water, reflecting a light blue hue which suggests it might be relatively shallow. On the edges of this photograph, partially visible buildings, likely industrial or agricultural facilities, can be observed. These structures appear simple and functional, with flat roofing and constructed from materials that blend into the natural landscape's colors.\n\nThe background is dominated by a rugged mountain range that spans across the horizon. The mountains, featuring shades of blue and brown, add a dramatic backdrop to the scene, suggesting a remote or rural setting. Overall, the scene captures a striking blend of natural geological processes with minimal human intervention, depicted in a tranquil and isolated environment.","title":"Settling pond at a uranium processing plant.
