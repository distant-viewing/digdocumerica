{"path":"549780.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a barge filled with large amounts of mixed waste materials, possibly garbage, stretching across most of the view. The background is relatively clear with a blue sky and some cityscape visible near the horizon, suggesting an urban waterfront scene. The barge is painted in bright red colors with some portions in white, making it visually dominant against the waste and the blue of the sky.\n\nOn the deck of the barge, there is visible marine equipment such as ropes and a big red structure that appears to be a part of the barge's mechanism, possibly for loading or unloading. The edges of the barge are highlighted with black protective railings. The garbage heap is dense and multicolored, comprising various items that are not distinguishable individually, blending into a collage of discarded items.\n\nThe focus of the image is definitely on the environmental aspect, showcasing a significant amount of waste being transported, which might prompt viewers to think about issues related to waste management, usage, and environmental pollution.","title":"Tugboat tows heaped-up garbage scow from the 91st street marine transfer station down the east river.
