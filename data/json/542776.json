{"path":"542776.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaged in some sort of environmental or biological fieldwork. He is attaching a small, square-shaped piece of equipment or experimental device, possibly related to environmental monitoring, to the trunk of a tree. The device is encased in a protective plastic cover, which the man is securing to the tree with care and precision.\n\nThe man appears to be in his 30s and has dark hair. He is wearing a long-sleeve, vertically striped shirt in shades of cream and orange. This outfit suggests a casual working environment, appropriate for fieldwork. He is focused intently on his task, indicating the importance or delicacy of the work.\n\nThe tree itself has a rough, textured bark and is leafy, indicative of a healthy, mature tree. The background is blurred but shows glimmers of sunlight filtering through additional foliage, suggesting this activity is taking place on a bright, sunny day. The setting appears to be quite lush and verdant, consistent with a well-wooded area or a field location rich in greenery.","title":"Bill Roothier, entomologist with the California Department of Agriculture, stapling paper bag to a mulberry tree.
