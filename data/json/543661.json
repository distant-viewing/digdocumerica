{"path":"543661.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set in a rugged landscape. The foreground features a barren tree with twisted, leafless branches, emphasizing perhaps the harshness of the environment. Beyond the tree, there is a river flowing horizontally across the frame, bordered by muddy, rocky banks. Patches of sparse greenery are visible near the water's edge.\n\nOn the opposite side of the river, industrial buildings dominate the scene. These structures vary in size and function, appearing as a mix of factories and possibly administrative facilities, characterized by flat roofs and large windows. Some buildings are constructed out of corrugated metal, while others are more robust and made of concrete or brick.\n\nSituated on the hillside behind the industrial complex are more buildings, presumably part of the same operation, connected by visible roads and walking paths that climb the hills. The terrain is rocky and sparsely vegetated, indicative of an arid or semi-arid climate. Above the buildings, the terrain continues to rise into rocky hills, accentuating the isolation and perhaps the specialized nature of this industrial setting. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of a functional, utilitarian space, heavily influenced by human activity and industrial work.","title":"Colorado river near union carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["550673","546080","557295","543709","546084","554630","557220","552544","557377","550856","557376","546122","551156","545993","544527","551036"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["corrugated","harshness","banks","climb","hill","muddy","accentuat","influence","vegetate","river"]}
