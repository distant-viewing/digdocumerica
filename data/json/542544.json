{"path":"542544.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial setting with a silhouette of industry machinery and structures against a bright, partly obscured sky. Heavy smoke or steam is being emitted from at least one large, cylindrical smokestack into the sky, where it diffuses. The source of the emissions is dark, outlined sharply against the light sky due to backlighting from the sun, which appears to be shining directly behind or near the smoke.\n\nProminent in the dark silhouette are various features of the industrial facility, including platforms, railings, and possibly other functional components of the factory or plant, mostly unidentifiable due to the backlight. The atmospheric conditions, combined with the angle of the light, give the scene a dramatic, moody quality, with the foreground obscured and the emissions highlighted. The overall condition and visual quality of the photo suggest it might be older or taken with film, as evidenced by its graininess and the presence of minor scratches or imperfections on the image surface.","title":"Steam emission at this asphalt batch plant consists of 85 percent sand dust, according to the Air Pollution Control Board.","placename":"San Joaquin River (Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin River, California","nn1":["545446","542999","546884","544696","543011","544688","551026","550983","544700","550181","544173","557231","550328","551054","545447","545239"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["emission","imperfection","graininess","backlight","scratch","silhouette","smoke","quality","film","condition"]}
