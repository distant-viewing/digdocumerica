{"path":"544293.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph displays an industrial setting during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset based on the lighting. It captures an array of industrial machinery and piping, predominantly featuring cylindrical tanks and interconnected pipes. Some of these tanks are equipped with external fixtures and control mechanisms. The setting is an outdoor area with a gravel-covered ground that reflects the orange hues of the setting or rising sun, which adds a metallic glow to portions of the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, there is water reflecting the same warm light, suggesting the presence of either a pond or water collection area, bordered by patches of grass and other vegetation. This indicates that the industrial site is located near a water body, possibly a river or coastal area, as a narrow water strip extends toward the horizon.\n\nThe infrastructure includes a pathway or narrow road made of gravel or crushed rock that runs through the site, providing access to different sections of the facility. On the far left, extending into the water, there are also wooden structures that could be part of a makeshift pier or docking area. In the background, the horizon shows a glimpse of open water and sky, which is fading from a lighter shade at the horizon to darker shades upward, typical of a twilight setting.\n\nThere are no people visible in the photograph, emphasizing the solitude or abandonment of the area at this time. The general mood of the image, enhanced by the subdued lighting and long shadows, adds a serene yet somewhat melancholic atmosphere to the industrial site.","title":"Placid Oil Company facility near Louisiana Highway 56","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546118","546058","547667","547702","544179","546108","545996","547958","549965","545646","547200","552717","545998","557220","557386","542587"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["gravel","site","water","horizon","tank","docking","piping","fixture","mechanism","sunrise"]}
