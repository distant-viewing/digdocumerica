{"path":"550608.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of what appears to be a collection of fine, delicate feathers or fibrous structures. The composition is dark and rich in texture, capturing an interplay of shadows and light. These structures dominate the frame, with the light source visible through the semi-transparent materials, creating a natural gradient that fades from bright at the center to darker at the edges.\n\nThe feathers or fibers are thin and numerous, branching out in various directions while being densely packed together. This gives a sense of depth and complexity. The coloration is primarily deep purple and black, which adds a dramatic and somewhat mysterious tone to the image.\n\nThe background is completely obscured by the feathers, focusing all attention on the texture and patterns created by the light filtering through. It seems that the light may be coming from behind, highlighting edges and contours and creating a visually striking contrast between the illuminated and shadowed areas. The image evokes a strong sense of natural beauty and intricacy found in the fine details of these structures.","title":"Wheat-like alpine grasses","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["546156","557169","555052","557628","557582","555194","547322","557617","555155","557581","557620","547318","543931","552239","555013","557208"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["feather","intricacy","bright","illuminated","shadowed","obscured","coloration","edge","come","source"]}
