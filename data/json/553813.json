{"path":"553813.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a smiling woman standing behind a produce stand, showcasing an array of fresh vegetables. She is dressed in a short-sleeved, gingham-patterned dress that is pink and white. The setting appears to be outdoors during the day.\n\nThe woman is positioned between two tables piled high with various vegetables. On the table directly in front of her, there is a collection of cucumbers arranged prominently in the foreground. The vegetables are neatly organized, some hanging over the table's edge and others packaged in yellow mesh bags. Behind these cucumbers, the table hosts a larger assortment of produce including different kinds of squashâ€”both yellow and green variegated ones, round white and striped squashes. Garlic bulbs can also be seen hanging in front of the woman.\n\nThe table behind her displays a broader variety of fruits and vegetables. Seen are boxes and piles containing tomatoes, several melons with distinct patterns, onions, and what looks like peaches or apricots among other produce. Each item is carefully arranged to showcase its freshness and quality.\n\nIn the background, there is a green and white structure, presumably a building related to the market or farm. To the right of the woman, a rustic wooden rocking chair can be seen, hinting at a rural or suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a vibrant, farm-fresh produce stand tended by a woman who appears proud and happy to be presenting her goods. The rich colors of the produce stand out against the neutral backdrop, drawing attention to the natural bounty displayed.","title":"Produce from a farm near Chauvin.
