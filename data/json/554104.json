{"path":"554104.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a metal chain that is diagonally stretched across the upper portion of the image with several attached locks. The focus is primarily on the chain and locks, which are silhouetted against a slightly cloudy sky. In the background, the scenery includes lush greenery with various types of tropical vegetation and trees. This outdoor setting gives a sense of being in a rural or semi-rural area. The foreground is darker, possibly indicating shadowed ground, and there's a path or a clearing visible leading into the grassy area with trees. The overall mood feels serene and slightly mysterious due to the focus on the chain and locks in the foreground against the natural landscape.","title":"Closed-off area earmarked for development.
