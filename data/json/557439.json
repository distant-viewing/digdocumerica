{"path":"557439.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural pastoral landscape. In the foreground, there is a large field with dry, golden grass where numerous cows are grazing, spaced apart from one another. A bit further back in the middle of the image, there is a farm, featuring a prominent red barn and a white house next to it. Several trees, possibly oaks, are scattered around the farm buildings.\n\nThe background of the photograph showcases rolling hills that gradually ascend in height. These hills are green and brown in color and seem to be sparsely vegetated, with visible patches of shrubs and rocks. Additionally, there are several white wind turbines installed along the rises of the hills, which stand out against the natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a quiet and expansive rural setting that merges agricultural activity with renewable energy generation. The composition balances the elements of human habitation and natural environment, evident in the grazing cattle, farm structures, and wind turbines amidst the natural landscape.","title":"Farmland in the irvine ranch area near Newport beach.
