{"path":"547334.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a dance hall where couples are joyfully engaging in a dance. The atmosphere is dynamic and full of movement. Various dancers, blurred through motion, are scattered across the venue, contributing to a sense of action and festivity. \n\nIn the foreground, a couple stands out prominently; the woman wears a brown dress with a full skirt mid-spin, radiating the style of the era. Her partner, a man in a yellow shirt and beige trousers, dances closely with her. Other dancers in the background wear similarly period-appropriate attire, including women in swirling dresses and men in short-sleeve shirts and trousers.\n\nThe mood conveyed is cheerful and social, with a touch of nostalgia given the vintage fashion and grainy quality of the image. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a community hall or similar venue, with plain walls and a hard floor suitable for dancing. The focus on movement and joyous interaction among the attendees is central to the composition, effectively conveying an evening of dance and connection among a community.","title":"The pershing memorial auditorium, one of the capital's chief buildings, is the scene of the 33rd annual folk dance festival of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547386","547403","558286","547317","547274","558284","547387","558285","547271","547371","547383","553241","557790","556288","551019","551710"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dance","dancer","hall","venue","couple","trousers","dancing","festivity","radiat","swirling"]}
