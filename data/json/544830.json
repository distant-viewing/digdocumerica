The primary focus is on what appears to be remnants of red commercial equipment, possibly related to vending or dispensing machines. A noticeable item in the heap is one that features a partially crushed and torn advertisement for Coca-Cola with the slogan \"Here's the real thing\", alongside the iconic logo.\n\nThe foreground prominently shows a large, flattened, and disfigured red metal object, detailed with vending machine components like coin slots, a selection keypad, and a product dispensing area. There are visible rusts and debris, demonstrating the worn-out condition and neglect. The backdrop is cluttered with various forms of rubbish, including more bits of red and white metal, wires, and general waste. The scene is set under a clear blue sky, indicating the image was taken during a bright, sunny day. The overall composition illustrates a chaotic and abandoned state, highlighting environmental concerns related to waste and disposal practices.","title":"National metals junkyard","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544831","553863","556640","547625","554300","548147","547611","554318","554301","556324","542585","552740","546267","549307","548758","554320"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["machine","waste","selection","jumble","thing","bits","chaotic","flatten","scrapyard","rubbish"]}
