{"path":"555387.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a serene landscape, capturing a broad view of a partially dried-up lake surrounded by mountainous terrain. The foreground shows foliage with autumn-colored leaves on tree branches, suggesting the season is either autumn or nearing winter. These branches partially frame the lake view, adding a natural border to the scene.\n\nThe lake itself has receded significantly, exposing a vast stretch of sandy and muddy shores that weave into the water body. Patches of water and puddles linger on the exposed lakebed, which appear slightly textured possibly due to footprints or erosion patterns. The lake extends into the distance, flanked on both sides by mountains which subtly fade into the mist, creating a sense of depth.\n\nThe serene water surface reflects the light blue sky. On the far left, there appears to be a cluster of objects or small structures near the shoreline, but they are too distant to identify precisely. The overall atmosphere is calm and untouched, predominantly natural with minimal to no visible human activity or intervention. This site seems remote and peaceful, offering a tranquil view of nature's quiet beauty and its cycles of change.","title":"Detroit lake at shown at an alltime low in the fall of 1973 due to infrequent snowfall and rain the year before.
