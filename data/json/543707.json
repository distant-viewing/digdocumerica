{"path":"543707.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense view of flowing lava. The image features glowing, molten lava displaying rich orange and red hues that suggest extreme heat. The main focus is on the swirling, viscous lava which creates textured waves and ripples as it flows. The composition of the photo enhances the dynamic nature of the lava, highlighting the fluidity and motion inherent in volcanic activity.\n\nThe perspective appears to be from a relatively close range, looking into an area where the lava is contained or channeled, possibly within a volcanic crater or a lava tube. The upper part of the image shows the dark, cooler edges of rock, framing the brightly illuminated lava below. The lighting accentuates the glowing lava against the darker, shadowy surroundings, enhancing the contrast between the intense heat of the molten rock and the cooler, solid rock around it.\n\nNo people or other objects are visible in the photograph, directing the entire focus on the natural geological process. The background is mostly engulfed in darkness, which helps to emphasize the vibrant colors and the flow of the lava. The image captures a moment of natural power and geological activity, displaying the beauty and danger of volcanic lava flows.","title":"The interior of the 2500 degree F. furnace where crushed bottles are made into molten glass.
