The river is bathed in the low, warm light of the setting sun, creating a spectacular contrast with the darker surrounds. Scattered along the riverbank are small inlets or bays, reflecting the sunlight and enhancing the overall golden glow. The background exhibits a range of mountains dimly silhouetted against the horizon under a gradient sky that transitions from dark blue to hues of orange and yellow. The topography and lighting combined with the winding form of the river create a tranquil and picturesque scene. There are no people or noticeable man-made structures in the image, emphasizing the natural beauty and peacefulness of the landscape.","title":"Colorado river at sunrise","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548181","547731","548909","548910","551206","553816","554762","548182","557447","545145","552597","552294","550646","542653","550560","544711"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["river","inlet","peacefulness","topography","bay","bathe","riverbank","orange","sunset","combine"]}
