{"path":"554732.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a serene woodland scene. The view is composed of multiple vertical tree trunks standing prominently in the foreground. These trees are dark in color, possibly silhouetted by the lighting behind them, and they form a slightly dense barrier that partly obscures what lies beyond.\n\nBehind the tree trunks, the background glows with a soft light, possibly from the sun, suggesting either a sunrise or sunset scenario. The light filters beautifully through the foliage, highlighting leaves with various shades of green and yellow, indicating either spring or summer season.\n\nThrough the gaps between some of the trees, there's a glimpse of a calm body of water in the distance, reflecting the light and contributing to the ambiance of tranquil natural beauty. The play of light and shadow, combined with the natural elements, gives the photograph a peaceful, almost ethereal quality. The overall composition is well-balanced between the darkness of the tree trunks and the vibrancy of the light-filled background, creating a captivating visual contrast.","title":"Striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), yellow tree, also called moosewood, at","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554394","555118","542931","555116","543581","547643","542849","555096","542932","543621","554393","555217","550791","554967","543700","553075"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["trunk","light","tree","gap","vibrancy","sunrise","darkness","scenario","barrier","spring"]}
