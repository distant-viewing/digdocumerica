{"path":"544972.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up of several jellyfish submerged in water contained in what appears to be a glass or transparent bowl. The jellyfish are translucent with visible radial symmetry consisting of concentric circles of ridges or ribs that extend outward from the center of their bodies, creating a detailed pattern.\n\nThere are small particles or debris visible in the water, suggesting it may not be perfectly clean. The light source is coming from above, as indicated by the bright areas and reflections on the surface of the water and the bowl's edges. These reflections add some highlights to the otherwise subdued and murky aquatic environment.\n\nThe image has a somewhat vintage or aged quality, with grain and slight color shifts that give a somewhat greenish and pink tint to the scene, adding to the overall moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere. The focus on the jellyfish, combined with the defocused background elements, centers the viewer's attention on the ethereal forms of these marine creatures.","title":"Jellyfish","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543277","555060","555069","548713","555365","543187","548719","547968","555556","546138","555023","546779","551597","548717","557619","551364"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["bowl","translucent","rib","reflection","symmetry","creature","circle","particle","grain","tint"]}
