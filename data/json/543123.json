{"path":"543123.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a mountainous landscape under a partly cloudy sky. The composition is dominated by a ridgeline or hillside that slopes from the foreground into the mid-ground. The terrain is rocky and sparsely vegetated, primarily with what appear to be coniferous trees.\n\nA distinct feature of the image is the partial rainbow in the upper left quadrant, seemingly emanating from a cloud. The rainbow displays a spectrum of colors but is faint and covers only a small portion of the scene.\n\nIn the background, steep mountain slopes can be seen, shrouded in a haze that adds a sense of depth and mystery to the scene. These slopes have patches of snow or light-colored rock, contrasting with the darker rocky textures elsewhere.\n\nThe sky above is a muted blue, partially covered by clouds that contribute to the overall serene yet somewhat dramatic ambiance of the setting. The lighting suggests it might be either earlier or later in the day, given the softness of the light and shadows present.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a tranquil wilderness scene, highlighted by the natural phenomenon of the rainbow which adds a touch of color and wonder to the rugged landscape.","title":"Rainbow above the shores of Mono Lake.
