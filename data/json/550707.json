{"path":"550707.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features two large logging trucks loaded with logs at a lumber yard. Each truck is backed up with visible rear bumpers, and the license plates indicate that this scene is likely taken in the USA. The truck on the left shows an obscured plate with \"68 47\" and possibly \"TEXAS\" while the one on the right has a clearer plate marked as \"TEXAS 3J5840.\" The logs are tightly stacked on each truck, secured in place with visible metal chains and frameworks that hold the logs above the beds of the trucks.\n\nThere's a loader with a grapple seen behind the truck on the right, suggesting ongoing work in loading or unloading the trucks. The background includes additional piles of logs and parts of industrial machinery, indicating that this photograph is taken at a site actively engaged in logging or timber processing. The landscape in the backdrop includes tree-covered hills, hinting that the location is in a forested or rural area. The overall atmosphere appears work-oriented and industrial.","title":"Logging trucks checking in at the oxford paper mill at rumford on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["554420","542856","552202","542855","542616","542854","542790","554416","555154","545046","553631","554419","552583","542780","545930","552163"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","truck","plate","load","loader","lumber","bumper","unload","license","timber"]}
