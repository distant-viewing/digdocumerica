{"path":"548836.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a roughly circular, hand-painted wooden sign mounted on a vertical black post. The sign, looking weather-worn with jagged, uneven edges and chipped paint, displays a warning message in hand-written, black capital letters. The message contains several misspellings or abbreviations and reads, \"NO TRESPES, PRIVET PROPERTY, NO FISHING ALLOW, KEEP OUT.\"\n\nAttached to the post is a strand of barbed wire that appears to extend off the frame, implying it is part of a larger boundary or fence. The background is a broad, open field that appears to be plowed or barren, with no visible vegetation, under a clear sky. The horizon is flat with a few sparse, distant trees, and possibly small structures visible. The setting suggests a rural or agricultural area with strict access restrictions. The emphasis is on private property rights and prohibitions against trespassing and fishing.","title":"This sign on the Colorado River is misspelled but the message is clear.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548845","548846","557441","554103","549129","557474","545159","547910","544228","547123","555582","548063","543168","553956","548951","552076"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["message","post","fishing","trespassing","restriction","strand","capital","warning","hand","property"]}
