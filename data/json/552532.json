{"path":"552532.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a set of wooden railroad tracks. The focus is on the wooden ties, which are worn and weathered, showcasing various textures and patterns from the wood grain. Metal rails are mounted on these ties, shining slightly under the ambient light, stretching away into the distance where they converge at a vanishing point. The rails are bolted to the wooden ties with large, visible metal bolts.\n\nAdjacent to the tracks, there are glimpses of a paved area with what appears to be cobblestones, and slightly visible are other parallel tracks that suggest a larger, more complex railway system or a railway yard. The background is generally out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention primarily to the details and the linear perspective created by the tracks. The atmosphere suggests a sunny day, given the brightness and shadows cast on the wooden ties and surrounding areas. No people or moving objects are present in the scene, emphasizing the stillness and the industrial function of the location.","title":"Railroad track in kewanee","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["544324","549206","556873","556769","544706","556783","556853","544677","556856","547050","556877","556851","545378","556841","550790","556902"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["tie","track","bolt","rail","railway","cobblestone","vanish","shine","converge","grain"]}
