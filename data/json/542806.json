{"path":"542806.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dynamic coastal scene. The composition features three individuals riding horses along a sandy beach. The beach is bordered by a large, verdant cliff on the left, contributing a dramatic backdrop to the scene. The ocean is visible with moderate waves and scattered rocks protruding above the water surface, lending a rugged feel to the seascape.\n\nThe beach itself appears soft and is strewn with small patches of seaweed and debris. In the foreground, tufts of tall beach grass sway, partially framing the scene and adding a touch of wild, natural texture. The lighting suggests it might be either late afternoon or early morning, given the soft, diffused quality of the light and the long shadows cast by the riders and their horses.\n\nThe riders are spaced apart, each in motion, suggesting a leisurely ride along the shore. They are all facing towards the left side of the frame, moving parallel to the waves. The overall ambiance of the image is peaceful, with the rhythmic sound of the waves likely accompanying the hoofbeats of the horses along the sandy shore.","title":"Trinidad Beach","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["542800","543014","543071","542885","542966","542956","542810","543366","557992","544308","553102","542891","557988","544414","547697","544362"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","beach","rider","wave","ride","sound","shore","seaweed","sway","seascape"]}
