{"path":"546063.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a waterway, featuring an elderly man and an industrial setting. The man, seated at the back of a small motorboat, is steering the vehicle. Dressed in casual attire, he wears a white cap, sunglasses, and a dark zip-up jacket over a light-colored shirt, paired with light slacks. His expression is serious and focused.\n\nThe boat appears to be moving away from a large industrial complex located at the water's edge. This facility includes several tall, cylindrical structures—silos or storage tanks, predominantly white with blue tops. These are lined up along a dock, reflecting on the water’s surface, which ripples with the movement of the boat. The background features a lush tree line under a clear blue sky, contrasting with the industrial foreground.\n\nThe photograph seems timed during the late afternoon, as indicated by the warm lighting and long shadows cast. This setting presents a blend of industrial activity and natural landscape, encapsulating a moment of navigation through a human-altered environment.","title":"Natural gas installation on the bayou segnette is approximately five miles south of the westwego public boat launch","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546976","546079","546885","550221","546892","546352","554196","557242","550841","544115","547559","544973","549417","551281","548304","547554"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["zip","slack","steer","alter","motorboat","boat","navigation","silo","encapsulate","waterway"]}
