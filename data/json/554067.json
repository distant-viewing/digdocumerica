{"path":"554067.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elegant scene of two black-necked stilts standing in calm, mirror-like water. The birds are prominent in the frame, standing side by side. Each bird sports distinctive black and white plumage, with a stark black back and head contrasted against a predominantly white underside. They have long, thin red legs and long, straight, pointed black beaks, which are notable features for their species.\n\nThe birds are reflected perfectly in the smooth surface of the water, creating an almost symmetrical composition in the vertical axis. The reflection adds to the tranquility and beauty of the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a soft, uniform blue, likely the sky mirrored in the water, which gives the image a calm, serene ambiance. There are no other objects or distractions in the background, emphasizing the birds and their reflection. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, giving the colors a slightly cooler tone.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a compelling study of wildlife and symmetry, effectively using the natural environment and characteristics of the birds to create a soothing and visually appealing image.","title":"Stilt birds live protected in Kanahe Pond, in a conservation district surrounded by an urban area. The pond was made more than 200 years ago by King Kanehameha the Great as a royal fish pond.
