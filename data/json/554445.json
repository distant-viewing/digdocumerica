{"path":"554445.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a man on a boat. He appears to be engaged in some form of official duty or activity, suggested by his attire which includes a light-colored shirt with patches on the sleeves and a wide-brimmed hat. The man is communicating using a two-way radio, holding it close to his face.\n\nThe boat is a light blue motorboat with a prominent windshield at the front. Inside the boat, we can see additional equipment including a small marine outboard engine, another outboard engine that seems to be heavier and probably serves as the main propulsion, and a large white battery pack. On the boat's dashboard, beside the man, there is a sticker reading \"PREVENT FOREST FIRES!\" which hints at an environmental or conservation-related mission.\n\nIn the background, a large expanse of calm blue water stretches to the horizon, fading into a misty, overcast sky. The scene conveys a quiet, sparsely populated or remote area, potentially near a forested region given the message on the sticker. This setting, along with the equipment and the man's attire, suggests that he might be part of a park ranger service or a similar agency tasked with monitoring and protecting natural environments.","title":"U.s.
