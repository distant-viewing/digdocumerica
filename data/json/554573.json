{"path":"554573.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features several horsetail plants (Equisetum sp.), focusing primarily on their intricate, vertical structures. These plants are depicted against a deeply shaded background that accentuates their vibrant green stems and the feathery, detailed texture of their spore-bearing cones. The lighting in the image highlights the tiny, bead-like segments of the cones and the slender, leafless stems, lending a vivid contrast to the scene.\n\nThe foreground shows the plants in sharp focus, each stem standing upright and adorned with spirally arranged branches. The plants seem to emerge from a bed of fallen leaves and other forest detritus, suggesting a natural, woodland setting. The background of the image is blurred and dark, emphasizing the plants themselves and creating a sense of depth and isolation. This backdrop enhances the natural beauty and delicate structure of these ancient, non-flowering plants, drawing attention to their unique evolutionary adaptations.","title":"Closeup of horsetail (Equisetum) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555031","554743","555106","555053","555052","552554","542573","555022","542574","545713","553590","555191","554993","555039","543566","542610"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stem","plant","cone","detritus","adaptation","segment","woodland","bed","branch","isolation"]}
