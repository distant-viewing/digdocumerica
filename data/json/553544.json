{"path":"553544.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a somber indoor scene featuring two women and a baby. The setting appears to be a room with worn elements, indicative of economic hardship or abandonment. The flooring is visibly damaged, with missing patches and debris scattered around. \n\nTo the left, a young woman sits in a black foldable chair, leaning forward with her right hand on her chin, suggesting a contemplative or concerned demeanor. She is dressed in a dark shirt and a long burgundy skirt, with her legs crossed at the ankles and wearing simple black shoes.\n\nOn the right, an older woman in a blue floral dress is seated and holds a baby wrapped in a white blanket. Her expression is serious, and she appears to be gazing directly outside the frame or possibly at the young woman.\n\nIn the background, the room opens up to another dark space where other objects and the outside light are barely perceptible. A door frame on the right hints at additional, unseen parts of the setting.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is one of quiet, reflective domestic life, tinged with a sense of melancholy or concern. The placement and posture of the figures, as well as the state of the surroundings, contribute to a narrative that seems to focus on everyday challenges within a personal or family context.","title":"Mrs. May Watkins (right) sits in her Mulky Square house with the youngest of her nine children and a daughter-in-law. Much of her time is spent like this. The kitchen in the background badly needs cleaning, but the incentives are lacking.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553523","544356","553496","558409","543041","557898","544364","552956","552935","544368","553535","550090","557353","557632","557368","552612"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["baby","woman","room","hardship","ankle","burgundy","flooring","chin","placement","blanket"]}
