{"path":"545136.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of community recycling activity. Several individuals, including adults and children, are engaged in sorting large quantities of aluminum cans that are scattered across the ground in a disorderly manner. They appear to be organizing the cans into cardboard boxes.\n\nThe scene takes place outdoors next to a building with a large white and glass window and a brick wall. There is a sign on the building that reads \"CAN INDUSTRY RECYCLING PROGRAM\" and includes the slogan \"We care. Take Part.\" This suggests the activity is part of an organized effort to promote recycling.\n\nIn the background, there's a glimpse of a rural or semi-industrial setting with a fence and additional structures, possibly indicating that the location is on the outskirts of a town or in a less developed area. The sky appears overcast, giving the photograph a slightly gloomy ambiance, which contrasts with the active engagement of the participants in the recycling effort.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a snapshot of environmental consciousness and community involvement, highlighting the effort to recycle and manage waste more effectively, relevant to discussions around sustainability and environmental protection.","title":"The Alameda Elementary School collected 8,000 pounds of tin cans to raise money to send 8th graders to Washington, D.C.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548758","544827","551391","543927","544800","548755","556636","550060","545299","542549","542550","542655","551427","550056","553039","552948"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["recycling","effort","can","sustainability","aluminum","quantity","slogan","community","protection","involvement"]}
