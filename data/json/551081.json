{"path":"551081.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic scene featuring two weathered wooden structures, possibly makeshift shacks, which serve as a living or operational space. The buildings are composed mostly of old, discolored wood, with parts made of other materials suggesting ongoing repairs or modifications.\n\nThe left structure has a faded and partially detached door. The roof appears patchy and worn, indicative of exposure to elements. In front of this structure is a ground area with a chicken visible, adding to the rural feel of the scene.\n\nThe structure on the right has multiple items around and in front of it, giving the scene a lived-in and utilitarian look. Thereâ€™s a porch area visible, cluttered with various objects like a broom, shovel, bucket, and miscellaneous containers. Clothes hang on a line, implying habitation. A red gas can sits prominently in view, and there are wires extending into the shack, hinting at makeshift electrical connections.\n\nIn the background, heavy vegetation partially obscures the sky, suggesting a secluded or rural setting. The ground is unpaved and looks compact, possibly dirt or gravel, consistent with a location that lacks modern infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of rustic subsistence living, with makeshift arrangements and practical use of space and materials common in a rural or undeveloped setting.","title":"A house","placename":"Charleston (W.
