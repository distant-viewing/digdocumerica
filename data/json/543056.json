{"path":"543056.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic view contrasted with foreground litter. In the foreground, there is discarded garbage prominently featuring a large cardboard box labeled \"Pampers\" which is partially collapsed, alongside other smaller pieces of trash strewn around it. The litter is tangled amongst wild brush and branches, indicating that it has been carelessly thrown into nature.\n\nThe background provides a stark contrast to the polluted foreground, showing a beautiful coastal landscape. The view overlooks a tranquil bay dotted with large rock formations emerging from the water. The waters are calm, reflecting a clear sky. The coastline extends into the distance where itâ€™s fringed with lush green vegetation and interspersed with sections of beach. The horizon is met with a clear, bright sky suggesting a sunny day.\n\nThis composition highlights environmental pollution, particularly how natural beauty is marred by human negligence in waste disposal, emphasizing an ecological concern.","title":"Litter mars this glimpse of shoreline","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550687","555228","546374","547525","548741","552936","551247","552098","551440","550352","552100","543676","552080","549820","543765","543589"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["litter","fringe","tangle","collapse","throw","strew","brush","disposal","cardboard","pollute"]}
