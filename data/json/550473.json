{"path":"550473.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a mongoose standing upright among tall, dense grass. The mongoose's pose is alert, and it appears to be carefully observing its surroundings. Its fur is predominantly brown with subtle variations in shading that suggest a natural texture and perhaps camouflage within its environment.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred but has a gentle gradient from a lighter sky at the top to a darker earthy tone at the bottom, giving the impression of twilight or an overcast day. The foreground, where the mongoose is located, is more focused although still softly lit, emphasizing the natural theme of the image.\n\nThe composition of the photograph has the mongoose positioned slightly to the right, creating a balanced visual interest across the image. Tall grass blades to the left are slightly out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention more prominently towards the mongoose. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of quiet observation and subtle intimacy with nature.","title":"Day's work done, the parka squirrel stands on the bank and surveys its domain.
