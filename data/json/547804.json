{"path":"547804.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a mounted moose head on the exterior wall of a building that appears to be a store. The moose head, prominently displaying a large set of antlers, is hung near the corner of the building, partially wrapped with green leafy vines, suggesting it has been there for some time. Part of the architecture visible includes red posts and a white wooden wall, embodying a rustic charm.\n\nThe building features several signs that hint at its commercial nature. One large, prominent sign states \"WE GIVE BIG G STAMPS,\" styled with a large \"G\" in a resemblance to a postage stamp, indicating a promotional loyalty program typical of mid-20th century stores. Other signage reads \"SAUSAGES BACON EGGS,\" suggesting that the store likely sells a variety of groceries, perhaps with a focus on local or traditional foods.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus, allowing the moose head and the storeâ€™s various signs to dominate the composition. The overall vibe is quaint and somewhat nostalgic, evoking a sense of a small-town or rural community store. This setting could be in a location where hunting and wildlife are integral to the local culture, which might explain the presence of the moose head as part of the store's exterior decor.","title":"Storefront in ben wheeler, on state highway 64 between Dallas and Tyler","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["558256","555377","554184","554457","554185","554286","544373","552513","555640","558281","552691","546187","552511","543580","552518","557804"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","head","hunt","vine","grocery","embody","antler","sign","sell","wall"]}
