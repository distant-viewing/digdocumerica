{"path":"550867.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a slightly hazy and overcast industrial or semi-industrial landscape dominated by numerous telegraph and utility poles of varying heights and designs, stretching back into the distance. There is a railway line in the foreground, leading the viewer's eye towards a faintly visible train in the distance, characterized by a dome-shaped top, possibly a passenger train.\n\nThe setting is fairly green, indicating some level of vegetation, with bushy and leafy plants around the railway tracks, suggesting either a neglected or naturally overgrown area. The sky is overcast, contributing to the slightly gloomy ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe background is somewhat obscured by haze, but there appear to be more industrial structures, including large poles and possibly factories or warehouses in the far distance, hinting at an industrial zone or a suburban area close to industrial activity. Overall, the image conveys a feeling of quietness yet underlined with human industrial influence.","title":"Smoke from the Neenah Foundry Company obscures buildings on the southside of town.
