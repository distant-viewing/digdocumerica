{"path":"545043.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody river scene. In the center of the frame, a small white boat is traveling on the water, creating a distinct wake behind it which ripples outward in a V-shape pattern. The boat appears to be the sole focus of activity in an otherwise calm environment.\n\nThe water itself is notable for having two different color tones. On the left side, the water appears darker and reflects the sky and perhaps some surrounding elements not visible in the photograph. The right side of the water has a lighter, somewhat murky tone, suggesting perhaps shallower water or a different bottom surface, or possibly the presence of pollutants. This division creates a visually striking contrast in the composition.\n\nThere are no visible people in the boat; the boat appears to be either remotely operated or moving at a slow pace allowing the photograph to be taken without obvious signs of human activity. In the background, the edges of the riverbanks or docks are faintly visible, but details are minimal, emphasizing the expanse and uninterrupted view of the water. The overall atmospheric quality of the image, with its rich, subdued coloring and the presence of mist or a soft focus, contributes to a sense of quiet and isolation.","title":"Pollution in the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547685","547276","547674","549458","549417","551214","544758","550773","546976","550831","557255","551148","550989","550769","551281","552310"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","v","water","division","pollutant","coloring","pace","wake","operate","riverbank"]}
