{"path":"553659.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene where several individuals are busy working in a field, which appears to be partially flooded or irrigated, creating reflective patches of water. The field is segmented into rectangular plots, suggesting different crops or stages of planting.\n\nThree people are visible, interacting with the setting in various manners. Towards the left, two of the individuals, one wearing a pink shirt and the other in darker clothing, are either planting or tending to the crops, bending towards the ground. On the far right, another person is seen in lighter attire, standing and possibly overseeing or preparing to work.\n\nThe backdrop features a dramatic, rugged hill with sparse vegetation, mostly in shades of brown and green, indicating a dry or arid regional climate. Below the hill, a dense row of trees lines the rear of the field, providing a sharp contrast in color and suggesting a cultivated or managed green area perhaps to act as a windbreak or for environmental balance.\n\nThe sky is clear and vividly blue, underlining the brightness and clarity of what appears to be a sunny day. Overall, the composition emphasizes a rural, rustic setting focused on agriculture and the natural environment.","title":"Field of young alfalfa and oats on the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
