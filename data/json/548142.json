{"path":"548142.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense, overlapping mass of small fish swimming in water. The image is captured from a top-down perspective, showing the fish tightly clustered together, creating a pattern of dark, elongated shapes against the slightly lighter water background. The varying orientation of the fish adds to the visual complexity of the scene. The water appears somewhat murky, suggesting a natural, possibly freshwater environment. The overall tone of the image is dark with brownish hues, emphasizing the feeling of depth and density in the water. The fishes' scales and fins are faintly visible, contributing to the textured appearance of the mass. No human presence, man-made objects, or visible landmarks are discernible in this image; it focuses solely on the natural aquatic life.","title":"Fingerlings the size of paper clips at the Eagle Creek Fish Hatchery, near the Cascade Locks on the Columbia River.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["553878","551364","553877","543315","546792","546784","542892","555556","546846","547704","548713","545063","557496","555560","543189","545075"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","mass","fin","orientation","overlap","landmark","swim","water","density","complexity"]}
