A large blaze is emitting intense yellow and orange flames along with a thick, dark smoke obscuring much of the surroundings. The facility appears to comprise multiple levels with visible metallic structures, including beams and staircases. There are no visible human figures in the image, focusing entirely on the industrial operation. In the background, against the night sky, some additional lights are faintly visible, possibly indicating other parts of the plant or surrounding infrastructure.
