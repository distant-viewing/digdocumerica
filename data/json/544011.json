{"path":"544011.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning urban sunset scene. The sky dominates the composition with gradations of orange, yellow, and deep red hues, centered around a large, glowing sun setting near the horizon. Electrical power lines stretch across the frame, prominent in the foreground against this vivid backdrop.\n\nA towering electricity pylon on the left side of the image anchors the complex network of power lines. Silhouettes of various buildings punctuate the horizon, including high-rise structures which suggest a cityscape. The skyline also features finer details such as cranes and other urban infrastructure, contributing to a layered industrial feel.\n\nIn the background, faint outlines of mountains are visible, adding depth and contrast to the otherwise technology-oriented skyline. The overall mood of the scene is one of powerful tranquility, combining elements of nature and human-made structures in a harmonious display.","title":"Valley National Bank's 35-storey building near Sky Harbor Airport","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544020","549011","549020","543903","553830","543926","547732","550289","545430","543965","544613","546384","548851","548123","545418","545425"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["skyline","power","pylon","gradation","electricity","technology","horizon","line","network","outline"]}
