{"path":"548253.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic urban scene, likely taken at a subway station. The immediate focus is on a subway car adorned with bold, white graffiti artwork. This graffiti appears cartoon-like, featuring abstract shapes and figures possibly representing faces and other forms.\n\nThe setting includes a sign reading \"TIMES SQ.,\" indicating the location as Times Square in New York City. The subway car has the number \"8644\" displaying prominently on the side, partially covered by the graffiti. The car's design suggests an older model, which aligns with the photograph’s vintage aesthetic.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a woman in motion, blurred likely due to her walking speed relative to the shutter speed of the camera. She is dressed in a light-colored coat and a white hat, indicative of colder weather attire.\n\nOther background details suggest an underground station context, such as the tiled walls behind the train and the robust metal pillars. The choice to capture the moment with such elements, including the motion blur of the pedestrian, the stationary decorated subway car, and urban setting, conveys a vivid sense of place and time, characteristic of city life’s constant movement and art expressions. The overall atmosphere seems dynamic yet everyday, encapsulating a moment in urban public transit.","title":"Times Square subway station and subway graffiti","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556811","554325","548266","554324","556652","548261","548258","556814","548265","548263","556650","556653","556690","548273","553823","548260"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","graffiti","speed","car","station","cartoon","walking","motion","blur","artwork"]}
