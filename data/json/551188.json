{"path":"551188.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vibrant urban landscape, featuring a sweeping view over a river that bends gently through the city. The river is flanked on both sides by various structures, creating a picturesque setting that encapsulates urban development alongside natural waterways.\n\nOn the left side of the river, dense greenery suggests a park or natural area, transitioning into a more industrial zone with larger buildings and facilities closely lined along the waterfront. This section seems dedicated to transport or storage, given the presence of flat spaces that could be used for containers or equipment.\n\nCrossing the river are multiple bridges that connect the two sides of the city, prominently featuring an older, truss-style bridge in the foreground and several others further back, which facilitate vital transportation routes for vehicles and perhaps pedestrians. These bridges enhance the connectivity of the cityscape and offer a stark contrast of heavy-duty metal structures against the fluidity of the water.\n\nOn the right side of the river, the urban environment is denser, characterized by a combination of commercial and residential buildings. Notably, a few taller skyscrapers dominate the skyline, suggesting a central business district. There's an observable grid pattern of streets bustling with activity and lined with various buildings, creating a dynamic urban texture.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its high vantage point, offers a comprehensive view of how the city integrates with the natural landscape of the river, highlighting both the urban expansion and the preservation or utilization of natural resources as part of its urban planning. This balanced interplay between nature and development provides a holistic view of the city's character and layout.","title":"Charleston, chief city of the kanawha valley, a major world chemical center","placename":"Charleston (W.
