{"path":"543190.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a dried kelp blade lying on a bed of multicolored pebbles typical of a beach or shoreline setting. The kelp, which appears to be part of a seaweed typically found in marine environments, has a rich, dark reddish-brown color and a texture featuring copious tiny, bubble-like bumps across its surface, characteristic of some seaweed species.\n\nThe kelp blade is curled and twisted in a few areas, showing its dried, brittle nature after being washed ashore. Its edges are jagged and slightly torn, suggesting it might have been subjected to rough conditions in the water or while washing onto the beach. Attached to the kelp blade are smaller, cylindrical, bead-like structures that could be either part of the kelp or small organisms colonizing it.\n\nThe background comprises solely of the beach pebbles ranging in color from grays and browns to specks of blue and white, which provide a varied textural contrast to the smoother, glossy appearance of the kelp. These pebbles are smooth and worn, indicative of being frequently tumbled by ocean waves. The lighting in the image is bright, suggesting daylight conditions, which highlights the wet sheen on the kelp and the subtle reflective surfaces of the pebbles.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543187","543292","543191","555022","547471","547486","543142","555069","547660","548290","543183","542887","548739","543555","550458","545082"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["pebble","blade","seaweed","beach","organism","bubble","speck","sheen","specie","bed"]}
