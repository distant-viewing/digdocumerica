{"path":"548139.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a fishing rod and reel set up on a flat concrete surface by the water. The rod is supported by a rod holder, which appears to be clamped onto the concrete surface. A rock is strategically placed on the base of the rod holder, likely to add stability. The fishing rod is bent slightly, indicating either the weight of the bait or a slight pull from the water. There's a bell attached near the tip of the rod, often used to signal when a fish is biting.\n\nIn the background, the water of a lake or river is visible, suggesting that the setting might be near a large body of freshwater. The reflection on the water glitters under the sunlight, indicating it might be a bright sunny day. The focus and composition center on the fishing gear, showcasing it in clear detail against the blurred natural backdrop, emphasizing a sense of calmness and patience typically associated with fishing.","title":"\"Lazy man fishing\" at Cascade Locks on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["544303","548138","550313","542646","551025","544216","551024","549935","550666","543240","550217","543627","553081","548189","555576","550665"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["rod","fishing","holder","reel","bait","stability","weight","bell","tip","calmness"]}
