{"path":"551229.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring several horses in a pasture. There is a prominent white horse in the foreground, viewed from behind, which draws the viewer's attention with its thick, flowing blonde mane. This horse is positioned towards the bottom of the frame, providing a glimpse of its back and head as it looks off to the left side.\n\nIn the middle ground, two dark chestnut horses can be seen grazing on the grass. They are spaced apart from each other and are shown in profile, which highlights their sleek bodies and the smooth curve of their necks as they reach down to the ground.\n\nThe setting of the photograph is a lush, open field dotted with sparse greenery and few scattered plants close to the ground. The background features a thick line of trees, suggesting a forested area that encloses the pasture. This creates a natural and peaceful backdrop, enhancing the pastoral theme of the image.\n\nThe sky is overcast, with light and shadow playing on the grass and trees, adding depth and a slightly moody atmosphere to the scene. The overall composition of the image, with the placement of horses and the sweeping lines of trees and horizon, conveys a sense of tranquility and the simple beauty of rural life.","title":"Livestock are a part of the water pollution problem in the lake of the ozarks region.
