{"path":"548095.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph showcases a majestic mountain, prominently covered with snow, dominating the background. The mountain exhibits a classic conical shape typical of stratovolcanoes and features sharply defined ridges, with alternating regions of snow cover and exposed dark rocky surfaces. Its summit appears pointed, suggesting a relatively intact volcanic cone.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a lush, expansive rural landscape that spreads out under the mountain. This area is dotted with numerous small farmhouses, barns, and other agricultural structures, which appear tiny in comparison to the massive mountain backdrop. The landscape is vibrant, with patches of darker forestry interspersed among light green fields that seem to be farmland.\n\nThe overall composition of the image is balanced, with the mountain centrally positioned, creating a dramatic contrast with the serene and pastoral foreground. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late evening, as the colors are vivid yet slightly muted, and the shadows are not overly harsh. The sky is notably clear, enhancing the visibility and prominence of the mountain.","title":"Hood River Valley and the northeast face of Mt.
