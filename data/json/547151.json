{"path":"547151.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a beach where construction or maintenance work seems to be underway. In the foreground, there's a large, yellow bulldozer or similar type of heavy machinery, with a cabin and wheels clearly visible. The operator can be seen inside, dressed in dark clothing. The vehicle is positioned amidst some bare, thin branches which frame the image, possibly branches of trees that are part of the surrounding area.\n\nThe bulldozer is located on a patch of sandy and somewhat muddy ground, which shows visible tire tracks indicating recent movement. Behind the machinery, the beach extends to a water body which appears calm, with slight waves hitting the shore. The sky is overcast, suggesting an early morning or a cloudy day.\n\nPartially buried in the sand near the top of the beach are pieces of what appear to be pipe or cylindrical structures, perhaps part of the work being conducted or debris. The general scene gives an impression of a rather secluded and possibly a work zone on the beach with no recreational activity visible. \n\nThis environment suggests that the focus of the image is the interaction between human-made machinery and the natural landscape, possibly highlighting themes of development, maintenance, or environmental alteration.","title":"Army earthmover pushes soil back into hole washed out of Lake Shore Drive","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547186","547926","547939","551262","543113","547031","547254","554544","549950","551947","545665","543114","544138","543105","549740","556325"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","bulldozer","machinery","work","maintenance","branch","operator","alteration","cabin","tire"]}
