{"path":"544309.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This image captures a dynamic and rustic scene set in a dusty, sunlit canyon. A team of three horses, laden with packs and gear, is galloping down a narrow dirt trail. The horses, appearing vigorous and determined, are kicking up a veil of dust behind them, which adds a sense of motion and raw energy to the scene. Behind the horses, a person, wearing what appears to be a blue jacket and a dark cowboy hat, is mounted on another horse. This rider is guiding the team with focus and control.\n\nThe landscape is rugged; the narrow trail is bordered by sparse desert vegetation, including scrubs and small bushes, and the backdrop is characterized by the steep, shadowy rock walls of the canyon. The lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with sunlight filtering through raising dust and casting a glow that highlights the contours of the horses and rider. This setting immerses the viewer in an atmosphere that feels distinctly Wild West or associated with outdoor adventure and exploration.","title":"Entering the GRand Canyon","placename":"Peach Springs (Ariz.)","location":"Peach Springs, Arizona","nn1":["553109","544362","553113","548987","553102","553103","544420","544308","543366","544358","548838","557781","553116","543634","548830","544313"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","team","rider","canyon","dust","trail","veil","pack","scrub","adventure"]}
