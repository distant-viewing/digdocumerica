{"path":"552568.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals in an outdoor setting engaged in the activity of handling a sheep. The scene takes place in a vast, open field, surrounded by gentle hill slopes and a distant line of trees under a fading sky, suggesting late afternoon or early evening.\n\nThe first person, a woman standing to the left, is wearing a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, striped T-shirt, and watches attentively. She holds what appears to be a bottle or container in her hands. The second person, on the right, is kneeling down and is partially obscured by the woman. This individual, whose gender is ambiguous due to their pose, is also wearing a wide-brimmed hat and is seemingly in the process of shearing or examining the sheep, which is lying down on the grass.\n\nA white bucket with tools or equipment protruding stands nearby on the grass, suggesting preparation for an agricultural task, possibly related to the care or treatment of the sheep.\n\nThe background features the tranquil landscape of a rural setting, with grazing animals visible in the mid-distance, enhancing the pastoral theme of the image. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of rural life focused on livestock management with a serene environment setting the scene.","title":"At the Oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their Piceance Creek ranch.
