{"path":"554088.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene of a sandy beach with incoming waves and foam. The beach is relatively narrow and strewn with dark rocks and driftwood, which are scattered along the water's edge and partially submerged by the sea. The ocean is turbulent, with white foam forming as waves break onto the beach, creating an intricate pattern of water and foam swirling around the obstacles.\n\nThe beach is backed by dense natural vegetation which includes bushes and low trees, and it seems to be an overcast day given the soft, diffused lighting and the absence of harsh shadows. The sky isn't distinctly visible but suggests a cloud-covered atmosphere, contributing to the somewhat moody tone of the setting.\n\nThis view appears to be taken from a low angle near the water's level, emphasizing the spread of the foam and the rough texture of the beach sand. The combination of natural elements provides a dynamic and slightly rugged coastal landscape. The photograph's vintage quality, possibly indicated by a slight graininess and color saturation, adds to the nostalgic feel of the seaside scene.","title":"Surf near Kihei.
