{"path":"545128.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a coastal landscape with various man-made and natural features. At the forefront, there is a marina filled with numerous boats anchored in neatly arranged rows within the confines of a breakwater. Adjacent to the marina is a parking lot peppered with cars, and several small, possibly temporary structures are scattered around the area, hinting at recreational or maintenance activities.\n\nTo the right of the marina is a curved bay embracing a calm body of water, which reflects the sky. The shoreline of the bay is lined with a road that snakes through the landscape, bordered on one side by parked cars and trailers in a loosely organized manner.\n\nThe photograph extends to reveal a long pier or jetty protruding into the sea at the far left, and behind the central marina area, the coast stretches into the distance, marked by more natural terrain and sparse development. There are green, grassy areas and patches of shrubs interspersed with the human-made structures, suggesting a blend of natural and developed land.\n\nThe background offers a panoramic view of a larger body of water (possibly a sea or large lake), with distant mountains faintly visible under a blue sky scattered with light clouds. The entire scene is rich with details that illustrate a lively yet serene coastal environment, typically used for boating and possibly other recreational water activities.","title":"Sport-fishing marina at mouth of Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["548638","548639","548783","557462","557450","548784","542871","548075","547980","548078","554058","548637","546853","548969","548763","552000"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["marina","bay","breakwater","confine","sea","jetty","coast","trailer","manner","car"]}
