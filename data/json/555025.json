{"path":"555025.jpg","date":"April 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a dense collection of moss, taken from directly above. The moss exhibits a vibrant green color, consisting of numerous small, star-shaped clusters. Each cluster of moss has slender, spiky leaves that radiate outward from a central point, giving a rounded, bushy appearance.\n\nThe surface is entirely filled with these moss clusters, creating a lush, textured carpet effect. There is visible variety in the shades of green, from bright lime to deeper forest hues. On the left side of the image, there is a portion of what appears to be a brown tree bark, providing a natural contrast with the green moss.\n\nOn the right side of the image, partially overlapping the moss, is a dried, brown pine needle cluster (likely from a pine tree), which adds an additional element of natural diversity and a reminder of the forest environment surrounding the moss. This integrates another texture and color, enhancing the complexity and depth of the scene. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the intricate details and vivid colors of the moss, showcasing its natural beauty and the texture of the forest floor.","title":"Dry ground moss cover in a Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554571","555026","543147","555018","555027","545271","554991","555058","554993","555191","554985","554975","555183","555000","555043","555016"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","cluster","pine","forest","reminder","radiate","carpet","needle","star","integrate"]}
