{"path":"552071.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or infrastructure scene, focusing on a large concrete pillar of a bridge or structure that is partially submerged in water. The pillar is stained and weathered, showing signs of aging and distress. There is an abstract pattern of darker water stains and biological growth running vertically down the central part of the pillar.\n\nOn the left side of the pillar, a rusted metal culvert or chute protrudes, discharging a stream of water that adds to the staining pattern. This indicates some form of ongoing water drainage from within or atop the structure. \n\nAt the base of the pillar, partially submerged in the murky water, is a large pile of debris, primarily consisting of wooden logs and branches. This suggests that the water body could be subject to strong currents or floods that deposit natural materials against the structure.\n\nIn the background, other industrial elements can be glimpsed, including what looks like another bridge with similar structural components, reinforcing the setting as an area heavily influenced by man-made structures. The overall atmosphere suggests a blend of natural and industrial elements, showcasing the interaction of human-made infrastructure with the natural environment.","title":"Industry, just upstream from the 18th street bridge discharges waste from water filtering process into the Kansas river","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["558003","547890","550715","552240","550719","556944","549564","547019","552254","544674","546067","547622","553462","552247","548207","551534"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pillar","stain","submerge","water","chute","distress","bridge","discharge","drainage","infrastructure"]}
