{"path":"557834.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a gas station during what appears to be a bright, sunny day. In the image, two men are standing at a gas pump, which is likely from the 1970s given the style of the pump and the overall setting. The man on the left, facing away from the camera, is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, and is leaning against a white column, watching the other man. The second man, visible from the back, is dressed in a light blue shirt and darker blue trousers. He is actively engaged in fueling the car, seen holding the pump.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, there is a large sedan, suggesting the time period with its designâ€”an indication of typical American automotive style from the 1970s. The vehicle is beige with a dark vinyl roof, indicative of the era's styling preferences. The license plate on the car is clearly visible, but the specific details are not the focus here.\n\nThe background of the scene includes a concrete structure with columns, hinting at a standard gas station architecture of the time. There are also orange traffic cones in the vicinity, possibly for managing traffic or indicating a section of the area that is temporarily off-limits.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a glimpse into everyday life and routine tasks such as fueling a car, capturing a moment frozen in time with individuals engaged in ordinary activities. This setting helps convey a sense of the era's aesthetic and automotive culture.","title":"Two motorists watch as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission readings are registered on the exhaust analyzer.
