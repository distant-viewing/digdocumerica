{"path":"545324.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph shows a scene of two adobe-style houses painted in a warm peach or terracotta color. The buildings feature traditional southwestern architectural elements such as flat roofs, parapets, and small wooden framed windows. The building on the left has two windows: one directly facing the camera and another on the side visible wall; there's also a door between them. The building extends further back with more of the same style windows visible on the right-side structure.\n\nThe scene is soaked in a soft, warm light suggesting it might be morning or late afternoon, which accentuates the rich color of the buildings' façade. The shadows cast are long and distinct, emphasizing architectural details like the slight protrusions and textures of the walls.\n\nThere is a chain-link fence to the far left of the image, indicating a demarcated boundary or property line. The foreground shows a street with no visible traffic, lined with what appears to be a curb. The environment around the buildings, visible in patches, includes some sparse greenery and trees, indicating a tranquil, possibly residential area.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene, picturesque moment in a southwestern architectural setting, highlighted by the quality of the light and the simplicity of forms in the architecture.","title":"Adobe houses in the second ward, the spanish-speaking section","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["556629","545334","545359","555286","552966","555340","544417","556433","544911","557949","558030","544448","545356","551164","556182","551110"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["peach","protrusion","soak","window","wall","curb","building","façade","chain","link"]}
