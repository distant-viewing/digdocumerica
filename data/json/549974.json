{"path":"549974.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid urban scene full of activity and historical architecture. The central feature is an iconic red brick building with a white clock tower, known for its distinctive colonial style, situated at the end of a bustling street scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple groups of people who appear to be engaged in leisurely activities and casual shopping at what appears to be an outdoor flea market. Several market umbrellas in different colors, such as white and dark green, provide shade for the vendors and shoppers. The ambiance is lively and casual with individuals browsing goods, which include various items spread across tables and makeshift displays.\n\nThe attendees are dressed in typical fashion of the late 20th century, suggestive of the era's popular style—several men and women can be seen wearing shorts and casual shirts. One person is walking away from the camera, wearing a blue polo shirt and white shorts, indicative of the relaxed, informal atmosphere.\n\nThe street is framed by tall buildings in the background that represent a contrasting architectural style—modern and utilitarian compared to the historic building with the clock tower. The juxtaposition of the traditional and contemporary architecture adds depth and context to the urban landscape, suggesting a setting that values both its past and its present development.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft, likely indicating either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the serene yet vibrant quality of the scene. The photograph overall provides a glimpse into everyday life in an urban setting, where historical sites exist alongside daily commercial activities.","title":"Sunday morning flea-market in independence square in the center city area","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549991","551786","549659","552718","551911","557656","550115","551685","551493","553840","551823","550045","558194","555902","551447","550107"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["clock","market","short","shopper","flea","exist","value","style","polo","browse"]}
