{"path":"551091.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph features a rural or suburban setting with an aged and weathered house partially obscured by lush green vegetation. The house is small, single-story, constructed of wooden planks that are weathered and starting to peel. It appears to be equipped with a covered porch, under which laundry is drying on a clothesline, displaying items like shirts and trousers that suggest an inhabited space.\n\nThere's a strong presence of nature as numerous trees and bushes envelop the scene, creating a dense green frame around the house, which appears quite secluded. In front of the house, a small staircase can be seen leading to the porch, and the house itself seems slightly elevated, likely on stilts or a raised foundation, common in areas prone to flooding or damp conditions.\n\nIn the foreground, partially visible at the left edge of the picture, is what looks like the back of a light-colored vehicle, possibly indicating that the photo was taken either from another vehicle or near a parking area.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a serene yet somewhat isolated living environment, with the focus on everyday life as shown by the presence of hanging laundry. The natural overgrowth and rustic appearance of the building create a feeling of privacy and detachment from urban settings.","title":"Never-ending stream of cars roars by homes on busy route 60 at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
