{"path":"543469.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features an elderly couple standing at a viewing platform, possibly at a tourist or scenic location. The man, dressed in a brown jacket and a gray cap, is leaning forward with his right elbow resting on a rail and his chin propped on his hand, appearing contemplative or tired. The woman, next to him, is wearing a brown coat and a patterned scarf wrapped around her head. Her expression is neutral, and she gazes straight ahead, her hands clasped in front of her.\n\nForeground elements include a coin-operated viewing telescope, which is mounted on a pedestal and appears ready for use. Its oval design and large viewing lenses are typical features of such devices, which are often found at viewpoints.\n\nThe background shows part of a blue structure with large windows, suggesting this platform might be adjacent to a building, possibly a visitor center or similar establishment. The color palette of the scene is dominated by muted earth tones and blues, giving the photograph a somewhat melancholic or wistful feel.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, with a focus on the couple and their interaction (or lack thereof) with the environment around them. The image captures a moment of stillness and perhaps contemplation, reflective of a peaceful, leisurely outing.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547834","551454","553202","554192","544404","548614","556493","558314","551337","552859","547421","557143","557149","552931","550739","549708"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["couple","platform","pedestal","elbow","chin","scarf","tourist","establishment","outing","hand"]}
