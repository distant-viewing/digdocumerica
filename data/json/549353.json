{"path":"549353.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a natural rocky coastline with large, irregularly shaped rocks partially submerged in calm seawater. The rocks are mossy and weathered, indicating they have been exposed to water for extended periods. The colors of the rocks vary from greyish-white to darker tones, with spots of green algae or moss visible on some surfaces.\n\nWater gently laps around the bases of these rocks, causing small ripples on the surface. The atmosphere appears slightly misty or overcast, which contributes to the soft, muted tones of the scene. No human activity or other animals are visible, giving the image a tranquil and undisturbed quality.\n\nThe angle and framing of the photograph focus on a trail of rocks leading into the distance, drawing the viewer's eye along the water's path through the rocks. The overall composition emphasizes the natural, rugged beauty of a coastal environment.","title":"Slime and pollution along the Yugoslavian shores of the Adriatic Sea","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["547486","543292","545173","545122","543142","554087","545130","543243","547602","543289","543060","543186","543295","543306","543092","543250"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","basis","mossy","algae","framing","moss","trail","coastline","spot","tone"]}
