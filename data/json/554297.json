{"path":"554297.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and bustling city street scene, likely from the late 1960s or early 1970s judging by the style of the vehicles and the aesthetics of the scene. The image captures a street lined with parked and moving cars that resemble typical American models of that era, suggesting a mid-to-large-size city in the United States.\n\nIn the foreground, several cars are prominently displayed. Some are in motion and some are parked, showcasing sedans and coupes with distinctive features such as long hoods, hardtops, and angular designs characteristic of the time period.\n\nThe background of the photo features a row of buildings with several visible business signs. Most notably, there are large, colorful cinema marquees with neon signs advertising movies. The titles on the marquees suggest adult-themed films, typical of some urban areas in that era. The signs are bold and eye-catching, with one announcing \"42 St. MOVIE CENTER\".\n\nThe street is busy with pedestrian traffic, adding a dynamic human element to the scene. Groups of people can be seen walking along the sidewalk, some heading towards the cinema, others simply passing by, contributing to the urban atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its straight-on view down the bustling street flanked by vivid signage and classic cars, captures the energetic, somewhat gritty essence of a bygone era in an American city.","title":"42nd street, just west of seventh avenue","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549872","556709","550139","556724","551135","545216","549882","551913","556718","548331","548388","554310","546626","554314","554551","548410"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","era","city","car","the","sign","neon","advertise","hood","pass"]}
