{"path":"549241.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive open-pit mining operation. The scene showcases the large, layered excavation site characterized by several distinct strata of earth toned in various shades of brown and beige, contrasting sharply with the dark, coal-rich layers that are visible.\n\nIn the pit, there are various activities and heavy machinery in operation. There are trucks visible in the middle distance—one yellow and the other green—which appear to be transporting materials around the site. Pools of water have collected in certain areas of the pit, reflecting light and adding a touch of blue to the predominantly dark hues of the pit.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, out of focus vegetation is present, offering a stark contrast to the industrial backdrop. This greenery includes grasses and small shrubs, with a few bright wildflowers providing small splashes of color against the earthy tones. The foreground suggests the photo was taken from an elevated or sloped area looking down into the pit, giving a comprehensive overview of the scale and operation of the mining activity.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural world against the man-made, emphasizing the scale and impact of human industrial activity on the natural landscape.","title":"Acme coal mine","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549172","544112","549242","549167","544100","552177","544096","553049","544054","549177","544110","554631","544111","555621","549148","544785"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pit","operation","mining","stratum","site","overview","scale","coal","wildflower","world"]}
