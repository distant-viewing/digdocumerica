The sign has a bold red frame and features a white background with black text composed of changeable letters. The text on the sign reads: \"FUEL SHORTAGE IS GOING TO GET THE WORLD BACK ON ITS FEET.\" Above the message board, there is a symbol shaped like a dollar sign ($), also in red, mounted on the top center of the sign. The backdrop of the image is a clear sky with a hint of cloud, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a day with good weather conditions. The overall visual emphasis is on the message conveyed by the sign, suggesting a commentary on the economic or social impact of a fuel shortage. The photograph is taken from a perspective that focuses solely on the sign and the immediate sky behind it, without any distractions from the surrounding environment.","title":"The energy crisis in the states of Oregon and Washington resulted in attempts at humor by businesses with darkened signs such as this one in vancouver, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555413","548169","548171","548176","548168","555452","548053","555519","550092","555464","548175","555416","555494","555518","548047","555455"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","message","board","text","shortage","distraction","get","commentary","fuel","go"]}
