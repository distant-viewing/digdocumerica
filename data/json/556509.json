{"path":"556509.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an underground mining scene with a male miner at the foreground. The miner, wearing a hard hat equipped with a headlamp, sits in a small rail-mounted cart labeled \"KERSEY\". He appears focused and is looking off to the side, possibly at his work or surroundings. The setting is dark and enclosed, indicated by the low, rocky ceiling and rough walls characteristic of a mine shaft. The lighting in the photograph highlights the white, rocky textures of the mine walls and ceiling, creating a stark contrast with the darker areas of the mine. The mining cart seems rugged and industrial, built for function within the harsh mining environment. The scene captures a typical moment in the life of a miner, surrounded by the tools of his trade in a challenging work setting.","title":"Lee Skyles, a tractor driver for the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee, is shown pushing a shuttle car of coal out of the three foot shaft. The shuttle has a hydraulic push which shoves the coal onto a conveyor belt which takes it out of the mine. It is called a non-gassy mine because it is above the surrounding water table.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556367","556396","556510","556397","543775","556319","556364","556359","556358","556357","556511","556365","543743","556360","556517","556515"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["miner","mining","cart","ceiling","shaft","headlamp","trade","mine","wall","work"]}
