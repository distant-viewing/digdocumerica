{"path":"555228.jpg","date":"February 1971","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a significant amount of scattered waste and pollution covering a landscape that appears to be a natural water body surrounded by a forest. The foreground is densely covered with a wide variety of discarded objects, including bottles, containers, plastic items, boxes, and other general rubbish. The debris is densely packed, suggesting a serious environmental contamination issue.\n\nIn the background, there is a calm body of water reflecting the surrounding environment, and the waste extends into this water body, littering the surface. Beyond the immediate area of pollution, there are dense woods leading up to the foot of a mountain. The mountain, covered partly with snow, rises prominently against a clear blue sky, providing a stark, natural contrast to the polluted foreground.\n\nThe overall scene depicted in the photograph is a powerful visual commentary on environmental pollution, contrasting the natural beauty of the mountainous and forested landscape with the destructive impact of human waste.","title":"Dumping spoils the view of the Skagit River in the forests of Washington state, thirty miles south of Bellingham.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550687","550352","552100","547524","552098","550800","552811","551440","551247","547525","552080","543684","543765","550259","543056","543676"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["waste","pollution","rubbish","contamination","commentary","body","mountain","foot","bottle","plastic"]}
