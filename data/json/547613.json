The flowers appear to be arranged in a cluster at the top of a stem, with multiple petals slightly transparent and delicate in texture. Each flower has a distinct shape with a bell-like form and extending stamens.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a detailed display of the plant's leaves, which have a green surface with veins creating a noticeable pattern; the edges of these leaves are slightly darker, enhancing their texture and silhouette. The leaves are attached to thin, curved stems which contribute to the overall delicate impression of the plant.\n\nThe background of the image is softly out of focus, with hints of similar colors suggesting that the plant may be part of a larger group or field. The lighting of the photograph casts a gentle illumination on the petals and leaves, highlighting their translucency and delicate structure.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the natural beauty and intricate details of the flowers and foliage, portraying a serene and undisturbed natural environment.","title":"Beach pea","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["545707","550462","553366","555036","555024","555035","554587","558075","554576","553368","544875","554595","551368","555034","542970","553588"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","leave","stem","petal","plant","stamen","vein","bell","illumination","texture"]}
