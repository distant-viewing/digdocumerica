{"path":"555602.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a man seated on a floating platform, possibly part of a larger watercraft. He's in a crouching position holding a long pole with a bundle on its end, which appears to be touching the water, indicating he might be engaged in an activity like fishing or cleaning. The man is dressed in a dark blue jacket and gray pants. He has dark hair and a mustache, and his expression seems concentrated on his task.\n\nThe platform on which the man is seated has a simple, functional design with a visible door that leads into a white structure with a small blue door, suggesting it might be a cabin or housing section of the boat. Additional features include railings and metal supports around the platform, enhancing its utilitarian appearance.\n\nThe background reveals a serene lake or river setting with calm waters reflecting light. A forested hill, lush and green, rises from the opposite shore, filling the horizon with natural scenery. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the man and his activity against the tranquil backdrop, creates a quiet, contemplative mood.","title":"Caretaker of the Belmont reel and gun club off route #100 near Morristown, Ohio, shows the silt from strip mining that is filling the lake","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["545940","553341","547023","544973","545928","545386","550666","545932","544208","544714","551024","551406","544260","548956","552122","543484"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["platform","door","watercraft","bundle","cleaning","man","mustache","crouch","seat","concentrate"]}
