{"path":"543765.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a sharp contrast between natural beauty and environmental pollution. The foreground is filled with a large pile of garbage, which includes assorted waste such as cans, bottles, papers, and other debris, showcasing signs of human disregard for nature. Notably, a broken chair is visible among the trash, along with a few metal rods that are protruding upright from the pile. \n\nIn stark contrast, the background features majestic snow-capped mountains, which appear serene and untouched. The mountains have steep, rugged slopes, mostly devoid of vegetation, transitioning smoothly into their snow-covered peaks. This juxtaposition highlights a poignant commentary on environmental degradation, positioning the pristine natural landscape against the human-induced waste and pollution in the foreground. The clear disparity serves as a visual representation of the impact of human activities on natural environments.","title":"Open dump in the San Juan Mountains.
