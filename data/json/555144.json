{"path":"555144.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a tightly packed stack of freshly cut logs. The logs vary in size and occupy almost the entire frame, presenting a rustic texture of wood, with visible tree rings and some logs showing traces of bark on the edges. The color palette is primarily shades of brown, with variations from light beige to dark brown depending on the particular cut and condition of each log. Some logs are more rough-hewn while others have smoother surfaces. The cuts reveal the internal fibers of the wood, highlighting various patterns and intriguing natural designs inherent in each log. These patterns can be indicative of the age and growth conditions of the trees. The logs are closely stacked, leaving little space in between, which emphasizes their rounded shapes and the variety of wood tones. The incidental light enhances the overall texture, casting subtle shadows and highlights that give the scene a three-dimensional look. There are no visible activities or people in the image; it focuses solely on the piled logs, possibly staged for industrial or commercial use. The image contextually suggests logging, forestry, or wood storage, inferring a natural or rural setting though it's not explicitly shown.","title":"Stacked Douglas fir and hemlock logs on the Canyon River drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
