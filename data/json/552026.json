{"path":"552026.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a serene moment of an elderly woman engaging in fishing by a tranquil body of water. The setting is outdoor, with a clear view of a shimmering blue water surface that fills the majority of the background, suggesting a lake or river.\n\nThe woman, who is the central figure in this composition, sits on a small stool placed directly on a concrete surface, likely a part of a pier or bank reinforcement. She is dressed casually for comfort and function, wearing a knitted sweater with a herringbone pattern, dark pants, and white shoes. A practical wide-brimmed hat protects her face from the sun, hinting at a warm, sunny day.\n\nHer fishing rod extends into the water, and she holds it attentively, showing engagement in the activity. A blue denim jacket or similar garment is draped over the stool, accompanying her as a layered option in case of a change in weather.\n\nThe entire scene conveys a peaceful, leisurely activity, dominated by calm water and suffused with natural light, suggesting a moment of relaxation and connection with nature. The absence of other individuals or any distracting elements adds a sense of solitude and contemplation to the image.","title":"Fishing on the niagara river.
