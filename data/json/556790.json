{"path":"556790.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling outdoor parking lot filled with a vast assortment of vehicles from presumably the 1970s, evident from the styles and shapes of the cars. The variety of colors and designs of these vehicles paint a vibrant scene of everyday activity, highlighting multiple sedans and station wagons typical of that era.\n\nIn the background, an imposing architectural structure with striking white beams supporting its numerous sloped levels, possibly a grand stadium or a unique public building, forms a central visual element. The architecture has a modernist appeal with its repetitive angling beams and expansive use of white coloring, providing a stark contrast to the colorful, cluttered arrangement of the cars in the foreground.\n\nShrubs and small trees interspersed among the vehicles add a touch of greenery to the otherwise urban setting, bringing a sense of life amidst the metal and concrete. Above the scene, the sky appears clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day that adds vividness and clarity to the image.\n\nThis setting can convey the busy hum of metropolitan life, with personal transport playing a significant role in the lifestyle showcased.","title":"Commuters use fringe parking at the Atlanta, Georgia stadium, then ride metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) buses downtown.
