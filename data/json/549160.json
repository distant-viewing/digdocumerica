{"path":"549160.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a small, solitary building situated in a grassy field under a clear sky. The buildng appears to be a basic, white-painted structure with a flat roof and a single chimney at one end. On the side of the building visible in the picture, there are dark painted words that read \"BAN STRIP MINING.\" There is a door and two windows, one of which is boarded up. The other window is closed, and there is a darker patch which might signify wear or a different material. The surrounding landscape is an open field with long grass and a smattering of small bushes or wild plants, extending towards a clear horizon. The sky is vividly blue, and there is a large fluffy white cloud above the building, which adds contrast to the scene. No people or moving objects are visible in the scene, lending it a sense of isolation and quiet.","title":"Graffiti on abandoned school house states opposition to strip-mining near Sarpy Basin.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549159","549221","544137","554816","554707","543836","544824","556623","555609","545233","543335","555611","542588","556404","544698","556416"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["field","window","white","word","chimney","mining","end","building","picture","bush"]}
