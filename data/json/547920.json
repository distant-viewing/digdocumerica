{"path":"547920.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a serene park-like setting, framed by the silhouettes of leafy trees in the foreground. The central focus of the image is a series of identical, large, two-story houses with steeply pitched roofs, symmetrically designed with a central entrance flanked by windows. These historical, large houses with chimney structures are lined up in a row across a vast open grassy field, suggesting a planned, residential area perhaps associated with a military or institutional facility.\n\nIn the foreground, a large grassy field stretches out, punctuated sparingly by small groups of trees. The tree in the middle of the foreground frames view towards the houses and appears to have sturdy, spreading branches that suggest it is quite mature. The background hints at a coastal or lakeside location given the presence of a faint blue horizon line, which could be water. There's a quiet, almost untouched quality to the scene, evocative of peaceful, spacious environments. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows cast are soft and diffused. No people or moving objects disrupt the stillness of the landscape. Overall, the photograph evokes a tranquil and somewhat nostalgic feeling, reminiscent of a bygone era.","title":"Part of historic Fort Hancock's Officers Row at Sandy Hook","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["556433","557094","556426","549279","556472","545041","557949","550311","558110","556601","556333","556950","556959","553458","545538","547567"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","disrupt","plan","lakeside","field","pitch","punctuate","stillness","entrance","chimney"]}
