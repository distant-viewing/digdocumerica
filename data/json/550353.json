{"path":"550353.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph features a landscape with a diverse range of elements. In the foreground, there is a grassy area covered with patches of yellow flowers, probably wild dandelions. The field is uneven and interspersed with barren patches and scattered brush.\n\nTo the left and center background, there is a substantial accumulation of debris and refuse, forming a large, sprawling dumpsite. The pile contains various discarded items, although specific details aren't discernible, the general impression is one of a mixed waste dump.\n\nBeyond the dumpsite, the environment opens up to reveal a body of water that appears to be a low-water river or a lake with visible sandbanks or mudflats. The land across the water is forested, with dense trees visible running across the horizon.\n\nThe overall composition of the image contrasts the natural beauty of the flowering field and water feature with the harsh reality of pollution and environmental degradation represented by the dumpsite. The sky is overcast, casting a somber tone over the scene and accentuating the sense of neglect and ecological impact evident in the image.","title":"Town dump at eastport, looking to the bay","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550801","549944","547524","552098","550352","544637","551247","553454","550248","547520","550259","549957","544174","551440","544823","550687"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["dumpsite","sandbank","mudflat","dandelion","flower","reality","brush","refuse","field","dump"]}
