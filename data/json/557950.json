{"path":"557950.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In the photograph, a person, likely female due to her hairstyle and attire, is standing next to a unique mailbox or post in the foreground. She appears to be middle-aged, with mid-length brown hair, and is dressed in a colorful, patterned sweater and jeans. She is slightly leaning towards the post as though inspecting or interacting with it, and she holds what seems to be a letter or small paper in her right hand.\n\nThe post itself is quite distinctive, painted in a deep blue with decorative swirl patterns and gold accents. It features a large sculpture-like top resembling a decorated blue globe. The structure is set on a concrete base, and the overall design has an artistic, possibly hand-crafted appearance.\n\nIn the background of the photo stands a traditional two-story white house with a pitched roof. The house has multiple windows with visible dark shutters. A short white picket fence partially encloses the yard where the woman stands, and the ground is covered in grass with some patches of dirt visible near the base of the post.\n\nThe setting suggests a peaceful, residential area, and the overall composition of the image with its vibrant colors and clear, sunny weather gives it a warm, inviting atmosphere.","title":"A visitor to the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio, takes a close look at an old water pump and horse watering trough near the Salt Box House.
