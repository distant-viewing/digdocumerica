{"path":"553408.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a white duck standing on a patch of dark, muddy ground that's strewn with leaves and twigs. The duck is positioned on the right side of the image and is looking to the left. The duck's pose is relaxed, embodying a serene demeanor against a largely blurred, natural backdrop.\n\nThe background features soft-focus imagery of a dimly lit forest environment. Hints of green from the surrounding vegetation and the dark, possibly water-filled area directly behind the duck suggest a lakeside or wetland setting. The natural lighting is subdued, adding a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere to the scene, while the foreground is shadowed, likely caused by the canopy above casting shadows over the area where the duck stands.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the contrast between the soft white plumage of the duck and the darker tones of the natural surroundings, emphasizing the duck as the primary subject through selective focus and lighting.","title":"Under the Route 119 bridge spanning Nashua River at Groton a duck waddles across a floating island of debris and trash.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["558092","555551","551377","552993","551501","552221","548542","543663","543918","546086","550388","553346","548840","550387","557122","544539"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","embody","plumage","imagery","twig","lakeside","relax","cause","strew","wetland"]}
