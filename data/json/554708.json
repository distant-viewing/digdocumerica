{"path":"554708.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful street scene, likely from a fair or outdoor festival, characterized by a series of small, themed food stands and eateries.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a stand with a bold, yellow sign advertising \"ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES\" and \"NEW\" pizzas with prices listed (40¢ per pie). This stand has a tent-like, striped roof in alternating colors of red, yellow, and white. Attached to it, another small booth is visible where a person is attending, possibly serving food or drinks to a customer.\n\nIn the center, there is a quirky, eye-catching establishment named \"The Dog House\", themed around hot dogs. The façade of this stand is designed to resemble a comic-strip doghouse with playful lettering and colorful banners. The menu items, including \"Corn Dogs Hot Dog Cob\", are also on display.\n\nTo the right, the scene continues with another food stand named \"Frostee Freeze\". This stand has a classic American diner vibe, featuring a white exterior with a prominently displayed name atop. It seems to specialize in frozen treats, suggested by its name.\n\nCollectively, these stands create a lively atmosphere that's heightened by the carnival-like roofs and amusing signage. The backdrop shows a glimpse of a residential street with a tree displaying autumn foliage, hinting at the seasonal context of the fair. Two poles, one possibly a stripped-down tree, add an unusual visual element on the right side of the image.\n\nThe activities in the image suggest a communal, festive environment where people are eating, walking, and perhaps interacting over the food stands. The overall composition is bustling yet quaint, enhancing the nostalgic feel of a local fair.","title":"View of small shops along the waterfront, contrasts with the scenic beauty of the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Lake George (N.Y.)","location":"Lake George, New York","nn1":["551731","554187","546979","554217","551689","551495","551844","550045","558118","545154","551789","550115","554495","548544","556223","551494"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["stand","food","name","carnival","menu","diner","price","festival","booth","customer"]}
