{"path":"554986.jpg","date":"July 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This close-up photograph captures a textured natural scene featuring sap extruding from tree bark. The sap appears in various forms; some as elongated drips that have frozen in motion, and others as solidified, irregular blobs and clusters. The colors of the sap range from translucent clear to different shades of amber. The background, which is the surface of the tree, exhibits a rich, dark brown hue with rough, textural details emphasized by the contrasting clear and amber sap. The overall composition highlights nature's intricate details and the interplay of texture and color in an organic environment.","title":"Closeup of white pine sap oozing from a gash through the bark and cambian layer of the trunk in the Olympic National Park, Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542774","553586","554974","550703","553587","545288","544662","554592","551355","557616","554604","545292","555141","543488","554989","542749"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","detail","up","interplay","range","cluster","motion","form","other","tree"]}
