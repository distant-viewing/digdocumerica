{"path":"548332.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense, complex network of intersecting highways and roads viewed from an aerial perspective. The image captures a mix of multi-level roadway systems, including curved ramps and elevated overpasses. There is significant vehicular traffic visible, comprising cars, trucks, and buses in various lanes, both moving and stationary.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is an urban area with rows of large, multi-story residential buildings, closely packed together, forming a grid-like pattern. The junction is surrounded by patches of greenery, and there are a few areas with trees and grass. Notably, one large circular area adorned with green grass lies immediately adjacent to a major interchange loop.\n\nOn the peripheral edges, other infrastructure elements such as smaller buildings and additional roadways can be observed. The photograph seems to be taken on a day with good visibility, contributing to the clarity with which the details of the transportation network and surrounding structures are visible. Overall, the image conveys the complexity and busyness of urban transportation in a densely populated area.","title":"Entrance to the George Washington Bridge from the West Side Highway in Upper Manhattan.
