{"path":"545570.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a striking natural rock formation known as a double arch, set in a desert landscape under a clear blue sky. The double arch consists of two large, rounded openings, one atop the other, with their bases connected, creating an elegant, window-like structure within the rock. The rock itself is a reddish-brown color, typical of sedimentary formations, and appears rugged and textured.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several green shrubby trees and bushes, which contrast with the dry, rocky ground covered in smaller rocks and sandy soil. The vegetation gives a touch of life to the otherwise arid scenery and provides a scale to appreciate the grandeur of the arches.\n\nThe background behind the arches is composed of additional rock formations, these too rugged and reddish, similar in texture and color, suggesting a vastness to this desert environment. The combination of vivid blue sky, striking rock structures, and spots of greenery conveys a sense of remote, natural beauty typical of desert landscapes. This scene likely depicts a location in a protected park or natural area, common in regions like the American Southwest.","title":"Double arch in windows section of Arches National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545566","545559","544939","553077","545568","545582","544935","545580","545585","545578","545711","545563","545572","545584","545551","544397"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["arch","rock","desert","formation","basis","strik","appreciate","reddish","opening","know"]}
