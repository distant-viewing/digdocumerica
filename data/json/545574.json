{"path":"545574.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph displays a captivating view of a natural sandstone arch formation under a clear blue sky. The arch, which is large and magnificently curved, creates a natural frame against the sky. The rock formations have a smooth, striated appearance with tones of red and brown, typical of sandstone landscapes like those found in many desert regions.\n\nOn the lower right side of the image, a part of the rock formation prominently displays some graffiti etched into its surface. The white etching reads \"RAY GOL 77\" which contrasts sharply against the dark red hue of the sandstone. The graffiti introduces a human element, suggesting recent interaction with the otherwise natural and ancient environment.\n\nThe viewpoint seems to be from a lower perspective looking upwards towards the sky through the arch, emphasizing the grandeur and curvature of the arch while also catching the rugged textures of the nearby rock faces. The composition and lighting highlight the natural beauty and geological wonder of the scene, albeit marred slightly by the human graffiti.","title":"Double arch in Windows section of Arches National Park.
