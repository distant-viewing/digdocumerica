{"path":"550315.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential street in a seemingly quiet neighborhood. On the left side of the image, there is a large, two-story house painted white with black shutters on the windows. Adjacent to this house is a smaller structure that resembles a garage or small guest house, matching the main house with its white exterior and black details. A small, glass-paneled sunroom or porch is visible at the front of the house, with a simple staircase leading up to its entrance.\n\nDirectly in front of the viewer runs a wet, paved street that gently slopes uphill, showing a perspective that narrows towards the end. Several mature trees line both sides of the street, their branches largely bare, suggesting that the season could be either late fall or early spring. Further up the street, to the right side, there are more houses similar in style to the first, with wood siding and various colors. These houses appear well-maintained, typical of suburban or small town settings.\n\nA single car is parked at the side of the street further up the hill, emphasizing the residential and possibly low-traffic nature of the area. The sky is overcast, and the overall lighting suggests a cloudy or rainy day, which reflects in the wetness of the street and adds a slightly gloomy feel to the scene.\n\nThe environment is peaceful, portrayed with no visible people, suggesting a moment of quiet daily life in a residential area.","title":"Quiet street in Eastport.
