{"path":"551312.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image captures a serene scene on a body of water, possibly a lake or river, viewed through a blurred foreground of leafless tree branches. The main focus is a small, flat-roofed boat docked in the calm water. The dock features open sides, a solid roof, and appears to shelter a small boat or canoe underneath. The sky and water share a dusky, purplish-gray tone that suggests the photograph could have been taken during twilight. The silhouettes of the branches in the foreground create a natural frame, adding depth and an almost dreamlike, mysterious quality to the composition. The overall mood is tranquil and slightly melancholic.","title":"Not an ethereal treehouse, but a boat dock framed by the branches of a cedar.
