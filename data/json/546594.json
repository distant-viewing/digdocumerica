{"path":"546594.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image portrays a group of people in a parking lot outside a large building, which appears to be a brick storefront with the sign \"LERNER SHOPS\" visible on the facade. The scene is captured during daylight with a clear, broad view of the area, indicating it might be late fall or early spring as the trees are bare.\n\nIn the foreground, several individuals are seen traversing the parking lot, likely either arriving at or departing from the building. The people are dressed in typical cold-weather attire including coats and suits, with one woman notably in a white coat and carrying a clutch. The composition captures them in mid-motion, suggesting a moment of usual day-to-day activity. Most of the group seem to be adults spanning a range of ages. The concrete parking lot is mostly empty except for a few parked cars in the background, highlighting the spaciousness of the area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere seems calm and routine, with individuals engaged in the simple act of walking across the parking lot, possibly after shopping or while heading towards the building for some errands. The backdrop is dominated by the large building and a partly clouded sky, giving the picture a mild, suburban feel.","title":"Disciplined riders queue up for early morning express bus from montgomery mall (md shopping center) to Washington, dc","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546598","546602","546590","556801","546599","548496","549875","555449","549885","556197","556204","556790","549858","550100","546732","556773"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["lot","parking","shop","coat","spaciousness","depart","clutch","arrive","traverse","storefront"]}
