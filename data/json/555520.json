{"path":"555520.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a vintage gas station scene with several objects and notable retro aesthetic elements. In the foreground, there are two old-fashioned gas pumps with mechanical dials and hoses. The gas pumps are labeled with the brand name \"Payless\" and show different octane ratings (95 and 97). Each pump has a price display and a total sale meter which are styled in a mid-20th-century design, suggesting the pumps are from that era.\n\nThe gas stationâ€™s name \"PAYLESS\" is visible on a simple, somewhat weathered overhead sign directly above the pumps, written in capital letters. Adjacent to the gas pumps, there is a tall red and white advertising sign for \"RED CARPET REALTY of Milwaukee, Inc.\" with a phone number listed, indicating a real estate business promotion. The signage uses bold red color to attract attention.\n\nIn the background, beyond the signage and pumps, lush green trees are partially visible suggesting a semi-rural or suburban setting. There are no people visible in the image, focusing solely on the gas station equipment and signage. The overall composition captures a nostalgic portrayal of a mid-20th-century American gas station, reflective of the era's automotive culture and aesthetic. The color saturation and the type of film used also contribute to the vintage feel of the photograph.","title":"Gas station in Portland, Oregon closed because of a lack of fuel allocation.
