{"path":"543868.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a large, terraced landscape with distinct geological features. The terrain is characterized by a series of parallel ridges with a consistent, wave-like pattern that create a visual texture. The ridges seem to be accentuated by lighter-colored gravel or rock materials against a darker earthy background, highlighting the terracing effect. This could possibly be a mining site, a large-scale agricultural field, or another form of land modification for industrial or agricultural purposes.\n\nIn the background, a highway or paved road curves around the terrain, providing a contrasting straight line amid the undulating patterns of the ridges. Another smaller road intersects this highway and runs parallel to the ridges before curving away. The landscape surrounding this modified area features more natural and rugged terrain, suggesting that this marked area stands out distinctly from its natural surroundings.\n\nThere are no visible people or moving objects in the photograph, accentuating the focus on the geometric patterns and the landscape's transformation by human activity. The image serves as an intriguing representation of human intervention in natural landscapes, possibly for resource extraction or cultivation.","title":"Strip mining at the Peabody Coal Co","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553050","543673","550574","549170","544498","555812","554164","550573","542514","543674","544564","555865","553051","555873","543861","549175"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["ridge","highway","accentuate","modification","terrain","pattern","curve","modify","transformation","cultivation"]}
