{"path":"556625.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features an intriguing architectural setup in a vast, open landscape. A man stands on a neatly trimmed grassy lawn beside an unusual, dome-like structure with a tan color. This building is distinctly modern in design, featuring curved surfaces and large, vertical window panels that together create a semi-circular shape.\n\nThe man, dressed casually in a buttoned shirt and slacks, stands holding what appears to be a hose, possibly watering the lawn. Adjacent to the structure is a curved retaining wall that leads to a lower area where there is another partial structure and some construction debris, suggesting ongoing work or recent completion.\n\nIn the distance, the terrain is flat and barren, stretching far into the horizon under a dynamic sky where clouds are visibly forming or dissipating. A solitary red car is parked near the structure, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted natural tones dominating the scene. The setting gives a sense of isolation and emphasizes the uniqueness of the architectural design within its environment.","title":"Lawn on the roof is one of several unusual aspects of this experimental house built near Taos, New Mexico, using empty steel beer and soft drink cans","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["555318","556628","546464","546543","546473","556623","555321","546481","555320","546468","546469","544565","546539","555319","546518","548866"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["lawn","completion","slack","retain","pop","hose","dome","structure","trim","design"]}
