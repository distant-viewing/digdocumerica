The child, who is naked, is viewed from behind and appears to be looking at something away from the camera. The scene includes a cluttered and littered environment, with an assortment of discarded items such as food wrappers, newspaper pieces, cardboard boxes, and empty cans. The overall setting gives a sense of neglect and poor sanitation. The wooden structure that the child is standing on is rustic and old, with visible wear and patches of darkened wood suggesting exposure to the elements. The surrounding details and disarray highlight a stark and possibly impoverished scenario.
