The person's hand appears youthful with a light skin tone, and is positioned in the lower right quadrant of the image facing upward to display the objects.\n\nThe background is out of focus with muted, natural green and earthy tones, suggesting an outdoor setting with what could be grass or vegetation. The soft focus helps to draw attention to the hand and the hailstones, emphasizing their detail and the peculiarity of the event captured. The lighting is soft and natural, adding a gentle quality to the composition.","title":"Hail stones","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545906","545630","545487","553848","557197","551360","557313","543979","543850","548998","546890","543695","550048","543905","546071","543564"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["hand","quadrant","object","skin","help","tone","white","draw","event","focus"]}
