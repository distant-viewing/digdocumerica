{"path":"547692.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and playful moment among three children at a rocky riverbed. The setting is a shallow river, densely strewn with various-sized, flat rocks. The water in the river is calm and clear, appearing in patches between the rocks, reflecting a bit of the sky and surrounding greenery.\n\nAt the center of the image are three children who appear to be engaged in a leisurely exploration of the stream. One child, on the left, wears a yellow T-shirt and denim shorts and is walking carefully on the rocks. Another child, in the middle, is dressed in a red and white top with grey pants; and the third child, to the right, wears a dark floral swimsuit. All three of them have bare feet, suggesting they are enjoying the feel of the water and stones.\n\nThe background reveals a bit of lush greenery to the left side, indicating the river is possibly bordered by a forested area or dense vegetation. The sunlight seems bright, illuminating the faces of the children and casting vivid colors and shadows across the scene. Overall, the photograph offers a nostalgic portrayal of childhood exploration and discovery in a natural setting.","title":"At herring run, a stream feeding into back river and Baltimore harbor","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551159","553429","543685","543692","544352","551160","553435","543473","544187","543466","544200","543677","544183","543530","550227","553431"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","bit","exploration","rock","river","riverb","discovery","swimsuit","childhood","portrayal"]}
