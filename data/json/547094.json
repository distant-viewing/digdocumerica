{"path":"547094.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene featuring a man engaging in outdoor labor, likely on a rainy day given the water present and the outfit he is wearing. The man, dressed in a striking yellow raincoat paired with a blue-hooded jacket underneath and yellow pants, is navigating a narrow space between two large metal structures, which appear to be parts of a train or similar industrial vehicles. His attire also includes dark boots, suitable for the wet environment. He is slightly hunched as he walks, with one arm outstretched to balance or support himself against the structure to his left.\n\nThe man is wearing a cap under his hood, and there is a cigarette protruding from his lips, adding a rugged element to the scene. His expression is focused and somewhat weary, suggesting he may have been at this task for some time. The environment is muted in color, dominated by grays and blues, which contrast starkly with his yellow outfit. The setting is industrial, with visible rivets and seams along the metal structures, emphasizing the utilitarian nature of the area. Raindrops create a reflective sheen on all surfaces, adding a glistening texture to the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of industrious solitude and the perseverance required in physical labor, especially under challenging weather conditions. The composition and color contrast draw attention to the worker as the central figure, amidst the expansive and impersonal industrial backdrop.","title":"Dockhand aboard barge","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["544832","556391","542497","556447","546885","553618","544171","556896","556866","551975","553616","551869","547163","555561","552748","546032"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["hood","labor","outfit","raincoat","rivet","glistening","lip","protrud","cigarette","sheen"]}
