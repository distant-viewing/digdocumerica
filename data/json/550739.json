{"path":"550739.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man dressed in a dark suit with a light shirt, standing near a handrail on a metal platform or bridge. The setting is outdoor, with a calm body of water visible stretching into the background, fringed by dense trees that are reflecting faintly in the water, creating a tranquil scene. The weather appears to be slightly overcast, contributing to the solemn mood of the image. The man is leaning slightly on the rail, his head turned towards the camera with a serious expression.\n\nThe platform where the man stands shows signs of weathering and rust, with some wooden planks visible, suggesting possible disrepair or age. To his right, there is a metallic structure that seems part of the bridge or barrier system, incorporating both horizontal and vertical pipes connected by joints.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combined with the misty backdrop and the attire of the man, evokes a reflective or poignant atmosphere, possibly suggesting themes of solitude, contemplation, or the passage of time. The environment and his attire create a contrasting blend of nature and formality.","title":"Walter Lawrence, rivermaster, at Gulf Island Dam at Lewiston, on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["545090","552871","551397","543701","545520","550268","556563","556443","548616","553418","557032","553176","557035","557744","554926","549325"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["platform","formality","bridge","handrail","man","weathering","disrepair","passage","attire","rail"]}
