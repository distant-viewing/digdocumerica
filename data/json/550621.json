{"path":"550621.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a natural landscape featuring a river and expansive forested areas. In the foreground, dense, dark green coniferous trees cover the terrain, imparting a sense of lush wilderness. The river appears in the middle of the photograph and flows horizontally across the frame. Its banks are irregular, showing sandy or muddy shores with lighter colors that contrast with the dark waters and the surrounding greenery.\n\nTo the left of the river, the forest continues, stretching towards the horizon. On the distant right side, there's an area where the forest gives way to exposed earth or rock, possibly indicating a natural cliff or erosion. This section displays shades of brown and gray against the natural greens and blues elsewhere in the image.\n\nThe upper part of the photograph shows another layer of forest, suggesting a vast wilderness area, possibly in a mountainous or hilly region given the varying elevation levels visible. The scene captures a remote and barely touched natural environment, typical of aerial views used for geographical or environmental studies.","title":"Pipeline crossing at the Tazlina River takes the pipe from the upper right to the lower left of the frame as it moves across the Tazlina.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550620","550559","555677","550625","550527","557002","542909","550576","550622","550542","542822","550601","550531","550580","550571","550700"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forest","wilderness","river","impart","elevation","study","continue","erosion","cliff","way"]}
