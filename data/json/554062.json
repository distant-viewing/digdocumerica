{"path":"554062.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively scene at a tropical location, likely near a beach given the presence of palm trees and the sunny weather. In the foreground, a young person with shoulder-length hair is riding a bicycle to the left side of the frame. This individual is balancing a large surfboard on one side of the bicycle, indicating they are either coming from or going to surf.\n\nIn the background, a group of approximately 15-20 tourists is gathered around several parked tour buses. The tourists seem to be either preparing to board the buses or just disembarking. They are dressed casually, with many wearing shorts and tropical shirts, which fits the vacation-like setting. The attire of the individuals and the style of the buses suggest that this photo may be from several decades ago, likely around the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nThe architecture visible in the scene includes low-lying buildings with red roofs that could be part of a resort or beach-related facilities. Palm trees are scattered throughout the background, enhancing the tropical theme of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the leisurely, solitary activity of the surfer with the group dynamic of the touring visitors, encapsulating a moment where different experiences of leisure and tourism intersect.","title":"Tourists just off buses crowd premises outside waterfront hotel at Lahina.
