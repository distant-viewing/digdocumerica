{"path":"546010.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a natural outdoor scene that appears to be a park or a garden. In the foreground, there's a large, bushy shrub with thin, twiggy branches, some of which are bare and others that hold green leaves. Scattered around the base of the bush are discarded items, including a bottle hung on a branch and a can lying on the ground, suggesting some neglect or littering in the area.\n\nBehind this immediate foreground, the scenery opens up to a pathway where a person is walking away from the viewpoint. This individual, wearing a long coat, contributes to a peaceful yet slightly solitary feel to the setting. In the background, the area is lush with tall palm trees and other mixed foliage, providing a sense of a warm climate. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, enhancing the tranquil yet somewhat unkempt nature of the location.","title":"Non-returnable litter left in city park","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544648","558088","546457","544640","550345","548672","557024","543600","544651","555185","552549","557940","551328","553464","546387","553373"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["branch","palm","bottle","viewpoint","garden","scenery","pathway","climate","coat","base"]}
