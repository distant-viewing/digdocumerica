{"path":"544324.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up perspective of a stack of railway tracks, extending into the distance. The rail sections are arranged neatly and parallel to one another, highlighted by a rich range of colors from bright rust on the edges to darker hues in the shadows, reflecting a textured, metallic surface. The lower part of the image shows where the rails are cut and fitted, providing glimpses of the shaped ends and connectors.\n\nIn the background, there's a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds contributing to a vivid and contrasting backdrop. On the left, there's a wide, sandy ground, possibly a construction or industrial area, leading to a nondescript large building with a flat silhouette. To the right in the far distance, smaller structures or machinery are barely visible, aligning with the horizon. The environment suggests a large-scale industrial or manufacturing setting, likely related to transportation or railway maintenance. The photograph uses deep, saturated colors, and the angle of the shot creates a dramatic vanishing point, drawing the viewer's eye along the length of the rails towards the horizon.","title":"Near Salt River Project plant","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["556873","556902","552532","556854","556853","547050","544677","556851","556888","556841","556783","556877","554356","549206","547140","544706"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["rail","railway","horizon","up","rust","manufacturing","stack","distance","shot","length"]}
