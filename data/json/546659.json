{"path":"546659.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up of a police officer wearing a helmet, captured from the side profile. The officer, appearing focused and serious, wears a white helmet that includes a badge logo at the front and a thick stripe at the center. Attached to the helmet is a guarded visor partially covering the officer's face; the officer is wearing sunglasses underneath. The officer's dark uniform, visible in parts, suggests a formal attire typical of law enforcement.\n\nTo the right side of the image, out of focus and in the foreground, is a red object that appears slightly blurred, possibly part of a vehicle or traffic equipment. The background is indistinct, contributing to a shallow depth of field that focuses attention primarily on the officer's expression and helmet details. The overall color tones are somewhat muted, with the officer and elements of his gear distinct against a softer, less defined background.","title":"Motorcycle cop","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["551919","553610","546637","556867","547165","551918","546661","546663","546028","546634","554043","547402","546657","546675","546654","556599"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["officer","helmet","enforcement","law","guard","police","badge","profile","up","define"]}
