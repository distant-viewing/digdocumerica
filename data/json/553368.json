{"path":"553368.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a wildflower and its surrounding foliage. The flower, positioned slightly off-center to the right, features a vertical cluster of small, rounded, white blooms arranged along a stem. The blossoms, which radiate from the stem, have tiny visible stamens extending outward, providing a delicate and intricate appearance.\n\nThe flower is supported by broad leaves that occupy much of the frame. The largest leaf, prominently displayed in the foreground, has a glossy surface with subtle veins visible under the lighting. The lighting accentuates the rich green color and the textural details of the leaf, including a few specks of dust or pollen.\n\nA shadow cast by the flower stem and blooms can be seen on the leaf, adding depth to the scene. The background is dark and out of focus, which helps to isolate the subject and enhances the vividness of the green leaves and the stark whiteness of the flower, drawing the viewer's attention directly to the details of the plant.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting create an intimate and serene portrayal of the plant life, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of a shaded woodland habitat.","title":"One of the many kinds of wild flowers growing on the shore of the Nissitisset River, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of Pepperell.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549230","545695","554576","544875","553361","554587","555034","547642","554586","554574","555106","543623","554575","554745","547613","555035"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stem","leaf","flower","bloom","stamen","leave","vein","blossom","speck","portrayal"]}
