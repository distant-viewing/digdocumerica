{"path":"542866.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene of numerous wooden crates or pallets arranged methodically in a large open space, likely a storage or industrial area. The crates are evenly spaced and cover almost the entirety of the visible ground in the image. The time seems to be either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the soft, dim lighting and the long shadows cast by the crates, which add a dramatic effect to the composition.\n\nThe background features elements of a small town or industrial harbor. On the left side, there's a visible church steeple, quaint buildings that suggest a residential area, and trees silhouetted against the sky. The right side of the image opens up to a waterfront scene with a large body of water calmly reflecting the early morning or evening sky. There's a semi-industrial silhouette possibly of a crane and other machinery related to shipping or goods handling. The horizon is faintly illuminated, hinting at either sunrise or sunset, which bathes the scene in a peaceful, albeit industrial, ambiance.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the organized, man-made order of the crates against the natural and serene backdrop, offering a contemplative view on human activity within a greater environmental context.","title":"Stacked lumber","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["548790","542934","550070","550910","547572","547585","547667","547102","547903","551954","555283","555270","549305","542859","546881","548810"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["crate","pallet","entirety","steeple","silhouette","order","shipping","harbor","handling","sunrise"]}
