{"path":"544727.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph shows a rusted, corrugated metallic fence with vertical grooves, behind which the background is obscured by shadow. A sign is affixed to the fence, reading \"AT ANY TIME... WESTERN PINE SUPPLY CO.\" in a simple, bold typeface on a plain white rectangle. In the foreground is a sparse shrub with some small white flowers, directly in front of the sign. The plant appears only partly healthy, with several brown, withered leaves. The ground around the shrub is dry and littered with scattered debris and dried leaves, suggesting a scene of neglect or disuse. This setting might represent an industrial area or a less-maintained corner of a commercial property. The lighting in the image highlights the texture of the fence and the form of the plant, creating a contrast between the natural elements and the man-made structure.","title":"Landscaped entrance way","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["543122","542566","557212","547092","554103","545159","547046","543330","545823","545819","557412","548845","549129","544263","557441","554707"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["fence","corrugate","groove","affix","disuse","plant","leave","property","represent","scattered"]}
