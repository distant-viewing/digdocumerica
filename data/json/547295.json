{"path":"547295.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a section of an old building with an intricately designed front. The building's structure features a series of four arch-shaped windows. The window arches are decorated with a classical motif that includes red, floral designs on a white background, interspersed with green leafy patterns, creating a highly decorative arch trim. Each window is bordered by pillars which are similarly adorned with red floral patterns on a white background.\n\nThe brick façade of the building is a pale yellow or tan color, giving it a somewhat aged appearance. The windows themselves appear to be large and open without any glass, and the interior is dark, making it seem potentially abandoned or unused.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a prominent red \"STOP\" sign, positioned off to the left side of the photo, partially obstructing the view of the first window. There appears to be a wooden bench or platform running along the front of the building beneath the windows, which further indicates it might have been a public or semi-public space.\n\nOverall, the setting seems desolate and devoid of human activity, focusing the viewer's attention on the architectural details and the juxtaposition of the stop sign against the decorative, historical backdrop.","title":"Ornamental arches on this bank in Dwight show the influence of Czechoslovakian settlers.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547299","557643","550042","545355","552968","542815","556276","557139","552964","555949","556046","551870","553422","553479","553478","552535"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["window","stop","motif","front","pillar","building","trim","pattern","façade","arch"]}
