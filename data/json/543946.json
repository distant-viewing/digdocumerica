{"path":"543946.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and dynamic water recreation scene. The image focuses on a person who appears to be engaging in water tubing. The person is partially submerged in water, legs and feet visible and raised above the water surface, suggesting a moment of action such as falling off or climbing onto the yellow inflatable tube.\n\nThe yellow tube is prominent in the frame, half-submerged and tilting, straddling the boundary between water and air. In the background, there is a motorboat in motion, creating white frothy waves as it speeds away. The boat is blurred, emphasizing its speed and the distance from the foreground action.\n\nThe water around is relatively calm except for the ripples created by the tube and the waves from the speedboat. The setting suggests a large lake or a calm sea area, and the conditions are sunny, indicated by the bright and clear visibility in the photograph. Overall, the photograph portrays a moment full of motion and excitement typically experienced in water sports.","title":"The Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550840","558234","543881","549088","551308","544347","546317","557739","546349","545941","553335","549939","554465","549463","543942","556295"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tube","water","action","wave","speedboat","tubing","motion","excitement","motorboat","recreation"]}
