{"path":"543162.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene of a Boy Scout event focused on environmental awareness, specifically the proper disposal of cans and foil. In the foreground, an older man wearing a scout leader uniform, including a khaki shirt, green pants, and a hat with a feather, is seated on a green folding chair. He is intently engaged in teaching or showing something to two young boys in Cub Scout attire. The Cub Scout to the left is shown from the back, and only partially, while the one to the right is seated on the grass, facing the scout leader, dressed in a blue outfit adorned with a yellow neckerchief and several badges.\n\nThe background contains a large, homemade sign that reads \"DISPOSAL OF CANS AND FOIL IN CAMP BURN IT PACK IT SMASH IT OUT.\" The sign also features colorful illustrations of scouts camping and managing waste. Adjacent to this, there is a wooden bench, with a khaki hat resting on it, and more importantly, a spread of materials in front of them on the grass, likely related to their educational activity. The materials consist of assorted papers, plastic bags, and what appears to be aluminum foil and cans â€“ probably to demonstrate disposal techniques. The environment around them suggests a clear, sunny day with lush grass and trees, making for a typical outdoor activity setting in a camp or park.","title":"Scout-o-rama at fairgrounds in Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543486","543176","543230","544829","545136","544800","550056","544827","548198","554450","554540","543229","551427","551391","543927","548758"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["disposal","can","khaki","grass","awareness","folding","aluminum","illustration","feather","technique"]}
