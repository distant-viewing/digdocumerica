{"path":"553580.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features two prominent, tall trees under a dark blue, near-night sky. The trees, which appear leafless and somewhat desolate, have jagged, bare branches jutting out at various angles, with one tree taking more of a central position in the frame. The central tree's branches are stark and devoid of foliage, providing a skeletal visual against the rich, dark blue sky. No horizon or other environmental features are discernible, giving the composition a focus solely on these towering, sparse trees, which form somewhat of a vertical and angular contrast against the smooth backdrop of the sky. The image evokes a sense of stillness and might be reflective of winter or a dormant season. The lighting and focus add a bit of a mysterious or moody quality to the scene.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora skeletons of trees in the burn area known as \"Granite Creek.\"","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["554981","543621","553575","548744","543843","554994","553579","547705","555112","557579","546157","555081","553572","543722","555002","555129"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["visual","branch","tree","night","stillness","position","bit","winter","season","angle"]}
