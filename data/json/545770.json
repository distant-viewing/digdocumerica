{"path":"545770.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated on a rocky dessert terrain during what appears to be the late hours of the day, considering the red-orange glow from the sun setting in the background. The man has a beard and wears a sleeveless top, contrasting with the rugged outdoor environment around him. He is looking towards the right side of the frame, possibly reflecting or observing the landscape.\n\nThe terrain is rough and characterized by layered rock formations. The warm lighting emphasizes the textured surfaces of the rocks, enhancing deep hues of red and orange. His shadow projects dramatically onto a rock adjacent to him, adding a visual depth and a sense of the time of day to the scene.\n\nIn the background, further rock formations stretch into the distance under a clear sky, faintly transitioning into a deeper blue hue, indicating that the sun is low on the horizon. The overall mood of the photo is contemplative and serene, capturing a moment of solitude in a vast natural landscape.","title":"Backpackers terry mcgaw and glen denny rest in the setting sun at the end of the trail to delicate arch","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"Arches National Park, Utah","nn1":["545755","545753","545696","545592","554460","545767","545748","543838","550428","545300","542548","544341","545752","544392","543846","544946"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rock","formation","sun","consider","beard","transitione","reflec","hue","project","hour"]}
