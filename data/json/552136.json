{"path":"552136.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial setting where water is visibly being expelled from two pipes into a large body of water. The setting includes a tall, dark sheet metal retaining wall or barrier that looms over the water. This wall extends along the entire background of the image and appears slightly corroded, reflecting its exposure to water and possibly chemicals over time.\n\nThe foreground shows the surface of a relatively calm, dark body of water. Two distinct streams of water are pouring out from cylindrical pipes embedded close to the base of the metal wall. One stream is larger and arcs gracefully into the water, while the other is smaller, splashing directly into the water nearby.\n\nAbove and behind the wall, thereâ€™s a glimpse of a fenced area with utility poles and some sparse greenery including shrubs or small trees, hinting at an area that is not entirely devoted to heavy industry but also not predominantly natural or residential. The lighting in the photo suggests it was taken on a bright day, as indicated by the bright reflections on the water and the vivid depiction of the scene despite the inherently dark colors.","title":"Culverts from industrial plants on the Duwamish Waterway discharge into the river.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["549564","546002","550959","546891","550193","551180","546003","550720","543810","550684","546793","542990","546907","552135","550713","542983"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["wall","water","stream","pipe","arc","sheet","depiction","metal","barrier","exposure"]}
