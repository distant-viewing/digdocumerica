{"path":"557248.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene characterized by large structures and significant air pollution. In the foreground, a grassy hillside sprinkled with small yellow flowers leads up to the industrial area. Across the image, several conveyor belts and bridges connect different sections of the facility. One person is visible walking along one of these elevated walkways.\n\nThe main focus of the image is the massive amounts of dark smoke billowing into the sky from the machinery or process happening in the background. This cloud of smoke dominates the upper part of the photo, suggesting air pollution as a significant concern in this industrial setup. Central to the background, a large, solid, block-like building with no visible windows stacks above some part of the machinery, further emphasizing the heavy industrial nature of the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the image is subdued, likely due to the overcast sky, which is obscured by the thick smoke, giving the scene a somewhat grim and moody undertone. The overall composition underscores themes of industry, pollution, and perhaps the environmental impact of such facilities.","title":"Pollution from coke batteries hangs in the air over a Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation plant at Aliquippa, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. Some discharge also is made into the Ohio River, the pollution has continued since this picture was taken.
