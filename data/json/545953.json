{"path":"545953.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures two young boys in an industrial setting, surrounded by heavy machinery. The setting appears to be a complex of pipelines and machinery, possibly part of a chemical or processing plant. Large metal tanks and conduits dominate the scene, and there's a structure with a corrugated metal roof in the background, indicating a sort of workshop or storage area.\n\nOne boy, holding a camera, is aiming it at something out of the frame, showing curiosity or interest in capturing something on film. He has his weight shifted onto one leg, with a serious expression on his face as he focuses through the camera. His clothing is casual, with a light-colored jacket, pants, and boots, suitable for an outdoor industrial environment.\n\nThe other boy, standing beside the first, seems to be observing the area or possibly waiting for the first boy to take the photo. He too is dressed casually in a striped sweater, pants, and boots. His expression is neutral, and he looks directly forward.\n\nThe area they are standing in is grassy, with a simple wooden rail fence in the foreground, serving perhaps as a boundary marker within the facility.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a moment of exploration or curiosity in a setting that contrasts with the usual places children are depicted, adding a layer of intrigue to the activities of the boys. Their presence in this industrial backdrop might suggest a narrative about discovery, education, or a day spent in an unusual environment perhaps under adult supervision out of frame.","title":"Children of fishermen play near natural gas installation.","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["551225","556163","553147","545959","556604","546043","545423","556490","557899","555950","544194","546565","556583","545401","550283","550899"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","curiosity","boot","intrigue","education","conduit","machinery","pipeline","weight","pant"]}
