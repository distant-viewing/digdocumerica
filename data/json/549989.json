{"path":"549989.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a male skier standing on a snow-covered slope. The skier, positioned in the center of the frame, is dressed in ski gear including black pants, a red and black jacket, and black gloves. He is equipped with skis and ski poles, which he holds by his sides as he balances on the slope. His expression is joyful and he appears to be enjoying his time on the mountain.\n\nThe background of the image is a gradient of snowy terrain, mostly featureless except for the shadows believed to be from an overhead sun. The snowy surface appears to be textured, possibly packed or groomed, typical of ski resorts. The lighting suggests it might be midday due to the bright exposure and the long shadow cast by the skier in the snow. The setting conveys a cold but exhilarating winter sports environment, emphasizing the theme of outdoor winter activity and recreation.","title":"The great blue hill ski slopes are 10 miles from the center of Boston and can be reached by street car and bus.
