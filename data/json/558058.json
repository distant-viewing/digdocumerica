{"path":"558058.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a small town captured during daylight. The main components of the town layout can be observed from this high altitude.\n\nAt the center of the image runs a main road, bisecting the town, with neatly arranged rows of small commercial and residential buildings on both sides. The buildings display a variety of architectural styles and colors, including red, white, and gray hues. The southern side of the road features a bright red building, possibly a service station or a small commercial outlet, which stands out due to its vibrant color amidst mostly muted tones.\n\nSurrounding the town are patches of dense greenery, indicating the presence of trees and other vegetation, which can also be seen interspersed among the buildings and along the streets. These green areas are beginning to show hints of autumn colors, suggesting the photograph was taken in the fall. The edges of the photo indicate that the town is nestled in a largely forested area, with a blurry appearance of trees providing a natural boundary.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is prominently a large tarmac road or highway that contrasts with the smaller town roads due to its clearer, more even surface and the absence of neighboring trees right against it. Additionally, the highway has vehicles that appear as tiny, colored specks, emphasizing the scale of the view.\n\nOverall, there is a serene and organized feel to the town, with its orderly layout and the surrounding lush environment, which is typical of small rural towns. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the town's structure and setting.","title":"Aerial view of Main Street (Ohio Highway 303) in Peninsula Ohio, with the Methodist church in the right foreground, the railroad tracks and the Cuyahoga River. The village has a number of period buildings of interest to visitors. It is located within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, a 30,000 acre parcel of largely undeveloped land between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. A master plan is being completed for the area.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["557653","558111","550551","550583","550558","553971","558060","558063","556979","556463","550271","545625","552595","550550","545610","553692"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["town","road","highway","layout","outlet","neighboring","tarmac","bisect","begin","overview"]}
