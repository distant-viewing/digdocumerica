{"path":"552217.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial scene from an aerial perspective. The primary focus is an expansive industrial complex surrounded by a watery landscape. The facility features multiple large buildings, including several tall, white cylindrical structures and a prominent building with a large rectangular structure marked with the Great Northern logo. This main building has tall, slender smokestacks emitting white smoke into the air. \n\nTo the right side of the industrial complex, storage tanks and additional infrastructure can be seen. This side of the image shows red-tinted earth, possibly indicating raw materials or disturbed ground, contrasted against the clustered industrial buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, there are bodies of water with visible patterns on the surface caused by currents or tides. Several small boats and floating docks are visible on the water. A sense of remote location is given by the forested areas surrounding the waters and industry. The overall atmosphere is somewhat moody due to the dark blue hues and the smoke merging into the overcast sky. \n\nThis picture captures both human industrial activity and its juxtaposition with a natural aquatic environment.","title":"Crown zellerbach kraft pulp mill at port townsend on the olympic Peninsula, overlooking puget sound","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555165","555776","549507","555777","548070","550339","546103","551998","552179","549968","551183","551192","551576","551994","543000","552191"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["complex","tinte","smoke","disturb","tide","building","current","merge","cause","slender"]}
