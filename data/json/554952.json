{"path":"554952.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph shows an outdoor scene where a man in a dark suit and hat is seated in the back of a parked truck filled with a large number of furs. The man appears to be handling or inspecting the furs stacked around him. The truck is positioned next to a building over which a sign reads \"WEBLY FIRS.\" This indicates the scene likely takes place at or near a business dealing with furs.\n\nThe background features another building, trees, and what appears to be a residential street setting under a clear sky, suggesting the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. The composition of the image focuses on comparing the rural or small-town feel evoked by the surroundings with the commercial activity being highlighted.","title":"Fur buyer with a load of deer hides in Leakey, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554925","554924","554939","544349","554934","556733","557110","545980","543588","555817","547174","542803","543219","542856","554412","548275"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["fur","truck","suit","business","town","number","back","place","man","hat"]}
