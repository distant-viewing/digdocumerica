{"path":"545080.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a man engaged in a task by the seashore. He’s wearing a red plaid shirt, black rubber overalls, and a white hard hat. His attention is focused downward on his work. He appears to be using a long wooden stick or tool that he’s holding in one hand while his other hand holds a net, which is draped over his shoulder and extends into the water.\n\nThe man’s posture and concentration indicate he might be searching or fishing in shallow beach waters. The background shows an expansive view of the ocean with gentle waves, suggesting a calm day. The beach environment, along with the attire of the man, suggests he could be involved in some sort of marine or environmental work, possibly monitoring or gathering samples.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are natural and subdued, with the blues of the water, the subdued tones of the sandy beach, and the organic hues of the man's attire, creating a peaceful yet focused scene.","title":"A resident of the Quinault Indian Reservation digs for razor clams on Quinault Beach.
