{"path":"545343.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban alleyway. The setting appears gritty and somewhat rundown with various signs of wear and neglect. The alley is flanked by brick buildings with a mix of wooden and metal fences, and there are some hanging clothes drying on a line extending between the buildings. The ground is dirty with patches of wet areas and small puddles, possibly left by recent rain.\n\nIn the alley, there are three individuals engaged in different activities. The person farthest away from the camera is walking towards the camera, shirtless, with a relaxed gait, and carries what looks like a small object in his hand. Another person is closer to the foreground, also shirtless, and seems to be either throwing something or waving. The third person, in the foreground, is sitting on what appears to be a large dumpster or container, interacting with another person who is standing but whom only partially appears in the frame; this pair is involved in a conversational or social activity.\n\nThe atmosphere portrayed is one of casual, everyday life despite the somewhat derelict surroundings, suggesting a community familiar and adapted to their environment. The background also shows low-rise buildings that appear to be part of an extensive industrial or older residential area. The overall composition of the photo, with its vivid colors and dynamic human presence, gives a raw, candid glimpse into a moment in the lives of the individuals it captures.","title":"El Paso's second ward, the Chicano area along the Mexican border, which is slowly giving way to urban renewal.","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552969","545348","548372","545315","555909","545546","552970","552971","549917","545361","552967","555940","544072","544087","552750","548371"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["alley","person","dumpster","alleyway","puddle","camera","clothe","pair","rain","life"]}
