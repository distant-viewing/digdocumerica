{"path":"554094.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is a close-up photograph depicting a large number of squid laid out on a wooden surface. The squid are densely packed and arranged with their bodies facing the viewer, showing their long, conical shapes and tentacles. The squid vary slightly in size and color, exhibiting hues of grey, white, and some patches of pink. The wooden surface beneath the squid is old and worn, displaying a deep, rustic brown color that contrasts with the lighter colors of the squid. The focus is centralized on the squid, while the background is darker and out of focus, ensuring the emphasis remains primarily on the arrangement of the squid. The composition and the wooden background give the photograph a naturalistic and somewhat rustic feel.","title":"Fish auction is a daily event.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543897","545063","547848","544987","554093","542892","546792","547968","546784","554096","545186","552810","545075","543916","548534","543189"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["ensure","pink","emphasis","remain","lay","arrangement","surface","number","exhibit","arrange"]}
