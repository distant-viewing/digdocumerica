{"path":"546150.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural or semi-abandoned scene including an aged wooden building and two tall metal towers. The building, possibly an old house or barn, appears worn and neglected with notable damage to the roof, suggesting a state of decay. Vegetation is growing over and around parts of the building, indicating it has been in disuse for some time.\n\nIn the background, there are two prominent metal towers with triangular frameworks, which rise above the height of the trees in the scene. These towers have empty crossbeams and a lattice construction, typically seen in radio or observation towers.\n\nThe surrounding environment has overgrown grass and a few sparse trees, contributing to the feel of abandonment. The sky is clear and bright, casting harsh sunlight on the scene, which aids in emphasizing the state of disrepair and desolation of the building. The visible power lines and poles suggest the proximity of civilization or developed areas nearby, albeit their scant presence in the immediate vicinity of the building and towers.","title":"Abandoned oil derricks behind abandoned farm","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["555612","554707","555609","547969","543344","543171","545233","547985","552515","552091","556351","551330","552448","557977","557344","547658"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["towers","civilization","state","aids","radio","building","lattice","disuse","desolation","observation"]}
