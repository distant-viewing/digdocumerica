{"path":"549731.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures an exhilarating powerboat racing scene. The focus of the image is a speeding boat on the left side, predominantly colored in black and red with visible signage including numbers, moving swiftly on what appears to be a lake. The boat generates a significant wake and spray of water as it races past an orange buoy, positioned a little ahead and to the right of the boat.\n\nIn the background, a large crowd of spectators can be seen gathered along the tree-lined shore, indicating a popular event location. The spectators are densely packed, watching the race from behind safety fences and barriers, suggesting that this is a well-attended event in a natural, outdoor setting characterized by lush greenery. The trees are dense, suggesting a secluded or remote venue typical for such sporting events.\n\nThe atmosphere is active and vibrant, highlighted by the dynamic movement of the boat and the engaged spectators. The water's surface is largely calm except for the disturbance caused by the boat, indicating good weather conditions for racing. Overall, the composition conveys speed, excitement, and a festive sporting atmosphere.","title":"Gar Wood Trophy race on the Detroit River--a contest for hydro-planes. \"Redman\" shoots past the course marker.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549733","549085","550879","549732","550840","542697","547708","548058","546049","548520","543994","549426","549389","549425","543945","549082"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["spectator","boat","sporting","racing","race","speed","event","buoy","excitement","generate"]}
