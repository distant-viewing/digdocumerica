{"path":"549366.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a man using a microscope. The man, likely a scientist or researcher, is shown from the side, focusing intently on his work as he peers through the microscope. His hair is short and graying, and his skin shows light signs of aging, highlighted with a subtle sheen, possibly from lighting or the natural gloss of skin.\n\nThe microscope itself is a prominent and complex piece of equipment, with multiple lenses and focusing knobs that are made of metal and are highly detailed in the image. The man's face is very close to the microscope, indicating deep concentration on the subject matter he is examining. His forehead and the side of his nose are nearly touching parts of the microscope, suggesting a moment of intense scrutiny.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dark and blurry, ensuring that the focus remains solely on the man and the microscope. The overall composition emphasizes science, investigation, and the pursuit of knowledge through technology. The lighting is focused in such a way that it enhances the contours of his face and the mechanistic details of the microscope, creating a dramatic and engaging visual narrative about scientific endeavor.","title":"Dr. Dusan Zarodnik, chief of the Laboratory for Ecology and Systematics at the Rudjer Boskovic Institute","placename":"Zagreb (Croatia)","location":"Zagreb, Croatia","nn1":["549384","546282","546311","546328","542664","546327","546291","542666","555280","546344","551594","542737","549364","546284","545002","549608"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["microscope","skin","researcher","forehead","investigation","science","knob","pursuit","scientist","face"]}
