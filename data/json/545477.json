{"path":"545477.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This color photograph depicts an industrial scene likely from the mid to late 20th century. Central to the image is a large billboard for \"Fairfield Works\" of the United States Steel Corporation (USS), specifically referring to \"Ensley Operations.\" The billboard features the USS logo on either side of the text. It is mounted on a sturdy framework that elevates it above the surrounding structures, making it visible from a distance.\n\nBelow and around the billboard, the composition includes various industrial buildings and equipment, characteristic of a steel mill environment. Some buildings appear older and show signs of wear, with corrugated metal surfaces and large, open doorways. There is a complex network of conveyors and overhead gantries, suggesting the transport of materials used in steel production.\n\nA railroad track runs through the forefront of the scene with several freight cars visible, indicating the movement of goods or raw materials associated with the operations of the steel mill. The general landscape is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the industrial function of the area.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, allowing natural light that casts a diffuse illumination over the scene, highlighting details of the industrial setup and the metallic textures of the constructions. There is a slight overcast feel to the sky, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a detailed and expansive view of a significant industrial operation, dominated by its large signage, that speaks to the industrial and economic activities of its time, revealing insights into the infrastructure and scale of mid-20th century American industrial sites.","title":"The United States Steel Corporation, Jefferson County's largest employer, has two plants in operation, one in Fairfield and the other in Ensley.
