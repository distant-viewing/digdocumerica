{"path":"557931.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photo showcases a historical site, the Jonathan Hale Homestead, set amidst a natural and tranquil setting. In the foreground, a rustic wooden fence immediately draws attention, leading the viewer's gaze towards the background. Immediately right of the foreground, prominently placed, is a historical marker. The sign is an official looking plaque, labeled “Jonathan Hale Homestead,” indicating the site was purchased in 1810 and mentioning its maintenance by the Western Reserve Historical Society as a museum.\n\nBeyond the fence and sign, a neatly maintained lawn stretches across the area, populated by scattered trees that provide shaded areas and enhance the serene, park-like atmosphere. Central in the background stands an imposing, antique colonial-style building, likely the Jonathan Hale house mentioned on the sign. This two-story building with its traditional brick facade, symmetrical windows, and a central entrance exudes historical significance. An American flag flies on a pole to the left of the house, symbolizing national heritage and adding a patriotic touch to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its historical elements and natural beauty, evokes a sense of preservation and respect for the past within a peaceful rural setting. The image is captured during the daytime under clear weather conditions, which illuminates the scene and highlights the lush greenery and architectural details.","title":"Jonathan hale Homestead, a red brick house built in 1826 near Akron, Ohio, in Summit County.
