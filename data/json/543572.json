{"path":"543572.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a water treatment facility from a high vantage point. The focal point of the image is a large circular settling tank with a central, elevated walkway extending across its diameter. This slim metal bridge, which appears to be an access walkway, is supported by a cylindrical structure at the center of the tank. The top of this structure is ringed with what looks like safety railing and instrumentation, possibly for monitoring or adjusting the treatment process.\n\nThe water in the tank appears still and mirrors the overlying structures, causing the central support to look submerged beneath its reflection. Surrounding this central tank are several other water-containing structures, possibly additional treatment or settling tanks, each at various levels of capacity. The surrounding environment includes various industrial buildings, some with mid-century architectural styles. These buildings are equipped with external piping and infrastructure typical of an industrial or utility facility.\n\nThe overall setting suggests an emphasis on practicality and function, with concrete and metal surfaces predominantly visible. The environment is tidy and well-organized, reflecting the controlled and systematic nature of water treatment processes. The area appears devoid of any visible human activity in this particular moment. The background features clear skies and a glimpse of a green landscaped area, contrasting with the industrial foreground. The light source, likely the sun, casts sharp shadows, enhancing the structural details and creating a sense of depth in the image.","title":"Ponds at S.
