{"path":"553778.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an expansive aerial landscape view, presumably of a coastal area. The foreground and midground are dominated by lush greenery, featuring patches of trees and open fields, possibly agricultural land. This area is flanked by dramatic mountain ridges to the left, which add a rugged texture to the scene. \n\nToward the center and extending to the right, we can see a spread of urban development. The buildings vary in size and are densely packed in some areas, indicating a populated town or small city. The urban area transitions seamlessly into a coastal line, suggesting proximity to a large body of water, likely an ocean given the vastness visible in the view.\n\nThe background shows the ocean meeting the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The clouds are scattered, letting sunlight spill through and illuminate portions of the landscape and water, creating a dynamic contrast between light and shadow. This interplay of natural light enhances the depth and complexity of the terrain's colors.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a striking juxtaposition between natural landscapes, human habitation, and the vastness of the ocean, all under a dynamic sky that contributes to the sceneâ€™s dramatic and serene ambiance.","title":"Hawaii--valley near Kaneohe on windward side of Oahu, Oahu i","placename":"Kaneohe (Hawaii)","location":"Kaneohe, Hawaii","nn1":["557532","554052","543429","553983","554064","553945","543434","543328","554057","554091","543430","556937","553677","553978","553675","554020"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","vastness","let","spill","toward","flanke","habitation","ridge","transition","complexity"]}
