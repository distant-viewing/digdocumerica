{"path":"544687.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a captivating and somewhat desolate landscape. It appears to be a tidal flat or a coastal salt marsh. The foreground is dominated by a textured surface that looks like a mixture of dried salt deposits and muddy areas, suggesting that water evaporates from this area, leaving behind mineral residues. These patterns of salt and mud form intricate, almost floral designs that are quite eye-catching.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, there's a noticeable transition where the dense texture of the foreground gives way to smoother and darker mud surfaces, indicating areas where water still stands or has recently receded. Scattered throughout this area are several rocks or clumps of salt.\n\nIn the background, there are sparse wooden posts arranged in a rough line extending into the distance, standing partially submerged or sunk into the mud, suggesting they may be remains of an old fence line, dock structures, or markers of some sort. These posts add a hint of human presence, albeit abandoned or neglected.\n\nThe horizon is wide and flat, meeting a clear but subdued sky which suggests it might be near sunrise or sunset due to the soft lighting. The overall color palette is a mix of cool blues and purples in the wet areas, contrasting with the warmer browns and whites of the dried salt and mud, which helps to emphasize the harsh and natural beauty of this marine environment.","title":"Leslie salt ponds at sunset","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544729","544721","545294","542869","545183","543644","544733","545095","553867","552147","552236","545656","551553","547663","548703","546109"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["salt","mud","post","deposits","catching","captivating","residue","flat","clumps","reced"]}
