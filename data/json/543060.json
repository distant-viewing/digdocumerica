{"path":"543060.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and rugged coastal landscape, possibly near sunset given the soft lighting and warm color tones. It depicts a series of tall, jagged sea stacks and rocks emerging dramatically from a choppy sea. The coastline curves gently from the foreground into the misty background, creating a sense of depth and expansiveness.\n\nThe rolling waves in the foreground add a dynamic element to the scene, as they break gently on the shore. The water's surface glitters subtly under the influence of the pale sunlight, contrasting with the dark, shadowed outlines of the rocks.\n\nThe perspective is taken from a raised vantage point looking down the coastline, allowing for a panoramic view of this wild maritime landscape. The overall mood is tranquil yet imposing, dominated by natural elements and a sense of untouched wilderness. The colors are predominantly muted with shades of grey, blue, and purple, emphasizing the calm yet powerful nature of the ocean.","title":"Northern California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["543068","545173","545130","542917","543025","545122","543243","557508","543304","543295","543080","547638","542808","543250","543051","553775"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["glitter","sea","expansiveness","mute","rock","influence","emerge","impose","purple","coastline"]}
