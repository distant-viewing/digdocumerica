{"path":"546585.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents a high-angle aerial view of an iconic urban scene dominated by prominent landmarks and bustling infrastructure. At the forefront, the Jefferson Memorial stands out prominently with its circular, neoclassical structure featuring a white dome and surrounded by lush greenery and symmetrically arranged walkways. This monument is placed near the banks of a body of water, which reflects parts of the nearby scenery and flanks the memorial to one side.\n\nThe image captures a network of busy roads filled with dense traffic; multiple lanes of vehicles outline curving paths and intersecting highways that emphasize the urban complexity and connectivity. Beyond the roads, the landscape fans out to include more urban structures, government buildings with distinguishing architecture, and stretches of open green spaces that add a contrasting natural element to the manmade environment.\n\nFurthermore, the background extends to a broader cityscape, indicating a view likely from a high vantage point like a building or a monument. The overall composition is a blend of architectural beauty, natural landscaping, and the dynamic movement of city traffic, captured in broad daylight that highlights the scene’s details and the area’s expansive layout. This setting likely represents a well-known part of Washington D.C., illustrating both its cultural significance and bustling urban life.","title":"Tidal basin, jefferson memorial and 14th street bridge","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546577","546570","546674","547268","546679","546741","547228","547267","546692","546584","546693","546737","547226","546717","546613","546740"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["monument","roads","memorial","traffic","fan","government","landmarks","connectivity","dome","landscaping"]}
