{"path":"554555.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic overlook from a rocky vantage point. The foreground prominently features a rock surface with several graffiti marks. Notably, one of the graffiti reads \"BRUCE\" and another says \"Babe Pat,\" both painted in white against the darker rock. There's also some graffiti painted in blue but it is less legible.\n\nThe middle ground shows a dense forest with a variety of green tones, presumably different types of trees. Beyond the forest, the background reveals a vast lake speckled with several small islands. The lake is nestled within a landscape of rolling hills or low mountains, which further enhance the serenity of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is slightly muted, likely due to the overcast sky which diffuses the lighting, casting a soft haze over the landscape. This type of environment suggests it may be either early morning or during a cooler weather day, adding a tranquil and somewhat solemn mood to the image. The photograph encapsulates a blend of natural beauty with the human element of expression through graffiti.","title":"Painted names and dates on rocks atop lookout point on rocky mountain overlooking Fourth Lake in New York state, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543079","557536","554719","552900","542915","557118","554755","543816","553135","552894","550493","551118","549151","543643","555388","554695"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["graffiti","lake","type","say","speckle","serenity","rock","forest","paint","island"]}
