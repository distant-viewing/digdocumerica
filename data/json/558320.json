{"path":"558320.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman deeply engrossed in a game or activity. She is wearing glasses and a green cardigan over a blue and white patterned shirt. Her silver hair is neatly arranged, and she has a serious, focused expression on her face as she looks down.\n\nThe woman appears to be seated at a table, on which are laid out playing cards and what seem to be black beads or tokens gathered on a small white piece of paper. Her hands are not visible in the frame, suggesting they may be either on her lap or engaged subtly in her activity, possibly holding cards or sorting through the tokens.\n\nIn the background, part of another person is visible, hinting that the woman is not alone. This person is wearing a patterned white and blue top, only partially visible.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is soft, with a focus on the woman and her immediate surroundings, contributing to the concentration and the quiet intensity of the scene. The environment looks indoor, possibly a community center or a room set up for recreational activities among seniors.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to take care of themselves physically are cared for in two community centers.

New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558329","558227","558327","548581","548582","558319","558336","556594","558339","558323","548562","548561","551337","557153","548586","552627"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["card","woman","playing","cardigan","game","lap","person","intensity","sort","concentration"]}
