{"path":"550293.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This image captures a quaint, misty waterfront scene. On the left, there is a large wooden building, weathered and grey, with a red roof and numerous windows. This structure extends over the water, supported by tall wooden stilts, partially submerged due to high tide. Adjacent to it is a long wooden pier, also supported by numerous vertical stilts, extending into the gentle waters.\n\nOn the right side of the pier, a small, shack-like structure sits, serving most likely as an office or storage space for dock activities. It also features a small pitched roof and is painted in a dark color.\n\nTwo small boats are visible in the water: one moored further away in the background and another one closer to the shore, both appearing small and motorized. The water itself is calm, reflecting the overcast sky and the structures above it.\n\nThe foreground of the photo is composed of a pebble-lined shore where a wooden rowboat rests upside down alongside a small wooden gangway leading down from a higher gravel path, suggesting this as a point of access to the boats or buildings.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is serene and slightly somber, with the mist and overcast conditions casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, enhancing the rustic and maritime feel of the waterfront.","title":"Fishing harbor, cutler, me","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["545005","548235","544567","548105","547594","550307","544672","547847","546871","547965","542872","548229","547585","547565","550322","547575"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["stilt","wooden","pier","shore","rowboat","moor","support","tide","pebble","quaint"]}
