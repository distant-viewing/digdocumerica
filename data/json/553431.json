{"path":"553431.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene with four individuals interacting with the peaceful natural environment. In the foreground, three boys are engaged in activities by the edge of the water. Two of these boys are kneeling on the sandy lakeshore, appearing to be focused on something in the sand between them, perhaps building something or examining an object. The third boy is lying prone on the sand, resting on his elbows, looking at what the other two are doing.\n\nIn the midground, the lake unfolds with gentle ripples, indicated by the smooth but wavy texture of the water. Another boy is further out in the lake, partially submerged in water, signifying that he is swimming or wading.\n\nThe background features dense, lush trees that line the far side of the lake, forming a natural barrier and enclosing the scene in a tranquil, secluded atmosphere. The lighting in the image suggests a bright, sunny day, enhancing the vibrancy and summery feel of the setting. This photograph evokes a sense of leisure and the simple joys of a youthful summer day by the water.","title":"Swimming hole on the squannacook river near groton.
