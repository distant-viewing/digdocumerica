{"path":"544333.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene outside a brightly colored building with turquoise doors and windows. It appears to be a cinema or theater showcasing various movie posters behind glass panels. The posters include images from action films and other dramatic scenes, providing a colorful yet gritty urban backdrop.\n\nIn the foreground, three people are engaged in the setting. A man wearing a traditional cowboy hat and a blue checkered shirt is seen from behind, facing the posters inside the building. Next to him, a young boy with dark hair, wearing a plaid shirt, is looking intently through the glass door. There is also a young woman or a teenage girl standing slightly in front of them. She is wearing a scarf around her head, has dark hair, and looks directly at the camera with a subtle, enigmatic smile on her face. Her expression adds a layer of personal interaction that contrasts with the otherwise impersonal city environment.\n\nThe outdoor light is bright, casting strong shadows and highlighting vivid colors of the building's façade and the people's clothing. The overall composition emphasizes the interplay of daily life and the fantasy world of cinema, underscored by urban cultural elements such as the cowboy hat and the urban setting.","title":"Navajos in town for Saturday morning shopping","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["550685","545331","551648","545351","549019","549806","551666","556214","551144","547809","543470","555909","556276","552965","545448","551786"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["poster","cowboy","theater","door","glass","scarf","hat","hair","façade","world"]}
