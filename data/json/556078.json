{"path":"556078.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman standing in the aisle of a train car, slightly leaning out the doorway into another compartment. She is smiling and appears to be engaged in a conversation with someone not visible in the picture. Her attire includes a dark blue skirt and a red-orange cardigan over a white shirt with a ruffled placket. She holds several books or notebooks tightly against her as she interacts, suggesting she might be a student or perhaps traveling with some reading material.\n\nThe woman has long, straight dark hair and wears classic black flats. The interior of the train features brown floor carpeting and metal accents, indicative of an older model train. The background within the car is softly lit and blurred, emphasizing the figure in the foreground. There is a sense of casual, everyday life and travel captured in this moment.","title":"A passenger service representative on the Empire Builder (train #7), ready to leave Chicago with the Amtrak train which is bound for East Glacier Park, Montana, enroute to Seattle, Washington.
