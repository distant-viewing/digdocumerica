The foreground prominently features a beer mug on a wooden table, partially filled with a golden ale. The mug has a printed design indicating it is from a \"Bierstube,\" with \"New Ulm Turner Hall\" and the date \"1972\" visible. Alongside it, there's another beer stein with different designs and logos, including \"Stern's Restaurant.\"\n\nBehind the beer mugs, several men in traditional German attire, possibly members of a heritage or cultural group, are seated at tables. They are dressed in matching jackets that have decorations on the lapels, suggesting a formal or celebratory gathering. Their expressions are jovial, indicating a moment of enjoyment or a social event. The overall atmosphere is convivial and culturally rich, set in a warmly lit indoor environment which adds to the coziness and communal feel of the setting.","title":"Beer is part of the tradition as the concord singers practice singing german songs in New Ulm, Minnesota.
