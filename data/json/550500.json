{"path":"550500.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling mountain landscape, likely taken from an aerial viewpoint. Dominating the frame is a large, majestic mountain coated with a dusting of snow, showing detailed textures of its rocky surface and sparse vegetation. Its slopes are steep and rugged, interspersed with patches of snow that emphasize the mountain's contours and elevations.\n\nSeveral adjacent peaks in the background also share a snow-capped appearance, contributing to a chilly, alpine atmosphere. In the valleys between the mountains, a few small, irregularly-shaped patches of snow or ice are visible, contrasting with the darker tones of the rock. \n\nThe central feature of the image, apart from the mountains, is a distinct river or stream that snakes through the valley. This waterway, likely fed by meltwater, gleams brilliantly against the somber tones of the surrounding terrain, creating a winding line of light that draws the eye through the composition.\n\nThe overall impression is one of raw, natural beauty and the vastness of the mountainous landscape, conveying both the ruggedness and the cold, isolated environment of high-altitude regions. There are no signs of human presence or activity, highlighting the pristine and untouched nature of this wilderness area.","title":"Dietrich Pass. This is the highest elevation along the route (4790 feet). In this view south from a point north of the pass, the pipeline will come north through the V-shaped notch and descend to the Atigun River beneath the peak in the left center of the frame.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550413","550415","550501","550503","550416","550423","550401","542519","550514","550515","555690","550609","550441","555681","555678","550634"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","valley","dusting","snake","ruggedness","ice","elevation","viewpoint","altitude"]}
