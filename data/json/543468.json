{"path":"543468.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The image captures a young girl standing on the edge of a clear body of water, possibly a lake, as she appears to be playing or fishing. She is holding what looks like a makeshift fishing pole, possibly a thin branch or stick, with one end dipped into the water. The girl is dressed in a loose-fitting, pink dress that has darker pink decorations and comes just above her knees. She also wears black leggings and seems to be barefoot.\n\nShe is focused on the water, looking where her stick meets the surface. Her hair is styled in two pigtail braids, enhancing her youthful and playful appearance. The setting is naturalistic, with large rocks adjacent to her, one prominently in the left foreground of the photo. The background offers a glimpse of the opposite shore of the lake, shadowed and dense with green foliage, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear, sparkling water.\n\nLight shines brightly on her and reflects off the water, giving the whole scene a lively and warm atmosphere, emphasizing a sense of innocence and simplicity in the child's activities. The composition of the photograph, with the rock formations and the positioning of the girl beside the water, suggests a peaceful, solitary moment in nature.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544200","543466","547727","543875","549103","544380","552940","545539","544189","542740","543457","549105","551400","544143","550241","551022"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["girl","braid","fishing","water","innocence","lake","stick","positioning","rock","knee"]}
