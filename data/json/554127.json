{"path":"554127.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a long, straight stretch of a two-lane road receding into the distance, dividing the landscape down the middle. It is framed by numerous utility poles lining both sides of the road, creating a repetition of vertical lines that run parallel to the road. On the road itself, a single car is visible, travelling towards the viewer.\n\nThe road has a yellow dashed center line and solid white lines on the edges, typical of rural highways. On either side of the road, the landscape appears moderately vegetated, with grass, shrubs, and patches of bare earth. The overall terrain appears slightly undulating but not steep, suggesting a relatively flat rural area.\n\nIn the background, rising beyond the road, there is a series of low hills or mountains, which add a sense of depth and scale to the scene. These hills are cast in muted tones, likely due to the distance or atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe overall impression is one of remoteness and tranquility, with the road acting as a pathway cutting through a somewhat sparse landscape, under a broad sky. This scene might evoke feelings of solitude or the allure of a road trip in less-traveled areas. The time of day appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, diffuse lighting and long shadows, which contribute to the overall serene and quiet mood of the photograph.","title":"Highway 11 in the agricultural area","placename":"Pahala (Hawaii)","location":"Pahala, Hawaii","nn1":["547354","549002","554130","545886","544598","552521","554131","544043","557010","547316","547300","545367","549235","544645","549013","554031"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["road","repetition","allure","line","remoteness","trip","stretch","hill","lane","distance"]}
