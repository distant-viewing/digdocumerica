{"path":"554866.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid, nostalgic scene inside a small, cluttered store or diner, likely from the 1970s or 1980s. The setting is resonant with a rustic Americana vibe, emphasized by the appearance and attire of the individuals present, as well as the decor and items for sale.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, an elderly man wearing a light straw hat, glasses, and a green shirt gazes outward towards the left frame of the photo, leaning on a counter. He is turned away from a group of people who are the central subjects of the image. Next to him, partially out of the frame, is a woman with her back turned, facing towards the group.\n\nThe main group consists of six individuals seated around a small, circular table cluttered with cups and dishes, suggesting they are either eating or drinking. Most of them are wearing hats typically associated with Western attire. A man in a striped shirt and another in a blue shirt engage actively in conversation. The latter seems to be telling a story or explaining something, and those listening appear engaged and entertained.\n\nThe two men wearing cowboy hats on the right edge of the photo wear similar denim garments and look attentively towards the man speaking. Another man in a white shirt and a cowboy hat actively listens, his arms crossed and a smile visible, indicating a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe background is stacked with a variety of items, from stacks of napkins to wall-mounted snacks and advertisements for various food items such as hamburgers, pizza, and sandwiches. The overhead signs further detail the menu offerings, adding to the diner-like ambiance.\n\nThe walls are also adorned with miscellaneous decorations and utility items, making the space feel lived-in and personalized. Dim lighting adds warmth to the scene, evoking a sense of communal gathering typical of a bygone era in small-town America. The overall mood is casual and convivial, with a strong sense of community and simplicity.","title":"Drugstore at Leakey, Texas, during the noon hour, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547796","547184","547789","556214","547779","547794","545984","547805","554895","554861","554897","556612","557152","543471","545452","545457"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["diner","item","hat","group","shirt","turn","stack","man","menu","sandwich"]}
