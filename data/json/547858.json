{"path":"547858.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a construction site, specifically focused on a partially constructed building made primarily out of wooden beams and planks. The structure seems to be in the early stages of development, with tall vertical beams set up to form the framework and some horizontal beams used for support.\n\nIn the center of the picture, a worker, wearing a casual outfit, is present within the structure, seemingly engaged in work. He is holding what appears to be a tool, possibly a hammer, indicating he might be involved in framing or assembling parts of the wooden structure. The workerâ€™s presence suggests manual labor and the construction or carpentry nature of the task at hand.\n\nThe backdrop shows a clear sky with no visible buildings or trees, suggesting the construction site may be in an open or possibly a suburban area. The foreground of the image is dominated by vertical wooden planks, some of which are angled, creating a dynamic and somewhat abstract pattern. The organization of the wooden beams and the angles at which they are photographed give the image a sense of depth and structural complexity.","title":"Construction at grant city, Staten Island-part of the building boom following completion of the verrazano-narrows bridge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557730","557731","543594","553702","555373","546414","543583","548551","557728","543593","556940","553703","556642","553921","546988","547977"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["beam","plank","construction","worker","angle","assemble","site","organization","complexity","stage"]}
