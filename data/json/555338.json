{"path":"555338.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a large bunch of green bananas still on the plant. The bananas are depicted in varying stages of growth, densely packed together, each connected at the stem. They are green, suggesting they are unripe and freshly grown. The bananas appear against a slightly blurred background that evokes a lush, tropical setting, possibly within a banana plantation or a similar cultivated area. The lighting in the photograph is subdued, casting shadows and creating a moody atmosphere. This dim lighting accentuates the rich greens of the bananas and the dark areas in the background, possibly suggesting early morning or late evening. Furthermore, there are visible leafy structures which may be parts of the banana plant or other vegetation surrounding the bananas, enhancing the natural, dense environment.","title":"Bananas being grown in a section of the university of Arizona's environmental research laboratory near Tucson.
