{"path":"545387.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This is a photograph of a pond or river mostly covered by green algae or duckweed, creating a dense green surface. In the middle of this green coverage, there is a circular area with contrasting purplish-pink waterlilies blooming, breaking the monotony of the green. Around the water body, there are lush green bushes and trees, tightly packed and extending all the way to the water's edge. Additionally, clusters of white and yellow flowers can be seen in bloom, adding pops of color along the foliage bordering the pond.\n\nThe image captures an aerial view, giving a wide perspective on the water body and its surroundings which suggests a quiet, secluded natural habitat hidden among thick greenery. The shot is framed to focus on the circular area of waterlilies, which not only provides a visual center of interest but also contrasts markedly in color and texture to the surrounding green aquatic plants. This composition of the photograph emphasizes the natural beauty and serenity of the location.","title":"Polluted stream located near U.S. Steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550809","543598","542554","544592","550808","547639","558095","554591","544588","545115","555080","558009","547509","543561","542582","550786"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["bloom","pond","monotony","pop","hide","algae","coverage","serenity","habitat","shot"]}
