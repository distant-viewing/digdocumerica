{"path":"543519.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an image of a shallow water body, likely a creek or a small pond. The primary focus of the image is a series of rounded impressions in the sand beneath the water, which appear to be footprints, leading towards the camera. The water is relatively clear and shallow, allowing a detailed view of the sandy bottom where these impressions are visible. The surface of the water has subtle ripples, indicating slight movement, either from the environment or from the source of the footprints.\n\nThe lighting suggests that the photo was taken on a bright day, though direct sunlight does not seem to penetrate the entire surface of the water, resulting in a mix of reflections and clear patches. There are no visible plants, animals, or human activity in the immediate vicinity within the frame, drawing the viewer's focus entirely to the mysterious trail leading through the water. The surrounding environment outside the immediate field of view is not discernible, which adds to the isolated and intriguing nature of the scene.","title":"Discarded tires","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["550341","544765","557251","542733","547905","546202","542582","553434","554623","543652","555626","547600","553348","546896","544725","549538"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["footprint","water","creek","penetrate","lead","result","sandy","intrigue","trail","pond"]}
