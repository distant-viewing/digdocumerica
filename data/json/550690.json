{"path":"550690.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows an environmental scene likely illustrating pollution in a natural water body. The central and largest portion of the image captures a thick, swirling substance on the surface of the water, with a mix of gray, white, and dark swirling patterns reminiscent of industrial or chemical pollutants. This contrast sharply against natural elements, providing a visceral representation of environmental disturbance.\n\nOn the right side of the image, part of a healthy, bushy green plant with narrow leaves is visible, flourishing beside or partially in the polluted area. This juxtaposition highlights the interaction between nature and pollution, underscoring the intrusion and impact of human activity on natural spaces.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the stark contrast between the unnatural, viscous swirls of the polluted water and the burst of natural greenery, emphasizing themes of environmental degradation and the resilience or vulnerability of nature.","title":"Polluted androscoggin river above the brown paper company's mill at cascade","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550734","546116","547617","544175","547537","550369","550812","547524","552811","548090","551561","550723","544804","545168","552127","547614"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["swirl","flourish","polluted","pollution","vulnerability","burst","intrusion","pollutant","representation","substance"]}
