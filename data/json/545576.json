{"path":"545576.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a woman outdoors engaging in photography against a striking natural backdrop. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is shown from behind and partially from the side. She has blond hair styled short and wears a striped shirt with hues of red and purple, along with dark pants. She is holding a camera to her eye, looking through the viewfinder, her pose focused and attentive to her subject.\n\nHer subject is an impressive natural arch, which dominates the central and right parts of the image. This geological formation, made of red rock, forms a large, rounded archway that frames the bright blue sky above. The arch stands majestically amidst other rock formations that share the same rich, reddish tones.\n\nThe terrain around the arch and the photographer is rugged and rocky, dotted with occasional desert vegetation. The sunlight casts well-defined shadows, indicating a bright, clear day, and the quality of light enhances the deep reds of the rock and the vivid blue of the sky, creating a visually stunning contrast. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph places the human element in harmony with the vast and awe-inspiring natural landscape, highlighting an interaction with nature focused on observation and preservation through photography.","title":"North Window Arch","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545563","545555","545572","544939","544935","545566","545568","544946","553077","545571","544341","545585","545584","545578","545300","545785"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["arch","photography","red","subject","formation","archway","preservation","photographer","harmony","awe"]}
