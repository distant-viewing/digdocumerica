{"path":"554583.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of water lily pads floating on a dark water surface. The image is set at night or in dim lighting, highlighting the glossy texture and purple hue of the lily pads, which are arranged diagonally across the composition. Each lily pad is adorned with droplets of water that glisten, adding a sparkling effect against the dark water.\n\nIn addition to the lily pads, there are two blooming lilies with bright yellow flowers that provide a vibrant contrast to the muted purple and black tones of the scene. The petals of the flowers appear soft and slightly open.\n\nThe background is almost exclusively dark, emphasizing the subjects (lily pads and flowers) and creating a tranquil, somewhat mysterious ambiance. The arrangement and lighting manage to draw attention to the delicate beauty of the lily pads and the gentle reflection of light on water droplets, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal of the image.","title":"Spatterdock or cow lily (Nymphaea advena), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544474","554584","555080","544588","550809","543598","544592","550808","547639","558095","545387","555044","557587","550775","544525","543561"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pad","droplet","flower","water","addition","petal","appeal","glisten","night"]}
