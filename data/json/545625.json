{"path":"545625.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a small town adjacent to a rugged, arid landscape. The image shows a clear demarcation between the urban settlement and the surrounding natural environment. The town is organized in a grid-like pattern, with streets lined with houses and several patches of greenery, possibly parks or gardens, which indicate residential areas. There are also larger plots of cultivated land, featuring different shades of green, indicating various types of crops or vegetation.\n\nOn the outskirts and towards the upper section of the image, the terrain transitions to a more barren, rocky environment, characterized by its lack of vegetation and a rough, textured surface. This natural area has gullies and ridges, suggesting erosion or other geological processes at work. The background shows a mountain range with peaks that appear slightly faded, possibly due to atmospheric distance or haze.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during the daylight with sufficient natural light highlighting the topography and urban layout vividly. The presence of shadows and the angle of light help to enhance the three-dimensional form of the landscape, providing depth to the mountainous region in the distance.","title":"Upheaval Dome and surrounding territory in the Canyonlands, including the Green River Gorge.
