{"path":"549178.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive agricultural landscape under moody skies. The foreground features several large irrigation systems spraying water over a vast green field, possibly indicating intensive farming practices. The water creates a mist that adds a serene quality to the scene. In the background, imposing mountains can be seen, their peaks barely distinguishable under a heavy layer of clouds suggesting either early morning or impending weather. The contrast between the engineered irrigation equipment and the natural roughness of the mountainous backdrop creates an intriguing juxtaposition. The overall color palette is composed of deep greens, muted blues, and grays, conveying a somewhat cool and damp atmosphere. The scene is devoid of any visible human presence, emphasizing a focus on the interaction between technology and nature.","title":"Farm irrigation","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["548875","548877","548869","553652","554014","548991","549094","553432","553972","548950","557517","554030","547778","542589","543650","554027"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","engineere","spraie","farming","practice","technology","mist","peak","system","compose"]}
