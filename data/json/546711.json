{"path":"546711.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a heavily congested highway, vividly illustrating a traffic jam spanning multiple lanes. The highway is enveloped by lush green forests on both sides, highlighting a stark contrast between nature and man-made structures. The road curves gently through the landscape, with vehicles tightly packed, especially in the lanes leading into the distance where the traffic density increases significantly.\n\nIn the foreground, the highway diverges into multiple ramps: one veering to the right and merging with another road, and another looping underneath the main highway, suggesting a complex interchange system facilitating various travel directions. Visible are numerous cars and a few larger vehicles like trucks and buses, hinting at a mix of personal and commercial transport.\n\nThe image also shows some areas of lighter road usage, notably on an adjacent highway that runs parallel for a short stretch before diverging, where traffic flows more freely. The overall setting is devoid of any urban development, focusing solely on the interaction between the transportation corridor and the natural environment surrounding it.","title":"Looking south from Beltway Bridge over the Potomac.
