{"path":"553361.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a young, tender plant prominently centered in the frame. The plant has several vibrant green leaves with a prominent vein structure, radiating out from the center where a delicate white flower blooms. The flower is small and star-shaped, with its petals fully open.\n\nThe plant is surrounded by a bed of dry, reddish-brown pine needles which provide a textural contrast to the smooth, freshness of the leaves. The background is blurred but suggests a rough, textured surface, possibly a rock or a wall, in varying shades of dark gray and blueish tones, enhancing the isolation and central focus on the greenery and flower in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its shallow depth of field, draws the viewer's attention directly to the life and delicacy of the plant within a seemingly harsh environment. The natural light seems soft, possibly filtered through overcast skies or a shaded area, which helps in highlighting the details and colors of the plant without creating harsh shadows.","title":"Star flower is one of the many kinds of wild flowers growing on the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of pepperell","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["544875","553368","554587","555053","553366","545695","554576","543623","549230","554586","553074","554595","543622","554745","547642","554575"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","flower","freshness","vein","radiate","star","needle","petal","leave","pine"]}
