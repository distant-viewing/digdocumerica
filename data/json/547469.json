{"path":"547469.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive industrial or commercial lot filled densely with a large collection of cars, primarily from the 1970s era based on their designs and colors. The cars display a range of colors like yellow, blue, red, and white, and most prominently feature the styles typical of the period, such as square bodies and chrome bumpers.\n\nIn the background, there is a massive pile of industrial scrap, mostly metallic, looming large behind the rows of cars. This pile towers above the parked vehicles and includes a mix of different types of metal refuse. Visible in the very distant background are a few industrial cranes and power transmission towers, suggesting this location might be near an industrial or port area.\n\nThe scene suggests an industrial parking lot or a storage facility temporarily housing these vehicles, which might either be for sale, storage, or possibly even waiting to be scrapped, given the proximity to the scrap heap. The setting is overcast with a mildly clouded sky, which casts natural light across the scene, enhancing the vivid colors of the vehicles. The overall composition gives a sense of scale and industry, emphasizing the massive amount of mechanical and industrial activity possibly related to vehicle handling or processing.","title":"Fields point on the water-front.
