{"path":"542872.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image depicts a serene harbor scene, likely captured during the early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft lighting and gentle ambiance. The photograph prominently features a collection of boats moored at a wooden dock on the left side of the frame. Among these boats, a larger vessel with multiple tall masts stands out, suggesting it might be used for fishing or perhaps as a sailboat.\n\nIn the foreground, there is calm water reflecting the boats and the sky above. Towards the center and right of the image, a small rowboat with two occupants is visible. They appear to be leisurely rowing or perhaps just enjoying a quiet moment on the water.\n\nThe background of the image is dominated by a hilly landscape, partially shrouded in mist or low-lying clouds, which adds a touch of mystique to the setting. On the hill, sparse vegetation can be seen. In addition, there are residential homes scattered across the landscape, and a dense grouping of trees on the right side of the hill suggests the presence of a forested area. The peaceful residential setting and natural scenery suggest this harbor could be located in a small coastal town, offering a picturesque and tranquil environment.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of human activity and natural beauty, creating a harmonious and peaceful maritime setting.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542907","548235","542905","542877","548247","546998","543246","542876","542903","548249","542904","552296","547565","545026","543358","543035"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["harbor","mystique","grouping","rowboat","occupant","addition","boat","mast","hill","low"]}
