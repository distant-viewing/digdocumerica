{"path":"550133.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a young woman standing in front of a weathered brick building with a faded advertisement painted on its side. She sports a striking afro hairstyle and is dressed in a patriotic T-shirt that has the American flag design (stars on blue background on the right shoulder and red and white stripes on the rest). She is wearing black shorts and is holding a tennis racket in her right hand with the head of the racket resting on the ground. Her posture is relaxed and she appears to be posing for the photo.\n\nThe background prominently displays the faded advertisement on the brick wall, which reads \"ELECT NESS\" in large, somewhat chipped letters. Below it, more faded text which seems to include \"COMRADE DIRECTOR\" and “MAYOR” along with \"OF CLEVELAND\", indicating the mural might be a historical campaign advertisement for a mayoral candidate in Cleveland.\n\nThe atmosphere is sunny and bright, casting clear shadows and suggesting the photo was taken on a clear day. The setting looks to be an urban area due to the architecture and paved sidewalk visible beside the woman. There are also some green shrubs visible next to her, adding a small touch of nature to the urban environment.","title":"1938 campaign sign on building at 36th Street and Cedar Avenue","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["556765","556737","552720","556143","557270","557114","546987","556289","550106","555896","553157","553480","556254","551132","553191","554270"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["advertisement","fade","mural","campaign","brick","rest","chip","hairstyle","star","strike"]}
