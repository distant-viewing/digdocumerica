{"path":"544041.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an industrial setting, likely a steel mill or foundry. It prominently features an immense, glowing crucible filled with molten metal that illuminates much of the scene in a rich orange hue. The crucible appears to be suspended from an overhead crane, suggesting it is in the process of being transported or poured. \n\nDominating the foreground is a large basin filled with either water or another quenching liquid, reflecting the intense glow of the crucible. On the right side of the image, a worker is visible; dressed in protective gear, he appears to be monitoring the process or preparing to execute the next steps. He stands beside control equipment or perhaps another workstation, holding what looks like a long tool or rod.\n\nThe background is filled with the dark outlines of industrial machinery, structural elements of the building, and various equipment related to the metal processing operation. Overhead, there seems to be a walkway or platform, possibly for overseeing the operations from a higher vantage point.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the harsh, fiery environment of metalworking, emphasizing the scale and intensity of industrial metal production. It showcases a moment of activity dealing with incredibly high temperatures, all set within a dimly lit, robust industrial framework.","title":"Refining impure copper through electrolysis at inspiration consolidated copper company","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544000","549695","549694","543996","557400","545536","557395","545532","557402","557401","557399","557397","544049","544004","549693","547060"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["workstation","glow","metal","deal","process","fill","pour","temperature","basin","oversee"]}
