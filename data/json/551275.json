{"path":"551275.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a woman grilling outdoors. She is seen standing at a black barbecue grill, actively engaged in cooking. The woman is dressed casually in a red T-shirt, a blue knee-length skirt, and red sneakers. Her hairstyle is short and appears styled for practicality, perhaps curled or waved. Her posture is leaning slightly toward the grill, suggesting focus on her task.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor patio with a rustic charm, characterized by a stone wall forming the backdrop and a wooden deck underfoot. The wall is built from irregularly shaped stones in a variety of colors from dark browns to grays. To the left, there is a hint of a floral arrangement hanging above, possibly a window or wall decoration. A lamp is also visible in the upper left portion of the frame, further enhancing the outdoor decor.\n\nThe overall ambiance is homely and relaxed, indicative of a warm, family-oriented event or a leisurely day spent outdoors. A can, possibly holding cooking utensils or ingredients, sits on the right side of the grill, and a white handle, perhaps of a tool essential for grilling, is partially visible beside the woman. The natural light and shadows suggest this event is taking place during the daytime, likely in a shaded area.","title":"Hostess, wife of a retired advertising executive, prepares hamburgers at a party at their lakeshore house in the \"land of the fifth season\" development, an affluent enclave on lake ozark","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["546127","544983","557934","557801","554862","557793","544974","550081","554443","545017","544986","549451","544979","550085","543987","558298"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["grill","cooking","wall","woman","practicality","stone","patio","utensil","event","sneaker"]}
