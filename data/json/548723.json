{"path":"548723.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This underwater photograph captures a serene aquatic landscape focused on a rock or coral formation submerged in the ocean. The formation is heavily textured and adorned with various types of marine life, predominantly corals. A mixture of softer, sponge-like organisms and more rigid, leaf-like corals envelop parts of the rocky surface, suggesting a vibrant and healthy ecological environment underwater.\n\nThe rock formation sits prominently in the center of the frame; it is covered with marigold yellow, beige, and brown hues of spongy corals which appear fuzzy or mossy, providing a stark contrast against the darker, deeper blue-green background of the ocean. Surrounding the main structure are taller, darker corals that have a rigid, vertical orientation, resembling the branches of terrestrial plants or trees.\n\nIn the backdrop, the water fades into a calm, gradient blue, indicating depth and the further continuation of the reef. The lighting, subdued and filtered through water, highlights parts of the coral and rock formation, adding a textured and three-dimensional effect to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere captured in the photo is one of tranquility and untouched natural beauty, representative of a thriving underwater ecosystem.","title":"Close-up of coral taken about 12 feet underwater at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a few miles off the coast of Key Largo","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548682","548678","548677","548719","548722","548712","548679","548710","548721","548676","548711","548681","548713","548717","543292","548683"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","formation","rock","underwater","representative","ocean","organism","reef","mossy","orientation"]}
