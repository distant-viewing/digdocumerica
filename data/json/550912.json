{"path":"550912.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large, flat barge moving through water. The water around the barge sparkles under the light, likely sunlight, suggesting the picture was taken during the day with good natural lighting. The top surface of the barge is textured with metallic panels, each one labelled with \"ROLL TOP - DO NOT TOPLOAD\" instructions, indicating areas that should not be covered with additional cargo.\n\nOn the rear of the barge, a small canopy structure is visible, possibly a control area or shelter for crew members. The most striking element in this image is a silhouette of a person, seemingly jumping or perhaps falling with outstretched arms and legs, painted or marked onto the barge's surface. This figure adds a sense of motion and human presence to the otherwise mechanical scene.\n\nThe textures and the metallic grey colors of the barge contrast vividly with the dark, shimmering blue of the surrounding water. This dense body of water surrounds the barge entirely, emphasizing its isolation in the vast aquatic environment. The photograph captures a combination of industrial activity and the playful human element contrasting within a natural setting.","title":"Towboat pushes enormous barge up the Houston ship channel man on roof of barge signals directions","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550952","548200","548186","544237","544271","550951","546830","555807","548201","551565","544643","552208","552020","551599","546938","553826"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","jump","instruction","sparkle","crew","rear","shelter","member","water","cargo"]}
