{"path":"547280.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a young man walking down a city sidewalk, seemingly engrossed in thought. He is dressed smartly in a vivid pink polo shirt and beige trousers, complemented by dark shoes. He wears glasses and sports a short haircut. The man is carrying a sizeable suitcase in one hand and a backpack slung over his other shoulder, suggesting he might be traveling or moving.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment, indicated by the smooth pavement and the large rectangular and square marble panels lining the building façade beside him. The street appears quiet, with only one other person visible in the background, partly obscured and walking in the opposite direction. The lighting in the scene casts soft shadows on the ground and highlights the man in a gentle backlight, emphasizing his solitude and perhaps the weight of his journey.","title":"On a street in downtown Omaha","placename":"Omaha (Neb.)","location":"Omaha, Nebraska","nn1":["546423","546419","553537","543037","547816","551940","547820","551486","553270","543890","549277","550130","553794","545396","545368","549325"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["marble","haircut","backlight","suitcase","polo","weight","backpack","journey","pavement","façade"]}
