{"path":"551034.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting with environmental implications. The primary focus is a series of large plumes of smoke or steam billowing from tall stacks at an industrial plant, dominating the skyline against a slightly overcast sky. The smoke, dense and gray, contrasts starkly with the lighter clouds in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, the image shows a quiet road lined with utility poles and wires, which leads towards the industrial facility. Vehicles are visible on the road; they appear to be typical of mid-20th-century models, suggesting an earlier era, potentially the 1970s or 1980s. On the right side of the road, there's a green street sign for \"River Ridge Rd\" and \"W.A. Chico,\" adding a locational detail to the scene.\n\nThe industrial complex itself features multiple large structures, including towers and interconnected pipes or scaffolding, characterizing it as possibly a chemical plant or a refinery. The atmosphere created by the image reflects a blend of daily life going seemingly unaffected under the looming presence of heavy industry.","title":"The Du Pont chemical plant at Belle pollutes the early morning air.","placename":"Charleston (W.
