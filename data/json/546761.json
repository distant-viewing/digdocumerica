{"path":"546761.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a landfill or a waste disposal site showing a chaotic scene filled with garbage, debris, and discarded items. The forefront is littered heavily with what appears to be a mix of torn fabrics and papers, scattered indiscriminately. A prominent white plastic jug lies atop the mound of debris, along with other undefined waste materials.\n\nIn the middle of the image, a mechanical dumping truck is captured with its trailer tipped back, attempting to offload additional trash onto the already piled heaps. A worker, wearing a white shirt and gloves, is standing on the back of the truck, engaged in the dumping process. This individual is partly visible, focusing on managing the debris.\n\nThe landscape is wide and open with a clear blue sky above, hinting that the location is in a relatively remote or underdeveloped area. Around the site, no vegetation is visible, emphasizing the barren and neglected nature of the environment used for dumping waste. This setting underscores the environmental impact and negligence associated with waste disposal practices.","title":"Landfill operation at bottom of Salt River is shared by Swift Plant and City of Tolleson.
