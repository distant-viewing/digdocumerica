{"path":"543739.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph presents a striking aerial view of a serpentine river flowing through a mountainous landscape. The river appears significantly broad in some areas, possibly swollen due to melting snow or rainfall, surrounded by sandy, sediment-rich banks. The bright white patches floating on the river are likely ice or foam, indicating colder temperatures or turbulent flow in the river.\n\nA highway closely parallels the river, snaking its way through the valley and into the dense forests covering the steep slopes of the mountains. The road is remarkably close to the river, curving around it and disappearing into the landscape, enclosed by the rugged terrain that dominates the scene.\n\nForests, predominantly coniferous, densely carpet the surrounding slopes, hinting at a remote or less populated region. The trees are dark green, suggesting health and vitality, possibly pointing towards a well-preserved ecological environment.\n\nOn closer inspection, there are some small structures or vehicles visible near the bottom left of the image, near where the highway intertwines with other smaller roads or tracks. This could indicate some form of human activity or settlement, though sparse.\n\nThe topography and the untouched nature of the landscape suggest this area might be part of a national park or protected area, valued for its natural beauty and ecological significance. The overall composition of the photograph, with its dramatic juxtaposition of human-made infrastructure and wild nature, beautifully captures the interaction between human activities and natural environments.","title":"Settling pond where wastes are allowed to \"settle out\" from milling process at Idarado Mill","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["550524","550526","550487","550593","550633","542701","550508","550561","550523","550627","550542","550530","542696","542700","550577","549456"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","highway","slope","vitality","carpet","temperature","health","inspection","ice","rainfall"]}
