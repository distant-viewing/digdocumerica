{"path":"557556.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a tall eucalyptus tree as the main subject, situated in a densely wooded area. The bark of the tree is patchy, displaying a typical eucalyptus texture with peeling layers, which reveal underlying shades of white and gray. The tree has multiple trunks or large branches that split off near the base, extending upward into the canopy which is lush and green with leaves appearing dark against the sky.\n\nOn the trunk of the tree, there is a handmade sign attached that reads \"GARAGE SALE\" in bold, black spray-painted letters. The sign is made from a piece of white board and is nailed to the tree. The message is duplicated on the sign for emphasis.\n\nThe setting around the tree appears to be natural and untamed, with other shrubs and trees visible in the background, suggesting that the location is somewhat remote or in a rural setting. The lighting in the photograph indicates that it may be either early morning or late afternoon, as the light appears soft and diffused, adding a calm and serene mood to the scene.","title":"Garage sale sign attached to a tree off Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains denotes recent development near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543488","542715","544332","542723","543198","557622","551962","554973","542749","558103","542791","550792","551328","553457","544942","548709"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["tree","trunk","sign","spray","sale","bark","message","emphasis","letter","base"]}
