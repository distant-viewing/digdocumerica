{"path":"548306.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed and casual moment featuring two people and their station wagon in a rural setting. A woman is seated at the open back of the white station wagon, her legs crossed, wearing a sleeveless top and bright yellow pants. Her blonde hair is cut short, and she looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression. Nearby, a man leans against the side of the station wagon, dressed in a red plaid shirt and khaki pants, with his right hand resting against his cheek, smiling amiably at the camera.\n\nThe station wagon's tailgate is open, revealing a variety of items inside that suggest a trip or outdoor excursion, such as a red cooler and what looks like camping or cooking equipment. Next to the woman, on the ground, are a pair of brown boots and a small brown leather bag, further indicating travel or outdoor activity.\n\nThe scene is framed by lush green foliage in the background, adding a sense of being in a woodsy or rural area. The overall vibe of the image is one of leisure, suggesting these two individuals are enjoying a break during a road trip or outdoor adventure. The brightness of the day and the relaxed postures of the individuals contribute to the laid-back, summery atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Owl bayou on highway 51 between laplace and manchac husband and wife wait while sons fish in the nearby bayou","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546093","548303","550649","557766","557684","548958","556595","548668","547141","552119","545342","544389","547758","543856","543947","549058"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["wagon","station","trip","cheek","excursion","cooking","cooler","khaki","leather","pants"]}
