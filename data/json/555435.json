{"path":"555435.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene with notable focus on a specific object in the foreground and a backroad setting.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently placed on the slightly gravel-speckled asphalt road, there's a fallen blue sign that reads \"10 GAL. LIMIT SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE\" in white, block lettering. The sign appears slightly worn and dirty, contrasting with its vivid blue color. The surrounding road surface is detailed with bits of gravel and scattered fallen leaves, suggesting a season like autumn.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features an asphalt road stretching directly into the distance, with a slight upward slope. On this road, a dark car, possibly a sedan from the late 80s or early 90s judging by its shape, is moving away from the viewer's perspective.\n\nIn the background, on either side of the road, there are lush green trees and bushes. The area has a tranquil, rural look, with houses just visible among the trees, suggesting a residential area in a less urbanized setting. The sky above is overcast, lending a slightly gloomy tone to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on an unexpected object - the fallen sign - on an ordinary road, suggests themes of disruption or inconvenience in a typically quiet, rural setting.","title":"Limits placed on the amount of gasoline drivers could obtain for their cars created uncrowded scenes along normally busy streets such as this one in Portland","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["543104","544262","556313","547782","547659","544245","555582","550279","556615","556943","546401","554031","555647","545367","547771","543173"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","asphalt","gravel","80","sign","disruption","object","lettering","block","sedan"]}
