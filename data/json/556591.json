{"path":"556591.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting with a large cylindrical concrete silo and an adjoining rectangular building to the right. A prominent feature connecting these two structures is a raised metal conveyor belt or chute, suggesting materials are transported between them. The environment surrounding this industrial setup is quite green, with wooded hills in the background that appear lush and dense.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an open space that seems to be part of a small park or resting area, evident by the presence of mature trees, a couple of bushes, and what appears to be a bench. Three individuals can be seen walking in this area. The trees are tinged with autumn colors, pointing to the season in which the photograph was taken.\n\nAdditionally, in the middle ground, below the silo and to the left, there are smaller structures that look like part of a residential or small community facility area, possibly related to the industrial operations or providing housing for workers.\n\nThis image captures an interesting juxtaposition of industrial and natural elements, with human activity subtly integrated into the scene.","title":"Industry, education and housing are shown in this picture in lynch, Kentucky, near Cumberland, in harlan county.
