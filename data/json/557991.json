{"path":"557991.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features a pastoral scene dominated by a large red barn in the center. The barn is a traditional two-story structure with white trim around the windows and doors. It has a gabled roof with two cupolas at the top, both painted white. In front of the barn, there are several cows grazing in a green field, which contributes to a serene rural setting. The barn appears to be surrounded by a variety of trees, some of which are leafless possibly indicating early spring or late fall. The sky above is partially cloudy with some blue showing through, suggesting a pleasant day. The foreground is partially framed by darker tree branches, adding a natural border to the bucolic landscape. This scene exudes a peaceful, agricultural charm, typical of a countryside farm.","title":"Cattle grazing on a privately owned farm along the Akron-Peninsula Road and Ira Road at Northampton, near Akron Ohio. The farm is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which was signed into law in December, 1974. The National Park Service must complete a master plan for the area by June, 1976. The law authorizes expenditure of $34.5 million for buying or controlling land, but it must be appropriated by Congress.","placename":"North Hampton (Ohio)","location":"North Hampton, Ohio","nn1":["550019","552537","549194","548065","547128","555571","556963","556586","555577","543343","555646","552462","550693","542801","551305","555635"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","cow","countryside","border","fall","charm","farm","spring","story","door"]}
