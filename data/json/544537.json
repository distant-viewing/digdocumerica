{"path":"544537.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a distinct, modern architectural structure set within a vast, expansive natural landscape. The image prominently features a large, circular observation tower with multiple levels, situated on the right side of the frame. This tower is connected by a sloping, curvaceous ramp to a smaller structure that mirrors its design, but is slightly shorter. Both structures boast a futuristic appeal with clean, white concrete surfaces that contrast sharply with the natural green surroundings.\n\nThe tower and ramp sit beside a dark, winding waterway that enhances the composition with a natural element, leading the viewer's eye through the scene. Beyond the structures, a long, narrow road or path stretches straight through the middle of the photograph, disappearing into the flat, open horizon. This path is bordered by lush greenery and stretches across an expansive field that suggests a wetland or grassland environment, characteristic of regions like the Everglades.\n\nThe background of the photograph fades into a light blue sky, scattered with a few white clouds, suggesting a calm, clear day. The aerial perspective emphasizes the isolation and uniqueness of the architectural structures within the natural setting, highlighting their geometric shapes and the juxtaposition of human-made elements with the untouched landscape surrounding them.","title":"Shark Valley Ranger Station","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544565","544561","546481","548870","548946","546480","555318","546473","555320","546485","544523","553829","544503","546468","555397","556929"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["ramp","tower","boast","path","disappear","structure","grassland","stretch","appeal","observation"]}
