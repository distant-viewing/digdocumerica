{"path":"549439.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures an intense and dramatic moment of whitewater rafting. In the photograph, three individuals in a red canoe struggle to navigate through turbulent, foaming river waters. Two of the occupants, visible at the front and middle of the canoe, are actively using paddles to steer and stabilize the canoe, while the third person appears to be holding on tightly to the side, likely trying to maintain balance.\n\nThe river itself is a frenzy of white waves and splashes, indicating strong currents and rough waters. Surrounding the river, large dark rocks and boulders can be seen, which adds to the sense of a challenging natural river course that the rafters are attempting to conquer.\n\nThe background is less distinct due to the focus and action in the foreground but appears to be a densely wooded area, which suggests that this activity is taking place in a remote or natural setting, far from urban environments. The canopy of trees in various shades of green hints at a lush, possibly mountainous area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its dynamic action, vividly captures the adventure and challenges of outdoor water sports such as whitewater rafting.","title":"Small (17-foot) raft running Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River in Hells Canyon.
