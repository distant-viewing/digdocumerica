{"path":"551883.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph is taken in a subway station, capturing a bustling scene with people engaged in various activities. A train is visible on the right side of the frame, its doors open, with passengers disembarking and preparing to board. The train is labeled with the number \"2\" and advertisement posters can be seen on its side.\n\nThe station is structured with multiple levels; the upper level has individuals walking, some descending stairs to the lower platform where the train is located. Overhead, the ceiling features lighting fixtures that illuminate the area, and structural columns can be seen supporting the levels.\n\nThe floor of the upper platform is tiled, contributing to a clean and orderly appearance of the station. The scene conveys a sense of everyday transit movement with a diverse group of people, including individuals walking briskly, standing, and interacting subtly with one another.\n\nThe setting includes advertisements along the wall, contributing to a vibrant urban environment typical of busy metro systems in large cities. The overall composition of the photo, with its dynamic range of movement and urban architectural elements, offers a snapshot of public transportation and city life. The slightly blurred motion of some people suggests the quick pace and transient nature of the setting.","title":"Arrivals and departures at an underground station. All have escalators.
