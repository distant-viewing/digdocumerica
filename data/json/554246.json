{"path":"554246.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This image captures a snowy mountain scene dominated by a ski lift gondola. The gondola, which is numbered \"2,\" is an enclosed cabin type, designed to protect passengers from the cold and wind. It is predominantly made of metal and glass, the exterior appears somewhat worn and is colored white. Inside the gondola, two individuals are visible, wearing winter attire suitable for skiing. Placed adjacently to the gondola are multiple pairs of skis stored upright.\n\nThe cable lines of the ski lift are noticeable above, showing a mechanism that facilitates movement of the gondolas. Below and around the ski lift, the terrain is covered with snow, displaying signs of multiple ski trails or tracks indicating frequent use.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features sparse winter trees without leaves, suggesting a cold, mountainous region suited for winter sports. The ground under the gondola is uneven and covered with snow, and there seems to be a small structure or booth at ground level, possibly used for ski lift operations or as a shelter.\n\nOverall, the composition gives the viewer a clear impression of an active ski area, highlighting the function of the ski lift in transporting skiers up the mountain to enjoy winter activities.","title":"Vail's two gondolas carry either six or four passengers per car.
