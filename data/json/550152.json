{"path":"550152.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene likely set in a suburban area. The focus of the image is split between a man and a vintage car, positioned in front of a garage that features a large American flag as its fa√ßade. The car, a prominent red vintage model from the 1970s, possibly a European brand such as Fiat or Renault, features circular front headlights and a notable chrome bumper. Its license plate indicates it is registered in Ohio, 1973.\n\nStanding leaning on the car with his left elbow resting on the roof, is an older man, sporting glasses and dressed in a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes. His casual stance and attire suggest a relaxed, perhaps weekend, setting.\n\nIn the background, to the right, a woman can be partially seen. She is in mid-motion, dressed in a light-colored outfit that blends with the sunlit, verdant environment of what appears to be a well-maintained yard.\n\nThe setting is further enriched with a mix of lush green trees providing some shade, with dappled sunlight filtering through. The driveway where the car is parked is unpaved, adding a rustic charm to the overall serene suburban atmosphere. The prominent display of the American flag adds a sense of national pride or celebration to the scene, possibly indicating the photograph was taken around a national holiday like the Fourth of July.","title":"The Staley's, residents of suburban Lakewood, recently spruced up the doors of their 50-year-old garage with red, white and blue paint.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550148","551021","557878","551119","555922","557874","557841","557900","552795","547141","557692","546817","545548","557667","544641","557766"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","flag","register","elbow","holiday","pride","driveway","bumper","license","split"]}
