{"path":"554798.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features an elderly woman standing in front of a traditional house with a weathered, white wooden exterior. She is wearing glasses and a sleeveless, patterned blouse. The woman has a serious expression on her face and is looking directly at the camera. In her right hand, she holds a clear glass jar that appears to contain a dark liquid.\n\nThe house behind her has visible signs of aging and wear, with peeling paint and an overall look of deterioration. The door is slightly ajar, and a window with a sheer curtain can be seen in the background directly behind the woman.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a rural or semi-rural area given the older architectural style of the building and the natural light, suggesting the photograph was taken outdoors during the day. The mood evoked by the image is somewhat solemn and reflective.","title":"Mary Workman holds a jar of undrinkable water that comes from her well, and has filed a damage suit against the Hanna Coal Company. She has to transport water from a well many miles away. Although the coal company owns all the land around her, and many roads are closed, she refuses to sell.","placename":"Steubenville (Ohio)","location":"Steubenville, Ohio","nn1":["556487","552680","553480","556498","554051","548246","556546","546987","553503","544410","554192","544311","554194","554787","555530","552956"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","sleeveless","jar","deterioration","glass","house","liquid","aging","curtain","peel"]}
