{"path":"546629.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy multi-lane highway during what appears to be either early morning or evening, as suggested by the low light conditions and headlights turned on in most vehicles. The scene is likely captured from an overpass or a high vantage point, looking down at the traffic-filled road.\n\nThe highway consists of several lanes, with cars densely packed and some lanes showing heavier traffic than others. The vehicles vary in type, mostly comprised of cars but also include a prominent bus in the right foreground, which is traveling on a less congested lane. The headlights and taillights of the cars create streaks of light, reflecting on the wet roadway, adding a shimmering effect to the surface.\n\nOverhead, there are large street lights illuminating the highway, contributing to the visibility along with light posts running parallel on both sides of the highway. Road signs are visible in the upper middle portion of the frame, indicating directions for \"North Washington\" and for an exit to \"Shirlington.\" The ambient light is dim, indicating that the photo was taken during twilight or at night, under cloudy or overcast skies.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment in urban traffic, reflecting a common scene in metropolitan areas where highways become congested during peak hours. The lights and conditions create a somewhat dramatic and busy atmosphere.","title":"Shirley Highway in Virginia.
