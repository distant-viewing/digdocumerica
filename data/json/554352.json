{"path":"554352.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image showcases a large pile of compressed and crushed cars, forming a monumental heap of metal waste. The cars are stacked unevenly, creating a jagged and chaotic surface that dominates the frame. The variety of colors in the metal, ranging from rusty browns to blacks, blues, whites, and hints of red, suggest these are vehicles of different makes and ages.\n\nThere are visible parts such as twisted doors, squished roofs, and mangled bumpers. The compacted shapes of the cars make it nearly impossible to discern any whole vehicle, indicating the intensity of the crushing and recycling process. The background is largely obscured by the scale of the heap, but a slightly overcast sky is visible overhead, casting natural light that enhances the metallic sheen of the crushed cars.\n\nNo people or activities are discernible in this image, emphasizing the desolation and abandonment typical of a scrapyard environment. The setting evokes a sense of finality, where vehicles have been reduced to their basic material form after the end of their usable life. The image is a stark representation of urban industrial waste and raises questions about consumerism, sustainability, and environmental impact.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["551517","554320","552738","554348","542656","546172","545545","553006","554311","545303","553005","551547","547476","554357","544819","542660"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["heap","car","waste","sustainability","question","make","vehicle","scrapyard","bumper","recycling"]}
