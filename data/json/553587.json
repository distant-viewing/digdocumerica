{"path":"553587.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a tree trunk, highlighted in such a manner that it emphasizes the intricate texture of the bark. The bark's rugged surface is deeply grooved with a complex pattern of cracks and crevices that appear almost map-like. The lighting enhances the texture further, casting shadows and creating a high contrast between the dark areas and the lighter, possibly sunlit, sections of the bark. The background is out of focus, which suggests that it might be taken in a wooded or forested area, emphasizing the isolation of the tree trunk in the frame. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of natural rugged beauty, focusing on the timeless and often overlooked details of tree bark.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora this unharmed tree stands on acreage in the burn area owned by the pickering lumber company.
