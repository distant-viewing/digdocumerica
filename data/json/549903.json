{"path":"549903.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of dense traffic congestion on a multi-lane highway. The image features numerous cars tightly packed, covering several lanes, which are predominantly vintage models suggesting the photo might have been taken in the 1970s or 1980s. The vehicles exhibit a variety of colors like yellow, red, white, black, and several shades of blue and brown.\n\nVisible in the backdrop are urban elements, such as tall street lamps lining the road and road signage, including a \"Speed Limit 40\" sign. There are also glimpses of what appear to be city buildings or infrastructure, but these details are somewhat obscured by the volume of traffic and perspective.\n\nThe photograph portrays a typical urban traffic scenario, likely during peak commuting hours given the volume of vehicles. The daytime setting allows for clear visibility of the cars and their immediate surroundings. The overall composition effectively conveys a sense of congestion and slow-moving traffic, typical of city life during this era.","title":"Franklin D.
