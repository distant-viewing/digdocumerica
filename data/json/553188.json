{"path":"553188.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, rain-soaked evening in what appears to be an urban setting. A prominent feature of the image is the multiple street lamps with polygonal light fixtures that illuminate the scene brightly, their reflections shimmering on the wet pavement.\n\nThe foreground features a large puddle reflecting the light, adding sparkle scattered across the pavement, enhancing the rain-soaked atmosphere. In the middle-ground, a single person holding an umbrella, covered with a pattern that resembles possibly floral or artistic, is walking away from the viewer, contributing a sense of solitude and quiet movement.\n\nThe background shows a high-rise building filled with many windows, some of which are illuminated, suggesting an office or residential building. Trees are faintly visible around the area, softened by the night ambiance.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a tranquil yet melancholic feel, evoked by the interplay of light and reflections with elements of nature and urban life, capturing a moment of solitude amidst the vastness of the city environment.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: rainy night.
