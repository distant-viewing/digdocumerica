{"path":"555863.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a vast, flat landscape, likely taken from an aircraft. The area shown is a mix of dry land and multiple bodies of water, which vary in size and shape. Many of these water bodies are irregular, suggesting they might be natural in origin, possibly salt flats or marshlands given the white encrustations visible around many of them.\n\nThe terrain is predominantly barren with minimal vegetation. A network of roads, both paved and unpaved, crisscrosses the area, connecting clusters of small structures which are probably human settlements or industrial installations. Notably, there is a main road cutting through the center of the image, running vertically and intersected by other horizontal paths.\n\nIn the background, a large expanse of water stretches across the horizon, which could be a lake or a sea. Beyond this body of water, mountain ranges are faintly visible, adding a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The overall appearance is that of a remote, sparsely populated region, possibly used for specific industrial activities given the layout and the isolated pockets of infrastructure. The color palette of the image is dominated by earthy tones, with hints of blue from the water bodies, indicating a dry, possibly arid climate.","title":"Aerial view of the pond when cleanup operations were half finished. The white areas are alkaline. In the background are evaporation cells on Great Salt Lake where minerals are extracted. EPA supervised the cleanup of the pond to prevent possible contamination of the lake and a nearby wildlife refuge.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["555865","555845","550397","555864","552902","554164","544764","543644","555844","555861","550598","544778","549170","548703","552426","555880"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["flat","body","origin","marshland","water","salt","pocket","installation","aircraft","settlement"]}
