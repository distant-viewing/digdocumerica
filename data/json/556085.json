{"path":"556085.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is taken from inside a train's cab, looking out towards a suburban landscape. The foreground is dominated by a silhouette of a train engineer, viewed from behind, as he oversees the controls in front of him. His head and upper body are visible, and he is looking straight ahead through the train's windshield.\n\nThe interior of the cab appears utilitarian, equipped with various meters and control panels, which are partially visible on the left side of the image. The top part of the windshield frames the view, which gives a feeling of looking outward from a confined space.\n\nOutside, the scene captures a straight stretch of railroad tracks receding into the distance, flanked by greenery and a clear sky. On the right, the view expands into a suburban neighborhood characterized by single-family homes, well-maintained lawns, and driveways. Several houses can be distinctly seen; they have different architectural designs but mostly appear as typical suburban homes with garages. The area looks peaceful and residential, with no visible people or moving vehicles, adding a quiet and serene atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Engineer on the empire builder enroute from Chicago to east glacier park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington, passes the outskirts of a housing development.
