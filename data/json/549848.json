{"path":"549848.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and busy urban street scene, likely in a city like New York, characterized by a congested traffic setting. The main focus of the image is a lineup of vehicles, notably including several iconic yellow taxis prominent in the foreground. One of the taxis, specifically the one nearest to the camera, features a driver with his arm resting on the window sill, adding a human element to the image. This taxi bears the logo and fare details typical of the era it represents, reading \"60¢ 1st 1/2 MILE 10¢ EACH ADDL. 1/2 MILE.\"\n\nThe composition includes other vehicles as well, such as another taxi seen in part, and different types of trucks in the background, one of which prominently displays the lettering \"P.M.,\" likely indicating a company or brand. The variety and density of these vehicles suggest a bustling urban environment, possibly during a traffic jam or peak traffic hours.\n\nThe background, though blurred due to the depth of field focused on the nearest taxi, shows urban commercial signage and the busy atmosphere typical of a densely populated city center. This includes glimpses of other vehicles and perhaps commercial buildings or billboards, contributing to the metropolitan vibe of the photo.\n\nThe overall aesthetics, including the color saturation, the style of the vehicles, and the grainy quality of the image, suggest that this photograph might be from the mid to late 20th century. The photo offers a snapshot of urban life, portraying the rhythm of the city through its depiction of the daily grind and movement within a congested urban setting.","title":"Midtown traffic","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549869","554315","554310","554330","554331","554316","548331","549876","549859","548410","549873","554314","554293","549868","554294","554329"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","mile","taxis","vehicle","traffic","city","sill","lineup","congested","congest"]}
