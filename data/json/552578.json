{"path":"552578.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural agricultural scene focused on hay baling activities. In the foreground, there's a red tractor operated by a person sitting in the driver's seat. Attached to the tractor is a hay baler and several oblong bales of hay lie scattered around. To the left, two individuals can be seen loading the freshly baled hay onto a flatbed trailer. The trailer is adjacent to the tractor and is already filled with several layers of bales.\n\nThe individuals involved in the manual labor are dressed in casual clothing appropriate for farm work, performing their tasks under clear, sunny conditions. The background features a large, barren hill or mountain with patches of sparse vegetation, which suggests this work is being carried out in a dry, possibly arid environment. The expansive field visible around the subjects is flat, and there are several lines of trees and possibly a fence line, indicating the managed nature of this landscape.\n\nOverall, this image depicts a moment of active agricultural labor, emphasizing teamwork and the use of mechanical equipment to manage and transport agricultural products. The setting and dress suggest this activity is taking place in a warmer season, conducive to such outdoor work.","title":"Three generations of oldlands have ranched on piceance creek.
