{"path":"555820.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a pastoral scene of a flock of sheep grazing in a grassy field. There are approximately a dozen sheep in total, spread out across the midground of the image. The sheep are mostly adult, with their wool appearing in various shades of off-white, and there seem to be a few lambs among them, indicated by their smaller size and closer proximity to the larger sheep.\n\nThe environment is a large, open field with lush green grass covering the ground. The background is lined with a dense collection of trees, which form a barrier that encloses the field. The trees are tall and leafy, suggesting that this might be taken during the late spring or summer months. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, which enhances the tranquil and serene mood of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the simplicity and peacefulness of rural life, devoid of any human presence or modern distractions, offering a snapshot of nature and traditional livestock grazing practices.","title":"Sheep in a pasture on a farm surrounded by industry near Somerville, New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area. The farmer uses a fine sand-like ash from a nearby sewage treatment plant incinerator to enrich his hay fields. Neighboring industries rent him back land previously sold; taxes are too high for him to own it. Cattle and hogs also are raised.","placename":"Somerville (N.J.)","location":"Somerville, New Jersey","nn1":["554779","554928","552555","552556","554887","557747","543269","544384","544933","554932","554935","544391","554890","542626","550452","546102"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","field","grazing","wool","dozen","total","flock","month","distraction","livestock"]}
