{"path":"552278.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in an activity along a rocky seashore. The setting features a dramatic backdrop of distant snow-covered mountains under a blue sky, suggesting the location might be in a colder, coastal region.\n\nThe person on the left is squatting low to the ground. They wear a red patterned top and brown pants, and are facing away from the camera looking down, possibly searching for or collecting something from the ground. The other individual, on the right, is bending over. This person is dressed in a black sweater and jeans and is wearing a beige hat. They hold a wooden stick or tool, possibly used to dig or probe the ground.\n\nBeside this pair, there are a couple of cardboard milk cartons and a yellow bucket, suggesting these items are being used to hold any finds from their activity. The terrain is rugged and wet, potentially indicating low tide where marine life or other seaside resources can be accessed.\n\nOverall, the scene likely involves shellfish gathering or a similar collecting activity, a common practice in many coastal areas that have rich marine biodiversity. The focus and attire of the individuals reflect a practical, outdoor task in a chilly environment.","title":"Digging for clams at alki beach, on puget sound.
