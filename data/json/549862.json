{"path":"549862.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving a yellow taxi cab on a busy urban street. The primary focus is on the left arm and hand of a person extending from the driver’s side window of the cab. The person appears to be wearing a denim jacket. The hand is relaxed, with fingers hanging downwards, and is held just above the side mirror of the vehicle. \n\nThe taxi itself is iconic, painted in a bright yellow color, with black and white lettering and some numbers seen on the side door, originating from a period where taxis were prominently colored in many urban settings. The photograph has a shallow depth of field, causing the background to appear softly blurred, which emphasizes the arm and taxi while also giving a sense of activity in the surroundings.\n\nThe environment suggests a densely populated cityscape with other vehicles ahead of the taxi—out of focus cars suggest traffic congestion. The muted backdrop implies a bustling, possibly overcast day in a city filled with tall buildings, typical of many downtown cores. The ambient lighting conditions and the soft focus contribute to an atmospheric quality, reminiscent of a daily city life scene.","title":"Cab driver waits at intersection in Midtown","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549869","554316","554330","549859","554315","549876","549848","549868","554331","549873","545325","549894","554329","554310","554314","548331"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["taxi","cab","arm","core","finger","congestion","city","downtown","mirror","person"]}
