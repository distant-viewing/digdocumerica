{"path":"548668.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting, likely at a campground or a recreational area. The scene includes a vintage camper attached to a vehicle, and a large beige station wagon parked to the side, showcasing a classic 1970s American automotive design. In front of the camper, there is a wooden picnic table equipped with what appears to be camping gear or picnic items — a cooler and other outdoor essentials are visible.\n\nThe background reveals a flat, open landscape dotted with small shrubs or bushes and a few sparse trees, suggesting a coastal or desert-like environment. The sky is partly cloudy, hinting at either early morning or late afternoon light which casts soft shadows across the ground. On the left side, there’s a glimpse of another vehicle or structure, shadowed and less distinct, which adds a feeling of depth to the scene.\n\nThe fronds of a palm tree frame the top right corner of the image, introducing a tropical element to the composition and enhancing the outdoor, leisurely vibe of the image. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and conveys a sense of escape or vacationing away from urban settings.","title":"Campsite at Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key.
