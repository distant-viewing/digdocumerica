{"path":"552840.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a large-scale flooding event affecting a riverside community. The river, which appears swollen and muddy, has flooded over its banks, submerging trees, roads, and buildings in the surrounding area. A prominent feature in the image is a bridge with distinctive towers and a span section that allows for the passage of ships, connecting two parts of the city.\n\nThe flooded area reveals several partially submerged buildings and homes, hinting at significant water-related damage. A variety of boats, some of which seem to be emergency or rescue vessels, can be seen navigating the muddied waters. \n\nIn the distance, the weather is overcast with dark clouds, suggesting ongoing or recent adverse weather conditions which could have contributed to the flooding. The landscape near the horizon shows that the flooding extends far into the surrounding region, impacting large swathes of the environment and human habitation. The overall composition of the photograph captures a dramatic and chaotic scenario, highlighting the scale of the disaster and its impact on the community and local infrastructure.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
