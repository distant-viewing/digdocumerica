{"path":"556902.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph displays a railway track taking center stage, leading the viewer's eye from the foreground diagonally towards a group of figures in the distance. It appears to be a daytime scene due to the bright outdoor lighting. The track is flanked by beds of gravel and the rails themselves have a rugged, used look, with some rust and worn-down wooden sleepers.\n\nOn the right side of the track, there is a row of parked railway work machines, characterized by their vibrant colors and sturdy build. These machines vary in design, reflecting their different functions related to railway maintenance or construction.\n\nIn the distance, along the continuation of the track, a group of people is visible. These individuals seem to be scattered around the railway environment, possibly engaged in some kind of construction, maintenance, or group activity. They are small in size within the frame due to the perspective.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes scattered vegetation and a few utility poles. The sky is broad and clear, hinting at fair weather conditions. The overall scene conveys a busy yet organized industrial atmosphere, possibly captured during a break in activity or an inspection of the site.","title":"Rails lying near the side of the roadbed where southern railway right-of-way workers are using machinery to revitalize the tracks","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556877","556873","556856","556853","556888","556869","556879","556878","556859","556889","556860","556871","556874","556883","556894","556885"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","track","machine","group","maintenance","continuation","construction","inspection","kind","bed"]}
