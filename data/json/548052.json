{"path":"548052.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a dense cluster of houseboats or floating homes packed closely together along what appears to be a river or lake. These homes vary in design, size, and color, displaying a variety of architectural styles, ranging from traditional to more cabin-like structures. Many of the houseboats have decks, some with personal belongings like chairs and tables visible, suggesting a community living scenario.\n\nThe houses are flanked by numerous utility poles, and electrical lines suggest the area is well connected for utilities despite the unconventional housing. The water surrounding the homes is calm, reflecting the structures and enhancing the feeling of a closely-knit, serene living environment. \n\nIn the background, more industrial or less densely packed areas can be seen, along with a large metal bridge that spans across the river, indicating that this community is likely situated near a more populated or urban area. Trees line the farther shore, providing a natural backdrop contrasting with the human-made housing environment. The overall composition gives a detailed look into this unique riverside community, illustrating a lifestyle that balances communal living with the proximity to natural and urban settings.","title":"Houseboats on the Columbia River slough near the Interstate 5 freeway and industrial area.
