{"path":"543701.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up portrait of an elderly man looking contemplatively towards his left. His features are marked by visible signs of aging including deep wrinkles and fine lines on his face, particularly prominent around his eyes and forehead. His hair is unruly, predominantly gray with streaks of dark hair, covering his head unevenly and slightly blowing, suggesting a breeze or movement.\n\nHis expression carries a seriousness and a depth of experience, with his eyes slightly squinted and a neutral mouth. The lighting in the photo highlights part of his face, creating shadows on the other half, adding to the dramatic and intense feel of the portrait.\n\nThe background is nondescript and dark, ensuring the focus remains solely on the man. Thereâ€™s a hint of a garment with a textured pattern visible, suggesting he might be wearing a regular, possibly denim, shirt. The overall composition and mood of the photograph evoke a sense of introspection and quiet dignity.","title":"Uranium miner","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["556563","553055","556452","548616","557035","552871","552103","554857","556443","552872","557032","547282","554846","547179","544409","545417"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["portrait","squint","blow","forehead","seriousness","introspection","wrinkle","aging","eye","garment"]}
