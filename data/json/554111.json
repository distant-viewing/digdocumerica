{"path":"554111.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a beautiful, lush scene of a pink flower field. The focus is on numerous tall, slender stems that have clusters of delicate, small pink flowers. The flowers appear light pink in color with a slightly darker pink center, decorating the green stems densely populated throughout the image. \n\nThe setting is an organized agricultural field as indicated by the presence of distinct rows which are bordered by wooden planks, suggesting a structured planting arrangement, likely a flower cultivation site. The lines formed by these rows lead the eye towards the background, enhancing the depth of the composition.\n\nIn the background, the green foliage continues, but details are less distinct, which gives a sense of the expanse of this field. The sky is overcast, with soft lighting that enhances the colors of the flowers, making them appear vivid against the muted tones of the field and sky.\n\nThe overall mood is peaceful and natural, showcasing the beauty of cultivated floral agriculture. The image seems to capture the essence of a calm, serene environment dedicated to flower growth.","title":"The Hilo area of Hawaii is known as the orchid capital of the world.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["552538","542970","554595","557618","553588","554843","544934","543597","544574","543200","542641","542645","557098","553366","542706","542704"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","field","row","planting","cultivation","agriculture","plank","essence","growth","arrangement"]}
