{"path":"545300.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a rugged, desert-like environment, characterized by expansive layered rock formations and sparse vegetation. A woman is seated on the smooth, sloping surface of a rock formation, looking out over the landscape. She has long hair, is wearing a sleeveless black top, and a patterned skirt.\n\nThe terrain is predominantly rocky with various shades of brown and tan, displaying striations that indicate geological layering and erosion. The land is shaped into undulating curves and flat plateaus, with some crevices and overhangs visible. Small green bushes and scattered patches of grass are the only visible vegetation in the otherwise barren landscape.\n\nThe background reveals a deep canyon or valley between large rock formations, giving a sense of depth and vastness to the scene. The sky above is clear with a few faint clouds, suggesting a sunny day which accentuates the earth tones of the rocks.\n\nThe composition captures a moment of solitude, introspection, or admiration of nature, as the woman seems absorbed in the view before her. The expansive and unpopulated wilderness along with the solitary figure helps evoke feelings of tranquility and the sublime nature of the landscape.","title":"White Canyon near Sipapu Bridge.
