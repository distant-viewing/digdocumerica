{"path":"550177.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene set against an urban skyline. In the foreground, prominent industrial equipment abounds, including large pipes and cylindrical structures, some of which emit white smoke or steam. In the center of the image, a distinct large smokestack projects a darker, denser plume of smoke into the air, contrasting starkly with the lighter emissions around it.\n\nThe middle ground offers a view of more industrial structures, while in the background, the urban skyline is characterized by several high-rise buildings. Among these buildings, a particularly notable tower with intricate architectural details stands out prominently, a classic feature of historical skyscraper design, suggesting the photograph might be located in a city with rich architectural history.\n\nThe overall mood is gritty and somewhat somber due to the visible air pollution and the overcast sky, hinting at environmental concerns associated with industrial areas. The combination of industrial foreground and an architecturally significant background provides a stark contrast between industrial activity and urban life.","title":"Smoke from republic steel obscures the terminal tower building","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548321","550172","555737","550982","557225","551026","557373","550181","548376","551054","550195","550983","545239","547204","545447","550981"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["skyline","air","smoke","denser","history","emission","concern","skyscraper","project","combination"]}
