{"path":"548787.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal landscape, most likely taken from an airplane. The image captures a large expanse of shallow coastal waters that vary in shade from light to dark blue and green, possibly indicating different depths or sea vegetation. The dominant feature is an intricate mangrove ecosystem with dense green vegetation. Winding through the mangroves, a white sandy road can be seen, suggesting some human presence or development in the area.\n\nThe topography of the land is flat, and sporadic patches of open land or less dense vegetation are visible amidst the mangroves. These areas are lighter in color, ranging from sandy to muddy tones. Toward the horizon, the water body extends into wider open water, blending into a haze that obscures the farther landscape and merges with the overcast sky.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of serene isolation, typical of remote coastal or estuarine environments. The photograph captures the natural beauty and complexity of such an ecosystem, reflecting both its vulnerability and its significance as a habitat.","title":"Luxuriant stand of mangroves near Big Pine Key in the lower Florida Keys.
