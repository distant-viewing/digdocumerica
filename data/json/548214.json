{"path":"548214.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat cluttered and neglected urban scene focused on a pile of garbage on a pavement. The debris consists of a mixture of papers, plastics, and other miscellaneous materials that have accumulated against a metal railing. This railing appears to be part of a staircase due to its angular alignment and proximity to the concrete steps.\n\nThe garbage is torn and weathered, suggesting it has been there for some time, exposed to the elements. It's spread across the width of the staircase, obstructing passage and creating a rather unsightly blockage. The colors in the debris range from whites and grays to browns and blacks, all dulled and muddied which adds to the overall unkempt feel of the scene.\n\nThe pavement where the trash lies is stained and dirty, with tracks and spills of unidentified liquids adding to the grimy appearance. The immediate background is dimly lit, focusing the viewer's attention principally on the brightly lit garbage and railing in the foreground. The lighting suggests either a strong sunlight or a directed light source, spotlighting the pile and enhancing textures and details. \n\nOverall, the photograph may evoke thoughts about urban decay, neglect, and the environmental impact of waste. It could be interpreted as a commentary on pollution or the need for better waste management in city environments.","title":"Solid waste clings to bars of sewage outlet near vancouver's interstate bridge; the rest flows on to empty into the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545494","549833","549839","551247","549820","549957","547983","549786","545506","547878","546854","549784","557307","549840","547899","552102"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","railing","staircase","pavement","waste","obstruct","neglect","pile","spotlight","interpret"]}
