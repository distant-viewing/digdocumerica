{"path":"542669.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an airport, where three men are standing near a small propeller aircraft, presumably having a conversation. The aircraft in the background is a twin-engine propeller plane, parked on the tarmac. It has a sleek, streamlined design with the nose of the aircraft facing towards the camera. The propellers on each engine are clearly visible, and they are positioned symmetrically on the sides of the fuselage.\n\nThe men are dressed in casual attire. The first man on the left is wearing a light-colored striped horizontally striped polo shirt and white pants, and he is slightly bent forward as he actively engages in the conversation. The second man, in the center, is wearing glasses with a dark frame, a light blue collared shirt, and dark slacks. He seems to be listening intently, with one hand partially reaching out, possibly gesturing. The third man on the right has a darker, well-groomed beard and mustache, and sports a dark shirt and jacket, paired with light-colored pants.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky and what appears to be the edge of an airport runway or tarmac, implying a bright, sunny day conducive for flying or travel. The overall mood of the scene is informal and collegial, suggesting the individuals are colleagues or acquaintances engaged in a professional meeting or discussion concerning aviation.","title":"This plane, supplied by nasa is equipped to undertake smog research","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542576","554092","542498","542578","552366","547247","542499","547237","542671","553182","547678","546683","547018","555287","547231","557856"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["propeller","aircraft","tarmac","airport","engine","man","stripe","colleague","runway","aviation"]}
