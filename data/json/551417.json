{"path":"551417.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a young woman seated on the ground in a muddy, outdoor setting. She is wearing brown knee-high boots with a thick heel and adorned with a row of metallic studs. Her attire includes brown pants, which are slightly raised to reveal white socks, and a long-sleeve blue shirt. She's also wearing suspenders. Her brown hair is pulled back into a low ponytail.\n\nThe woman is seated in a casual, somewhat awkward position with one leg stretched out and the other bent, resting on the ground. She is looking towards her right side, away from the camera, with a calm expression.\n\nThe background consists of a sparse, muddy field with some dry grass and small twigs. The overall environment appears cold and barren, suggesting a late fall or early spring setting. The image captures a sense of rustic outdoor life, possibly indicating the woman is engaged in activities such as hiking or fieldwork.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
