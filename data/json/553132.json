{"path":"553132.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene featuring multiple U-Haul rental trucks and trailers parked in a lot. The vehicles prominently display the U-Haul brand, including its recognizable orange and white color scheme, and slogans like \"Adventure in moving\" and \"Lowest cost.\" Each truck is attached to a cargo trailer, and they are arranged in no particular order within what appears to be a dirt or grassy area.\n\nIn the background, a variety of modular or mobile homes are visible, clustered together and featuring outer construction of primarily metal roofs and siding. Beyond these homes lies a slightly elevated residential area with more traditional homes, indicative of a suburban environment.\n\nAdding depth to the scene, the backdrop further features a distant view of a hill or low mountain range, under a bright, likely sunny sky. The overall setting appears to be on the edge of a suburban area, transitioning into a more rural or less developed environment. The photograph captures a moment of stillness, with no people visible, focusing solely on the parked vehicles and the architectural landscape surrounding them.","title":"Along I-80, outside Reno","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["544146","558300","551428","546848","556417","548762","552376","544449","557339","556468","548980","544061","546900","558254","546695","544147"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["home","trailer","truck","slogan","order","brand","scheme","cargo","stillness","siding"]}
