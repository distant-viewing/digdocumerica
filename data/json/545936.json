{"path":"545936.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene at a lakeside, distinguished by a structured, calm body of water reflecting the clear sky. It features a metal framework, possibly part of a cage or floating platform, partially submerged and extended into the lake. The structure is characterized by a series of metal bars with some parts showing signs of rust, indicating that it may have been in the water for some time.\n\nOn a rough dock made of wooden planks, there are two individuals engaged in activities likely related to the structure in the water. One person, standing closer to the edge of the dock, seems to be maneuvering a bucket or a similar object, perhaps interacting with the water or the structure. A second person is standing slightly behind, observing or waiting to assist. Both are dressed in casual outdoor wear suitable for work or activity near water.\n\nThe background shows a distant shoreline softly blurred, with gentle hills rising modestly under a blue sky. This tranquil backdrop suggests a peaceful remote location, intended for practical usage rather than bustling activity. The overall color palette of the scene is a blend of blues, grays, and earth tones that evoke a quiet, early morning atmosphere. The calmness of the lake and the clarity of the sky contribute to a sense of isolation and tranquility.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["544266","545928","547052","554552","548034","545911","545940","544567","545932","543579","545915","552139","545969","551258","547027","545926"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dock","cage","lake","water","distinguish","intend","lakeside","maneuver","bar","usage"]}
