{"path":"548921.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a vibrant river scene flanked by contrasting landscapes. In the river, two speedboats are visible; one is nearly at the center of the frame creating a wake as it moves rapidly downstream, and the other is located near the bottom right, trailing a long, frothy wake behind it. The river itself shines under the sunlight, its surface textured by ripples and waves.\n\nOn the left side of the river, a small developed area can be seen. This stretch includes several rows of buildings that appear largely residential or possibly low-key commercial. Right at the water's edge, there are multiple docks extending into the river, some with boats moored to them. This side of the river also shows less vegetation and appears more urbanized with visible roads and some parked cars.\n\nOn the right side, in contrast, the area is less built-up and more natural. There is a strip of dense greenery lining the riverside, followed by what look like roads or paths that run parallel to the river. The background on both sides is dominated by rugged hills or low mountains, providing a stark, natural backdrop to the river scene.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a picturesque setting that juxtaposes human activity and natural beauty, showing how the river serves both recreational and possibly functional purposes for the community.","title":"Parker \"strip\" below Parker Dam is a popular recreational area.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548926","548939","548934","548935","551218","548916","551286","548028","551208","551993","548077","551148","549458","551217","544749","549088"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","wake","key","speedboat","shine","side","riverside","moor","road","strip"]}
