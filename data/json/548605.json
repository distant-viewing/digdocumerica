{"path":"548605.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a lush, green island surrounded by various shades of blue and green water. The island is characterized by dense vegetation, possibly mangroves or a similar type of coastal forest. A significant feature of the island is its curving white beach, which contrasts starkly with the dark green foliage and the surrounding water.\n\nThe surrounding area is dotted with numerous smaller islands and patches of land, interspersed among winding waterways, suggesting a wetland or estuarine environment. The texture of the water varies in color from deep blues to greens, indicating varying depths and perhaps the presence of sea vegetation or shallower areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the isolation and natural beauty of the island, highlighting the contrast between the densely vegetated areas and the open water surrounding it. The perspective from above provides a comprehensive view of the landscapeâ€™s complexity and tranquility.","title":"Photograph of one of the uninhabited islands between the southern coast and the Florida Keys","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["548630","544596","548785","548604","552887","548786","550358","552919","548787","547637","550359","554171","553983","548628","552922","544635"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["island","mangrove","water","wetland","complexity","waterway","vegetation","beach","sea","isolation"]}
