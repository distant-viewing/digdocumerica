{"path":"543234.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and informal outdoor gathering, possibly during a hike or a nature trip. The scene is set in a rugged outdoor environment with rocky and uneven terrain, dotted with shrubs and small bushes.\n\nThe composition includes several people, mostly children and a few adults, in various casual poses and activities. On the left side, you can see an elderly man in a blue shirt and a cowboy hat looking to his side, standing next to a younger woman with dark hair who is carrying a small child on her back, secured in a baby carrier. In the background, another adult (possibly male), dressed in a blue shirt and jeans, is seen climbing or navigating through the rocks.\n\nThe central part of the image features a group mostly comprised of children and two women. One woman with long dark hair and a vibrant purple sweater is squatting while engaging with a young child, who is looking up at her attentively. Surrounding her are other children of various ages, some standing and others kneeling, all seemingly in a state of active interaction or movement.\n\nOn the far right, a young girl in a white shirt observes or interacts with something she is holding carefully in her hands, separate from the main group.\n\nThis image evokes a sense of communal outdoor activity, possibly a family or a group outing, emphasizing a connection with nature and each other. The attire of the individuals suggests a cool weather setting, with sweaters and long sleeves predominant. The overall mood is one of casual engagement and exploration.","title":"Sierra Club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554672","554667","543233","544739","554670","554510","543238","551413","554489","553370","558096","543236","557985","544093","557206","555947"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["child","sweater","group","adult","woman","baby","hike","squat","shirt","climb"]}
