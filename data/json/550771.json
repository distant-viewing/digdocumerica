{"path":"550771.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This image captures a serene and picturesque scene on a body of water, possibly a river, during sunset. The photograph shows multiple canoe-like boats scattered across the frame, with people engaging in leisurely water activities. These boats range in occupancy, with some carrying single individuals, while others hold groups possibly engaging in conversation or simply enjoying the tranquil environment.\n\nThe setting sun casts a warm, golden light that reflects beautifully off the water's surface, creating a glow that illuminates the scene. The sky is deep and vibrant, suggesting it is either late evening or early dusk.\n\nIn the background, there's a silhouette of a distant bridge spanning across the river, adding a sense of scale and civilization to the otherwise natural landscape. On one side of the river, trees line the shore, their outlines visible against the sky. This provides a natural frame to the water scene, enhancing the sense of being enveloped by nature.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of human activity, natural beauty, and infrastructure, offering a peaceful glimpse into a moment of leisure and connection with nature.","title":"A 1973 replay of the marquette-Joliet trip, three hundred years later, reaches muscoda on the Wisconsin river.
