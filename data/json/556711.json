{"path":"556711.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a vivid urban street scene, likely from the 1960s or 1970s based on the style of the cars and attire. In the foreground stands a woman observed from behind, dressed in a striking green jacket and a colorful patterned skirt. She has short blonde hair and carries a black shoulder bag. She appears to be waiting or observing something across the street.\n\nThe road is densely lined with parked and moving vehicles, showcasing a variety of models and colors typical of the era, such as yellow cabs and other classic cars with distinctive chrome bumpers and designs. The nearest car, a sedan, features a unique two-tone color scheme with elongated headlights that mark its vintage character.\n\nThe street is busy with signs of activity; another person is visible on the opposite sidewalk, interacting with a car. This setting is composed against a backdrop of tall urban buildings, an array of architectural styles suggesting this scene likely takes place in a major city's downtown area. The environment is grey, possibly indicating overcast weather, and the street is wet, reflecting recent rain. The overall attire of the people and the vibrancy of the scene encapsulate the bustling, diverse atmosphere of a mid-20th-century American city.","title":"Taxis were in great demand in Washington, District of Columbia, in May, 1974, during a bus strike which affected the nation's capital and the suburbs.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556726","556715","547191","556808","556725","549882","546626","551913","548369","556742","556710","556723","549645","553184","548388","554297"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","car","cab","observe","bumper","city","headlight","downtown","chrome","scheme"]}
