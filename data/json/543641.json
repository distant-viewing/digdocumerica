{"path":"543641.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic yet arid landscape characterized by steep hills that prominently display layers and variations in soil color, ranging from deep browns to lighter shades of tan and gray. The vegetation appears sparse, consisting of small bushes and grass that dot the hillside, indicative of a semi-arid or desert environment.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent yellow billboard is displayed. It reads \"For INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LAND See GARFIELD OIL LAND & DEVELOPMENT, INC. 719 Grand Ave. Glenwood Springs, Colo.\" The sign is mounted on a simple wooden structure with horizontal supports, standing somewhat isolated against the sparse vegetation below and the stark hills in the background. The starkness of the sign and its message contrasts sharply with the natural rugged terrain behind it, suggesting a dialogue between land development and the natural environment.\n\nThe overall composition juxtapositions human commercial endeavor against the natural geology and sparse vegetation of a possibly remote area, highlighting themes of usage, ownership, and the exploitation of natural landscapes.","title":"Land development advertising in Rocky Mountains","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543637","545746","545827","544418","553130","555573","545824","555610","544845","549039","554817","544429","544136","549179","549180","543772"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["ownership","dialogue","geology","starkness","vegetation","billboard","land","usage","endeavor","hill"]}
