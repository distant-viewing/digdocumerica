{"path":"549393.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph depicts a sailboat actively sailing, leaning slightly due to the force of the wind. The boat is a mono-hull with a white hull and deck, equipped with a mainsail and a jib, both of which are filled with wind, showing that it is sailing in breezy conditions. \n\nThere are four people visible on the sailboat. One person is standing at the stern, apparently steering the boat. Three others are distributed mid-ship and toward the bow, engaged in various activities likely related to managing the sail or perhaps balancing the boat.\n\nThe sea around the boat is choppy, indicating a windy day, and the sky appears to be overcast, giving the scene a muted, somewhat hazy atmosphere. The lack of distinct landmarks or other boats in the immediate vicinity suggests that they are in open water, somewhat isolated from shore or other vessels. The focus and exposure of the photo emphasize the motion and dynamics of sailing.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the race.
