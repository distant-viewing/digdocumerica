{"path":"545140.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene riverside landscape shrouded in fog, creating a subdued and mystical atmosphere. The foreground features wildflowers and tall grasses, some in bloom with clusters of white flowers, suggesting a late summer or early fall season. Wooden fence posts, worn and partially broken, line one side, adding a rustic, aged element to the scene.\n\nThe river itself gently meanders through the center of the frame, its calm waters reflecting the muted colors of the foggy sky and the faint outlines of the distant shoreline. The opposite bank is softly obscured by the fog, hinting at dense vegetation or bushland. This layer of mist not only amplifies the depth and distance but also imbues the scene with a tranquil, almost ethereal quality.\n\nThe palette is cool and limited, dominated by hues of blue and gray, punctuated by the earthy tones of the wild vegetation and the weathered wood. The overall effect is one of quiet isolation and natural beauty, capturing a moment of stillness and the subtle interplay of light and texture.","title":"Fog over estuary","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["557014","557561","554629","550845","557106","550782","550656","550691","557239","557572","552318","542653","557996","554755","554762","553355"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["fog","riverside","bloom","wildflower","fall","stillness","post","outline","mist","summer"]}
