{"path":"543439.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a group of people engaged in outdoor activities in a natural setting. At the foreground, a woman and a shirtless man are focused on planting or tending to vegetation. The woman, wearing light blue pants and a white sweater with dark horizontal stripes, is bending over while pouring water from a green watering can. The man, who stands beside her, is also leaning forward slightly, possibly assisting her or preparing to plant something.\n\nFurther in the background, several other individuals can be seen scattered across a clearing filled with dense vegetation and fallen logs. Each person appears to be actively involved in similar environmental conservation tasks such as planting or clearing the area. Some are wielding tools like shovels.\n\nThe setting appears to be a forest clearing or a wooded area with a variety of trees visible in the background which contribute to a feeling of a secluded natural environment. The scene depicts a community or a group effort, likely aimed at reforestation or ecological restoration. The attire and tools suggest a casual, but organized activity focused on environmental care. The lighting and abundant greenery suggest it's a sunny day, ideal for outdoor work.","title":"Conservationists water newly planted redwoods in devastated area of big basin redwoods","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California","nn1":["545725","544003","545535","543441","551427","552948","545217","545531","543927","551633","553424","551619","551080","543440","545721","542655"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["clearing","tool","restoration","wield","ten","planting","pour","shovel","clear","aim"]}
