{"path":"550449.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a Dall sheep in a natural scenario, exemplifying an outdoor, wildlife setting. The Dall sheep, recognizable by its white coat and notably short, curved black horns, is depicted mid-stride on a rocky terrain. It is moving from left to right across the frame, suggesting motion.\n\nThe background features an assortment of rocks and pebbles, predominantly shaded gray and black, which suggests that the location might be a mountainous or rocky area typical of the natural habitats where Dall sheep are found. The overall color palette of the image is dark with the sheep’s white coat standing out against the darker, blurred background. This contrast focuses the viewer's attention on the animal.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, somewhat dim and possibly overcast, contributing to the moody and natural atmosphere of the shot. The picture's composition and focus draw attention to the sheep's calm but alert demeanor, indicative of its awareness of the surroundings — a common trait in wildlife photography intended to capture the essence of the subject in their environment.","title":"Young sheep on its way to the west salt lick in Atigun Gorge near the point where the pipeline will cross the Atigun River.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550451","550446","550453","550448","550445","550452","550450","554928","554890","543269","554889","554888","554891","550454","544933","555820"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","wildlife","coat","awareness","horn","stride","pebble","attention","assortment","photography"]}
