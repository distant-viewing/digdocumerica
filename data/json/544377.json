{"path":"544377.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, lively beach scene set against a remarkable desert backdrop. In the foreground, the shoreline of a large lake is visible, featuring gentle waves and clear water. Numerous people are enjoying the sunny day at the beach. There are individuals and groups scattered along the sandy shore, engaging in various activities: some are walking, others are sitting or lying on beach towels, and a few are bending over the water, possibly washing or picking up objects. The beach is relatively narrow and defined by its reddish-brown sand, typical of desert environments.\n\nOne person, closer to the forefront, is distinctly visible bending over near the waterâ€™s edge. Further out in the water, people can be seen swimming or wading.\n\nIn the background, the striking natural landscape features large, flat-topped rock formations that rise dramatically from the horizon, characteristic of mesas. These formations, under a bright blue sky, suggest a rugged, arid region possibly within a large desert basin area, providing a stark contrast to the recreational scene at the beach. There are also boats visible in the lake, emphasizing the popularity of water activities in this location. \n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph juxtaposes leisure and the stark beauty of nature, illustrating a vibrant human presence within a stark and dramatic natural landscape.","title":"Beach activity on lake powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["543310","553952","543322","557458","543536","543518","550243","543193","554476","547482","543254","546874","543072","553447","543998","547503"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","desert","stark","bending","few","popularity","formation","mesa","wad","lake"]}
