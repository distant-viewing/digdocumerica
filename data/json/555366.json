{"path":"555366.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph displays a view of a section of a stone wall with metal letters spelling out “THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LABORATORY.” The architecture displayed is structured with large, rough stones, and the text is mounted on it, creating a 3D effect with the letters casting shadows on the stone surface, indicating direct sunlight. \n\nTo the right side of the wall, there is a transition to a plain, white concrete wall. This background serves as a sharp contrast to the textured stone part. Partially visible in the background toward the right side of the image, there are a series of domed structures that appear to be greenhouses or similar research facilities.\n\nIn the foreground, there are desert plants, including Yucca and possibly some types of cacti or agave, typical of the Arizona landscape. These plants are situated next to the building, likely part of the landscaping, and they add a natural element to the otherwise man-made environment. \n\nThe sky is clear and blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, which is common in the arid regions of Arizona. The overall scene suggests an educational or research setting, dedicated to the study of environmental or earth sciences.","title":"Exterior of the office building of the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
