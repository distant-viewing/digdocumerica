{"path":"554624.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene centered around NL Industries Inc.'s \"MacIntyre Development,\" as indicated by a prominently displayed sign in the foreground. The sign, located on a dark wooden post, includes white text on a black background and invites the public to a \"Visitors Overlook.\"\n\nIn the background, there are several large industrial buildings and structures associated with mining or material processing. These buildings are made of metal and have a somewhat aged appearance, hinting at robust utility rather than aesthetic design. Piles of black material, possibly coal or another mineral, dominate the landscape, underscoring the industrial function of the site.\n\nTo the right side of the image, there's a railroad with a single train car visible, suggesting that the site uses rail transport for shipping materials. The general area is broad and open, with little vegetation, and surrounded by wooded hills that encapsulate the industrial site, creating a secluded environment.\n\nThe photo captures a cloudy day, and the overall ambiance is one of industrial productivity and the intense use of natural resources. The presence of the visitors' sign suggests an attempt to engage or educate the public about the industrial operations at MacIntyre Development.","title":"Sign for NL Industries mine at Tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
