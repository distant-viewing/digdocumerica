{"path":"553375.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a construction or industrial scene set alongside a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The image prominently features several elements related to construction work.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a large concrete-like structure that appears partially covered with a white tarp. On top of this structure, various items are scattered, including what looks like rods or poles, possibly for reinforcement purposes. Next to this structure is a dark item that seems to be a coil of ropes or wires. A makeshift plywood ramp leans against the concrete structure, suggesting it's used to move items or allow access to different levels of the site.\n\nTo the right, a focal point of the scene is a cement mixer, loaded with a mixture, indicating an ongoing or paused mixing operation. There are also buckets, a wheelbarrow, and various smaller tools, likely used for construction purposes, placed around the mixer.\n\nThere are two individuals present in the scene, both dressed casually, one wearing a white t-shirt and the other in a darker colored top, with protective hard hats. They are engaged in what looks like a discussion or planning, standing apart and facing each other, indicative of coordination or supervision activities.\n\nThe natural environment surrounding the construction site appears serene, with a calm body of water and trees leaning over the water’s edge, which contrasts with the industrial activity. The sandy ground and the gentle slope leading to the water suggest a riverbank or lakeside location.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a busy yet organized construction site setup in a picturesque natural setting, highlighting human activity’s interaction with nature.","title":"Water control facilities are being constructed at Nashua jointly assisted by the EPA Water Quality Office and the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["545858","553392","546252","553353","556940","548361","547033","544753","545635","544282","543894","545631","546833","545648","555795","553352"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["construction","site","item","reinforcement","cement","purpose","coordination","tarp","ramp","lakeside"]}
