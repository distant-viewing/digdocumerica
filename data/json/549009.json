{"path":"549009.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic street scene at night, presumably in Las Vegas, characterized by bright and colorful neon signs. A prominent sign in the center reads \"Golden Nugget Gambling Hall,\" adorned with twinkling lights outlining its elegant script and decorative elements. Surrounding it are other signs featuring similar neon lighting, promoting casinos and other establishments, including additional signage for \"Golden Nugget.\"\n\nThe image exhibits motion blur, with streaks and swirls of light stretching across the frame, suggesting a long exposure or a moving camera. This creates an abstract, slightly surreal effect, emphasizing the vitality and high energy typically associated with nightlife in a bustling urban setting. The darkness of the night sky and other environmental elements are overshadowed by the intense artificial lights, making the illuminated signage the focus of the composition. The photograph conveys a sense of action and liveliness, encapsulating a night scene filled with excitement and visual stimulation.","title":"Night lights","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549026","549025","549022","549015","545462","555446","551321","549014","551322","549017","549623","551239","553119","553139","553017","547051"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["night","neon","signage","script","vitality","liveliness","swirl","sign","excitement","streak"]}
