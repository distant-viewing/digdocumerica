{"path":"542677.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a scenic view of a mountainous landscape. The foreground captures dense forests covering the sides of hills, with intricate textures of green foliage. Situated on a crest among these hills are several scientific or astronomical observatories. Key features of these structures include large, white dome-shaped buildings - likely telescopes - alongside taller, slender towers which appear to be antennae or other types of communication or observational equipment.\n\nThe background of the image extends into distant, misty mountains, suggesting vastness and the high altitude of the viewpoint. The skies are clear with a hint of gradient, going from a lighter blue at the horizon to a deeper one at the top, suggesting it might have been taken either in late afternoon or early morning. The overall aura is tranquil yet carries an element of human curiosity and exploration due to the presence of technological installations within a natural setting.","title":"Mt.
