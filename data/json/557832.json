{"path":"557832.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor automotive repair scene. The most prominent object in the image is a dark blue car, likely from the 1970s, with its rear left side and wheel visible in the foreground. Just beyond the car, there is a person lying on the ground, half underneath the vehicle, suggesting that he is likely performing some kind of maintenance or inspection work on the car's undercarriage. The person is dressed in a dark uniform, with legs extended outside and only the upper half of the body visible under the car.\n\nBehind the scene, another vehicle, an older white station wagon, is parked facing the opposite direction. This sets a context of a spacious outdoor area, possibly a parking lot or a similar open area. The ground is paved, and there are visible lines indicating parking spots. Also noticeable are orange traffic cones, suggesting an area designated for specific use, possibly related to vehicle servicing.\n\nThe background is lined with lush green trees, indicating a suburban or park-like setting, which contrasts with the man-made elements of the scene. The atmosphere is bright, indicating daytime, and the overall composition of the photo suggests a focus on everyday activities and work related to vehicle upkeep.","title":"Employee at the Hamilton County Auto Emission Inspection Station at Newtown, Ohio, checks the exhaust system under the car for leaks.
