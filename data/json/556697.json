{"path":"556697.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a crowded scene inside a subway station. The image shows a multitude of people, likely commuters, densely packed and navigating an escalator and the surrounding area. The lighting appears dim yet focuses on the center and the escalator area, where the bulk of the people are situated.\n\nMost individuals are dressed in coats and attire that suggest it could be a cooler season, with colors ranging from dark to medium tones â€“ typical for a working-class ensemble from the mid to late 20th century. The presence of both men and women of various ages is noticeable, and the expressions range from neutral to slightly weary, possibly reflecting the fatigue often associated with commuting or the end of a workday.\n\nAbove the crowded escalator, the subway station's tiled walls and utilitarian structures are noticeable. There is a griminess that hints at the high traffic and urban setting. Overall, the photograph portrays a slice of urban life, emphasizing the daily routine and crowded conditions experienced by city dwellers during their public transit commutes.","title":"Subway passengers ride escalators from New York city transit authority trains to the surface on their way to work.  There has been a decrease in ridership since 1960.  At that time the subway handled 2.2 million people a day, which was 51 percent of the work force.  In 1970 the number had decreased to 2.1 million per day and 47 percent of the work force.  The system is of crucial importance to the city, but voters have refused to okay more improvements or a fare increase","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551880","549904","551885","556696","556818","556823","556815","556819","556820","556821","551884","551883","551886","551890","551879","556682"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","dweller","station","ti","working","ensemble","commuting","workday","commute","bulk"]}
