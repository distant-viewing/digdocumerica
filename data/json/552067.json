{"path":"552067.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures an environmental scene where a dead fish is partially submerged in murky water. The fish, which appears pale and decomposing, floats near the surface, highlighting a distressing water pollution issue. Sparkling particles, possibly pollutants or organic matter, are visible within the water and on the surface, adding to the somber tone of the image.\n\nThe foreground shows a section of wet, muddy ground that appears textured, possibly slippery due to the moisture. This mud bank is covered in small shimmering particles, indicating either moisture or some form of contamination. The overall scene is dark and foreboding, reflecting a negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem, likely due to pollution or environmental neglect.\n\nThe photograph serves as a stark, visual representation of environmental degradation, emphasizing the urgent need for attention to water bodies and their ecosystems.","title":"Suffocated fish are a frequent sight at the inner city viaduct area where the Kansas river joins the Missouri river.
