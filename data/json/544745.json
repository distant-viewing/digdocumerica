{"path":"544745.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a breathtaking view of a rugged and expansive landscape that is likely a section of a desert canyon or a similar geological formation. The foreground shows intricately patterned terrain with various shades of greys, blues, and subtle hues of earthy colors, which create a layered effect. These layers look like sedimentary rock formations, shaped and eroded over millennia. \n\nThe midground prominently features larger, steep rock formations colored in richer shades of red and orange, which contrast with the softer tones of the sedimentary layers below. The textures and lines on these formations suggest a combination of erosion processes at work, perhaps from wind and water.\n\nThe background reveals elevated plateaus and cliff edges under a clear, bright sky. These high formations frame the scene and give a deep sense of the scale and the untouched nature of the landscape. The clarity and brightness of the sky suggest the photograph might have been taken during daylight hours with good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a sense of vastness and the enduring power of natural geological processes, showcasing a dramatic and untouched wilderness that is both ancient and imposing.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545799","545761","545802","545696","545800","545805","545750","545792","544392","545775","545783","544950","545790","543838","545804","545806"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["formation","millennium","plateaus","process","layer","rock","canyon","brightness","shade","clarity"]}
