{"path":"550584.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a small town laid out adjacent to a winding river. A prominent, straight road dissects the landscape vertically, lined by assorted buildings that suggest a settled, communal area. To the right of this road, the town expands with various structures like a church with a red steeple, visible residential houses, and possibly some commercial buildings, all interspersed with areas of greenery.\n\nOn the left side of the road, near the top of the image, there is a large area displaying exposed soil or sandy ground, which stretches towards the river. This part of the river appears wide but shallow, with extensive sandy banks. Surrounding the town and beyond the limits of the community are dense forests, highlighting the town's remote setting.\n\nIn the background, a rainbow arches down towards the earth, adding a colorful element to the largely natural and earth-toned palette of the scene. The sky, while mostly out of frame, hints at cloudy or post-rain conditions which likely led to the appearance of the rainbow.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, onlooked from a high vantage point, captures both the isolation and the integration of human settlement within a natural landscape, underscored by the serene presence of the rainbow suggesting a moment of tranquility or recovery after a storm.","title":"Delta junction, view north.
