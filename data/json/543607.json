{"path":"543607.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, damp forest scene, primarily featuring a slender, leafless tree in the foreground. The tree's branches, devoid of foliage, are dotted with small water droplets, suggesting recent rainfall or morning dew. Each droplet is meticulously captured, reflecting light and adding a delicate, sparkling effect against the subdued, moody background.\n\nBehind the focal tree, the forest appears dense and somewhat shadowy, filled with similar bare, vertical tree trunks, primarily in muted tones of gray and brown. Some trees in the background still retain clusters of dark evergreen needles, offering a subtle contrast to the predominantly dormant deciduous trees.\n\nThe ground is uneven and partially covered with what appears to be a thin layer of snow or frost, enhancing the cold and moist atmosphere of the setting. The forest floor is also strewn with fallen branches and leaves, contributing to the natural, untamed character of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition creates an intimate focus on the interaction between light and water on the tree, set against a hauntingly quiet and somewhat gloomy forest backdrop. The photograph captures the essence of a cold, wet day in a forest, emphasizing textures and the quietude of nature.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["542929","543560","557596","553579","554989","554961","542932","557601","555008","554998","553574","554976","557019","542958","555122","554984"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","droplet","tree","delicate","evergreen","frost","sparkl","dew","branch","retain"]}
