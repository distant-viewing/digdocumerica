{"path":"543578.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic scene of a cascading waterfall surrounded by a dense forest. The waterfall, composed of multiple tiers, flows vigorously over rocky terrains, creating white frothy water as it hits the rocks and divides into various streams. The water appears lively and is the central focus of the image, with light catching and highlighting the mist and foam generated by the falls.\n\nThe surrounding environment features tall coniferous trees, primarily pine trees, that stand stark against the brightly lit sky. These trees are dark and silhouetted, accentuating the natural ruggedness and wild beauty of the landscape. The interplay of light and shadow is dramatic, with the trees largely in shadow and the waterfall illuminated by sunlight, lending a contrasting and almost mystical quality to the scene.\n\nThe high contrast in the photograph emphasizes the texture and movement of the water, while the forest provides a dark frame that draws attention back to the white, sparkling water. The overall composition presents a sense of untouched wilderness and natural power, typical of a forested mountain region, likely in a national park or a similar preserved natural area.","title":"Fallen leaf falls","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["554408","555220","558087","545878","550697","545874","545839","554409","545882","555699","544456","550843","554113","555073","542698","542594"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","forest","tier","hit","generate","ruggedness","preserve","tree","cascade","foam"]}
