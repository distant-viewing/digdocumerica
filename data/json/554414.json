{"path":"554414.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in the process of cutting a log with a chainsaw. The man, wearing a grey long-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and heavy-duty boots, is shown from the side as he leans forward to maneuver the chainsaw through the thick log. He has donned a yellow hard hat for safety, which shields his head. The activity creates wood chips that scatter across the scene, illustrating the intensity of the work.\n\nThe man is standing atop a pile of large logs, suggesting that he is in a logging area or a wood-processing site. The background features dimly visible, dense green trees, indicating that the location is in or near a forest. The overcast sky contributes to the subdued lighting of the scene, emphasizing the raw and natural environment of his work setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a moment of laborious woodcutting, capturing both the physical effort involved and the rustic, wooded surroundings.","title":"Lumberjack from Tupper Lake cutting logs into eight foot sections for loading.
