{"path":"553131.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a visually intriguing scene with multiple layers of perspective and texture. In the foreground, a large blue, weathered metal structure, possibly a wall or barrier, dominates the view. This structure features various panels bolted together with visible rust and erosion marking its surface. There is a horizontal gap near the bottom section of the wall, providing a framed view of what lies behind.\n\nThrough this gap, the middle ground reveals a bright red pickup truck parked adjacent to a wooden construction or storage area filled with piled lumber. This suggests that the setting might be a construction site or an industrial area. The contrast between the rustic blue of the metal in the foreground and the vivid red of the truck creates a strong visual interest.\n\nBeyond this immediate scene, in the background, the photograph extends to a sweeping landscape of snow-covered mountains under a clear sky. This distant view adds a majestic and serene quality, contrasting sharply with the industrial elements in the foreground.\n\nOverall, this composition layers industrial human activity in the form of construction against the natural beauty of a mountainous landscape, employing the textural decay of the foreground structure against the crisp and clean lines of the distant mountains.","title":"Along I-80, outside Reno","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["543769","543687","544699","557340","555875","543725","554807","543173","548135","543109","552349","554561","552159","545739","545623","543826"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["gap","construction","truck","lumber","wall","pickup","mountain","metal","view","rust"]}
