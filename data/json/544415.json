{"path":"544415.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and textured landscape of sand dunes. The foreground is dominated by fine sand ridges forming natural patterns, likely shaped by wind. The sand's surface exhibits a series of small, wavy ridges and troughs running parallel across the image, emphasizing the effects of natural elements on the landscape. Scattered around the sand are sporadic tufts of dry, sparse vegetation, likely hardy plants adapted to the harsh, arid environment.\n\nIn the distance, the horizon is marked by a striking contrast between the natural scene in the foreground and the hints of industrialization. A factory or plant with several tall chimneys is visible, discharging emissions into the sky. This introduces a juxtaposition of nature versus human impact, evoking a sense of intrusion into a natural landscape.\n\nThe overall tone of the photograph is a bit somber, with muted colors ranging from deep browns to grayish blues in the sky. There's an overcast ambiance, suggesting either dawn or dusk due to the soft, diffused light. The sky also contains what appears to be a pale moon, adding a tranquil yet melancholic touch to the scene.\n\nThis photo could be commenting on the encroachment of industrialization on natural spaces, highlighting environmental concerns or the persistent spread of human activity into remote areas.","title":"The empty desert","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548230","545203","550490","543097","545199","549191","543160","548906","545207","554804","547717","545200","554817","555883","548968","544374"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["sand","industrialization","ridge","tuft","trough","moon","encroachment","intrusion","dune","spread"]}
