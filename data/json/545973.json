{"path":"545973.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image depicts three young boys on an unusual, three-wheeled cycle, riding down a gravel road by a river. The boy in the front is pedaling the cycle and holds the handlebars. He is wearing a bright orange jacket, a blue shirt underneath, and khaki pants. The two boys sitting behind him are perched on a seat attached to the rear of the cycle. The boy on the left wears a dark jacket and pants, while the one on the right wears a collared jacket and khaki pants much like the boy in front.\n\nThe setting is rich in natural beauty, with a calm river visible on the right side of the photo, reflecting a clear blue sky. Tall trees draped with Spanish moss stand prominently along the riverbank, contributing to a serene, southern marsh-like environment. A pair of green boats are partially visible docked on the calm water near the tree line. The background sky is clear and blue, making for a sunny day that casts well-defined shadows of the boys and their cycle on the gravel road.","title":"Children of fishermen on homemade tricycle","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["543719","543715","551032","547209","544432","545972","545965","544805","547241","555499","551003","544680","546967","550069","544221","545961"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cycle","boy","khaki","gravel","jacket","pant","pedal","handlebar","marsh","front"]}
