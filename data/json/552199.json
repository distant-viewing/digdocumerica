{"path":"552199.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a large industrial logging area. Numerous logs are neatly organized in parallel rows, creating an intricate pattern of natural wood textures. The logs are grouped into various stacks and appear to be segregated possibly based on size or type. Between these rows are patches of water, reflecting some parts of the logs and adding a contrasting element to the earthy tones of the timber.\n\nThere is a dirt road running diagonally across the image, which cuts through the log storage area, suggesting a way for vehicles to move within the site. The overall mood of the photo is dominated by natural colors, including browns, blues from the water, and greyish dirt tracks. The setting appears to be in a vast open space, possibly near a body of water, given the presence of water amongst the logs.\n\nThe composition focuses on the large-scale industrial processing of timber, depicting a scene devoid of visible human presence but emphasizing the impact and organization of human activity in natural resource management.","title":"Cold deck log storage near Olympia.
