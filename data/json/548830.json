{"path":"548830.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and dynamic scene of cattle herding on a dusty rural road, evoking a strong essence of traditional ranching life. In the foreground, a cowboy mounted on a horse leads the way. He is dressed in typical Western attire including a cowboy hat, a plaid shirt, and jeans, suggesting his role as a rancher or cattle herder.\n\nBehind the cowboy extends a large herd of cattle, predominantly comprised of various shades and patterns, including whites, browns, and blacks. The cattle are spread across the width of the road and beyond, kicking up dust that creates a hazy, atmospheric effect. This thick dust partially obscures the cattle and additional riders or herders in the background, enhancing the sense of movement and the vast number of animals being handled.\n\nThe setting is a flat, open landscape under a clear sky, which underscores the rural, unenclosed terrain typical of some ranching regions. The road diminishes into the horizon at the center of the frame, guided by faint traces of power lines barely visible through the dust haze.\n\nThe image is imbued with a sense of traditional pastoral activity, emphasizing themes of livestock management and the enduring culture of cattle ranching. The composition, with its leading lines (the road) and the spread of the herd across the frame, effectively conveys the scale of the operation and the dusty conditions typical of such environments.","title":"Moving cattle raise dust along the highway--near calipatria in the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548878","548829","548828","549033","553104","543776","548838","552565","552698","543634","553105","553110","554128","543779","553814","553100"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["cattle","herd","ranching","cowboy","road","dust","leading","spread","diminish","enduring"]}
