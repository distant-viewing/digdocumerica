{"path":"545110.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph is a vibrant coastal landscape featuring a cluster of buildings nestled along a steep, wooded cliff overlooking the ocean. The point of view is from a high vantage point, possibly from a hill above the road that curves along the bottom edge of the image. This road is bordered by a metal barrier and surrounded by lush green trees and shrubs, indicating a rich, natural environment.\n\nThe coastline stretches into the distance with the ocean appearing calm and a deep shade of blue, reflecting the clear sky above. The beach is visible in the far distance as a narrow strip of lighter color along the water's edge.\n\nIn the middle ground, a group of white buildings with dark roofs is prominently situated on the headland. The architecture suggests residential homes or possibly holiday villas, positioned to provide panoramic views of the surrounding sea. These buildings are surrounded by patches of grassy areas, some trees, and smaller vegetation, softening the transition between the man-made structures and the rugged cliff faces.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the vibrant natural colors and serene setting, invokes a sense of peacefulness and scenic beauty, typical of coastal hillside communities.","title":"Condominiums on Otter Rock Beach","placename":"Otter Rock (Or.)","location":"Otter Rock, Oregon","nn1":["543340","557429","557523","543337","543426","543427","554102","545222","543437","543362","557453","543184","557524","543291","545226","557482"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","holiday","point","peacefulness","strip","edge","hillside","road","coastline"]}
