{"path":"543053.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal environment, where natural and man-made elements blend together against a backdrop of vibrant blue skies. On the left side, a large rocky cliff rises steeply, covered at the top with lush evergreen trees. This cliff casts a dramatic shadow over the sandy beach below.\n\nA substantial wooden pier extends from the base of the cliff into the calm bay, aligned towards a channel that directs the viewer's eye towards distant hills on the horizon. The pier seems aged but sturdy, navigating over both the beach and entering into the water, leading to an undefined point in the distance.\n\nThe beach itself is dotted with debris, including driftwoods and possibly washed-up seaweed, suggesting recent high tides or storm activity. The sand curves around the inlet, bordered by another cliff on the right, which mirrors the left in its steepness and dense tree coverage.\n\nIn the water, several small boats are anchored, spaced out across the bay. The calmness of the water suggests a quiet day with minimal wind. The overall atmosphere of the scene is peaceful, with elements of rustic and untouched natural beauty, giving an impression of a secluded hideaway far from urban environments.","title":"Trinidad harbor at low tide","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543080","554102","544284","543362","542870","543299","545081","545222","543297","543068","553765","543289","543361","545122","545132","547602"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","beach","bay","pier","seaweed","inlet","coverage","driftwood","tide","storm"]}
