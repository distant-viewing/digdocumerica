{"path":"546928.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene at a beach, likely taken on a hazy or slightly overcast day. The primary setting is a sandy beach crowded with people engaging in various leisure activities.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple groups of people can be seen. Some are seated on the sand, lounging or interacting with each other, while others are standing or walking around. There is a mixture of adults and children, all casually dressed in typical beachwear such as swimsuits and shorts. On the left, thereâ€™s a notable sign indicating that the beach is protected by lifeguards during specific hours (10 AM - 6 PM).\n\nIn the midground, a central focus is a lifeguard station where one lifeguard is seated high on a chair, supervising the area, and another stands beneath him on the platform. This adds a sense of safety and oversight to the scene.\n\nFurther in the background, the atmosphere gets misty, likely due to the weather or distance, making the details less discernible. A significant feature in the background is a long, arched bridge spanning across the water, adding a structural and somewhat industrial element contrasting with the natural beach setting.\n\nThis photograph seems to epitomize a typical busy day at a public beach, filled with activity and underscored by a sense of communal enjoyment and relaxation near the water.","title":"On the beach at Sandy Point State Park.
