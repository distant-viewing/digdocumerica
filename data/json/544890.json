{"path":"544890.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph showcases a cluster of vibrant, orange-petaled flowers rising prominently in the foreground against a harsh desert landscape. The flowers, which have a bulbous shape and are connected to tall, thin green stems dotted with small green leaves, add a bright splash of color to the otherwise arid environment. Each flower radiates under the sunlight, suggesting an adaptation to harsh sunny conditions.\n\nThe background is dominated by a mostly flat, expansive desert setting. The ground is covered in sandy soil that takes on a reddish or dusty pink hue. Sparse vegetation is visible further back in the scene, consisting mainly of low shrubs or grasses scattered across the landscape. The sky is clear and notably vast, hinting at the open, undeveloped nature of this arid region. The overall composition of the photograph highlights the stark contrast between the delicate beauty of the flowers and the ruggedness of their surroundings.","title":"Orange mallow - showy desert flowers","placename":"Green River (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545722","549018","545727","544879","545718","544885","544875","544894","544934","545723","545717","544891","555186","545562","544877","544582"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","desert","adaptation","ruggedness","splash","shrub","cluster","soil","shape","leave"]}
