{"path":"547272.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph presents a high-angle view taken from inside a helicopter, overlooking a wide river and a bridge with multiple lanes of traffic. The vantage point is just above the cockpit of the helicopter, where parts of the dashboard and the edge of the open cockpit window are visible. A pilot's gloved hand grasps part of the helicopter, indicating this could be either a moment of maneuver or simply a stable holding position.\n\nThe bridge stretches across the frame horizontally, dividing the river and the riverbanks. The river itself reflects sunlight, causing the water to shimmer and creating a stark contrast with the bridge and its orderly flow of vehicles. The bridge appears to carry a moderate amount of traffic with cars and trucks in various lanes, suggesting a typical day with clear weather.\n\nBeyond the bridge, the landscape opens into a flat, somewhat developed area with patches of greenery, buildings, and other infrastructure. The backdrop includes a clear sky with minimal clouds, emphasizing the brightness of the day.\n\nThis image captures a dynamic blend of technology (the helicopter), human activity (traffic on the bridge), and natural elements (the river and open landscape), all under the luminous expanse of the sky. It portrays a sense of oversight and control, as well as the intersection of human constructions and nature.","title":"View from a helicopter: light traffic on the 14th street bridge between the district and Virginia","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549469","546581","546724","548401","558049","558051","546569","546704","546689","556951","555758","547703","552846","555727","548344","549547"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["helicopter","bridge","cockpit","traffic","river","lane","oversight","pilot","grasp","dashboard"]}
