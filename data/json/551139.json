{"path":"551139.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic overview of a city skyline, framed by natural elements. The focal point of the image is a group of buildings, among which a high-rise building stands out prominently, labeled \"Charleston National.\" This suggests that the photograph was taken in Charleston. Adjacent to this are smaller buildings including another prominent one with the \"C&P Telephone\" logo, along with various other commercial and residential structures that appear typical of an urban downtown area.\n\nThe background features a dense, wooded hill which suggests that the city is likely situated in a valley or near a range of hills. The perspective is from a higher vantage point, possibly from another hill across the city, which provides a clear view over the buildings towards this natural backdrop. In the foreground, the photograph is framed by out-of-focus tree branches and leaves, adding depth and emphasizing the interplay between urban and natural environments. The lighting in the image suggests it was taken during the day under clear and bright conditions, highlighting the structures vividly against the greenery.","title":"Downtown Charleston seen from Swathmore Avenue on a hazy afternoon","placename":"Charleston (W.
