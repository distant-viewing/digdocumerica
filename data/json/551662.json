{"path":"551662.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This image depicts an urban plaza surrounded by high-rise buildings. The focus of the photograph is a large, abstract geometric sculpture positioned centrally in the frame. The sculpture appears to consist of two major elements, each a white beam that diagonally intersects with the other, creating a dynamic and imposing structure against the backdrop of the city's architecture.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an individual looking up at the sculpture. This person is wearing light-colored clothing, which contrasts with the darker, more formal tones of the surrounding cityscape. The plaza is spacious, with a flat surface that reflects some light, suggesting it might be made of stone or concrete.\n\nThe background features several tall buildings with a variety of windows, which add to the dense urban feel of the setting. There are also smaller human figures visible in the mid-ground, some seated around the plaza, suggesting a casual, perhaps leisurely atmosphere among the busy city environment.\n\nAbove the sculpture and buildings, the sky is visible and appears clear, adding brightness to the scene and emphasizing the height and form of the sculpture amidst its urban surroundings.","title":"Sundial.
