{"path":"555360.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a greenhouse where agricultural research or cultivation is taking place. A man, presumably a scientist or a farmer, is examining tall tomato plants laden with fruit. The plants are suspended from the ceiling by strings, forming a dense green curtain of leaves and tomatoes. Some of the tomatoes are ripe, while others are still green.\n\nThe man is middle-aged, wearing glasses, a short-sleeved, button-down shirt, and dark pants. He is focused on the plants, reaching out to touch or possibly evaluate one of the tomatoes.\n\nIn the background, we can see the interior of the greenhouse, characterized by a framework supporting the transparent roofing material, which allows natural light to fill the space. The floor appears to be soil or dirt, consistent with greenhouse flooring designed for plant cultivation. A white sign with some black text is partially visible, possibly detailing information about the tomato plants or the research parameters, indicating that this is a controlled and monitored environment for plant growth. The overall setting suggests a professional approach to agriculture, emphasizing productivity and the health of the plants.","title":"View of tomatoes inside one of the solar greenhouses at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
