{"path":"547105.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene yet stark winter scene along a shoreline. In the foreground is a roughly constructed wooden shack, taking center stage. The shack is built predominantly from raw and mismatched wooden planks; it features an angular, leaning roof and is partially open to the elements, with no visible door and an unglazed square window. The structure is placed on a ground that is littered with small rocks, tree limbs, and a mix of snow and dirt, suggesting a rugged environment.\n\nThe background showcases a frozen beach stretching alongside a body of water, which appears turbulent with breaking waves that hint at cold and windy weather conditions. The ice and snow covering indicates it is winter. The sky is overcast, with grey clouds providing a moody atmosphere to the landscape. On the left side, leafless trees line the edge of the beach, enhancing the sense of a desolate and chilly winter shoreline.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a sense of isolation and the harshness of a winter by the sea, highlighted by the simple, makeshift structure which stands alone against the natural elements.","title":"Children's playhouse at Ft.
