{"path":"554517.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and picturesque outdoor scene featuring five individuals engaged in activities on a wooden dock that extends into a lake surrounded by lush, steep mountains. The setting is tranquil and natural, epitomizing a classic outdoor excursion.\n\nOn the left, there are two individuals, a tall male teenager and a young girl, both positioned with their backs to the camera, gazing out over the lake and mountains. The teenager is wearing a striped shirt and jeans, while the girl is dressed in a plaid shirt and checked trousers.\n\nTowards the center, another younger man, presumably in his twenties, stands slightly turned from the camera, appearing in profile. He is wearing a light blue shirt and dark pants. Nearby, an older man with short hair, dressed in a blue work shirt and dark trousers, is actively engaging in fishing; he holds a fishing rod with his focus directed towards the lake.\n\nOn the far right, closest to the camera, a young child in a vibrant red top and blue shorts is sitting and playing on the dock. This child is flanked by a man (possibly his father), who is also fishing and seems to be instructing or assisting the child. There are a few objects around them, such as a tackle box and a pair of shoes, enhancing the casual, recreational feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by imposing mountain ranges covered with dense forests, reflecting off the surface of the calm, dark water of the lake, which fills most of the middle distance in the composition. The clarity and tranquility of this natural setting, combined with the human element of familial and recreational activity, offer a glimpse into a moment of peaceful coexistence with nature.","title":"Family fishing from dock at Cascade Pond near Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554516","546800","543164","552029","549935","542564","543516","550827","550776","552283","546941","554552","548737","544274","552982","542740"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["teenager","lake","child","girl","mountain","trouser","camera","shirt","fishing","father"]}
