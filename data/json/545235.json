{"path":"545235.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of a large body of water with floating log rafts. These neatly organized log rafts form several curved patterns across the surface of the water. In the background, there's a majestic mountain with a snow-capped peak, likely indicating volcanic activity, which dominates the skyline. The scene is further complemented by various industrial structures and ships along the distant shore, suggesting a bustling port area. The foreground of the image features lush greenery which partially frames the top part of this picturesque scene. The overall composition blends natural beauty with industrial activity, creating a striking contrast between the serene mountain in the distance and the active, developed waterfront.","title":"At the mouth of the contaminated Puyallup River.
