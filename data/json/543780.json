{"path":"543780.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a young child interacting with a medium-sized, light-colored dog in the outdoors. The child, who appears to be a young boy with short blonde hair, wears a horizontally striped shirt in shades of orange, red, and white, paired with dark pants. He is bending slightly at the waist, extending his arms toward the dog in a gentle, playing gesture. The dog, seeming to be in motion, has its head turned slightly towards the child, which suggests a friendly interaction.\n\nThe setting is a dusty gravel road, lined on one side by a wooden fence which is partially in disrepair. The road stretches into the background towards a softer-focused rural landscape that features rolling hills and sparse vegetation, indicative of a rugged countryside. The lighting is bright, hinting at a sunny day that casts distinct shadows on the ground.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a spontaneous moment of connection and play between the boy and the dog, in a serene, rustic environment.","title":"Ranch scene","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["547106","553526","554126","554497","551123","557637","543040","553064","545972","543784","558189","543485","543678","552674","543390","545218"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["dog","child","boy","waist","countryside","gesture","disrepair","gravel","road","connection"]}
