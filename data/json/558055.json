{"path":"558055.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large highway intersection surrounded by various landscapes, showcasing rural and industrial elements. The image captures four significant converging roads: a divided highway that stretches vertically through the scene, another intersecting horizontally, and additional looping off-ramps and on-ramps that create a cloverleaf pattern facilitating the flow of traffic between different directions.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the highways, there are patches of wooded areas with a variety of trees showing early fall colors, primarily greens with hints of red and orange. To the left of the photograph, the residential area includes a few scattered houses surrounded by lawns and small roads leading up to the properties.\n\nZooming towards the center-right of the image is a large industrial or commercial facility featuring several tall, grey or white grain silos, which dominate the rural landscape. Adjacent to this are vast open storage areas and possibly smaller buildings related to the facility, set amidst large, open fields.\n\nThe background is flanked by further expanses of fields, patches of forest, and distant properties, all under a broad horizon that suggests a clear sky with ample daylight, enhancing visibility and giving the photograph a serene overtone. The image not only highlights infrastructure and transportation but also subtly underscores the integration of human activity with natural and cultivated landscapes.","title":"Aerial view of the Ohio Turnpike running left to right in the foreground. The parallel road nearest the coliseum is Ohio Highway 303; to its left is Interstate 271. The coliseum, located south of Cleveland, Ohio, is located just west of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. It contains 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land in a 20-mile stretch of the valley between the metropolitan districts of Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553947","553944","544642","551205","546733","552719","558049","546714","547770","553015","547762","548092","548827","546709","546721","546612"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["ramp","highway","property","integration","facility","grain","field","silo","intersection","vicinity"]}
