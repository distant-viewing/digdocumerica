{"path":"548109.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of scrap metal under an overcast sky. The heap consists of various types of discarded metal objects, including parts of vehicles, machinery, and other metallic debris. Prominent in the foreground are elements like a large, cylindrical tank and a rusted car door, indicative of the general theme of abandonment and decay that characterizes the scene.\n\nThe elements are predominantly rusted and worn, showcasing various shades of brown, red, and metallic gray, creating a textured and chaotic scene. The composition of the photograph is dynamic, with the pile of scrap metal occupying most of the frame, suggesting the vastness and overwhelming scale of the waste.\n\nThe background features a somewhat cloudy sky, which provides a muted backdrop that contrasts with the harsh, tangled forms of the metal debris. This juxtaposition emphasizes the industrial and forsaken nature of the scene, giving it a somber and possibly reflective quality regarding environmental or economic themes.","title":"Heap of scrap metal at the American Ship Dismantling Division on the Willamette River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["554300","554346","554318","554357","554301","548147","547625","552740","542585","547611","548753","547610","557308","544831","545010","554320"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["scrap","metal","pile","theme","debris","heap","gray","abandonment","waste","vastness"]}
