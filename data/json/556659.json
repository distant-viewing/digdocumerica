{"path":"556659.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures an individual seated on a subway train, immersed in reading a newspaper. The person, whose gender is indiscernible due to their position and the lack of visible identifying features, is dressed in a tan or beige trench coat and is seated with their back slightly turned towards the camera. They hold an open newspaper, where the visible headline reads \"Goodbye winter hello baseball.\" The individual is surrounded by multiple shopping bags placed at their feet, suggesting a possible return from shopping or running errands.\n\nThe image shows a single subway car with no other passengers visible in the immediate vicinity, giving a sense of solitude or isolation. The interior of the subway car is modestly decorated: the seat upholstery is red, and the walls are a muted shade of green. Above the person, there is an advertisement poster featuring an offer related to car loans, and various objects like jumper cables, a car battery, and other automotive items are depicted in the ad. On the adjacent wall, by the subway car's door, there is another advertisement and signs that might be metro operational notices.\n\nThe subway car doors are closed, and through the rectangular window of the subway door, one can't discern much outside view other than a vague reflection. The lighting within the subway is somewhat dim, giving a slightly subdued ambiance to the scene. Overall, the photograph conveys a moment of everyday life within the public transit system, emphasizing solitude and personal engagement amidst the public nature of the setting.","title":"Lexington Avenue Lines subway passenger passes the time by reading a newspaper. Graffiti defaces the wall behind his head. Transit police arrested more than 1,400 graffiti offenders in 1973, and more than 2,000 in 1974. Even though the New York City Transit Authority has a constant program of maintenance and repainting, there are very few cars in operation that are not defaced.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556662","554370","556698","556665","556691","553823","548260","556666","548273","556811","556780","556661","556675","554326","556669","548255"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","car","shopping","newspaper","door","advertisement","seat","headline","ad","solitude"]}
