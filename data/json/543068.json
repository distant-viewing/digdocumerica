{"path":"543068.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal seascape, highlighting the rugged beauty typical of such terrains. The scene is illuminated by a soft, subdued light, possibly during early morning or late afternoon, which casts gentle reflections across the water's surface and emphasizes the silhouettes of various landscape elements.\n\nIn the foreground on the left side, there's an outline of a steep, forested cliff adorned predominantly with what appear to be coniferous trees, suggesting a cool climate area. The cliff gently disappears into the background, enveloping the coastline in a natural frame.\n\nDominating the middle ground is a series of rocky outcroppings or sea stacks scattered across the shoreline and partially submerged in the sea. These formations vary in size and shape, creating an interesting visual texture and depth to the composition. The rocks closest to the viewpoint are significantly larger and more pronounced, with one in particular featuring a keyhole or arch-like structure, making it a focal point amidst the generally rounded shapes.\n\nThe background extends into a haze, merging with the sky and obscuring the details of distant landforms, which seem to be rolling hills or low mountains, hinting at a continuous rugged terrain beyond the immediate coastal area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is tranquil, with the expanse of water reflecting light and adding a sense of vastness and quiet majesty to the scene. The color palette is predominantly composed of blues, grays, and greens, reinforcing the natural and somewhat moody aesthetic of the photograph.","title":"Volcanic rocks rise from ocean.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545173","543060","542917","543080","545130","545122","557508","543090","543297","543289","543025","543291","544985","553805","543061","550361"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","outcropping","sea","disappear","majesty","landform","shape","seascape","merge","viewpoint"]}
