{"path":"552351.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of multiple sailboats scattered across a dark water surface. The sunlight reflects off the small ripples and waves in the water, giving it a sparkling texture. Each sailboat appears small from this perspective and features colorful sails in various patterns such as red, white, blue, and combinations thereof.\n\nThese sailboats are oriented in different directions, suggesting a casual or recreational sailing activity rather than a structured race. The overall setting is peaceful and serene, with no visible signs of land or other objects â€“ only the vast expanse of water and the tiny, colorful sailboats navigating through it.\n\nThe composition of the photograph cleverly uses the contrast between the dark water and the brightly colored sails to draw attention to the sailboats, emphasizing their isolation and the vastness of the surrounding water. The image provides a sense of scale and the tranquil atmosphere commonly associated with sailing in open waters.","title":"Sailboats at sunset on spinnaker run in race on Commencement Bay, Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552352","552353","551540","552355","547781","543305","543936","544021","544669","552345","543059","548498","544663","544697","549424","555785"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","water","race","sailing","combination","direction","ripple","vastness","wave"]}
