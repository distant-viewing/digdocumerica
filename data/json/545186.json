{"path":"545186.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of numerous small, brown clams held gently in a person's hands, which appear weathered and stained from working. The clams have a textured, ridged surface typical of many bivalves, and are presented in an array of brown and beige tones. In the background and to the side, many more similar clams are visible, scattered casually over what appears to be a teal metal surface with perforations, possibly a part of a sorting or processing equipment. The image is vividly detailed, capturing the shiny, moist surface of the clams which suggests they are fresh and possibly still wet from their marine or river environment. This setting suggests a scene from seafood harvesting or processing, highlighting the manual aspect of gathering marine life.","title":"Jack Wiegardt, owner of Northwest Oyster Farm, Inc., grows cherrystone clams and oysters from seed in trays.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552307","546279","545082","545079","552305","552880","545190","546365","543916","552866","546289","545189","546297","545181","545182","545310"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["processing","seafood","teal","harvesting","surface","stain","sort","shot","aspect","gather"]}
