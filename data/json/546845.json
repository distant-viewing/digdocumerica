{"path":"546845.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene involving several tugboats maneuvering a large ship in what appears to be a harbor or river setting. Three tugboats, each marked clearly with names—“SAINT PORT,” “KINGS POINT II,” and “KINGS POINT”—are visible assisting a significantly larger red and black ship. The tugboats show robust, compact structures typical of such vessels, designed for high maneuverability and power. The larger ship's hull towers above the water with visible decking, and it's rusty, suggesting that it is well-used and perhaps engaged in heavy industrial or cargo transport.\n\nThe water around the vessels is choppy, indicating either windy conditions or the turbulence created by the operation of the boats themselves. The presence of seagulls flying and hovering in the distant background adds a natural element to the scene, suggesting an outdoor, coastal environment.\n\nThe background is less distinct but gives the impression of an overcast day; the colors in the image are somewhat muted, which might be an attribute of the weather or the photographic technology or settings used. The photograph provides a vivid depiction of industrial maritime activity, highlighting the coordination between tugboats during navigation or docking procedures.","title":"The launching of the new tanker, \"chevron Hawaii\" from the sparrows point shipyard.
