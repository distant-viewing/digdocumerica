{"path":"553564.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a rugged and forested landscape. The prominent colors in the image are shades of dark green and brown, suggestive of dense tree coverage. Some areas of the forest appear to be lighter in color, possibly indicating different types of vegetation or effects of sunlight. The terrain is hilly and undulating with visible ridges and valleys suggesting a mountainous region. In the distance, the landscape levels off into flatter, less densely forested areas which fade into the horizon under a clear blue sky. There are no visible structures or people; the image purely captures natural scenery. The perspective is high above the ground, indicating that the photo might have been taken from an aircraft. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, emphasizing the vastness and natural beauty of the wilderness.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora burn area \"Granite Fire\" seen from the air.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["550578","553567","556906","555677","553570","550642","550541","550643","550538","557003","550566","550629","556931","542821","555698","542843"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["coverage","dark","aircraft","ridge","scenery","valley","wilderness","vastness","type","effect"]}
