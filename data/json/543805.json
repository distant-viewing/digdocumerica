{"path":"543805.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph focuses on the close-up of a clear needle-like object, presumably a medical syringe, positioned vertically against a softly blurred pink and cream background. The syringe's tip is capped by a rounded transparency, possibly a protective cover or droplet, reflecting a focused light creating a subtle glow.\n\nThe cylindrical body of the syringe appears somewhat transparent, showcasing internal specks and potential residue, indicating prior use or contents. The most eye-catching feature includes significant magnification of these details, such as air bubbles and minuscule particles caught within the syringe's shaft, suggesting a well-used or long-stored condition.\n\nAt the base of the clear section near the syringe tip, there appears to be a mechanical component, possibly plunger mechanics or seal components, emphasizing the intricate workings inside.\n\nThe setting does not reveal any specific location or environment attributes, reinforcing a clinical or isolated focus on the syringe itself. The soft background colors contrast with the sharp, clinical details of the syringe, focusing all attention on the object at the center.","title":"Raw sewage before treatment at plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["546326","546269","552385","546282","548860","542737","546283","546327","543834","555841","548861","555374","546344","548998","551360","555253"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["tip","component","shaft","bubble","working","mechanic","residue","particle","speck","droplet"]}
