{"path":"554659.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant marina scene, likely taken during the autumn season, given the foliage on the surrounding hills which display vibrant shades of red, orange, and green. The water is calm, reflecting light and colors from the environment.\n\nIn the forefront of the image, there's an array of boats moored at the dock, ranging from large cabin cruisers to smaller speedboats. One of the prominent boats, named \"Alter Ego\", is a cabin cruiser painted white with a visibly older design. Several boats have covers partially draped over them, suggesting either recent use or preparation for use.\n\nThe wharf is populated with a few individuals engaging in leisure and boating activities. On the right side of the image, there is a group of three peopleâ€”one adult and two children. The adult, possibly a male, wears a red hat and white shirt, while one of the children is in a plaid shirt. Another child stands slightly out front, wearing a white shirt. They all appear to be attentively looking towards the left or preparing for a boat ride.\n\nIn the background, another larger boat can be seen with people aboard; a man stands at the highest point, seemingly enjoying the view or managing the boat. The calm water, boats, and people all together present a tranquil and recreational lake or river setting, enhanced by the serene and picturesque backdrop of autumnal trees and distant hills under a soft blue sky.","title":"Power boats at the dock indicates high boating use on Lake George.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544130","546388","542912","542871","552028","543246","548078","542872","544661","546935","542902","543545","542904","552316","548075","557450"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","cruiser","cabin","child","adult","speedboat","use","shirt","marina","people"]}
