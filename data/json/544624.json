{"path":"544624.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an intricate scene that focuses on the rich textures and natural environment of a mangrove ecosystem. The image features a bird, specifically a heron, standing elegantly among the complex root system of the mangroves. The roots are thick and knotted, plunging into what appears to be wet, muddy ground, suggesting that this might be a tidal area where water levels fluctuate with the tide.\n\nThe heron, centrally placed, exhibits a long neck and legs, with its body colored in shades of brown, blending harmoniously with the surroundings. Its presence underscores the ecological importance of mangroves as habitats for various wildlife species.\n\nThe background hints at an open water body, possibly a river or coastal bay, indicated by a hint of blue and the suggestion of a distant shoreline. Above the scene, there are the dark green leaves of the mangrove trees, partially blocking the sky but letting through specks of light that illuminate parts of the muddy ground and some roots.\n\nOverall, the composition is dense and layered, showcasing the complex interaction between the land and water elements typical of mangrove forests. Itâ€™s a serene yet dynamic scene that highlights the biodiversity and significance of such ecosystems.","title":"A great blue heron Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548729","544493","544563","544620","544543","547630","544611","544506","548731","545967","544489","544838","550388","550783","544484","544593"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["mangrove","root","heron","ecosystem","suggestion","biodiversity","tide","speck","importance","neck"]}
