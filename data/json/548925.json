{"path":"548925.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a broad landscape and captures an aerial view of a dam and a river. The image prominently shows a river winding its way through a barren landscape. A dam is constructed across the river, which appears to manage the flow of water, creating turbulence in the water downstream. The riverbanks and surrounding land are arid and largely devoid of vegetation, typical of desert terrain.\n\nThe topography is relatively flat with some gentle undulations, and scattered small hills or mounds can be seen in the distance. The horizon is dominated by flat plains that are interrupted by occasional hills and low mountain ranges. The color palette is dominated by earthy tones of brown, beige, and blue from the river and sky.\n\nOn the left side of the riverbank, there is a small structure which could be a part of the dam's infrastructure. The broader surrounding area includes faint traces of paths or roads, and there are minimal signs of human habitation, emphasizing the remoteness and possibly the utility-focused nature of this area.\n\nThe setting suggests a harsh, dry climate, under a clear blue sky that suggests the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. The absence of clouds and the sharp shadows cast indicate a midday or early afternoon time frame. The engineering marvel of the dam contrasts starkly with the natural, untamed, and rugged environment.","title":"Diversion dam on the Colorado river, north of needles","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548940","548927","549004","548947","548007","548012","548938","548975","548847","548013","548936","553660","544166","548920","544141","548003"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","river","riverbank","marvel","turbulence","undulation","plain","remoteness","interrupt","trace"]}
