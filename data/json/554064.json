{"path":"554064.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal landscape with a dramatic scene of nature and urban presence. In the foreground, there are turbulent ocean waves, featuring white foamy crests highlighted against the darker blue water, suggesting a windy or stormy condition. The middle ground shows a vista of a coastal cityscape, positioned along the waterâ€™s edge. Multiple buildings, possibly commercial or residential, are visible and are compactly clustered, indicating an urban area. \n\nThe background features a magnificent and rugged mountain range. The mountains rise steeply from the coast, and their surfaces appear heavily textured with crevices and folds, suggesting significant geological features. The mountains, under what seems to be a partially cloudy sky, are cast in various shades of blue and green, possibly due to the distance or atmospheric conditions, adding a mystique to the overall scene.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the untamed energy of the ocean with the orderly human settlement, all under the watchful presence of the towering mountains, creating a dynamic and layered visual narrative.","title":"Maui County's Hookipa Park, where surfing is a popular sport; towns of Kahului and Wailuku in background.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["553778","554065","543433","543298","553677","553675","543432","557532","543328","543434","543250","545122","543092","543309","553779","550291"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["mountain","mystique","ocean","crest","crevice","vista","fold","coast","settlement","condition"]}
