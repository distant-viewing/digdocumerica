{"path":"555493.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man in the process of taping a sign to a glass window. The handwritten sign prominently states \"DOCTORS ONLY\" in large, black block letters on a white background. \n\nThe man appears focused and slightly concerned. He is dressed in a casual manner, wearing a dark blue or black jacket with a logo and a name tag, either for identification or affiliation, possibly suggesting he works at or is involved with the location. The man is holding a roll of tape in his left hand while using his right hand to affix the sign.\n\nThe background through the glass window shows an interior space with bright ceiling lights, visible shelving with various items, and another sign that is less clear. The setting could be a medical facility, a restricted access area of a hospital, or another health-related environment given the context provided by the sign. The ambience suggests it might be evening or a day with low natural light, given the reliance on artificial ceiling lights inside the building.","title":"Some gas stations, such as this one, defined exactly who they would pump fuel for--such as doctors.
