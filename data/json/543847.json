{"path":"543847.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is a close-up photograph capturing a tender and intimate moment between a woman and a young deer. The woman, who appears to be in her 20s or 30s, is gazing affectionately at the deer while holding it gently in her arms. She has light complexion and wears rounded eyeglasses. Her hair is dark and shoulder-length, and she is dressed in a brownish or dark amber coat with a red bandana visible around her forehead.\n\nThe young deer, held closely to her chest, has soft, light brown fur and large, dark eyes. Its ears are erect and attentive. They both seem at ease with each other, suggesting a calm and caring interaction.\n\nThe background of the image is largely out of focus, with hints of a blue color that could possibly be someone's jeans, indicating the presence of other people nearby. The lighting appears natural and bright, enhancing the details of their faces and the deer's fur, suggesting this could be an outdoor setting during the day.","title":"Students from Denver public schools make friends with two-week-old fawn, orphaned when its mother was hit by a car.
