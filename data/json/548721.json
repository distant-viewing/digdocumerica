{"path":"548721.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image is an underwater photograph that captures a serene marine environment. In the foreground, there are rounded, textured brain corals that occupy the lower part of the image. These corals have a mottled appearance and are a pale yellow-brown color, interspersed with dark crevices.\n\nTowards the center and the upper part of the image, you can see a diver swimming just below the waterâ€™s surface. The diver is stretched out horizontally, likely wearing fins and appears to be in motion, enhancing the feeling of exploratory tranquility.\n\nBehind the diver, and also scattered in the background, are slender, vertical elements of coral that resemble underwater foliage. These corals contribute to the layered feel of the photograph, providing a sense of depth.\n\nAbove everything, the water's surface is visible, reflecting some light back into the depths and creating a shimmering effect that subtly illuminates the underwater scene. The overall composition portrays a calm, isolated moment under the sea, highlighting both the beauty of marine life and the human interaction within this tranquil underwater world.","title":"Snorkeler at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo. On the day of this picture water clarity was good. Old diving hands, however, say clarity has greatly declined in the past two decades owing to the dredging and filling operations of the land developers.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548722","548676","548681","548680","548675","548683","548679","548682","548677","548712","548719","548713","548714","548678","548723","548717"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","diver","fin","crevice","swimming","isolate","world","depth","surface","occupy"]}
