{"path":"551233.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents a geological setting, predominantly consisting of a rocky outcrop and sedimentary rock debris. The focus is a steep, eroded hillside showing layers of red to brownish sediment, suggestive of iron-rich deposits which might be sandstone or similar rock types. The hill appears to be partially weathered, resulting in rugged textures and substantial rock fragments scattered around the base.\n\nLarge boulders, broken and angular, sit prominently in the foreground, indicating recent breakage possibly from natural weathering processes or human activity. The soil around these boulders is similarly colored, hinting that the entire area includes similar material.\n\nSparse vegetation, including a few green plants and grasses, is visible at the top of the hill and scattered sparingly near the bottom, suggesting a semi-arid environment where plant life struggles to establish due to the dominant rocky terrain.\n\nThe sky is largely overcast, giving a muted lighting to the scene which accentuates the earthy tones of the soil and rocks. This setting could be part of a larger geological or natural reserve, or possibly a commercial quarry. The scene is devoid of any human presence or artificial structures, emphasizing its natural and undisturbed state.","title":"Red clay soil causes much of the siltation problem in the Lake of the Ozarks region.
