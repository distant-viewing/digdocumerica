{"path":"550291.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and moody seascape under a stormy sky. The image is taken during the day, but the ambient light is dim due to the dense cloud cover, giving the scene a twilight mood.\n\nIn the foreground, choppy, dark waters stretch across the frame, reflecting the somber sky above. The sea appears tumultuous, with small waves cresting under the force of wind.\n\nThe background features an urban skyline silhouetted against the sky. The buildings, while not detailed due to the silhouette effect, are varied in height and shape, suggesting a dense cityscape. Notably, one of the buildings stands out with a pointed structure, rising above the others, potentially a tower or spire. The silhouette of this cityscape adds a sense of scale and civilization to the natural drama unfolding in the sky and sea.\n\nThe sky itself is a central element of the composition, filled with thick clouds in shades of dark blue and gray, dominating the upper two-thirds of the image. Rays of sunlight break dramatically through the clouds in several places, creating a striking contrast of light and dark. These sunbeams highlight sections of the water and parts of the city, adding a dynamic and somewhat ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of natural drama with a powerful interplay of light, water, and urban elements, conveying a feeling of awe and the sublime power of nature juxtaposed against human habitation.","title":"Cleveland skyline and Lake Erie at daybreak","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553857","550295","547147","552265","548705","544701","545255","548328","543025","547057","547047","543138","548384","554064","552252","553992"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["drama","silhouette","cityscape","cloud","civilization","sea","ray","crest","awe","spire"]}
