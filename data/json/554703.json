{"path":"554703.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene characterized by vibrant fall foliage and reflections on the water. In the foreground, a large white building with a flat roof and rectangular architecture extends to the left edge of the frame, positioned closely to the river, with its entire side and reflection visible in the water. Right next to it, a smaller black-painted structure with a sloping roof—possibly a mill or boathouse—partially obscures the white building and juts out over the riverbed. The surrounding landscape features lush trees displaying autumn colors ranging from vivid orange to deep red and unchanged green, creating a rich tapestry of colors which are mirrored perfectly in the river's calm surface.\n\nThe river itself, possibly a small- to medium-sized one, stretches across the width of the photograph, dominated by mirror-like reflections of the surrounding natural beauty and the buildings. Floating leaves that have already fallen hint at the ongoing seasonal change. In the background, more trees can be seen lining the riverbanks. The far bank is less distinctly visible, suggesting a slightly larger breadth to the river at this point.\n\nThe overall composition and the reflections in the water emphasize symmetry and tranquility, while the bright, clear sky contributes to the illuminated and vibrant appearance of the scene. This photograph likely aims to depict the peaceful coexistence of human establishments and natural landscape in a rural or semi-rural setting during the fall season.","title":"Old mill above a small dam and the Warrensburg Board and Paper Company at the edge of the Hudson River at","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552599","554753","554737","554751","554756","554775","554750","557239","552597","554758","550845","554762","552108","554649","552318","550852"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["reflection","river","fall","mirror","boathouse","breadth","symmetry","riverbed","tapestry","jut"]}
