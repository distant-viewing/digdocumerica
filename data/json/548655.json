{"path":"548655.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a two-story wooden building, raised off the ground on concrete supports, which suggests it might be located in a flood-prone area, commonly seen in coastal regions. The building appears to be a commercial establishment based on the signage and the nature of the ground floor. The upper level has a wraparound balcony with railing, accessed by a flight of exterior stairs on the buildingâ€™s right side.\n\nOn the balcony, there are louvered shutters and a couple of small windows. Below, the ground level hosts an open, sheltered space, likely used for commercial activities. The front and side have wooden boards, some with painted advertisements, as well as a distinct, brightly colored door painted yellow with decorative patterns and another simpler wooden door.\n\nThere's a prominent sign hanging from the roof's edge that reads \"Junior's Sandwiches\" with \"HOT SANDWICHES\" advertised underneath, indicating the type of business operating here. The building shows signs of weathering and age but still stands as a functional structure.\n\nThe location around the building appears to be a suburban area with other low-rise buildings and lush greenery visible in the distance. The clear skies and bright sunlight suggest a sunny day, enhancing the visibility of the details in the photograph.","title":"Sandwich shop in Key West shows characteristics of the old Bahama style wooden residences that are a feature of the town.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548654","558029","557156","545317","545339","558128","550110","558126","544088","552963","552964","545334","546440","547808","552454","542812"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sandwich","balcony","building","level","door","flood","shutter","stair","ground","weathering"]}
