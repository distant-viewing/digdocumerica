{"path":"547424.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and evocative scene involving a horse. The horse is partially visible, framed by a weathered wooden gate which is also the central focus of this composition. The gate features ornate, curved ironwork patterns that run both along the top and fill a large bottom panel, suggesting a mesh-like structure supported within a wooden rectangular frame.\n\nThe horse is a creamy color, with long, slightly tangled blond mane that obscures part of its face. It is peeking through the gate, with only its head and upper neck visible. Behind it, the open field and a clear blue sky hint at a rural setting.\n\nIn the foreground, directly in front of the gate, there is an old metal bucket that seems to be resting on a concrete slab, nestled among some lush green grass. This adds a touch of day-to-day functionality to the scene. The overall ambiance is one of serene country life, underscored by the use of natural materials and the presence of the horse.","title":"\"Goldie\".
