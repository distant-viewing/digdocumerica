{"path":"542772.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, a man stands in a dense forest, observing a large fallen pine tree. The man, dressed in work attire consisting of a light blue shirt, suspenders, and olive pants, wears a hard hat and a tool belt. His position and gaze suggest he is assessing the situation or planning the next step in dealing with the fallen tree. Numerous branches, needles, and forest debris cover the ground around the fallen tree, emphasizing recent forestry activity.\n\nThe background is rich with tall, dense evergreen trees which largely dominate the scene, indicating that this photo is likely taken in a well-preserved, natural forest. The lighting in the photograph is natural, with dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, casting shadows and highlighting areas of the forest floor. This setting creates a serene yet active forestry scene, where work and nature intersect.\n","title":"D.Jackson felling red fir tree","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542770","542716","542771","542781","542788","545269","542773","542769","553611","553602","554422","542786","542787","553608","553604","553601"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["fallen","forest","forestry","dappled","assess","suspender","tree","deal","situation","preserve"]}
