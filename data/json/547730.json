{"path":"547730.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an expansive wheat field under a clear blue sky. The field, bathed in golden hues, extends towards a horizon lined with distant mountains. The wheat stalks are dense and seem to be ripe, bending slightly under the weight of the grains. On the right side of the image, a red combine harvester is operating, its presence indicated by a cloud of dust and debris it leaves behind as it moves through the field, harvesting the wheat. The combine is partially visible due to the vastness of the field which dominates the view. The landscape is flat, giving a sense of vast, open agricultural land, which is typical of many grain-producing regions. The overall scene captures the essence of harvest time in a wheat field, highlighting agricultural machinery at work in a serene rural setting.","title":"Grain harvester in the Palo Verde Valley.
