{"path":"545286.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph portrays a woman engaging in the leisure activity of fishing. She is situated amidst a naturally verdant environment, possibly a riverbank or near a lake, given the presence of water and dense greenery in the background. The scene captures the woman side-profile and partly obscured by tall, thin reeds in the foreground, which add a sense of depth and a slight wild, untamed quality to the image.\n\nThe woman is dressed casually for outdoor activity; she wears a striped tank top paired with what appears to be rugged pants, suitable for an environment that might involve elements of water and dense foliage. On her right arm, thereâ€™s a wristwatch, practical for keeping track of time during such outdoor activities. Her hair is styled in a blunt bob, practical for outdoor activities, and she seems focused on the task at hand.\n\nShe holds a fishing rod with both hands, and her stance suggests she is either waiting for a catch or just casting the line. The photo has a candid and immersive quality, capturing an instance of genuine interaction with nature. The clarity and color saturation in the photo contribute to a vivid portrayal of the setting and the activity, with the lush greens and the subtle reflections on the water enhancing the outdoor feel of the photograph.","title":"Young indian at camp chitwin","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552026","542739","551393","555576","550313","551024","550665","542529","544216","554519","550666","551025","553081","554520","542744","550217"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","woman","instance","wristwatch","wild","stance","portrayal","reed","quality","saturation"]}
