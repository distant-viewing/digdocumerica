{"path":"554503.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures two hikers ascending a rugged mountain trail. The scene is depicted under a clear blue sky, highlighting a vibrant outdoor environment rich with natural colors.\n\nOn the left, one hiker leads the way. He is wearing a dark brimmed hat, a gray shirt, and shorts. His backpack is traditional and appears quite full, held by straps over his shoulders, and he is using a walking stick for support. His pose captures movement as he steps upwards, looking towards the rocky path ahead.\n\nThe second hiker, to the right in the image, is slightly higher up on the trail. This individual is wearing a red cap, sunglasses, a long sleeve shirt, and long pants, providing protection from the elements. His backpack is noticeably larger and bright orange, making him easily distinguishable against the mountain backdrop. Like the first hiker, he also uses a walking stick to aid in his ascent.\n\nThe terrain they are crossing features patches of grass and small bushes, interspersed with rocky outcrops. This suggests a high-altitude environment typical of mountainous areas. The natural landscape implies a quiet and solitary location, ideal for rigorous hiking.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a scene of adventure and exploration in a picturesque mountain setting, with an emphasis on the challenge of the terrain and the preparation of the hikers for their journey.","title":"Backpackers descending the summit of Algonquin Mountain in the High Peaks region of the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554504","543381","545781","554508","545751","544305","545772","543385","543382","554507","554558","545768","543510","545700","554509","543388"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","backpack","stick","trail","mountain","ascent","strap","walk","ascend","outcrop"]}
