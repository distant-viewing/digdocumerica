{"path":"549786.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image depicts an urban scene, likely an abandoned or neglected lot with prominent signs of decay and neglect. The foreground is filled with a vast amount of trash and debris, scattered haphazardly over an unkempt piece of land. Various types of waste can be seen, including papers, plastic items, and miscellaneous rubble, making the area appear disordered and neglected.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a large old building, characterized by its worn and grimy exterior. The building is several stories high with rows of windows, many of which are boarded up or broken, suggesting long-term abandonment. The architecture suggests it might once have been a residential or industrial building, but now stands as a relic of neglect. The walls of the building are covered in patches, showing signs of water damage and structural decay.\n\nOn the left side of the image, you can spot a portion of another structure with a visible fire escape stair, adding to the urban decay aesthetic.\n\nThe image's overall mood is somber and desolate, underscoring themes of urban decay and neglect in what might once have been a bustling area. The lighting is dull, suggesting an overcast day, which amplifies the sense of abandonment and dilapidation in the scene. This photograph captures the stark reality of certain urban environments that have been left to deteriorate.","title":"Trash-filled lot behind apartment house on upper Lexington avenue at 105th street, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549785","550264","557345","550253","553555","552750","552102","546854","557350","549833","547921","553869","557344","549307","549958","550246"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["neglect","decay","abandonment","disorder","amplify","escape","deteriorate","reality","rubble","stair"]}
