{"path":"547041.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a coastal scene with a focus on a rugged, pebbled beach and the waters of a lake. In the foreground, the beach is strewn with smooth, rounded stones, typical of wave-polished pebble beaches. There is a hint of a driftwood log washed up amongst the stones, adding a natural element to the scene. The water is relatively calm and extends to the horizon, suggesting a vast body of water like one of the Great Lakes.\n\nThe most striking feature of the photo is a large, rusted and seemingly abandoned piece of heavy machinery, possibly a bulldozer or similar construction vehicle, positioned at the water's edge. This machinery, partially in the water, provides a sense of abandonment or deterioration, illustrating the impact of nature on human-made objects over time.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there are a few small, simple houses close to the shoreline, likely residential homes or lakeside cabins, indicative of a small, perhaps seasonal community. No people are visible in the image, which gives it a deserted or quiet feel. The sky above is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day, contributing to the stark contrast between the natural beauty of the scene and the aged, man-made machinery. The overall mood evokes a sense of tranquility mixed with a hint of melancholy due to the abandoned equipment.","title":"Bulldozer at work on break-water after severe storm at Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["548184","547040","547581","547602","549338","543242","547622","543057","543175","547893","547031","550458","545132","543405","542884","543552"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","machinery","stone","deterioration","water","driftwood","pebble","hint","lakeside","bulldozer"]}
