{"path":"547317.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and busy scene, likely taken at a dance event or social gathering. The setting seems to be an indoor venue with warm, ambient lighting, contributing to a blurred and dynamic effect likely caused by long exposure photography which captures motion over time.\n\nSeveral dancers, predominantly women, are caught in mid-motion; their festive dresses appear like colorful blurs due to their spinning movements. The dresses are full and flowing, suggesting they are wearing traditional or folkloric attire, possibly crinolines which enhance the spinning effect. The colors of the dresses vary widely, including shades of pink, yellow, and white, adding to the festive and lively atmosphere.\n\nScattered among the dancers are a few standing individuals, possibly bystanders or partners waiting to join in. These figures are less blurred, implying they are relatively stationary compared to the swirl of the dancers.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of motion and festivity, emphasizing the cultural or celebratory aspect of the gathering, highlighted through the use of photographic technique that emphasizes movement and a joyous mood.","title":"In the swing at Lincoln's 33rd annual square dance festival dance was held in the pershing memorial auditorium, one of the sights of the capital","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547274","547386","547403","558286","547334","547371","547387","547270","558284","558285","553241","551710","547271","547383","553304","557790"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dancer","gathering","join","festivity","motion","dance","effect","movement","technique","standing"]}
