{"path":"554979.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dense thicket of leafless, intertwining trees or shrubs, presenting an intricate mesh of bare branches. The image captures the complexity of the twigs and branches, forming a dense, chaotic tangle against a darker undergrowth of what appears to be occasional evergreen foliage or shadows. The lighting seems dim, suggesting dusk or an overcast day, contributing to the somber palette of grays, dark browns, and subtle greens. The atmosphere has a wild, untamed quality, characterized by the natural disorder and the lack of human presence or intervention. The overall tone and mood of the image convey a cold, perhaps wintry scene with a focus entirely on the natural texture and forms created by the branches.","title":"Alder with new spring growth located along the Queets River bottom in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554980","554981","553579","543487","543621","554976","557622","555201","554984","554983","554954","553574","555121","555117","555002","554985"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","thicket","disorder","tangle","mesh","twig","undergrowth","intertwine","intervention","form"]}
