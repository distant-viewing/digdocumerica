{"path":"551749.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling outdoor market scene, likely a flea market, set between tall urban buildings under a clear blue sky. Multiple vendors have set up tables covered with assorted items: glassware, plates, jewelry, and other knick-knacks are prominently displayed for sale. The tables are draped with cloths of different colors, mainly white and green, creating a vibrant and inviting ambiance.\n\nThe people in the market, a mix of shoppers and sellers, are engaged in various activities. There are individuals of different ages, some examining items on tables, while others converse or handle the merchandise. One person in the foreground, a man with dark hair wearing a red sweater and a jacket, appears to be organizing items on a table. The shoppers are dressed in casual and warm clothes, suggesting the market might be taking place in a cooler weather setting.\n\nIn the background, the urban environment is characterized by typical city elements: brick buildings with visible fire escapes, large advertisement billboards, and street signs. In the distance, slightly faded, a big moving truck with a sign reads \"AAA EDDY'S MOVING,\" adding to the busy, metropolitan atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a lively community event with a focus on commerce and social interaction, set in an urban neighborhood. The array of goods and the active participation of the people beautifully illustrate the vibrancy of a local flea market setup.","title":"Sunday flea market on Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) and 27th Street.
