{"path":"554622.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged man standing inside a large, empty greenhouse. He is dressed in a dark utility outfit and is positioned bending slightly forward, appearing to be observing or inspecting some objects on the ground before him. The objects resemble small square blocks arrayed irregularly on the grey concrete floor.\n\nThe greenhouse structure is comprised of a metal frame with large glass panels, some of which are open, providing a view of the exterior which includes another building and some trees. The environment inside the greenhouse is sunlit, casting sharp shadows of the metal frames onto the floor. The atmosphere has a somewhat industrial or utilitarian feel, possibly indicating the greenhouse is used for research or educational purposes rather than commercial plant cultivation. A large metal pipe with a curved end lies horizontally on one side of the frame, which could be part of an irrigation or ventilation system. \n\nThe overall mood is one of quiet investigation or contemplation, with the man's posture suggesting a moment of thoughtful examination or decision-making about the blocks or his surroundings.","title":"Manager of the sewer treatment plant at Old Forge, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
