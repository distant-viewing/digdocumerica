{"path":"549778.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a landfill or waste disposal site, viewed from the perspective of someone operating a mechanical claw or machinery, likely used for handling and organizing waste. The focus of the image is on the heavy machinery's operator compartment, showing parts of the operating levers and the metallic structure of the equipment.\n\nThe background is cluttered with mounds of assorted garbage and debris, sprawling across the field under a bright sky. Numerous seagulls are flying around or perched atop the waste, creating a dynamic, albeit chaotic, atmosphere. These birds frequently visit landfills to scavenge food from the waste. The broad daylight and clear skies suggest the photo was taken during the day. The perspective from within the machinery adds an immersive layer to the photo, emphasizing the magnitude of waste humans produce and the ongoing efforts required to manage it.","title":"Bulldozer spreads garbage in dump in Hackensack Meadows near Ft.
