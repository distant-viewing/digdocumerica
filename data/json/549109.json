{"path":"549109.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and serene scene primarily featuring the silhouette of a landscape against a twilight sky. The primary object of interest in the image is a bright, comet-like trail streaking across the darkening sky. The trajectory of the trail originates from the horizon point within a valley and extends upward and across the frame, suggesting the path of a missile or a similarly fast-moving object. \n\nThe landscape consists of dark, rounded hilltops or small mountains forming a subtle valley that dips in the center of the image. The sky transitions from a deep blue at the top to lighter hues near the horizon, indicating either sunset or sunrise. This celestial gradient creates a beautiful backdrop for the streaking light. The light itself appears white and very bright at its origin, with a consistent, slightly tapering trail leading behind it, indicating motion. \n\nThe overall composition is clean and simple, with a focus on the contrast between the earth's dark silhouette and the luminous sky. There is a minimalistic and somewhat mysterious quality to the image, as it captures a fleeting moment with crisp clarity.","title":"Jet contrail over the mountains of searchlight.
