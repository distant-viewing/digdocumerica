{"path":"550100.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a large, open-air parking lot filled with numerous cars. The lot is neatly organized into multiple rows and columns, creating a grid pattern of parked vehicles. The vehicles come in various colors and sizes, including red, blue, white, and black cars. Some lanes are denser with vehicles, while others have more empty spaces.\n\nAround the perimeter of the parking lot, there are roads with moving traffic, demonstrating that this area is most likely urban or suburban. To the right side, a small section of a building is visible, suggesting the parking lot is adjacent to commercial or residential structures.\n\nThe top of the image features a road where a few cars are driving by, indicating the lot is easily accessible from a main thoroughfare. The overall setting appears busy, as this parking setup is typical of areas with high vehicle usage such as shopping malls, stadiums, or business districts. The image is brightly lit, suggesting it was taken during the day under clear weather conditions.","title":"Downtown parking lot","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548432","553303","549875","556197","546685","556721","546879","547826","547686","556722","546732","542635","546708","554349","546813","546900"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","parking","vehicle","stadium","car","thoroughfare","spaces","urban","perimeter","suburban"]}
