{"path":"552572.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene featuring a Caucasian middle-aged man engaged in strenuous outdoor work, specifically installing or mending a fence in a rural area. The man, wearing a cowboy hat and dressed in a red plaid shirt, denim jeans, and work boots, is holding a post-driver with both hands, captured mid-swing as he drives a wooden fence post into the ground. His focus and physical effort are evident in his posture and expression, showing a combination of determination and exertion.\n\nIn the background, a red pickup truck is parked alongside the fencing area, suggesting it may be carrying supplies or serving as transportation for the worker. The setting is a dry, rugged terrain, indicative of a mountainous or high desert region with sparse vegetation. The sky is exceptionally clear and deeply blue, contributing to a vivid contrast with the red of the truck and the earth tones of the landscape.\n\nBarbed wire runs parallel to the fence line, partially framing the composition of the shot, indicating an existing boundary that is either being repaired or extended. The ground is rocky and uneven, adding to the labor-intensive nature of the workerâ€™s task.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of authentic rural labor, highlighting themes of hard work and the upkeep of land and property in less urban environments.","title":"At the oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
