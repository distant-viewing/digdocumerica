{"path":"558275.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a historical reenactment scene, likely from the Civil War era, featuring several individuals in period military uniforms. These uniforms are primarily dark, possibly blue, with hats that are characteristic of the era. They are gathered around a cannon that has just been fired, as suggested by the substantial cloud of smoke erupting from the artillery piece. This scene takes place outdoors on a grassy hill, under a clear sky that transitions from a lighter shade near the horizon to a deeper blue at the top of the frame. The smoke from the cannon is voluminous and billows out in tones of white and gray, drifting towards the right side of the image, which adds a dynamic element to the otherwise still and calm setting. The composition captures the precise moment of action, emphasizing the dramatic effect of the cannon fire within the serene landscape.","title":"Members of the New Ulm battery firing a salute in New Ulm Minnesota.
