{"path":"546089.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of six men engaging in a card game outdoors. They are gathered around a foldable circular table, seated on various types of chairs including stools and foldable seats. The setting appears to be a camping spot or a casual outdoor area, evidenced by tents, vehicles such as jeeps and a trailer, and surrounding trees visible in the background.\n\nEach man appears focused on the game, with drinks in paper cups and a bottle of whiskey on the ground. The attire of the men varies, featuring jackets and vests primarily in leather or fabric, and hats, some of which are camouflaged, indicating a possible hunting or outdoor expedition theme.\n\nThe environment is informal and rugged, with items like a cooler box and plates on the table, contributing to a sense of a casual gather among friends enjoying a game and drinks in a natural setting. The overcast sky and natural, leafless scenery suggest it could be either late fall or early spring.","title":"Deer hunters drink and play poker while waiting for wild deer.
