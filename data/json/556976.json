{"path":"556976.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a long, narrow dirt road slicing through a dense forest. The road itself appears dry and dusty, stretching straight through the landscape and dividing the forest into two distinct halves.\n\nThe forest displays lush greenery with a variety of tree types, suggesting a diverse ecosystem. The treetops create a textured appearance, adding depth to the scene. The color of the trees varies slightly, hinting at different species or perhaps the effects of sunlight filtering through the canopy.\n\nThe image is taken from a high vantage point, looking almost directly down onto the road and trees, giving a sense of the vastness and isolation of this natural area. The lighting is soft, likely either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the gentle shadows and the overall muted tone of the scenery.\n\nNo buildings, people, or vehicles are visible, emphasizing the untouched and remote character of this environment. The photo captures a moment of quiet and untouched natural beauty, with the road perhaps serving as the only sign of human intrusion into this wild landscape.","title":"Aerial view of a portion of a central valley quadrangle which is bounded by tracyton, illahee, brownsville and silverdale these communities and others in the area will be affected by population growth when the navy's proposed trident submarine base is built nearby","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550567","556933","555127","544860","545262","553567","548598","547659","550600","557011","550613","550614","553570","557555","548594","552516"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["road","forest","treetop","intrusion","half","specie","slice","divide","vantage","character"]}
