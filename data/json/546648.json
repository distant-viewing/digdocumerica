{"path":"546648.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of someone handling paperwork, specifically involving identification and document verification. The person, whose hands are the only visible part of them, is filling out or reviewing forms attached to a clipboard. These forms contain various details such as names, dates, and identification numbers, including a photo ID clipped at the top which displays a picture of a man and some personal information.\n\nUnder soft and dim lighting, the person's hands are captured writing with a pen, suggesting focus and attention to detail. The background and surrounding environment are not clearly visible due to the close framing of the shot, keeping the focus solely on the act of handling and reviewing these documents.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somber and professional, emphasizing the seriousness of the document handling process. The clipboard and papers contain a lot of text and data, indicative of bureaucratic or administrative work. This scene could be taking place in a variety of professional settings where document verification or processing is required.","title":"Cab driver gets ticket for not having passenger list.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555241","556750","548892","556007","556264","546281","557910","544318","542757","542690","546680","552377","558378","552389","552387","556573"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["document","identification","clipboard","paperwork","seriousness","date","form","datum","pen","act"]}
