{"path":"557116.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in a forest, characterized by a thick layer of fallen leaves and dense foliage predominantly in hues of brown and fading green, suggesting it was taken in autumn. The focus of the image is a vintage red and white vehicle, partially visible, as it makes its way down what appears to be a narrow, leaf-covered forest road, or a clearing.\n\nThe car is shown from the front, with its headlights visible and the grille peeking out among the trees. The setting is quite shadowy, with patches of sunlight filtering through the tree branches, creating areas of light and dark contrast across the scene. The surrounding trees envelop the area tightly, creating a secluded and somewhat mysterious atmosphere.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any people, focusing solely on the interaction of the vehicle with the natural surroundings. The composition of the photograph, with the vehicle emerging from the shadows into the dappled sunlight, adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static natural setting.","title":"Four wheel drive vehicle making a trip deep into the Doniphan County hardwood forest in the extreme northeast corner of the state to look for Indian petroglyphs mentioned in the Lewis and Clark journals.
