{"path":"554444.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures two men, dressed in light-colored uniform shirts and wearing broad-brimmed hats, seated closely side-by-side. The man on the right is in partial profile facing left, while the man on the left is viewed more from the side, facing right but looking towards the man on the right.\n\nBoth men's shirts have patches on their shoulders, presumably indicating their affiliation with a ranger or park service, denoted by a nature-themed emblem and the text \"New York\" visible on the patch of the man on the right. The hats are similar in styleâ€”beige with a crown ribbon. Their expressions are serious and contemplative.\n\nThe man on the left is seen holding his wrist with his other hand, resting his elbows on his knees, portraying a relaxed yet attentive posture. Both men wear watches on their wrists. They appear to be engaged in a serious conversation or are observing something out of the frame attentively.\n\nThe background behind them is blurred, with hints of greenery suggesting an outdoor, possibly wooded, setting. The focus of the photograph emphasizes the men and their attire, suggesting their roles as officers or rangers in a professional context.","title":"U.s.
