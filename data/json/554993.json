{"path":"554993.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense, lush scene of vegetation, predominantly featuring a variety of green plants and leaves. It seems to be an image of a forest or jungle undergrowth.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several kinds of leaves in different shapes and sizes. A noteworthy element is the presence of a plant with delicate, tiny green leaves that appear almost feathery or fern-like, covering much of the image's central area. This plant is intertwined with a thick, pale branch that contrasts with the dark green background.\n\nAlongside this, there are other green leaves that are broader and have a waxy texture, accompanying darker, shriveled leaves showing signs of decay, perhaps indicating natural ecological processes like decomposition. Also visible are sprigs of a plant with lighter green, elongated leaves that add to the composition's variety.\n\nAdditionally, there's a visible moss or lichen that clings to the branches, introducing a texture that is fuzzy and pale green to light yellow in color, contributing to the overall verdancy and wildness of the scene.\n\nThe background is dark and blurred, allowing the multitude of greens and the textures of the different plants in the foreground to stand out vividly. There's no sky visible, and no clear human presence or artifacts, reinforcing the natural and untouched feel of the setting. The overall composition gives a rich, detailed view into the intricacy and beauty of forest vegetation.","title":"Hemlock forest floor view with young hemlock, salal deer fern and young Douglas fir seedlings in the Olympic National Park Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555093","555192","555054","555040","555043","554957","555183","555019","554991","554980","555049","555050","555000","545285","555058","555191"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","plant","wildness","intricacy","lichen","texture","branch","artifact","cling","multitude"]}
