{"path":"551195.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a winding river passing through a mountainous landscape with a settlement situated along its banks. The river, appearing deep and broad, curves through the terrain, reflecting the surrounding environment. A bridge, likely constructed with a steel framework visible in the picture, spans the river, connecting the opposing banks.\n\nOn one side of the river, nestled against the mountains, is a small town. The buildings are densely packed, with various rooftops that suggest residential and possibly commercial or industrial functions. Opposite this, the land is mostly unoccupied, with sweeping forested slopes dominating the view.\n\nFurther up the river, noticeable industrial activity can be seen, indicated by smoke or steam arising from multiple large structures, possibly a factory or plant, situated close to the riverbank. This suggests a blend of residential, commercial, and industrial usage of the area.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the river and town features rugged, densely forested mountains, which taper off into the distance where additional mountain ranges can be seen under a blue sky. This mixed-use region where natural beauty coexists with human settlement and industrial activity provides a distinct juxtaposition, typical of many river towns that utilize the waterway for various purposes.","title":"The Kanawha Valley, a major world chemical center, is narrow from Montgomery to Alloy.","placename":"Charleston (W.
