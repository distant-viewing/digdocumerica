{"path":"545243.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating scene combining natural and industrial elements. It showcases a majestic, snow-capped mountain looming in the background, its surface detailed with shades of white and patches of rocky terrain visible beneath the snow. This is likely a prominent volcano, given its conical shape and size.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a vivid contrast to the natural beauty of the mountain; it features an industrial landscape positioned along a body of water. The waterfront is dotted with various vessels, likely ships and boats of different sizes, possibly involved in commercial activities. A cluster of industrial facilities is visible, characterized by multiple buildings, cranes, and large stacks, one of which is emitting a plume of smoke into the sky.\n\nThe water, reflecting the light and shadows of its surroundings, adds a dynamic element to the scene. The photograph seems to capture the intersection of human activity and nature, highlighting the juxtaposition between the industrial operations at the foothill of the serene mountain. The color saturation and quality suggest that the photo might be taken during the latter part of the 20th century, given the style and graininess typical of film photography of that era. The scene is bathed in a soft light, which might suggest it was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Mt.  Rainier, with port of tacoma in foreground.
