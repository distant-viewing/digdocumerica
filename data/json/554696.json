{"path":"554696.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and picturesque outdoor scene with a rustic log cabin by the water's edge. The cabin is traditional in style, with dark wooden logs and a large stone chimney extending above the roofline. It features a steeply pitched roof with shingles, and a small porch can be glimpsed at the front, suggesting a cozy, inviting interior. A door with a window and at least one visible window enhances the homely feel of the cabin.\n\nThe cabin is surrounded by a lush forest setting, with tall pine trees prominent in the background, contributing to a sense of seclusion and tranquility. There are clear reflections in the calm water, mirroring the cabin and trees, which adds to the overall peacefulness of the setting.\n\nIn front of the cabin, there is a well-maintained grassy area leading down to the water, and the impression is of a well-loved retreat perhaps used for vacations or weekends away. The sky is notably clear and blue, indicative of good weather, enhancing the vibrancy of the scene.\n\nThis setting evokes feelings of tranquility, isolation from the hustle and bustle of daily life, and a close connection with nature.","title":"Picturesque log cabin","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554438","554401","554084","544567","544865","545137","552987","557691","543527","552986","549193","557562","543514","557783","543547","555231"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["cabin","log","love","vacation","roofline","tranquility","retreat","front","hustle","shingle"]}
