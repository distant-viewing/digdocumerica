{"path":"554389.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from an indoor event, likely a car show, based on the context and elements present. In the foreground, part of a shiny red car is visible, dominating the lower section of the image with its glossy, reflective surface and sleek design. The car's well-polished exterior reflects the bright lighting of the venue.\n\nIn the background, primarily out of focus, a group of five young adults, both men and women, can be seen. They are dressed in fashion typical of the 1970s, evident from their hairstyles, clothing, and accessories. The group is displaying various expressions and appear to be engaged in a casual conversation or perhaps evaluating the cars on display.\n\nBehind them, a prominently placed promotional display features the word \"LeSabre\" repeated in a vertical column, almost certainly referring to the model of the car being exhibited. This display has a bold, graphic design with white text on a dark background, which stands out in the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a lively social interaction in a commercial or promotional setting, surrounded by elements indicative of an automotive event, and styled in a manner evocative of the 1970s cultural aesthetic. The atmosphere suggests a blend of leisure and mild intrigue among the attendees.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York coliseum at Columbus circle in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554373","554385","554372","554388","554387","554381","554376","554390","554377","556703","554375","552412","557874","552782","552792","554384"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","display","refer","intrigue","repeat","event","accessory","venue","attendee","hairstyle"]}
