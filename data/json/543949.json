{"path":"543949.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures a young woman engaged in sailing. She is seated on the edge of a small sailboat that is labeled \"II 6059 KA,\" indicating its registration number and possibly location. The woman is dressed in a patterned bikini, which is predominantly red with floral accents, suggesting a leisurely or recreational setting.\n\nShe appears focused and is actively handling the boat's rigging. Her right hand is pulling on a rope, adjusting the sail to navigate or control the boat's speed. The white sail is partially visible, stretched and filled by the wind in a way that shows that the boat is in motion.\n\nThe background indicates an open water body—likely a lake or coastal area—characterized by calm water with slight ripples, indicating gentle wind conditions. The setting seems peaceful and isolated, emphasizing the personal and intimate experience of sailing.\n\nThe photograph's composition emphasizes dynamic action through the angle of the woman's body and the direction of the sail, creating a sense of movement and balance. The use of natural, soft lighting adds to the relaxed and serene mood of the scene.","title":"Participant in the Louisville spring regatta","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["548527","552345","543953","548511","549386","544029","544667","549421","544224","548526","549404","543937","548494","549405","549403","547463"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailing","boat","wind","woman","leisurely","registration","rig","bikini","navigate"]}
