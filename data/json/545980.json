{"path":"545980.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an older man standing outdoors between two vehicles, likely in a rural or semi-rural setting. The man wears a light blue, long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a black baseball cap. He is holding up a large, dark-colored bird by its feet, possibly a turkey or a similar type of fowl.\n\nTo the left of the man, there is a green truck or trailer with an open lift gate and what appears to be equipment or garbage bags inside. To the right, there is another vehicle, which is blue and white and also features an open hatch with another similar dark-colored bird hanging from it, indicating that the man may be involved in hunting or animal processing.\n\nThe background is somewhat blurred, but it suggests a flat, open landscape with sparse vegetation. There are some buildings visible in the far background, suggesting that this might be on the outskirts of a developed area. The overcast sky indicates it might be a cold or damp day.\n\nOverall, the scene likely captures a moment related to hunting or farming in a rural community, accentuated by the use of trucks for transportation of the game or livestock.","title":"Louis petre, a nutria buyer","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["554939","554675","554680","554934","552587","547394","542542","546132","554925","547395","554926","549036","555854","547326","545087","546380"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["hunting","bird","hatch","truck","man","gate","livestock","baseball","game","outskirt"]}
