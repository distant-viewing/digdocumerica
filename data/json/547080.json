{"path":"547080.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph presents a unique and colorful scene, featuring multiple artistically painted panels aligned horizontally, each exhibiting vibrant designs with a folk or tribal aesthetic. The panels are placed on what appears to be a makeshift scaffold or outdoor display structure. The background is occupied by a traditional two-story white house, featuring a gabled roof and several windows, with a smaller, dark-colored structure to its right. The environment around the panel and house appears rough and somewhat scrappy; there are leafless trees, suggesting a colder season, and the ground is strewn with assorted debris and materials, possibly in a yard or an informal workshop area. The entire scene has a rustic and creative atmosphere, likely indicating a community or individual's effort in art or cultural expression in a casual, outdoor setting.","title":"Waves breaking along a corrugated sea wall in Zion, on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["544911","556230","554458","556231","544417","555321","545356","545221","547088","554549","549280","543348","551110","556167","551654","551081"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["panel","folk","scaffold","art","workshop","yard","effort","display","aesthetic","season"]}
