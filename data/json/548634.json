{"path":"548634.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a tropical island marina complex, surrounded by the vibrant blue and turquoise waters of the ocean. The marina is organized into a systematic grid-like layout with numerous docks and slips clearly visible, hosting a variety of boats. In the center of the marina, a large building possibly serving as the main hub or clubhouse is observed, surrounded by neatly arranged parking lots.\n\nThe island itself is bordered by sandy beaches visible on its periphery, accentuated by lush green foliage and palm trees spread throughout. The overall layout suggests a well-planned, possibly luxurious marine facility, catering to boating enthusiasts and oceanic activities.\n\nTo the top left corner of the image, another smaller section of the island can be seen, possibly used for similar recreational or residential purposes, showing more trees and some smaller structures. The water around the island is shallow near the edges, revealing coral or sand formations, and deepens into darker shades of blue further from the shore, indicating deeper waters beyond the reef.\n\nThe sky is clear with no visible clouds, suggesting favorable weather conditions possibly enhancing the vivid coloration of the sea. This setup suggests a tranquil and idyllic setting, likely designed for leisure and tourism.","title":"Marina and travel trailer park at long key.
