{"path":"557457.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a road scene dominated by a bright yellow fire hydrant positioned in the foreground on the left side. The hydrant is slightly weathered and is attached to a short chain, most likely for a cap that is not visible in this angle. It sits on a concrete curb beside an asphalt road, contrasting with the darker road surface.\n\nThe road stretches away into the distance, curving slightly to the right. It appears to be in a desolate or sparsely populated area, given the lack of visible traffic and buildings. The road is lined on both sides with light-colored sandy soil and small rocks, hinting at a possible coastal or desert-like environment.\n\nOn the horizon, the landscape is flat and barren with no significant vegetation or structures, except for a couple of small, silhouetted structures or signposts on the right side near the road. The sky above is bright and mostly clear with a few fluffy clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall lighting in the scene creates sharp shadows, emphasizing the sunny, arid conditions.\n\nThe absence of human activity and the stark, open landscape give the photograph a quiet, isolated feeling, focusing attention on the vivid fire hydrant and the open road stretching into the distance.","title":"Unfinished streets and utilities contrast with completed development (not shown) at Laguna Niguel. Work here was halted and other developments were restricted following state passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["554124","547653","549070","544178","554131","544043","545367","544080","544645","556615","545886","554127","553124","554155","545604","554130"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["hydrant","road","fire","signpost","asphalt","curb","chain","absence","lack","distance"]}
