{"path":"557319.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows two people working on installing or maintaining a large, angular structure made up of reflective glass or metal panels. This structure is most likely a solar panel array, given its reflective surfaces and outdoor setting. \n\nThe workers are crouched down and appear to be engaging with the panels or the structure's framework closely, possibly securing or adjusting components. Both are wearing light, casual clothing suitable for outdoor physical work and protective gloves. The person on the left wears a white shirt and light-colored pants, while the person on the right is dressed in a plaid shirt and darker pants.\n\nThe structure dominates the foreground of the image, leading the viewer's eye along its length thanks to its diagonal placement across the frame. The shiny surfaces of the panels catch the light and reflect some of the clouds visible in the sky above.\n\nIn the background, the sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue peeking through white and gray clouds, which are also reflected in the panels. The overall atmosphere suggests a bright but slightly overcast day, ideal for outdoor work that might be too strenuous under direct sunlight. There are no other prominent features or distractions in the environment visible in the image; it focuses clearly on the activity of the workers and the impressive structure they are working on.","title":"Flat plate solar heating collectors built by the Solaron Corporation, and installed on the roof of the Gump Glass Company in that city.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["555349","555347","557334","555341","555327","557320","555309","555323","555348","546929","557312","555331","553924","555293","547218","557328"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["panel","worker","distraction","structure","pant","glove","placement","work","ideal","cloud"]}
