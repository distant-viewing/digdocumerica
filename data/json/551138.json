{"path":"551138.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents a scenic view of a city skyline, likely taken from an elevated or hilltop location with natural surroundings framing the shot. The foreground is softly out of focus with leaves and branches hinting at a lush environment, suggesting that the viewpoint might be amidst a wooded area or park.\n\nThe cityscape in the midground and background features a variety of buildings which suggest a mix of architectural styles and periods, indicative of a city that has grown and developed over many years. Notable structures include taller buildings that are likely to be corporate or possibly governmental, marked with signage like \"CHARLESTON NATIONAL.\" These taller buildings suggest a center of business or downtown area.\n\nThe colors in the image suggest it might be late afternoon or early morning, given the soft lighting and the hazy atmosphere that bathes the city, which may also imply some humidity or mild pollution. The overall mood is serene and a bit nostalgic, possibly captured using film given the grain and quality of the colors. \n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a quiet moment observing a busy city from a peaceful, natural retreat, offering a contrast between urban development and natural beauty.","title":"Downtown Charleston seen from swathmore avenue on a hazy afternoon","placename":"Charleston (W.
