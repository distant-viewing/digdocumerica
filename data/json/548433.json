{"path":"548433.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of a large industrial area. The foreground prominently features a vast parking lot filled with numerous cars, ranging in various colors and models, indicative of a busy area such as an airport or a large commercial complex. Adjacent to the parking area, there are several large buildings, including a massive hangar or warehouse with large open doors.\n\nThe midground and background of the image reveal more industrial facilities, showing buildings with flat rooftops and several smokestacks, suggesting factories or power plants. There are also visible roadways intertwined throughout, facilitating the movement of vehicles in and out of the area.\n\nIn the distance, a dense urban skyline is visible with high-rise buildings that contribute to the impression of a densely populated city. The horizon stretches far into the background, with a hazy sky suggesting either pollution common in industrial areas or just the effect of the aerial distance. The overall composition gives a vivid portrayal of an industrial bastion, bustling with activity and surrounded by urban development.","title":"Parking fields at Logan Airport","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548444","548434","549506","555779","549523","549727","555755","548436","548015","555761","550886","549726","555771","555765","549969","549977"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["parking","airport","intertwine","portrayal","rooftop","facilitate","roadway","warehouse","midground","distance"]}
