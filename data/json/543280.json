{"path":"543280.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures four harbor seals resting on dark, rugged rocks. The scene is likely set in a coastal environment, evidenced by the wet, blackened volcanic rock surfaces that contrast starkly with the water around them, which reflects in deep, dark tones amidst patches of small pools. The seals show varied patterns of gray and white speckles across their bodies, which help them blend into the natural surroundings.\n\nThe composition of the image focuses on the contrast between the organic shapes of the resting seals and the jagged, harsh texture of the rocks. There's a muted color palette dominated by grays, blacks, and subtle touches of brown, underscoring the natural and somewhat somber habitat of these marine animals. The background and periphery of the image are slightly out of focus, directing attention towards the seals lounging at the center. The overall mood is serene, capturing a moment of rest in the wild habitat of these creatures.","title":"Seals swimming on rocks","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543275","543272","543274","547638","543292","543263","543281","549353","545173","543183","547471","543046","543139","550458","545122","543311"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["seal","habitat","rock","resting","blacken","rest","periphery","creature","lounge","speckle"]}
