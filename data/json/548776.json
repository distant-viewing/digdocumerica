{"path":"548776.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a landscape predominantly filled with dense green vegetation, likely a mix of forest and mangroves, which defines a remote, natural setting. Notably, two clear, long and straight white rectangles cut through the greenery, resembling unpaved runways. These strips are separated by a patch of land covered in similar green foliage, suggesting that they are part of an isolated or possibly abandoned airstrip. A white perimeter road or boundary encloses this airstrip area.\n\nThe surrounding area is a contrast of land and water. To the top right of the image, there's a view of shallow coastal waters that show aquatic vegetation and sandy patches, typical of a lagoon or coastal marsh environment. The coastline subtly curves around the greenery, integrating smoothly with the terrestrial environment. The overall impression is of a secluded airstrip located in a coastal or island region that is largely untouched by urban development.","title":"Waterfront development at North Key Largo with \"plugged\" canal.

Developers dig the canals anyway, and buyers can hope that the \"plugs\" will later be removed.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548642","548782","548787","556932","553670","548605","550575","548604","548785","556941","550757","554171","548630","550587","550749","548643"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lagoon","mangrove","runway","perimeter","land","greenery","integrate","island","separate","strip"]}
