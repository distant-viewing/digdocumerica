{"path":"543161.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal scene with children and adults engaged in activities on a sandy beach. The central feature of the image is a curvilinear, narrow channel that has been carved into the beach, creating a small river of seawater flowing back into the ocean. Foamy water is visibly moving through this channel. The sandy terrain around the channel is uneven and craggy, suggesting that either the water flow or human activity has shaped it.\n\nOn the beach, several individuals are spread out. A child in white shorts is running on the left side of the channel, while another child is observing the water flow. To the right, some adults and children appear to be walking or standing as they watch the scene or take photographs. In the background, the ocean horizon is visible under a clear sky, and the waves indicate a moderately windy day.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of leisure and curiosity, with beachgoers interested in the natural spectacle of water interacting with sand.","title":"Discharge pipe on Monterey Bay beach","placename":"Sunset Beach (Calif.)","location":"Sunset Beach, California","nn1":["552341","546982","543225","547009","543310","555402","543047","543254","557507","543322","543072","555892","543216","543395","543493","547909"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["channel","child","beach","flow","ocean","adult","beachgoer","spectacle","curiosity","water"]}
