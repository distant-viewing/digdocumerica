{"path":"548062.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant maritime scene featuring a small sailboat on a vast expanse of deep blue water. The sailboat, which appears to be a small catamaran or a similar sailing craft, is equipped with a sharply triangular main sail divided in color with darker green at the top and lighter near the bottom. The sail displays a logo or text at its center, adding a graphic touch to its design.\n\nOn board, a lone sailor is seen maneuvering the boat, dressed in a brown or dark-orange outfit. The sailor is bending over slightly in what seems to be in the process of adjusting the sail or perhaps steering the craft, indicating an active engagement with sailing duties.\n\nThe background offers nothing but the open, deep blue sea, indicating that the photograph is taken far from shore. The water's surface is textured with ripples and small waves, reflecting the sun's light and enhancing the dynamic feel of the scene. The color tone of the water suggests that the photograph was taken on a clear day with abundant sunshine.","title":"Sailing on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547463","544667","543953","549421","549409","549403","549405","548521","549394","549423","549386","545900","544663","556192","543217","549392"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailor","craft","sailing","sailboat","sunshine","steer","maneuver","duty","divide"]}
