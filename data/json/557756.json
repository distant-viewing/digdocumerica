{"path":"557756.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic outdoor scene that includes a variety of objects and decorations that resemble a roadside marketplace or an outdoor rural exhibit.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left, there is a wooden circle table displaying various hand-sized black pots or kettles. Adjacent to this, there is a sign posted on a wooden pole, hand-written which appears to list items for sale with prices, such as \"Blocks 50¢ Basket\", \"LARGE STICK 50¢ EACH\", \"MEDIUM STICK 25¢ EACH\", \"SMALL STICK 3/$1\", and an instruction, \"PLEASE PUT MONEY ON BACK PORCH TABLE.\"\n\nFurther to the right and dominating the middle of the image, numerous items are systematically placed, predominantly colored in red, which may serve practical or decorative purposes. These items include upright posts, a gas or oil pump with an old-fashioned globe lamp on top, and other posts that look like they might historically belong in a farm or rural setting.\n\nOff to the right side, there are more glass objects displayed, which seem to be blue mason jars, arranged neatly on a table. There’s also a farm-like water pump painted in red, adding to the rural and old-timey feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, one can see a windmill and a rural landscape that includes a fence, lush green trees, slightly overgrown grass, and an open field, which gives the photograph a serene and pastoral touch. The environment suggests it might be located at the edge of a farm or in a country setting, emphasizing a quaint and nostalgic atmosphere.","title":"Backyard display at the w.h.
