{"path":"550453.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a wild, rugged landscape, predominantly featuring two Dall sheep—distinct for their white pelage—positioned amidst a rocky terrain flecked with green vegetation. The setting exudes a remote, almost desolate vibe indicative of a high-altitude or mountainous region.\n\nThe upper part of the image shows one sheep positioned on a slightly elevated patch of ground covered with a mix of moss and small plants, showcasing reddish-brown soil and sporadic patches of green. This sheep looks toward the camera, allowing a clear view of its profile and curved horns, which identify it as a Dall sheep.\n\nIn the lower part of the photo, another sheep is captured mid-step as it navigates a rock-strewn gully or dried riverbed that cuts a swathe through the terrain. This area features assorted rocks and pebbles, varying in size, creating a natural pathway that the sheep appears to be following.\n\nBackground elements of this natural scene include additional rocky outcrops and sparse vegetation, contributing to an overall sense of a harsh yet serene wilderness habitat, typical of regions inhabited by such wildlife. The color palette is earthy, with tones of brown, green, and the stark white of the sheep's coats, contrasting sharply with their surroundings. The lighting suggests either an overcast day or a diffusion of light typical of higher altitudes.","title":"Two young rams nibbling on a dwarf alder 4 miles east of the designated pipeline crossing in the Atigun Gorge.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550452","550451","550445","550449","550446","550448","550450","543269","554928","544933","550456","544384","550444","554779","555820","552556"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","altitude","diffusion","fleck","gully","horn","inhabit","region","riverbed","pebble"]}
