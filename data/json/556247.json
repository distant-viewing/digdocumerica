{"path":"556247.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene featuring multiple individuals in what appears to be a formal or celebratory event. In the foreground, a man in a dark suit with a tie and white shirt is the focal point. He has a warm smile and is engaging with people around him. His hair is cut short, and he exudes a charismatic presence.\n\nTo his left, partially visible, is a man wearing a uniform with a peaked cap, suggesting he might be some form of official or belongs to a military or police force. Another man in the focal plane wears a light-colored suit and is also interacting closely with the central figure, partially extending his arm, perhaps in a handshake or gesture.\n\nThe background is dark and unfocused, putting the emphasis on the interactions between the central figures. The lighting highlights their faces and the upper torsos, accentuating the engaged and pleasant expressions.\n\nOverall, this image conveys a sense of camaraderie and respect among the individuals, with a formal setting that hints at a significant occasion.","title":"World heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a Black Muslim, attends the sect's service to hear Elijah Muhammad deliver the annual Savior's Day message in Chicago.
