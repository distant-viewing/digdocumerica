{"path":"551362.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a brownish-green frog on a muddy, algae-covered surface. The frog, likely in a natural wetland environment, has large, prominent eyes that seem alert and vigilant. Its skin appears moist and glistens slightly, suggesting the wet conditions of its habitat. The immediate surface around the frog is uneven and covered with a mix of mud and patches of green algae. Some areas of the mud reflect light, indicating the presence of water. There is no clear indication of the surrounding environment beyond the muddy area, as the focus of the photograph is primarily on the frog itself, highlighting details of its physical features and immediate surroundings. The natural, earthy tones of the scene contribute to a sense of the frog being in its natural, possibly camouflaged, setting.","title":"Frog on algae in a pond at Troutdale Ranch in Gravois Mills on the upper arm of the Lake of the Ozarks","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["549145","555197","551363","555066","557606","557587","544280","555067","554602","546161","550727","542554","547509","550219","548089","545033"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["algae","mud","indication","skin","wetland","habitat","surface","eye","mix","surrounding"]}
