{"path":"548487.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene likely viewed from an interior space looking out towards an airport runway. The composition is framed by parts of a window and a blurred foreground that may include parts of a person seated or standing inside, suggested by a silhouette of a head and arm. The vantage point offers a view over a white sedan parked outside, behind a metal fence.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a grassy area with a wooden structure that resembles a tower or scaffold, standing beside other industrial or airport-related buildings enclosed by a red and white barrier fence. Background activity focuses on an aircraft, appearing to be in mid-landing or takeoff, as it is close to the runway, which is visibly wet or reflective, possibly indicating recent rain.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of everyday operational life at an airport, seen from a slightly obscured, personal point of view that includes elements of both the observer's immediate environment and the wider airport scene.","title":"From the rear porch of his home at the southern corner of neptune and lovell streets, larry vienza watches jet take off from runway 15r-33l.
