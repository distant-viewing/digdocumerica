{"path":"553341.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated in a small boat (possibly a canoe) on a river or lake. The man appears to be in his mid-thirties or forties and has a rugged, slightly weathered look. He is wearing a dark blue jacket, a red flannel shirt underneath, and green pants. His hair is dark and tousled, and he has a contemplative or focused expression on his face as he looks off to the side. In his hands, he holds a wood-clad notebook and a pencil, suggesting he might be recording observations or thoughts.\n\nThe background shows a natural, somewhat barren landscape, likely during late winter or early spring as the trees are leafless and the ground on the riverbank appears muddy and devoid of grass. The riverbank is visibly eroded, indicating recent high water levels or frequent flooding. The water of the river has a murky greenish color, reflecting the overcast sky.\n\nThe mood conveyed by the image is one of solitude and introspection, emphasized by the solitary figure amidst the quiet, natural scene. The photograph has a somewhat vintage, timeless quality, likely due to the natural lighting and the classic, simple attire of the man.","title":"The Nashua River watershed group is on a canoe outing to study changing conditions in the part of the river around the Route 119 bridge in Groton.
