{"path":"542965.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures an isolated clump of dandelions growing through a crack in a sprawling asphalt surface. The focal area is a small mound of green leaves and bright yellow dandelion flowers blooming defiantly amid the grey, coarse-textured ground.\n\nIn the background, a largely unfocused industrial or semi-urban landscape is visible. There are several utility poles rising into the clear sky, equipped with multiple wires. The scene includes a high fence on the left of the midground, possibly enclosing a parking lot or industrial area. Beyond the fence, a small industrial structure with what appears to be a cylindrical tank can be seen, and a larger white building is visible against the horizon. The prominent feature in the upper right of the frame is a tall flagpole, bearing an unrecognizable flag, fluttering in the wind. The sky is blue, suggesting a clear, sunny day, which paints the entire scene with strong light and clear shadows. The overall ambiance of the image portrays a stark contrast between urban development and natureâ€™s resilience.","title":"Nature bursts through pavement in Eureka parking lot","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["552741","555186","544519","544523","545971","542552","544443","545718","545993","557487","542707","544574","543913","548060","546170","549127"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["dandelion","fence","flagpole","flutter","clump","asphalt","crack","grow","bear","resilience"]}
