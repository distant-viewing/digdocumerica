{"path":"553784.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a mining or quarry operation embedded in a mountainous landscape. The terrain is rugged and covered with sparse vegetation, primarily in shades of brown and green, suggesting a dry or arid environment. In the foreground, large piles of extracted earth materials are evident, alongside heavy machinery and some infrastructure, likely for processing or transporting these materials.\n\nA prominent road carves through the landscape, meandering its way through the hills. It is lined with barriers, and there are no visible vehicles on it, giving it a deserted look. Alongside the road, there are various structures, possibly storage tanks and buildings associated with the mining operation.\n\nIn the distance, the background reveals more mountains, rendered in a bluish haze that suggests they are further away. Most notable is a distinct peak, higher and less vegetated than its surroundings, with some small buildings or installations visible on its top, possibly for telecommunications or surveillance. The overall composition of the image captures a blend of natural ruggedness with industrial activity, highlighting human impact on a mountainous environment.","title":"Litigation has suspended construction of the h-3 freeway opponents claim construction would damage moanalua valley which should be declared a national historic landmark","placename":"Kaneohe (Hawaii)","location":"Kaneohe, Hawaii","nn1":["543729","544139","552686","555614","554765","555622","543754","544785","554836","544111","544418","551065","549174","554764","544781","545529"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","telecommunication","surveillance","render","embed","operation","ruggedness","material","carve","installation"]}
