{"path":"548531.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene by a waterfront. An elderly man rides his bicycle on a paved walkway alongside a guardrail, facing left-side of the frame. He is dressed casually in a blue short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, with glasses. His posture suggests a leisurely ride, taking in the scenery.\n\nThe background is also visually detailed. The water, calm and expansive, stretches across the midground and is bordered by a distant shoreline adorned with buildings and lush trees. On the right, there is a large marina filled with numerous boats docked in neat rows. The sky is clear and brightly lit, indicating a sunny day.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the cyclist and the waterfront, evokes a sense of peacefulness and leisure, typical of a beautiful, sunny day spent near the water. The structures and boats add depth and interest to the otherwise tranquil setting.","title":"Retired resident, formerly a worker up north, pauses at the municipal boat docks","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["543497","547158","547241","545090","548691","548537","548249","550826","542877","547595","547554","543465","543143","548247","547389","548521"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["ride","waterfront","cyclist","guardrail","spend","boat","marina","peacefulness","bicycle","walkway"]}
