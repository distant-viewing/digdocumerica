{"path":"553713.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a marching band positioned outdoors, engaging in a performance or preparing to perform. The band members are uniformly dressed in vibrant blue shirts with a floral pattern and white trousers. They are lined up in a formation, with some playing brass instruments and others likely holding different types of equipment related to their performance. \n\nIn the background, a thick tree canopy provides a lush green backdrop, casting shadows and adding a natural aesthetic to the scene. There is also a glimpse of a buildingâ€™s roof and a partial view of a bright orange car to the right side of the frame, which adds a contrasting color tone to the composition.\n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a structured, festive outdoor event, possibly in a park or a similar recreational area, enhanced by warm and sunny weather. The focus on the band members, their attire, and instruments emphasize the musical and cultural aspect of the event being portrayed.","title":"Preparing to parade on aloha day during annual aloha week of festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553173","557264","556283","556279","549702","554451","552656","553297","552661","546780","551770","553201","551012","553286","549567","551014"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["band","performance","instrument","member","brass","event","structured","shirts","casting","perform"]}
