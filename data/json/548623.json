{"path":"548623.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant beach scene filled with activity. In the foreground, dominating the frame is an elderly man with a determined expression, captured mid-motion as he pushes himself up from the sandy beach. He is balding with white hair on the sides of his head, and his skin appears tanned. He is wearing dark swimming trunks with a pattern around the waistband.\n\nBehind him, the beach stretches out to the ocean where various people are engaged in beach activities. The sea is a beautiful shade of blue, and the waves are gentle. Several individuals are in the water; some are swimming while others are standing or splashing around. The beach is populated with more people, some of whom are walking towards the water or playing in the sand.\n\nThe background is a serene view of the ocean meeting the sky on the horizon. The sky is clear and predominantly takes on a light blue tone, suggesting a sunny day. The atmosphere feels lively yet relaxed, typical of a day out at the beach.","title":"Lives of the many elderly persons who have chosen south beach for their retirement years revolve around the beach.
