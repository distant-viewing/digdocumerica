{"path":"550273.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction site with several elements clearly visible. In the foreground, there is a stack of brown roofing tiles packaged in cardboard boxes labeled \"Laheta Brick.\" These materials are neatly arranged next to a concrete curb, suggesting they are ready for use.\n\nThere are several buildings in different stages of construction spread across the midground.  To the left, there’s a small completed building with plain, light-grey siding and a shingled roof. A sign posted on this building is unreadable in the image. In the center and extending to the right, more prominently featured is a house under construction with distinctive architectural details, including a steeply pitched roof and external wood framing that's exposed. The structure’s design features decorative patterns in darker wood tones on a lighter wood background, and multiple windows are visible, some finished with decorative casings.\n\nIn the center of the scene, a construction worker dressed in a white shirt and dark pants can be seen walking, carrying some materials. This provides a sense of scale and activity at the site. The background reveals additional construction activity with another building partially seen and various construction materials scattered around.\n\nThe environment appears to be quite dusty and muddy, typical of an active building site. There are no trees or vegetation in immediate proximity to the construction, suggesting a relatively new development area. The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene, reducing shadows and contributing to the flat lighting of the photograph.","title":"Colonial style buildings will distinguish shopping center construction in Franklin, on Interstate 75 near State Route 73.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547833","557730","543583","547829","556619","550269","546414","546418","550737","546988","557728","548552","553922","547858","556642","550284"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","wood","site","material","package","building","reduce","roofing","complete","finish"]}
