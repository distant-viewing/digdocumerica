{"path":"545811.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet poignant desert landscape. In the foreground, a simple, standalone black cross is prominently featured. It stands on a mound of uneven rocks and stones, suggesting a makeshift or informal memorial or marker, possibly of a grave. The cross casts a long shadow toward the left side of the picture, hinting that it's either morning or late afternoon.\n\nBehind the cross, the landscape features sparse vegetation typical of desert environmentsâ€”small, hardy bushes and a few scattered yucca plants. About mid-ground, there is a partial structure built from stones, appearing to be remnants of a wall or small building, adding a sense of history or past habitation to the scene.\n\nThe background reveals a hilly terrain with rock formations and low mountains stretching across the horizon under a bright, clear blue sky, emphasizing the openness and isolation of the setting. The overall composition effectively conveys a feeling of solitude and remembrance within a natural and rugged environment.","title":"Old graveyard near lajitas, a town on the Rio GRande","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545826","545322","549041","544267","545809","545363","544019","545843","544401","545575","545895","544027","545789","545817","543718","545754"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cross","desert","memorial","featured","remembrance","stone","grave","poignant","marker","rock"]}
