{"path":"557701.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and somewhat cluttered rural scene, likely taken during the daytime given the lush greenery and soft natural lighting. In the foreground, there are several decrepit tractors with visible rust and disrepair. These machines are surrounded by tall wild grass and weeds, indicating that they have been unused for some time and are overtaken by nature.\n\nBeyond the tractors, deeper into the scene, there are at least three vehicles, including what appears to be vintage cars. These cars also show signs of neglect, similar to the tractors, with faded and possibly rusting exteriors.\n\nIn the background, there is a house with a front porch, looking relatively simple and functional compared to the state of the vehicles and machinery. It is flanked by a large field, presumably of corn, which appears well-tended in contrast to the machinery's condition. Additional smaller structures, possibly sheds or garages, are visible around the main house.\n\nThe surrounding area is lush with trees and green vegetation, suggesting that this location could be in a wooded or rural mountain area. The setting feels somewhat secluded, peaceful yet marked by the passage of time and abandonment of certain items to the elements. This scene could be telling of rural life's complexity, blending the beauty of nature with the relics of past industrial activities.","title":"Old cars at the Warren Brown residence on Hamby Street in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Helen was a typical small mountain community until 1969 when local officials, businessmen and residents decided to Renovate the business district with a Bavarian alpine theme. Property valuation in the village of some 270 residents was $1,484,775 in 1970 and had increased to $3,364,703 in 1974. A planning report cautions the need for balance between growth and public interest.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554211","543354","554561","552673","554212","553985","550279","554879","544323","544225","556313","551333","557670","547535","550795","543166"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["tractor","corn","machinery","weed","house","garage","time","disrepair","passage","daytime"]}
