{"path":"555022.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of various wet plant species, likely living in a moist environment such as a tide pool or wetland. The image features different types of seaweed or aquatic plants, emphasizing their diverse textures and colors.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a green plant with delicate, finely serrated leaves that resemble the fronds of a fern. This plant is slightly lighter green compared to its surroundings, making it stand out against the darker backdrop. Just above this plant, there are some distinct, translucent star-shaped structures, possibly buds or flowers of a marine plant. These structures have a glossy appearance, suggesting that they are wet, which enhances their visibility and gives a vibrant texture to the composition.\n\nAdditionally, there are red-brown stems that weave through the image, interconnected with both the green fern-like plant and the translucent star-shaped structures. Scattered across the image are small, orange globular elements that vary in opacity and size. These could be a type of berry or fruiting body associated with one of the plants.\n\nThe background is densely packed with a dark, maroon-hued seaweed or mossy substance that adds depth and contrast to the photo. The dark backdrop accentuates the more vividly colored plants and their details.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully showcases the intricate details and diversity of aquatic plant life, with a rich juxtaposition of colors and forms that highlight the vibrant ecosystem in which these plants thrive.","title":"Detail of wet ground moss cover in a Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555044","555093","555019","555069","554993","550670","555023","555192","543187","543558","543566","551354","542582","555050","544541","543201"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["plant","seaweed","star","frond","mossy","interconnect","type","bud","fern","tide"]}
