{"path":"550081.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a relaxed, outdoor family or communal gathering, focused on a barbecue. In the foreground, sharply in focus, is a small, open grill containing several burgers and a hot dog, emitting wisps of smoke, indicative of cooking. The background, blurred to emphasize the food in the foreground, features a grassy area where several people are gathered.\n\nThere appears to be four individuals in the blurred backdrop; two adults and two children. One adult, positioned on the left, is interacting with a small child who seems to be standing or toddling. Adjacent to them on a blanket, another child is sitting and playing, possibly with food or a toy. The second adult is sitting cross-legged on a blanket, seemingly in conversation or watching the child nearby.\n\nThe setting suggests a warm, casual day focused on leisure and food, with family members or friends enjoying each otherâ€™s company outdoors. The use of focus directs the viewer's attention to the food being cooked, which is a central activity of this gathering. The overall tone of the photograph is one of casual intimacy and communal enjoyment.","title":"Cookout at Huntington Beach on Lake Erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557793","557934","546127","550026","551276","543987","557933","544983","557801","552821","549444","554861","556298","557779","543631","558182"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["food","child","adult","blanket","family","wisp","gathering","playing","cook","cooking"]}
