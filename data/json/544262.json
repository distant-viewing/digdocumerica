{"path":"544262.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil, semi-rural setting, focusing on a weather-worn \"NO TRUCKS\" sign mounted on a metal pole at the side of a narrow, shaded road. The sign, showing signs of deterioration and rust, has bold black letters on a white background, though both are faded. It stands out against a densely leafy backdrop consisting predominantly of lush green bushes and trees.\n\nThe road itself, partially visible, is an uneven, possibly gravel path, leading away into the distance and gently curving out of sight. Its surface appears slightly damp, perhaps from recent rain, and it is shaded by the thick foliage that lines both sides. The soft, natural light suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting a calm ambiance over the scene.\n\nSurrounding the road, the vegetation is thick and verdant, adding a sense of seclusion and quietness to the scene. No people or vehicles are visible, emphasizing a stillness and possibly the effectiveness of the road signâ€™s message. The overgrown setting shows little sign of human interference, other than the path and the sign itself. The scene portrays a serene snapshot of a secluded road where nature predominantly holds sway.","title":"Abita Springs Wayside Park","placename":"Abita Springs (La.)","location":"Abita Springs, Louisiana","nn1":["543104","544245","555435","556429","556943","547659","557990","555582","552516","555647","552005","544292","554130","555628","552673","555818"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","road","interference","path","quietness","deterioration","sight","seclusion","message","rain"]}
