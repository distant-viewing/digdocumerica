{"path":"553311.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures a large crowd of people gathered in what appears to be an urban outdoor setting, possibly a square or a plaza. The scene is densely packed with dozens of individuals of various ages, standing and facing in different directions, hinting at a possible event or gathering that has drawn their attention, though it's not explicitly clear what they are looking at or listening to.\n\nThe attire of the crowd is quite varied, suggesting a casual to semi-formal event, with men mostly wearing shirts with or without ties and some in jackets, while women are dressed in a mix of dresses, skirts, and blouses, in a style that suggests a period look possibly from the 1970s or 1980s. The fashion includes a range of colors, though whites and light colors predominate, which may imply a summer season.\n\nIn the background, there are several tall fountains, adding a decorative element to the setting and likely contributing to the ambiance of the gathering place. The plaza is paved with what looks to be cobblestones or a patterned pavement, enhancing the outdoor, communal atmosphere. Trees and possibly some urban buildings can be glimpsed in the far distance, enclosed by what might be part of a park or a designed urban environment.\n\nThe individuals exhibit different expressions and levels of engagement; some are looking straight ahead attentively, others are talking to each other, and a few are glancing away, possibly distracted by other elements of the setting. This mix of engagement levels adds a natural and dynamic feel to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment of collective presence, gathering a diverse group of people together in a public space, likely for a common purpose or event that remains unspecified in the image. The composition and the slightly elevated angle of the shot capture the scale of the event and the density of the crowd effectively.","title":"Fountain Square audience listens to performance by Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553287","551798","553322","551852","550076","551801","551814","553264","543482","551811","547442","549734","551802","553273","551800","551656"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["crowd","event","plaza","engagement","cobblestone","dozen","level","mix","fountain","pavement"]}
