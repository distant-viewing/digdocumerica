{"path":"544099.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial mining operation in clear daylight. The foreground is dominated by a giant mechanical shovel excavator that is in the process of loading dug-up material into the back of a large, dump truck. The dump truck, notable for its large size and robust tires, appears somewhat smaller in comparison to the imposing size of the shovel excavator. \n\nThe excavator has a long arm and a large bucket used to scoop up the earth or ore, which is held high with a load ready to be dumped. The cabin of the excavator is visible, enclosed with windows, somewhat aged and industrial in appearance. Several other similar dump trucks are also visible in the frame, waiting or in motion, indicating a busy and active mining site.\n\nThe background features a stark and rocky terrain, typical of a large-scale excavation site. The exposed face of the earth displays layers of soil and rock, creating a rugged texture. The sky is clear, enhancing the sharpness and vivid colors in the photo, predominantly earthy browns and industrial yellows and grays of the machinery.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the essence of heavy industry and mining operations, emphasizing the scale and mechanical power used in such environments. The image conveys the harsh and dusty conditions typical of such settings, highlighting human engineering and industrial efforts in resource extraction.","title":"The Duval Corp.'s Sierrita mine.
