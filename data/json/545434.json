{"path":"545434.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, primarily featuring a steel factory or similar heavy industry complex. In the foreground, there are tree-lined edges partially obscuring the view, with hints of green foliage visible. Several rust-colored industrial train cars, likely used for the transportation of materials, are also seen in the foreground, set on tracks.\n\nMidground shows large storage tanks, possibly for oil or chemicals, characterized by their dark cylindrical shapes. Some of these tanks have conical roofs. There is a variety of industrial infrastructure including pipes and steel frameworks visible.\n\nIn the background, numerous tall smokestacks dominate the skyline, releasing large amounts of smoke into the sky which blends into a somewhat hazy atmosphere, indicating air pollution. The stacks vary in height and thickness, and some are connected to large buildings with sloped roofs.\n\nThe overall industrial complexity suggests heavy manufacturing activity, likely related to the production of steel or other heavy materials. The presence of smoke indicates active production processes. The scene lacks any visible human figures, focusing solely on the industrial elements and their environmental impact. The time of day appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and the color tones in the sky.","title":"U.S. steel plant emits smoke 24 hours a day","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545445","557225","549967","543011","545503","542999","549508","546908","550168","557374","544691","547010","546884","557214","553891","550983"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steel","production","thickness","tank","smoke","material","roof","oil","chemical","amount"]}
