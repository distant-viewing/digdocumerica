{"path":"548097.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a scenic landscape featuring a winding river cutting through a valley. The river appears calm, reflecting a hint of the blue sky above, and is flanked by rocky riverbanks and sparse vegetation, including shrubs and a few trees. In the foreground, gentle hillsides slope down towards the river, with a mixture of greenery and dried grass indicating a possibly arid region or the onset of autumn.\n\nIn the background, the photograph shows industrial activity and infrastructure. A bridge with a simple, modern design spans the river, connecting the two sides of the valley. Beyond the bridge, various buildings, likely industrial facilities or warehouses, are visible, spread out and suggesting some level of urban or semi-urban development. The buildings are predominantly low-rise and seem functional in style.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is dominated by rolling hills and low mountains, covered in a mix of forested areas and open spaces, suggesting a variation in vegetation. The sky is clear and vividly blue, adding a serene quality to the overall vista.\n\nThe composition of the image uses the river as a leading line drawing the viewer's eye through the scene, from the natural environments in the foreground through to the human-altered landscapes of the middle and far distances. This contrast between nature and development is a central theme of the image.","title":"The hood river near its exit into the Columbia River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548096","548098","542555","551195","555575","552107","548010","549514","550524","547807","551519","549081","558042","548050","545152","549456"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["river","valley","leading","bridge","onset","development","alte","vista","winding","scenic"]}
