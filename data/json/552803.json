{"path":"552803.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph shows a classic car displayed at an indoor event, possibly a car show. The car is primarily green with a black roof, and its hood is open to showcase the engine and the detailed customization inside. The engine compartment looks neat, with components that feature chrome finishes and parts painted in red and blue, giving a patriotic vibe. There's a display board resting on the windshield with text and information about the car, though the specifics are not clear from this image.\n\nThe setting is an indoor area with a dramatic tent-like ceiling that features broad stripes in dark red and black tones. The background is dimly lit, focusing attention on the brightly colored car. Another car can be glimpsed in the background, suggesting that this may be a part of a larger exhibition.\n\nThe overall composition centers on the car, employing the dramatic ceiling as an effective backdrop that adds to the presentation's visual appeal. The ambient lighting accentuates the shiny surfaces of the car and its polished engine components, creating a visually appealing contrast with the darker environment.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
