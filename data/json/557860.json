{"path":"557860.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a garage or a vehicle service area. It features three individuals focused on a dark-colored vintage car, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, with its hood open.\n\nOn the left, a young man in a blue shirt leans forward, peering at something under the hood, his expression suggesting he is engaged and possibly troubleshooting or explaining a mechanical issue. He has dark, medium-length hair and appears to be in a typical mechanic's uniform.\n\nIn the driver's seat of the car sits a middle-aged woman wearing glasses and a white sleeveless blouse. She is turned slightly towards her right, looking out of the open window with a calm demeanor. Her appearance is that of a customer or car owner who is either listening to the mechanics or waiting for the car to be fixed.\n\nAnother man, only partially visible on the right-hand side of the image, stands by the passenger side, facing toward the woman, possibly in conversation with her or observing the mechanic's work.\n\nThe car itself features a shiny black exterior with chrome details, including chrome mirrors and trim. The open hood reveals nothing specific about the engine or its condition due to the focus and angle of the photograph.\n\nThe background is a bit blurred but suggests an indoor garage environment with artificial lighting, contributing to the slightly blue tint of the image. There are no clear distinguishing features or objects in the background, which maintains the viewer's focus on the characters and the car.","title":"Unhappy car owner, foreground, watches as Public Works Department employees try to locate the reason her vehicle failed its inspection for the second time at an auto emission inspection station at Norwood, Ohio. She was armed with a receipt from the garage where she had taken it for repairs and was very angry the car had not passed. Patience and public relations is part of the testing job for the city employees.
