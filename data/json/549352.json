{"path":"549352.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a mature man walking along a rooftop covered with short grass and some scattered plants. He is dressed in a white coat, which suggests he may be a scientist, technician, or medical professional. The man is walking beside a series of horizontal pipes emitting a mist or spray of water, possibly as part of a cooling or irrigation system. Behind him are four large, cylindrical ventilation shafts that rise vertically from the roof, each topped with what appears to be a metallic, slightly domed cover. \n\nIn the background, lush green trees are visible, implying that the location is in a verdant, possibly hilly area. Distant buildings or structures can be faintly seen through the haze, further suggesting this scenario might be set in an institutional or industrial complex within a rich natural environment. The image has a somewhat ethereal quality, partly due to the mist and the soft focus, which lends a dreamy, almost surreal atmosphere to the scene.","title":"The water cooling system for the Ruder Boskovic Institute's cyclotron.
