{"path":"548382.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a busy urban area, likely part of a large city. The scene includes a mix of tall high-rise buildings, some of which are under construction as indicated by the cranes on top. There is a dense arrangement of buildings, showing slight variations in architecture and height. The primary focus can be drawn to the lower regions of the photograph where a bridge, possibly a large steel truss bridge, spans a gap and seems to connect different parts of the city.\n\nIn the middle of the image, a prominent chimney stands tall amidst the buildings, suggesting an industrial or utility area. Adjacent to the chimney is a long building with multiple rooftop units, which could be a factory or a similar facility. The roads are densely filled with cars, indicating traffic movement.\n\nThe street layout appears to grid-like, typical in many cityscapes. The area shows different types of vehicles mostly in medium to heavy traffic, moving through the roads outlined by the typical urban infrastructure of billboards and smaller structures.\n\nFurther analysis of the immediate surroundings and any notable landmarks or unique features is limited by the resolution and angle of the image, but the overall ambiance is that of a bustling, densely populated urban setting. The photograph's overall tone and lighting suggest this could be a scene from mid-to-late 20th century. The image itself is somewhat grainy, adding a historic or archival quality to the visual.","title":"The Queensboro Bridge at 59th Street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548318","548344","548414","548343","551507","548392","549979","550157","546569","553001","548326","555734","546621","555733","548364","555743"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["chimney","bridge","medium","traffic","visual","analysis","truss","limit","gap","billboard"]}
