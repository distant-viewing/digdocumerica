{"path":"549514.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph provides a scenic view of a river landscape bordered by steep cliffs. In the foreground, there's an industrial structure built along the cliff side right next to the river. It has multiple levels, rectangular in shape, and appears somewhat weathered, suggesting it has been there for some time. The structure could be an old power station or related to hydraulic management.\n\nThe river itself flows from the left to the right of the image and is characterized by active, whitish rapids indicating a swift current, leading into calmer, darker water as the river bends out of sight. The banks of the river are rocky and steep, covered with dense green foliage, enhancing the natural, rugged terrain of the area.\n\nIn the background, elevated on the cliff tops and at a considerable distance, two towers with observation decks can be seen under an overcast sky. These likely provide vantage points for viewing the landscape, and are indicative of a tourism-oriented infrastructure. There appear to be few buildings and minimal development near the towers other than green areas, further suggesting that this is a preserved or less urbanized region.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on contrasting the natural elements of the landscape with the human-made structures that blend into the environment's scenic views. The mood is serene and somewhat solemn, painted in muted colors likely due to the lighting and weather conditions at the time of the photograph.","title":"Waste water from City of Niagara Falls sewage treatment plant flows into the Niagara River from a discharge point below the falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549515","548061","548097","548098","551519","543647","548010","553462","553392","548050","550673","557239","553390","553393","549486","547952"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["cliff","river","tourism","rapid","tower","sight","elevate","preserve","current","time"]}
