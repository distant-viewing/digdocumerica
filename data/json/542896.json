{"path":"542896.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image features a large, vintage water tower positioned alongside railroad tracks. The water tower is elevated on a substantial red wooden frame with crisscross bracing, giving it a robust and utilitarian appearance. The tower itself is cylindrical and constructed from what appears to be rusted metal, painted in a faded red color that shows considerable weathering and age.\n\nThe tower's water tank is topped with a flat, slightly domed top and it includes a protruding horizontal beam on one side, connected to a pulley or a hoist system, indicative of its use for filling locomotives with water. In the foreground are railroad tracks that extend into the distance, implying this is part of a larger railway facility.\n\nThe surrounding area is mildly industrial and sparsely populated, with small buildings that seem utilitarianâ€”perhaps related to the railway or possibly small warehouse structures. The background shows a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds, hinting at a sunny, calm day.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of historic railway infrastructure, possibly no longer in active use but standing as a relic of the era of steam locomotives. The setting and composition of the photograph portray a nostalgic scene, emphasizing the durability and historical significance of the structures within.","title":"Water tower, California western railroad","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545912","553023","543007","552534","548325","543258","547969","547940","544706","550010","557090","543636","556783","547579","546752","543174"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["railway","locomotive","tower","railroad","pulley","track","hoist","elevate","weathering","crisscross"]}
