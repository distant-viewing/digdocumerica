{"path":"543166.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vast and densely packed car junkyard. The picture is set in a rural or semi-rural environment with a background featuring a distant view of dense residential housing, hinting at a suburb. The foreground features wild vegetation, predominantly tall, yellow-flowered weeds and shrubs, through which several old cars are partially visible.\n\nTwo classic cars, likely from the mid-20th century, are prominently displayed in the foreground. These cars, both painted in dark colors with visible signs of rust and decay, embody distinctive vintage automotive designs with curved body shapes, sleek lines, and intricate detailing typical of that era. These cars have evidently been left to the elements, and their surfaces show significant wear.\n\nThe vast array of cars in the background extends across the landscape, filling the scene almost to the horizon. The cars are tightly packed, varying in color and model, ultimately blending into a mosaic of muted colors that indicate varying degrees of exposure to weather and age.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a bright, clear day, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the vividness of the natural and man-made elements. The overall scene depicts a contrasting blend of nature slowly reclaiming space occupied by technology that has surpassed its usable life.","title":"Auto abandoned on beach","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["552999","555491","553004","545365","546268","545340","542590","555492","552739","542977","546249","553005","545303","542656","549023","553006"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","mosaic","suburb","junkyard","degree","weed","detailing","housing","vividness","technology"]}
