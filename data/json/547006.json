{"path":"547006.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people standing in front of a large building with a prominent architectural style. The building is a two-story structure with multiple balconies supported by white columns and decorated with railings. The facade appears to be painted in a red-hue, and two visible doors on the ground floor are topped with arched transoms.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of people, primarily women, are gathered, seemingly engaged in a social gathering or waiting in line. The women are dressed in dresses, skirts, and suits in a variety of colors like pink, blue, and peach, paired with hats, suggesting a formal occasion or church attendance. Their attire reflects a range of styles from more tailored suits to lighter, summer dresses. Several people are carrying purses and one woman is holding a bible or hymnal, enhancing the suggestion of a church-related event. They appear engaged in conversation or waiting for an event to begin.\n\nThere is greenery around, including trees partially visible above the building and a few smaller plants closer to the street level, adding a vibrant and peaceful element to the scene. The setting, combined with the architectural style of the building, suggests a warm, possibly southern U.S. location.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of social interaction in a community setting, characterized by formal attire and a significant architectural backdrop.","title":"Lining Main Street for a view of the Memorial Day parade","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["558402","548240","546210","556276","558395","552718","551852","558397","551063","556046","557641","556068","546233","557156","545870","547425"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["church","suit","dress","suggestion","woman","style","purse","event","occasion","people"]}
