{"path":"557002.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image offers a high-altitude aerial view of a meandering river flowing through a densely forested landscape. The river is a prominent, dark blue feature and snakes smoothly from the lower-right corner towards the center-left of the image, and curves slightly as it passes beneath the viewing perspective. Its banks are sharply defined, contrasting with the lush surrounding forests.\n\nThe forests are thick and continuous, exhibiting deep green colors, indicating a healthy, possibly coniferous woodland. The view extends to the horizon, where the land remains densely forested, and a very faint outline of mountains can be seen in the far distance under a pale sky. This suggests the photograph was taken during the day under clear or slightly hazy conditions.\n\nThere are no visible structures, vehicles, or people, highlighting the area's natural and untouched appearance. The overall impression is one of serene, uninterrupted wilderness, likely located in a region valued for its natural beauty and ecological importance.","title":"Aerial view of city water reservoir of Bremerton. It is located southeast of Bremerton in southern Kitsap County. This community and others like it will be affected by population growth when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550625","550576","550527","550622","550559","550621","550580","550571","550620","550570","555677","550616","550627","550577","542909","550531"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snake","forest","importance","river","altitude","curve","outline","corner","wilderness","bank"]}
