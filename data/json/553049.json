{"path":"553049.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive outdoor mining operation in a large pit mine. There are several layers or terraced benches visible, illustrating the depth and scale of the excavation. The terrain is mainly reddish-brown earth, indicative of rich, possibly mineral-laden soil. Several heavy mining vehicles, possibly trucks and excavation machinery, are distributed throughout the scene. These vehicles, which appear quite small relative to the vastness of the environment, are engaged in transporting material or are positioned for excavation work. The curves in the terraces show winding tracks used by these vehicles, emphasizing the operational nature of the site.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests that it is taken on a bright day with strong sunlight casting shadows and highlighting the textured and rugged surface of the mining site. The overall composition of the shot is from a high vantage point, looking downward into the pit, providing a comprehensive view of the mining operation and its surroundings. There is no visible vegetation or water bodies, reinforcing the industrial and barren nature of the landscape. This photograph captures the significant human effort involved in such large scale extraction activities, focusing on the alteration of natural landscapes for resource extraction.","title":"Twin-buttes mine.
