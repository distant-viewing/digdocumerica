{"path":"550727.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image depicts a natural, outdoor scene centered around a small body of still water, possibly a pond or puddle. The water's surface is dotted with several clusters of frogspawn, which are gelatinous masses containing frog eggs, indicated by their slightly off-white color and shiny texture.\n\nProminent in the foreground are grass-like plants, possibly reeds or rushes, dipping into and overhanging the water. These plants are dense and a darker green color, interspersed with bits of dead brown grass, indicating a natural, perhaps marshy, environment.\n\nThe water itself reflects a dark, almost black color, which could be due to the depth of the water or the silt and mud at its base. The reflection and shadows suggest it may be either dawn or dusk, or the area is heavily shaded, preventing harsh light from penetrating directly.\n\nThere is no visible sky or distinct background objects other than the natural elements of water and plants, emphasizing a secluded or self-contained ecosystem typical of wetland areas. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and natural, with a focus on the details and textures of the environment interacting with the lifecycle of frogs.","title":"Sludge deposits in the Androscoggin River, seen from the bridge at Turner","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["546161","549145","551362","551363","557587","547509","542554","543561","557606","555067","544765","555197","554591","544588","550785","542582"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["plant","lifecycle","water","silt","self","masse","rush","puddle","reed","mud"]}
