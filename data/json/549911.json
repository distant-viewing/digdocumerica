{"path":"549911.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful scene in an urban park. The image features a woman lying on the grass, clearly relaxed and possibly sunbathing. She is dressed in a short-sleeved, knee-length dress and appears to be resting comfortably with her eyes closed, arms gently resting by her sides.\n\nIn the midground of the image, there is a curved park bench along a paved pathway. The bench is empty except for a newspaper resting on one end, suggesting someone was there earlier or intends to return. The background shows a bustling park atmosphere with several people in distant motion, trees dotting the landscape, and a tall building looming behind the trees.\n\nThe overall ambience is one of tranquility amidst the city environment, accentuated by the deep greens of the grass and the contrasting dark color of the pavement and the bench. The photo seems to capture a moment of reprieve in the life of an urban park, with the focus on individual relaxation and leisure.","title":"Lunch-hour nap in battery park, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553065","551922","549922","546566","552722","552723","551682","546555","549321","550051","553043","549926","550067","550071","551860","555947"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["bench","rest","park","dott","sunbath","return","loom","intend","ambience","newspaper"]}
