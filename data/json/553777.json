{"path":"553777.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a serene and richly colored natural setting dominated by tones of deep oranges, pinks, and blues which seem to reflect the time of sunset or sunrise. The scene centers on a single bird standing at the edge of a body of water. The bird, appearing black and white in color, is particularly striking due to its long, thin legs and its contrasting coloring amidst the warm hues of the background.\n\nThe backdrop shows the sky mirrored upon the water, creating a symmetrical effect between the sky and its reflection. This doubling intensifies the color saturation, adding to the atmosphere of the scene. The ground around the water is sparse, covered with small rocks and perhaps some sand, hints of which are visible around the area where the bird stands. The simplicity and the minimal elements in the scene highlight the bird's elegant and solitary presence against the vibrant backdrop, providing a sense of calm and isolation.","title":"Hawaiian stilt bird, an endangered species, is returning to nest in ponds at the Kaneohe marine corps air station (on windward side of Oahu i.).
