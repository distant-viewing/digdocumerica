{"path":"544296.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph showcases an industrial scene primarily dominated by elements of power transmission. In the foreground, there is a large informational sign which reads \"GLEN CANYON-FLAGSTAFF TRANSMISSION LINE NO 1 345 kV\" and \"BUREAU OF RECLAMATION\". The sign is black with white text, featuring a stylized white lightning bolt. Positioned prominently at the upper part of the scene is a large electrical transmission tower. The tower is metallic and constructed in a lattice style, typical for high voltage power lines. Its structure forms an A-shape with cross bars supporting numerous insulators and power lines stretching outward and upward into the scene.\n\nThe background displays a partly cloudy sky with soft blue hues and fluffy, light gray clouds scattered across it. Below the sky, the landscape consists of arid terrain with some green vegetation, suggesting a desert or semi-arid zone. No human figures or animals are visible in the image, emphasizing the industrial and uninhabited nature of the location. The entire composition conveys a sense of isolation and the scale of the infrastructure related to power transmission in remote areas.","title":"Power lines","placename":"Red Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Red Rock, Arizona","nn1":["548136","544355","549110","544300","555574","553028","547929","552524","548145","557977","544277","553830","544405","543728","542643","546054"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["transmission","power","tower","voltage","line","bolt","lattice","cross","bar","sign"]}
