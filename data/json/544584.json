{"path":"544584.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a complex and somewhat surreal scene where a car appears to be wedged in a V-shaped fork of a large tree. The car, seemingly a sedan, is covered in mud, suggesting it may have been washed up into the tree by a flood. The scene is outdoors, and the background reveals a river with murky water, indicating a potential flood scenario. Behind the river, there’s dense foliage, comprising primarily of green trees, which harmonize with the clear sky barely visible through the canopy.\n\nThe tree itself has a rugged bark, showing signs of weathering, which might hint at its strength and age. To the left of the tree trunk, a part of a chain-link fence is visible, adding to the context that this might be a riverside park or protected natural area. The lighting in the photo is natural, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the tree’s bark and the dirt-covered car.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the car improbably perched in the tree, creates a striking visual narrative, possibly relating to the power of natural events like floods.","title":"River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544472","548750","552083","548298","548751","547835","546315","546318","542853","546173","546405","547911","547597","552439","546406","547132"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["flood","bark","car","tree","strength","relate","cove","wash","perch","mud"]}
