{"path":"545562.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of vibrant yellow flowers growing on rocky terrain in the foreground, set against a stunning geological backdrop. These flowers, which have tall, thin stems and golden blooms, cluster amongst scrubby vegetation and rough stones at the lower part of the image.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by a large, dramatic rock formation characterized by a distinct natural arch. This sandstone arch has a smooth, rounded shape and is quite large, creating a window through which the blue sky can be seen. The colors of the rock range from deep reds to lighter shades of orange, suggesting layers of geological history and erosion.\n\nThe sky is clear and intensely blue, which contrasts starkly with the earthen tones of the rock formation. This composition of natural elements and vivid colors highlights the harsh beauty and scale of desert landscapes, possibly somewhere in the American Southwest. The overall setting evokes a feel of remote wilderness and natural grandeur.","title":"Narrow-leaf yacca and angel arch","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545711","549228","545797","545718","544938","545296","545703","545719","544894","545723","544887","549018","545566","544939","545727","545568"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["arch","rock","formation","flower","stem","history","grow","bloom","close","up"]}
