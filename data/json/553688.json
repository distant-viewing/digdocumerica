{"path":"553688.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to capture an everyday scene on a busy street, likely in a tropical or subtropical location, distinguished by lush palm trees that line the streets and dominate the composition. The street is bustling with activity, filled with pedestrians who seem engaged in leisurely activities, suggesting this might be a tourist area. There is a mix of modern and traditional architecture; a prominent traditional thatched structure is visible on the left side behind dense green foliage, contrasting with the more modern buildings in the background. \n\nIn terms of transportation, there's partial visibility of a white car and what looks like the front of a bus (or a large vehicle) on the left side. Several street lamps and traffic lights structure the urban scene, aiding in the ordered movement of pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nThe lighting conditions suggest a bright sunny day, enhancing the vibrancy of the greenery and contributing to the shadows visible on the ground, adding depth to the photograph. This setting alludes to a warm, inviting climate typical of tropical locales, often associated with holiday destinations.","title":"Tourists throng kalakaua avenue, the main street of the popular waikiki beach area","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553682","554083","551471","552379","553689","551685","551478","556195","544013","551496","556732","549659","549679","553845","553301","551652"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["pedestrian","street","distinguished","holiday","warm","stroot","order","aid","destination","locale"]}
