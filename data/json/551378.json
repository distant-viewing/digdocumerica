{"path":"551378.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, dim lighting and the purple hue of the sky. The composition focuses on a single tree, which fills the majority of the frame. The tree is densely foliated, likely a type of deciduous species, and it stands out with its dark, richly colored leaves against the contrasting lighter sky.\n\nPerched at the top of the tree is a bird, poised elegantly. The bird, potentially a heron or similar wading species, is outlined by the sky, its long neck and beak clearly visible, suggesting it is looking out into the distance. Its silhouette adds a dynamic element to the otherwise peaceful and static image.\n\nThe scene conveys a sense of tranquility and simplicity, emphasizing the beauty of nature through minimalist elements â€” the single tree, the solitary bird, and the gradient sky. There are no other objects or distractions in the background, which enhances the focal point of the photograph, allowing viewers to appreciate the subtle interplay of natural forms and colors. The overall mood is quiet and contemplative.","title":"Immature little green heron in treetop overlooking ha ha tonka lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["547318","543595","550388","544547","543063","548832","553776","554601","551379","544601","554099","557628","550471","548731","553777","545142"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","specie","heron","beak","distraction","poise","appreciate","majority","perch","neck"]}
