{"path":"554102.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a serene coastal scene. In the foreground, rugged rocky shorelines with scattered low vegetation and small tree groupings, that appear to be growing almost directly from the rocks, can be observed. These rocky formations extend into the water, creating a natural contrast with the calm ocean.\n\nSeveral clusters of dark, jagged rocks protrude from the water surface near the shore, and their uneven shapes are distinctive. The water is relatively tranquil, with subtle ripples, reflecting a gentle sea conducive to such landscapes.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a small peninsula or outcrop that supports a unique formation of trees with umbrella-like canopies, likely a kind of pine based on their shape and structure. This thriving greenery settles on an elevation above the water level, adding a vibrant organic texture to the landscape.\n\nIn the background, across the bay, lies a town with various buildings, including homes and possibly small commercial structures. The architecture looks typical of a small coastal settlement. Beyond the town, rolling hills partially covered in either fields or lightly forested areas stretch into the distance, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe scene conveys a peaceful coastal town atmosphere, highlighting the interaction between natural and human-made environments. The land, even developed, shows a high degree of coexistence with its natural surroundings, suggesting a community living in harmony with the coastal landscape. The color palette generally consists of deep blues, vibrant greens, and muted earth tones, which are typical of seascapes, enriching the overall calm and natural vibe of the setting.","title":"Shoreline scene in the Hilo area","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["557429","543337","545173","543289","543362","547984","553805","542870","543068","543297","545110","543427","543291","547602","542910","542917"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["town","grouping","formation","shape","peninsula","degree","harmony","seascape","outcrop","umbrella"]}
