{"path":"543127.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic silhouette of a large, rugged rock formation taken against a sunset backdrop. The sun, seen as a small, radiant point of light, appears near the base of the formation, creating a starburst effect through a narrow gap in the rocks. This presence of the sun provides a striking contrast and highlights the intricate outline of the formation.\n\nThe rock formation itself is jagged and irregular, dominating the foreground and middle of the image. Its silhouette reveals various protrusions and indentations, mimicking perhaps the profile of a face or an animal, depending upon the viewer's interpretation. \n\nIn the background, the sky transitions smoothly from a deep navy at the top of the frame to a softer blue near the horizon, suggesting that the photograph was taken during twilight. Beyond the immediate silhouette to the right, another part of the rock formation or distant hills are faintly visible against the lighter sky, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene yet potent, as it captures the stark beauty of nature in a simplistic yet impactful composition. The interplay of light and shadow, along with the natural ruggedness of the rock formation, evokes a sense of timelessness and the enduring strength of natural landscapes.","title":"Tufa \"towers\", porous rock formations, created by the heavy saline content of Mono Lake","placename":"Lee Vining (Calif.)","location":"Lee Vining, California","nn1":["550428","544359","544392","544376","545586","555206","544363","545775","552444","545805","552890","552891","543311","545801","555047","557591"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["formation","rock","silhouette","protrusion","interpretation","timelessness","strength","navy","sun","gap"]}
