{"path":"543331.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of hikers exploring a dense forest. The prominent feature of the image is a large tree covered with hanging moss, creating a curtain of elongated, stringy vegetation that lends an almost ethereal quality to the scene. Sunlight filters through the forest canopy, casting dappled light patterns on the hikers and the forest floor.\n\nThe group consists of several individuals, all dressed suitably for hiking, with backpacks and casual outdoor attire. Their attention seems focused on the moss-covered tree, suggesting a moment of observation or learning. The forest itself appears lush, with a variety of undergrowth and other towering trees that contribute to the feeling of being deep within a wooded area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a sense of adventure and exploration, highlighting the natural beauty and the serene atmosphere of the forest setting.","title":"A nature - appreciation walk organized by the sierra club","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["554663","554705","543388","553357","545290","543446","555058","554502","554985","542958","555000","554662","554961","557005","555043","555054"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["forest","hiker","moss","learning","undergrowth","backpack","hiking","explore","group","curtain"]}
