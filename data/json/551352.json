{"path":"551352.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph offers a tranquil view of a water body with subdued natural tones. The main features of the image capture the clear blue-green water surface, through which submerged branches and foliage are visible. At the forefront, there are a few remnants of what appear to be tree stumps, sticking out of the water, worn and darkened, probably by prolonged exposure to the aquatic environment. \n\nScattered on and slightly below the waterâ€™s surface are leaves, some belong to water lilies noticeable with their round shapes and characteristic notches. Giving a touch of dynamism to the otherwise calm scene, the leaves drift on or just under the water surface, adding texture and points of interest across the picture.\n\nThe water itself reflects a cloudy sky, suggesting an overcast day. The reflection adds a sense of depth and perhaps a slight chill to the air, common in scenes where water and overcast conditions combine. The boundary between water and air is subtly marked by these natural elements, blending sky and water seamlessly at the edges of the image. \n\nOverall, this photograph exudes a serene and absorbed natural scene, typical of a quiet pond or backwater where plant life and water coexist untouched by active human interference.","title":"Lake in the Ha Ha Tonka region, one of two formed by Gunter's Big Spring.
