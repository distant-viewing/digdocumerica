{"path":"556487.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph portrays an older woman standing outside in a rural setting, gazing directly at the camera with a semi-serious expression. She has medium-length graying hair and is dressed in a light-colored sleeveless top. The woman stands slightly off-center to the left in the frame.\n\nBehind her is a small, quaint house that appears to be of simple construction. The house features a covered porch with white railing that contrasts with the darker shingle siding. It has a gable roof, and the front door is noticeable on the porch, partially obscured by a porch post. The exterior walls of the house are made of what appears to be asphalt shingles.\n\nOn the left side of the image, partially cut off by the frame, there is a large, old wagon wheel standing upright on the ground, adding a rustic or historical element to the scene. Some foliage and natural elements are visible, indicating the house is in a somewhat wooded or rural area. The lighting suggests it is a bright day with ample sunshine, casting clear shadows and illuminating the scene vividly.","title":"Lilly Mae Sheets, Fireco, West Virginia, near Beckley, stands outside her Raleigh County home. Her husband was hurt by a roof fall in the mines in November, 1973, and did not receive workman's compensation until March, 1974. They received no welfare or food stamps, but were given credit at a local grocery store. The delay in receiving compensation was a frequent complaint of the miners'.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554798","552680","554051","553480","547372","547281","557114","556541","546987","548246","555530","554192","543864","548295","557157","553499"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["porch","house","shingle","sunshine","gable","asphalt","wagon","woman","siding","wheel"]}
