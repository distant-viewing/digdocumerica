{"path":"554898.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a casual, lively scene featuring a group of young people at a gas station. There are four individuals prominently visible in the image, with a focus on the two young women in the foreground. The woman on the right has long, brown braided hair, wearing a pink tank top and a necklace. She smiles directly at the camera. Next to her, the woman on the left sports curly blonde hair and a white tank top, also smiling at the camera, holding what appears to be a striped paper cup.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there are two young men. The one on the left is engaged in a phone conversation, holding the receiver to his ear, looking somewhat pensively off to the side. He has long, blonde hair and wears a plaid shirt. Another man stands behind the group, partially obscured, facing away and interacting with someone inside a pickup truck.\n\nThe setting includes a white pickup truck, parked at the station, adding a rustic touch to the scene. Above the men, a gas station canopy with a \"CITE\" sign is visible, suggesting the location type. The ambiance is relaxed and friendly, capturing a moment of youthful interaction and leisure in a small-town or suburban setting. The clothing and hairstyles of the individuals, along with the vintage look of the vehicle and phone, suggest this photograph might be from a few decades ago, possibly in the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"Group of teenagers in the town of Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["557834","555497","557766","554871","550096","554872","554873","555486","555465","557684","555498","557908","554178","555485","555457","555502"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["phone","station","pickup","gas","hair","woman","tank","truck","ear","necklace"]}
