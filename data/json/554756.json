{"path":"554756.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive natural landscape dominated by a tranquil river, surrounded by a diverse array of vegetation that suggests an autumn setting. The river winds gently through the center of the image, flanked by marshy areas with tufts of grass rising above the water's surface.\n\nThe landscape is predominantly covered with a mix of trees showcasing autumn colorsâ€”yellows, reds, and greens providing a colorful contrast to the subdued tones of the marsh and water. On the left side of the image, dense growths of trees including evergreens and deciduous varieties are visible. The right side also features similar trees but with one particularly prominent bare tree, lacking leaves, which stretches its branches toward the sky.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with large, white to grey clouds scattered across a bright, pale blue canvas, suggesting variability in weather that could be typical of autumn. There is no visible human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing the natural and pristine condition of the environment. The overall composition conveys a sense of peacefulness and the untouched beauty of a wild landscape during the fall season.","title":"Fall scene on the north branch of the moose river at thendara bridge showing tawny marsh grasses, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Old Forge (N.Y.)","location":"Old Forge, New York","nn1":["552599","557159","554712","554713","554715","552600","554758","554757","557127","552692","542653","546090","554714","555075","550656","554738"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["autumn","variability","evergreen","canvas","marsh","peacefulness","tree","river","yellow","growth"]}
