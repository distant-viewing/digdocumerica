{"path":"543618.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene at dusk. The composition prominently features a small blue and white boat resting on a dark pebble beach in the foreground on the right side, with the edge of the water just brushing its base.\n\nThe lake itself is calm, with subtle ripples on the surface and stretches across the middle of the frame, extending to the horizon where it meets a line of distant mountains that are partially snow-covered. These mountains create a majestic backdrop, lending a sense of tranquility and vastness to the scene.\n\nTo the left in the midground, there is a small island clad with a few sparse trees, which stands alone in the water, adding interest and a sense of scale to the panorama.\n\nThe sky above is a tapestry of colors, fading from a deep blue at the top, merging into lighter shades and hints of orange and pink near the horizon, suggesting the time is either early morning or late evening.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a quiet, picturesque natural environment, evoking feelings of peace and solitude.","title":"Beached boat at twilight","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["551207","551280","543577","552319","550299","550324","554752","554405","543531","543604","543613","557562","542994","554759","550735","552336"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["panorama","tapestry","brush","pebble","peace","mountain","lakeside","clad","island","merge"]}
