{"path":"547741.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a moment of joy and activity outside a picturesque house on a sunny day. The focus of the image is an elderly woman, who is laughing heartily as she carries a colorful quilt in her arms. She is wearing glasses, a floral blouse, and a patterned skirt, with an overall cheerful and vibrant appearance. The quilt she holds features a variety of patterns suggesting it's handmade, contributing to the rustic, homely feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is an old, grand two-story house characterized by its Victorian architectural elements, including arched windows and a gabled roof. The house is painted white and is surrounded by a lush, grassy area dotted with yellow flowers, likely dandelions. Trees and a partially visible swing set in the distance complete the serene and pastoral setting. This suggests the photo might have been taken in a rural or semi-rural area, emphasizing a sense of community and traditional values.\n\nThe scene reflects a moment of simple pleasures, possibly during a family or community gathering.","title":"Mrs. John Bettger, president of the Fairmont Golden Circle Senior Citizens Club, on lawn of Fairmont's oldest house.
