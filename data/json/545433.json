{"path":"545433.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at twilight or early evening. The foreground is dimly lit and features indistinct greenery and some darker areas that might be parts of vehicles or structures slightly obscured by shadow. The main focus of the image is on the large industrial plant in the background, which is emitting plumes of smoke or steam from multiple stacks. The sky has a gradient of purple and blue hues, suggesting evening or early night time, which contrasts with the muted lighting on the plant and the more vivid colors of the smoke. The plant itself consists of several structures with varying heights, including tanks, pipes, and buildings with flat roofs. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of heavy industrial activity, possibly linked to manufacturing or processing, set against the backdrop of environmental impacts indicated by the smoke.","title":"U.S. steel plant operates 24 hours a day","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["544173","544684","552165","557381","552164","546042","544700","551140","546384","550820","544696","551026","542999","545239","547200","545446"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","plant","evening","night","link","gradient","manufacturing","twilight","plume","pipe"]}
