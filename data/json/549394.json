{"path":"549394.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic sailing scene, depicting a large sailboat in motion on a body of water, presumably at sea. The angle of the image presents a close-up view of the boat from the side, slightly tilted towards the viewer, emphasizing the breadth of its large, white sail which occupies most of the frame. The sail is taut and filled with wind, curving gracefully towards the top.\n\nThe hull of the boat is dark and sleek, slicing through the water, which is captured mid-splash, indicating a brisk speed. The water appears choppy, with waves around the boat, suggesting a windy day ideal for sailing.\n\nOn board, there are at least three crew members visible. They are engaged in various activities, likely managing the sail and steering the boat, demonstrating teamwork and coordination. The crew members are dressed in casual, practical attire suitable for sailing.\n\nIn the background, another sailboat can be observed, identifiable by its white sail at a distance. This adds a sense of scale and competition or companionship on the water. The sky is overcast, lending a slightly moody atmosphere to the setting, which contrasts with the vigorous activity on the sea.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the race.
