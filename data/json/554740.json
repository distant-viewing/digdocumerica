{"path":"554740.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures the intricate beauty of tree branches against a clear blue sky. The branches, likely in early spring, are lined with small buds or blossoms that catch the sunlight, giving them a delicate, almost glowing appearance. The trees' limbs intersect at various angles, creating a natural composition of lines and patterns. The color contrast between the dark, nearly silhouetted branches and the bright sky enhances the visual impact of the image. There's a softness to the light that suggests either early morning or late afternoon. This photo emphasizes the renewal and subtle beauty found in natureâ€™s details.","title":"Closeup view of tamarack needles and branches at Moose River Plains","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545072","546533","543551","546162","543621","547634","542927","547733","548744","550033","548709","551365","545292","548687","554732","543448"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["branch","renewal","limb","bud","blossom","softness","beauty","spring","angle","impact"]}
