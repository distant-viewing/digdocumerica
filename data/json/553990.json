{"path":"553990.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset at sea. In the foreground, a solitary sailboat floats on the calm waters. The sun, hidden behind a thick layer of clouds, casts vibrant rays of light that pierce through the clouds, illuminating the sky and parts of the ocean with a warm glow. The sky is a dramatic backdrop with varying shades of deep blue and dark clouds blending into a lighter, yellowish hue near the horizon where the sun sets.\n\nThe sailboat, quite modest in size and detail, has its sails down, suggesting that it may be anchored or simply drifting slowly. The ocean's surface appears smooth and reflective, amplifying the effect of the sunset.\n\nAt the right side of the image, a distant headland juts into the sea, silhouetted against the sky and partially obscuring the setting sun. This headland seems densely covered with vegetation or trees.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes tranquility and the majestic beauty of nature, with particular focus on the interplay of light and shadow created by the sunset and clouds.","title":"Manele Bay, where developers plan to build two hotels (Lanai has only a single old one at present). In May, 1973, against more moderate staff recommendation, the land use commission agreed to reclassify 22,340 acres for urban use. The decision is being contested. Developers hope to increase the island population from the present 2,500 to 12,500 people.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["548117","543613","553991","548118","552293","552039","552038","552344","545170","544251","543411","551215","543143","543880","550296","545234"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["sunset","cloud","sailboat","sun","ocean","sea","ray","sail","glow","interplay"]}
