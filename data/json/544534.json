{"path":"544534.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts three individuals on an airboat gliding through a body of water, possibly a lake or a slow-flowing river. The setting suggests a sunny day with clear skies and a natural, grassy landscape visible in the distance.\n\nThe airboat is predominantly white with a large, metal-framed fan at the back that provides propulsion. The deck where the individuals are seated is surrounded by a protective metal railing.\n\nAt the front of the boat, seated and taking an active role in navigating, is an older man wearing a white shirt and dark pants. He is leaning forward, possibly adjusting something, while shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand.\n\nBehind him stands a younger man dressed in a white tank top and dark sunglasses, hands resting casually on the metal railing. He appears to be watching the path ahead or enjoying the ride.\n\nSeated towards the rear of the boat is a woman wearing a light-colored top, sunglasses, and what seems to be a sun hat, possibly observing the surrounding scenery.\n\nThe calm water reflects the blue of the sky and the greenery of the distant vegetation, enhancing the serene and leisurely feel of the scene. The photograph captures a moment of relaxed exploration or travel over water, surrounded by nature.","title":"Air boat for tourists along taMiami trail through everglades","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["546356","546348","551255","546352","546976","553411","544980","545654","554199","554177","554198","553403","544532","546053","543940","548525"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sunglass","railing","seat","metal","glide","fan","sun","shield","boat","rear"]}
