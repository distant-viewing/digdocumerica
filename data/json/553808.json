{"path":"553808.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a serene outdoor landscape, capturing two deer on a sloping hillside. The hill is bathed in a warm, natural light that highlights the gradient from a deeper, shadowed green at the top to a brighter, sunlit green and yellow closer to the bottom where the deer are standing. These deer, centered in the image and spaced slightly apart, add a sense of peaceful wildlife presence to the scene.\n\nThe background is composed predominantly of the hill, which fills the frame diagonally from the upper left corner to the bottom right, creating a dynamic visual flow. Above the hill, there appears to be a darker area which might suggest the presence of foliage or shadows cast by trees just outside the frame. The environment looks natural and undisturbed, suggesting a remote or protected area.\n\nThe lighting and vivid colors in the photograph give it a vibrant, almost picturesque quality, emphasizing the beauty of the natural setting and the grace of the deer within it. The overall composition and the presence of wildlife evoke a sense of tranquility and a connection to nature.","title":"Deer at sunset.  (from the sites exhibition.
