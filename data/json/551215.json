{"path":"551215.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water, likely a river or a lake. In the foreground, there's a boat moving from left to right, partially illuminated by the backdrop of the glowing sunset. The boat appears to be an older style passenger or recreational vessel, characterized by its multiple decks.\n\nThe sun is setting directly in the center of the frame, casting a warm, golden hue across the sky and creating a pathway of reflected light on the water's surface. This reflected light adds a shimmering texture to the water, enhancing the overall tranquility of the scene.\n\nOn both sides of the water, land can be seen, densely covered with trees. The details of the shoreline are mostly silhouetted due to the backlighting of the setting sun, creating a strong contrast between the dark edges of the landscape and the brightly lit sky.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph embodies a calm and peaceful evening, with the boatâ€™s presence adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil water and landscape. The use of natural lighting and the timing of the shot allow the rich colors of the sunset to dominate the scene, evoking a sense of quietness and relaxation.","title":"Excursion boat \"Tom Sawyer\" cruises on the main Osage arm of Lake of the Ozarks.","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["552038","551206","543880","543143","547230","557447","552294","543411","552293","550303","551214","543613","550771","543956","545170","552039"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sunset","boat","timing","embody","quietness","sun","backlighting","water","shimmer","relaxation"]}
