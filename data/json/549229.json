{"path":"549229.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural landscape under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, there's a variety of wild grasses and small flowers, including prominent white blooms that stand out against the dense, dark green grass. Among these grasses, patches of bright yellow flowering plants add a vibrant contrast near the bottom right.\n\nFurther away, the landscape opens into a broad field colored with shades of green, yellow, and subtle hints of brown, suggesting either a change in vegetation or the effects of seasonal changes. In the middle distance, a few small structures are faintly visible, indicating some form of human presence or agricultural activity.\n\nThe background extends into a slightly hilly terrain under a dynamic sky filled with white and shadowy clouds, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. The overall composition of the photograph is balanced, with a natural flow from the richly detailed foreground to the expansive, open fields in the distance, creating a sense of depth and tranquility.","title":"Flowers amid the prairie grasses on the crow indian reservation","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549227","557191","549238","549157","549134","549158","549186","557098","551370","550667","545040","549146","557099","557104","549251","556990"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["change","grass","flower","field","bloom","open","distance","brown","flow","effect"]}
