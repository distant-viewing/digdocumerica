{"path":"544980.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, outdoor scene involving three individuals on a small boat, which appears to be a canoe, in a body of calm, reflective water. The background features a rocky shoreline with sparse vegetation under a clear sky, creating a sense of a quiet, remote area possibly used for leisure or fishing activities.\n\nIn the picture, an older man stands at the stern of the boat; he wears a light-colored shirt and dark trousers, and he is using a small wooden oar or pole to navigate or stabilize the canoe. Near the center of the boat, a young boy holds an oar as well, positioned as though he is learning or participating in propelling the boat. He is dressed in a casual short-sleeve shirt and shorts. Near the bow of the canoe, a young woman, also in casual attire consisting of a short sleeve shirt and shorts, is involved in managing another oar, actively engaging in directing the boat.\n\nAll three individuals are focused on their tasks, suggesting a moment of cooperation and shared activity. The canoe contains visible equipment or personal items, hinting at a day spent outdoors, possibly involving fishing or merely rowing along the water. The surrounding water is still, reflecting the blue of the sky and hinting at a tranquil, slow-moving day on the water. The setting and activity suggest a peaceful recreational outing, emphasizing enjoyment and camaraderie among the boat's occupants.","title":"Netting jellyfish in order to study their ability to fluoresce.
