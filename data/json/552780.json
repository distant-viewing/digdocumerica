{"path":"552780.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures an older man standing beside a car with its door open, presenting a glimpse into the interior of the vehicle. The man is dressed in a windbreaker jacket and slacks, accessorized with sunglasses, conveying a sensible, perhaps leisure-oriented demeanor typical of the 1960s or 1970s. He is leaning slightly on the car door, looking outward, away from the camera.\n\nThe perspective of the photo is from the driver’s seat, creating an engaging point of view. This captures the richly appointed car interior, featuring a well-designed dashboard with chrome accents and wood paneling. The steering wheel is prominent, large, and circular, with a classic tri-spoke design.\n\nThe background, although slightly out of focus, shows a parking lot with multiple vehicles that hint at the era of the photograph due to their vintage styles. There's a sense of openness in the setting, which looks overcast, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. \n\nOverall, the composition and the elements in the photograph together evoke a nostalgic feel, placing emphasis on the car’s interior elegance and the casual posture of the man, which suggests a moment captured during a routine outing or a pause in travel.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
