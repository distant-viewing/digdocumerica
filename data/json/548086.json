{"path":"548086.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene waterscape scene featuring a floating building, presumably a houseboat, anchored on a calm body of water. The houseboat is elongated, with a wooden structure and a flat roof, painted in a light color, likely white, with dark trim around the edges. It has a simple, rustic appearance, with what seems to be a small front porch area. A metal staircase leads up from the water to the houseboat's entry, suggesting a functional design for easy access from water level.\n\nIn front of the houseboat, two geese are swimming gently on the shimmering water, adding a touch of wildlife to the scene. The water reflects the sky and surroundings, creating a tranquil and slightly mirror-like effect.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a line of utility poles stretching into the distance along the shore, indicating the proximity of a developed area, likely a small waterfront community. The overall tone of the image, with its muted colors and peaceful setting, evokes a sense of quiet isolation and simplicity in waterfront living.","title":"Houseboat on the Columbia Slough","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548056","545197","542908","545067","548030","547953","551258","544243","558062","548052","544567","557562","548763","544212","550357","552270"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfront","waterscape","entry","water","staircase","mirror","trim","living","wildlife","access"]}
