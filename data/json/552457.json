{"path":"552457.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban decay and abandonment. The shot is taken in a corner where two walls meet, showing a dilapidated environment. The walls are in a state of extreme disrepair with much of the paint peeled off, revealing weathered wood underneath.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a small, grimy white sink with a silver tap, placed against the wall. The sink contains debris and dirt, indicating it hasn't been used for functional purposes in quite some time. Adjacent to the sink, leaning against the wall, is a dirty and worn black bucket or container, adding to the overall sense of neglect.\n\nOn the ground, debris is scattered around, consisting mainly of broken pieces of the surroundings and dirt. Notably, there are several cans (possibly spray paint cans given their shape and size) and a discarded \"Polling Place\" sign which adds a layer of socio-political commentary to the scene. The sign, featuring an American flag and the text indicating the polling place is closed due to circumstances beyond control, suggests themes of civic neglect or social issues.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on decay and discarded items, evokes feelings of abandonment and disuse, highlighted by the ironic presence of the polling place sign amidst the ruins. The scene might be interpreted as a visual metaphor for neglected civic duty or urban decline.","title":"This abandoned grade school in La Prairie Center was used as a polling place.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["549786","546051","549785","557342","553869","546854","557345","550264","543330","550263","553506","550253","550257","556640","553555","547587"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["sink","wall","neglect","can","discard","abandonment","place","decay","ruin","interpret"]}
