{"path":"553562.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and somewhat eerie scene set in a heavily smoked-filled forest area. The central figure, a person, is walking through the forest amidst considerable amounts of smoke and fallen, charred tree branches. The person appears to be a man wearing a light-coloured shirt, dark trousers, and is bending slightly as he walks, suggesting a cautious or weary demeanor.\n\nThe area around him is engulfed in gray and blue smoke, heavily obscuring the background and creating an atmosphere of haziness. The visibility is further diminished by the dense smoke, making it difficult to discern many details of the surroundings. The forest ground is littered with blackened wood and debris, indicative of a recent fire or ongoing smoldering remains. The trees visible in the background are mostly bare, their branches stripped of leaves, either due to the fireâ€™s destruction or the intensity of the smoke and heat.\n\nThe photo uses a combination of natural and possibly artificial lighting, casting a blue-purple tint over the entire scene, enhancing the sense of urgency and devastation typically associated with forest fires. The composition of the photo, with its focus on the figure navigating through this devastated landscape, evokes a strong emotional response, possibly related to the themes of disaster, resilience, or the daunting power of natural elements.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora fire-fighter in part of the burn area called \"granite fire.\"","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553583","548596","553625","553561","548590","553598","553599","555157","553584","553571","553597","548593","553595","548592","553626","554956"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["smoke","fire","forest","diminish","engulf","charr","response","remains","branch","urgency"]}
