{"path":"548803.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, focused mainly on a classic green and white Volkswagen Type 2 (T1) bus, also known as a \"Bulli\" or \"Microbus.\" The bus is parked on a sandy patch near the beach, facing towards the right side of the frame. On the right side of the bus, the doors are open, revealing the interior and dark tinted windows. Standing by the rear passenger door is a person, partially cut off by the left edge of the frame.\n\nIn the foreground, a sandy beach curves gently from the left side to the middle where the waterâ€™s edge meets. The sand has various textures and patches of vegetation towards the drier area. Just along the water line, someone is reclining on a beach towel, facing away from the camera, enjoying the view of the ocean, giving an impression of leisure and relaxation.\n\nIn the background, the ocean forms a calm horizon under a sky dotted with fluffy, well-defined clouds suggesting a sunny, breezy day. The scene conveys a sense of a peaceful, leisurely beach outing, featuring a vintage vehicle that adds a nostalgic element to the composition. The overall tone and color saturation, typical of older film photography, enhance the timeless quality of this beach day snapshot.","title":"Beach at Little Duck Key.
