{"path":"551626.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This is an evocative photograph taken on a rooftop urban garden. The image features a man standing on a wooden deck surrounded by lush greenery and colorful flowers. The man, dressed in a red shirt and sporting a receding hairline, leans forward slightly, looking intently at something outside of the frame.\n\nThe rooftop on which he stands is decked out with several elements indicating a personal touch to the gardening effort. There are various plants including tall flowers with yellow blooms, dense green foliage, and other floral arrangements in what appears to be a well-maintained space. The setting includes garden furniture such as a metal lounge chair with a round, dotted design on the seating area, which contributes to the casual and leisurely atmosphere of the space.\n\nThe background shows an urban cityscape with a mix of residential buildings in varying architectural styles and states of upkeep. The sky is overcast, which casts a soft, diffuse light over the scene, enhancing the colors of the garden.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene moment of urban gardening amidst the density of city living, highlighting a personal retreat and connection to nature.","title":"Cherries, carrots, strawberries and roses are only some of the plants that flourish twenty floors up in stuart mott's penthouse garden","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551625","551627","551628","551755","550059","544295","555522","550764","551743","551705","551620","551623","555523","544236","550055","551630"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["gardening","rooftop","garden","deck","flower","upkeep","lounge","retreat","seating","round"]}
