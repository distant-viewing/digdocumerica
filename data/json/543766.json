{"path":"543766.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic winter scene, predominantly featuring a large, frozen waterfall with a varied and complex structure. The waterfall is set among towering, rocky cliffs that rise steeply from the base where the ice has accumulated. The ice formation is intricate, with numerous large icicles and frozen cascades creating a visually striking white and pale blue sculpture. The ice appears thick and solid, suggesting cold temperatures and a environment where the water freezes before completely descending.\n\nThe surroundings are scattered with snow-covered rocks and boulders, adding texture and ruggedness to the scene. The flowing water in the foreground, which has not yet frozen, provides a dynamic contrast to the stillness of the icy waterfall. This running water is blurry, indicating movement, and it flows over round, ice-glazed rocks that lead into the picture.\n\nAbove, the sky is visible, showing a cloudy but bright day, contributing to the dramatic lighting which casts shadows and highlights the complex ice formations. The overall atmosphere is one of raw, natural beauty, showcasing the power of winter to transform a landscape into a frozen wonderland.","title":"Rainbow Falls -- the source of the San Miguel River in the San Juan Mountains","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543656","543770","543619","542698","550697","542699","544344","543578","555073","545874","545882","545839","558087","542594","544867","544456"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["ice","waterfall","winter","formation","cascade","temperature","sculpture","ruggedness","rock","boulder"]}
