{"path":"554003.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a seascape bathed in a rich, purple hue suggesting either early morning or late evening light. In the foreground, the ocean appears calm with subtle ripples and isolated patches of shimmering light reflecting off the water. There is a lone figure visible in the sea, appearing quite small in relation to the vastness of the surrounding water and landscape. The person seems to be standing in shallow water near the shoreline or on a submerged object.\n\nThe middle part of the image shows a slightly darker strip, which could be a distant shoreline or a change in the sea depth, while the background is dominated by a large, sloping mountain that fades into the sky. This mountain takes up the entire upper portion of the photo and shows gradients of dark to lighter shades of purple, adding a sense of depth and scale.\n\nThe sky, visible at the top of the photo, is filled with clouds that vary in shades of purple and pink, matching the overall color palette and enhancing the moody atmosphere of the scene. The overall composition, with its simple elements and monochromatic color scheme, evokes a sense of solitude and tranquility.","title":"Fishermen in surf on the island's eastern shore.
