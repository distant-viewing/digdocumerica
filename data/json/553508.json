{"path":"553508.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy focused on playing with a portable video game in an outdoor setting. He appears to be standing in the middle of a paved area, possibly a street or park pavement.\n\nThe boy is dressed in a patterned long-sleeve shirt and velvety, well-worn jeans tucked into boots. Notably, he wears a large, striped helmet, which suggests he might have been engaged in some sort of active play, like skateboarding or rollerblading, prior to stopping to play his video game. The large helmet, juxtaposed with his engrossed posture over the game console, adds a quirky and endearing element to the scene.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, another child is seen active on a bicycle, emphasizing the outdoor, playful environment. The lighting is golden and soft, indicating that the photo might have been taken either in late afternoon or early evening, which adds a warm and serene atmosphere to the scene. The simplicity of the setting with soft shadows and the casual outdoor play activity captures a slice of everyday childhood life.","title":"Mulky Square youth with cowboy gear and transistor","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["552035","547170","543855","555950","550249","547201","551010","542768","551857","543688","553147","553221","543859","549143","545242","558191"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["game","helmet","play","boy","childhood","pavement","sort","bicycle","boot","slice"]}
