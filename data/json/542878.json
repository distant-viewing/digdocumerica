{"path":"542878.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic coastal town viewed across a body of water, probably a harbor, which dominates the foreground. Several boats, primarily fishing boats of varying sizes and designs, are moored along wooden docks. One prominent boat in the foreground features a white hull and cabin with visible rigging and masts, suggesting it might be used for both fishing and sailing.\n\nBehind the harbor, the town spreads uphill. The buildings are closely packed and display various styles and colors. Most buildings appear residential, with some having distinct architectural elements like gabled roofs and external chimneys. The layout of the town follows the contour of the hill, creating a layered effect in terms of building elevation.\n\nThe backdrop to the town is a range of hills or low mountains with gentle slopes. The terrain here is predominantly barren or grassy, lacking significant tree cover, which provides a stark contrast to the denser, more colorful urban area. The sky is partly cloudy, and the overall lighting suggests either dawn or dusk, lending a warm hue to the landscape and enhancing the tranquil and picturesque setting.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542913","542910","542876","550322","542907","542872","550318","543358","549362","542905","542877","550307","554058","543423","555688","547984"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["town","harbor","fishe","rigging","hills","boat","denser","gable","mast","sailing"]}
