{"path":"552014.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling industrial landscape along a large body of water. In the foreground, there is a paved road, marked by a prominent stop sign on the right side. Electrical poles and wires stretch across the scene, leading the eye into the background.\n\nIn the middle ground, various industrial equipment and structures are visible by the waterfront. There is a large crane and two barges moored at a docking area. The barges have containers and debris scattered on them, suggesting that this area is actively used for industrial or shipping purposes.\n\nAcross the river in the background, an extensive industrial setting continues. There are large tanks and multiple buildings, including a very prominent factory or plant with tall smokestacks, from which smoke is being emitted. The skyline is cluttered with more cranes and industrial apparatuses.\n\nThe landscape is somewhat green, interspersed with foliage and grassy areas around the water, which contrasts with the heavy industrial presence. The overall color tone is blues and greens mutedly reflecting from the water, juxtaposed with the grays and earth tones of the industrial elements. This combination suggests a tension between the natural environment and industrial activity in the area.","title":"Arthur kill road on Staten Island, looking north.
