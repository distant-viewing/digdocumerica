{"path":"557764.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a surreal and humorous scene, featuring a person hugging a large watermelon while lounging inside a shopping cart. The person appears to be a middle-aged man with curly hair, who is shirtless and wearing brightly striped shorts and roller skates. The image captures a moment of either playfulness or fatigue, as the man rests his head and arms on the watermelon as if it were a cushion.\n\nThe backdrop is a weathered, blue and white painted wall of a building, likely a shop, with windows displaying various items for sale like snacks and other goods. Next to the man, on a yellow poster adhered to the wall, there are details of an event involving old-fashioned cream making and singing, intended to support local students' trip to the national capital. The date and time of the event are mentioned, ending with an encouraging \"Hope to see you there.\"\n\nThe scene is an intriguing blend of mundane elements—such as the shopping cart and the shop front—combined with the unusual sight of a grown man cuddling a large fruit in public, lending the image a whimsical and eccentric quality. The shopping cart, positioned in front of a wooden bench and a cardboard box from “Marcal,” emphasizes the everyday setting contrasted sharply by the peculiar activity taking place.","title":"Son of the h.c.
