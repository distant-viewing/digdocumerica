{"path":"551447.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene dominated by a large, prominent clock structure featuring a visible pendulum and large Roman numerals on its face. The time on the clock reads approximately 10:09. The background shows a busy urban street lined with trees and various storefronts. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a bench directly in front of the clock where four individuals are seated. They appear to be casually dressed, suitable for a warm day, and each of them is sitting relaxedly, suggesting they might be taking a break or waiting for someone. They are of various ages and seem to be engaged in different activities: one might be looking around, another resting, while the others could be conversing or observing their surroundings. \n\nThe pedestrian area around the clock and the bench is bustling with activity, including people walking by. Some individuals are noticeable in the photo, like a man in a suit who appears to be walking past the bench, and other pedestrians in the background contributing to the urban vibe of the scene. The attire of these passersby ranges from casual to business, indicating the diverse nature of the urban environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the unique clock and the everyday life that surrounds it, offers a snapshot of urban life and the small, often unnoticed moments that occur within it.","title":"On south 9th street on nicollet mall the huge clock provides the time and a resting place","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["549974","551829","542794","556199","551798","551646","551815","551477","551911","553158","553218","551823","551816","556018","551742","551851"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["clock","bench","pedestrian","resting","passersby","walk","storefront","street","occur","converse"]}
