{"path":"555496.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a handwritten sign about gas prices, taken at night. The sign reads \"IMPORT GAS Reg = 59¢ ETH. = 63¢ IRS Approved Prices\" written in blue and red markers. The handwriting indicates that the sign is likely quickly made, possibly in a casual or urgent context. The background features blurred lights and a dark nighttime setting, suggesting this was taken near a street or a gas station. On the left side, there's a soft glow of a street light reflecting off some surface, and on the right, part of another illuminated sign is slightly visible. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image suggests a focus on the economical aspect of fuel with a practical, no-frills presentation.","title":"Imported gasoline was sold at this service station, during the fuel crisis in the fall and winter of 1973-74.
