{"path":"548590.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a forest fire occurring in a predominantly wooded area. The fire is visible in the far side of the image, dominating a large portion of the upper frame with flames and smoke rising into the air. The smoke, ranging in color from white to dark gray, blends hauntingly with the sky, creating a somber atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there are numerous trees, some of which are tall with sparse branches, while others are more lush and green, indicating they have yet to be consumed by the fire. A noticeable dirt path snakes its way through the forest floor, leading directly towards the fire, and appears to provide access through the impacted area.\n\nThe area itself seems to be remote, characterized by natural terrain without visible signs of human habitation. The colors in the photograph are muted, possibly due to the density of the smoke and the lighting conditions which give the scene an eerie, almost dystopian feel. The entire scene encapsulates a dramatic and destructive event, emphasizing the intensity and devastation of wildfires in forested regions.","title":"Forest fires in the Everglades, Collier County. Fires are fairly common in the Everglades in dry seasons or dry years. 1973 was not dry, however, and there have been reports that the condition was caused by drainage of the land for commercial development.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["553843","548597","548591","555157","548592","553560","555113","553561","548595","553128","555156","548593","547728","557577","548596","553626"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","smoke","wildfire","flame","devastation","forest","intensity","habitation","density","access"]}
