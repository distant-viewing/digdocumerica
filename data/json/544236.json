{"path":"544236.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man standing in a lush garden. The man has gray hair and a thick gray mustache, and he is wearing a short-sleeved, olive green T-shirt and khaki pants. He is holding a plant with long, slender leaves in his hands, carefully examining it as he stands among a variety of other plants and foliage.\n\nThe garden setting is vibrant and densely packed with plants of various types, including both flowering plants and green foliage. The garden seems well-tended, with visible paths and structures that suggest it is a cultivated space rather than a wild one. In the background, there are miscellaneous garden items such as pots, tools, and other gardening supplies scattered around.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of peaceful engagement with nature, highlighting a moment of personal interaction between the man and the environment he is tending to. The lighting in the photograph suggests it is a sunny day, casting natural light and shadows across the scene, enhancing the rich greens and the detail of the garden. This gives the image a warm, inviting atmosphere.","title":"Lush growth in Louisiana wetlands, south of Lake Borgne","placename":"Violet (La.)","location":"Violet, Louisiana","nn1":["544240","550760","557681","544295","554797","549298","544275","550059","546505","546286","551626","551625","551628","555300","551701","552113"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["garden","tend","plant","khaki","gardening","mustache","pot","foliage","supply","cultivate"]}
