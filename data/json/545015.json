{"path":"545015.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene at dusk or dawn, with the natural lighting suggesting it's possibly the blue hour. The composition includes multiple boats and ships of different sizes and builds, which are floating in a calm body of water, likely a harbor or bay area.\n\nIn the foreground, there are smaller boats, moored closely together, among which a boat labeled \"GLWJRC\" is visible. The boats vary from fishing types to possibly small recreational or tour boats. In the middle of the frame, there are larger, more robust boats, and one prominently labeled \"RELIEVE,\" suggesting it might be a service or support vessel.\n\nThe background features a vast water body, softly illuminated by the low light, enhancing the tranquil mood. On the horizon, there are silhouettes of land and distant ships, including a large barge-like vessel with distinct highly visible flags, adding a touch of detail and diverse activity within the scene.\n\nThe overall low-light conditions and the rich blue and grey tones present in the image create a calm and somewhat melancholic atmosphere, capturing the quiet activities typical of a harbor area where boats are preparing to dock or start the day's work. The scene is devoid of human figures, focusing solely on the boats and tranquil environment.","title":"Sunset along the mouth of the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["548247","543119","547549","547553","550039","547561","542872","547110","548235","545026","547556","543411","544661","544672","543035","549374"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","harbor","ship","vessel","label","tour","start","barge","moor","hour"]}
