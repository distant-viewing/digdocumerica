{"path":"551397.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man sitting outdoors along a riverbank or lakeside on a foggy day. He is seated on the ground, resting on what appears to be a cushion or folded blanket. The man is dressed in a durable, outdoor jacket and trousers, and wears a distinct flat cap with what seems to be a badge or emblem on it. His expression is thoughtful or pensive as he gazes off to the side, not directly at the camera.\n\nAround him, the surroundings are muted with an overcast, foggy ambiance that blurs the background, making details indistinct. Directly next to him is a small, leafless bush, and he is surrounded by dried grass and vegetation typical of a lakeside or riverside setting in cooler weather.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is quiet and introspective, with a sense of solitude emphasized by the sparse and foggy landscape. The focus and clarity on the man contrast with the softly obscured background, directing attention to his expression and posture.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City. In mid-April thousands of fishermen gather at Whitney Drain, a manmade canal on Lake Huron, to dip net for these small fish. For some, it's a spectator sport.","placename":"Saginaw (Mich.)","location":"Saginaw, Michigan","nn1":["545090","548218","542613","554521","553341","552871","554677","553090","550739","551347","552103","547330","554926","545091","554915","557713"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["lakeside","cushion","emblem","badge","blanket","riverside","expression","clarity","man","riverbank"]}
