{"path":"555657.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape dominated by a majestic, snow-covered mountain towering in the background. The mountain is steep and expansive, its slopes marked by rugged textures and deep crevices indicative of glacial activity. The peak is sharp and notably highlighted against the sky, suggesting a high altitude and a harsh, cold climate.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense forest of evergreen trees fills the scene. These trees appear to be primarily conifers, likely spruces or firs, characteristic of a subalpine or alpine environment. The forest is rich and dark green, providing a stark contrast to the bright white of the snow on the mountain. This lush vegetation suggests a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem, likely part of a preserved natural area or a national park.\n\nThe sky above the scene is a clear, vibrant blue, indicating a perfect, cloudless day, which enhances visibility and bathes the landscape in natural sunlight. This lighting enriches the colors and textures in the photo, emphasizing the pristine beauty of this serene wilderness area.","title":"Mount drum (elevation 12,002 feet) seen from copper center looking east.
