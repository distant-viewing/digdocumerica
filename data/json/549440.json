{"path":"549440.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an intense and dynamic moment of white-water rafting. The image shows a rubber raft with two occupants, both paddling vigorously, as they navigate through a challenging section of a fast-flowing, tumultuous river. The water around the raft is frothy and white, indicating the rapid's powerful and chaotic nature.\n\nThe raft is slightly tilted towards the viewer due to the force of the water, highlighting the skill and concentration required to maintain control. Both rafters wear life jackets and helmets, essential safety gear for such an adventurous activity, and they seem to be working in tandem to steer their craft through the rough waters.\n\nThe background consists of dark, jagged rocks lining the river, creating a stark contrast with the bright white foam of the river's rapids. The natural setting suggests this activity is taking place in a remote, mountainous area, ideal for white-water rafting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, combined with the forceful expression of the water and the focused actions of the rafters, vividly conveys the thrill and challenge of white-water rafting.","title":"Small (17-foot) raft running Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River in Hells Canyon.
