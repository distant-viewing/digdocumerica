{"path":"555581.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a weathered, two-story wooden house painted in a faded white with peeling paint evident on its exterior. The house features a covered porch area where one can see a black metal chair, and various objects like a broom and other domestic items are kept. To the left of the porch, mounted on the exterior wall, thereâ€™s a notable circular item and bells, adding a rustic accent to the facade. A dog stands in the yard near a folding lawn chair with a vibrant green and white stripe pattern, which adds a pop of color to the otherwise muted scene.\n\nThe house is set in a lush garden embellished with several mature trees at the back, signifying a serene and secluded setting. The grass in the yard is green but unkempt, with visible fallen leaves, indicating it might be late summer or early autumn. A worn-out path leads to the porch suggesting regular use.\n\nThe overall composition and the faded, rustic appearance of the house create a sense of nostalgia or depict a rural lifestyle, emphasizing simplicity and an unhurried pace of life. The presence of the dog and everyday items on the porch contribute to a homey and lived-in feel.","title":"An older home, built in the 1850's, off Route #800.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["558110","555632","551091","546992","545041","550704","546989","557640","548295","557646","552489","554822","557746","557633","546997","554697"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","dog","item","yard","chair","broom","embellish","bell","pop"]}
