{"path":"543348.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph showcases a textured, wooden facade of a building, likely detailed and aged over time. The wall is constructed with vertical wooden planks that show varying degrees of weathering, ranging in color from dark brown to a lighter, worn tan. Across the image, there are artifacts indicating repairs or reinforcements on the wooden surface.\n\nThe facade features three shuttered windows, horizontally aligned at about the same level; however, the windows appear distinct in their presentation. Each window has shutters, but they vary slightly in color and condition. The shutters are painted in faded and chipped red and blue stripes, adding a rustic and colorful element to the otherwise monochrome wooden surface.\n\nThe arrangement of the windows suggests a symmetrical design that is somewhat offset by the placement of the third window closer to the edge of the frame. This asymmetry adds a visual interest to the composition.\n\nThe wall includes additional architectural elements like horizontal supports that intersect the vertical planks, creating geometric patterns. Some sections of these supports are visibly disjointed or have shifted, emphasizing the structure's weathered nature.\n\nThis photograph captures a sense of historical decay and rustic charm, focusing intently on texture and pattern without human presence or vivid natural elements, creating a serene yet intriguing visual narrative.","title":"Southern California -- Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["552511","543339","553479","555295","557643","543028","552498","553478","545355","552968","549193","545821","550006","544945","557640","543330"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["shutter","window","support","plank","reinforcement","facade","artifact","degree","presentation","wall"]}
