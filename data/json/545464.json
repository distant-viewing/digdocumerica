{"path":"545464.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful scene, likely at a fair or carnival. In the foreground, a man is seen with a young girl seated on his shoulders. The man, appearing in his 30s or 40s, is wearing a black jacket and has a watchful expression as he looks slightly to his left. The girl on his shoulders, possibly around 4 or 5 years old, is wearing a plaid garment and pink pants, with her blonde hair loosely hanging down. She seems concentrated or possibly watching something intently in the distance.\n\nDirectly beside them, there is a woman who appears to be in her mid-30s, dressed in a white blouse with black detailing, suggestive of a waitress or a retro uniform. She is also looking in the same direction as the man, with a curious or attentive expression. She holds what appears to be a small book or pamphlet. Positioned next to her, and partially obscured, is another figure dressed in a red jacket with feet in view donning white shoes, further adding to the feel of a crowded space.\n\nThe background is bustling with activity and adorned with multicolored lights and carnival decorations, adding a festive and lively aura to the scene. The atmosphere suggests an evening out possibly at a community event, where various individuals are gathered, each engrossed in their activities or spectacles, contributing to a lively communal experience. The expressions and direction of gaze of the key figures suggest a focus on a particular event or attraction out of frame, drawing the viewer’s curiosity towards what might be capturing the crowd’s attention.","title":"Choice seat at one state fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545460","545449","551811","553142","552655","551810","551299","551688","545444","551689","545459","549320","558292","551298","551808","543482"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["carnival","girl","shoulder","direction","expression","30","pamphlet","spectacle","event","don"]}
