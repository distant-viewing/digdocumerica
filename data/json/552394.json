{"path":"552394.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a dense urban landscape, likely captured from a high vantage point in a city. The image prominently features several tall skyscrapers that dominate the foreground; these buildings are modern with clean, straight lines and appear to be made of materials such as glass and steel.\n\nThe scene is covered in a haze, suggesting either early morning, late afternoon light, or some atmospheric pollution which adds a bluish-gray tint to the entire view and softens the outlines of distant buildings, creating a slightly dreamlike effect.\n\nThe middle ground is filled with a variety of other buildings which vary in height and structure, reflecting a typical cityscape. The rooftops of the buildings are varied, some flat with visible equipment like air conditioning units. The far horizon is crowded with similar structures, becoming progressively less distinct as they recede into the haze.\n\nThe streets below are not clearly visible, suggesting a focus more on the buildings than on street-level activity. There are no visible people or moving vehicles, indicating that the photo captures a static moment in the city's life. Overall, the photograph depicts a busy, modern city enveloped in a serene, almost ethereal atmospheric condition.","title":"Los Angeles in heavy smog","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549979","552395","549971","548417","548424","548385","549620","550198","545499","549970","548384","548425","548392","552363","551509","548319"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","haze","conditioning","building","tint","rooftop","street","skyscraper","unit","steel"]}
