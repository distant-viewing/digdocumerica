{"path":"543268.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a young lion lying comfortably on a sandy ground. The lion is positioned towards the camera, showing mostly its head and part of its body. Its eyes are slightly narrowed and the mouth is open a bit, giving off a calm yet alert expression. The light brown fur of the lion contrasts with the neutral, sandy background. There is minimal vegetation visible, suggesting a dry, possibly arid environment, typical of a lion's natural habitat. The foreground is focused on the lion, with the background softly blurred, highlighting the lion as the main subject of the photograph. Overall, the image conveys a sense of the serene yet powerful presence of this young lion in its natural surroundings.","title":"One of the stars of \"Lion Country Safari,\" a roadside tourist attraction","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543275","542629","542630","550473","544916","543272","554621","550436","551366","543839","550468","543840","550803","543279","545902","544742"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","mouth","habitat","bit","head","subject","eye","surrounding","camera","expression"]}
