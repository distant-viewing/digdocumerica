{"path":"550310.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and evocative scene featuring an old, derelict pier. The wooden structure is in a state of disrepair, with missing planks and deteriorated supports clearly visible. The pier is framed against a backdrop of a calm sea extending to the horizon. The sky is overcast, casting a somber light over the scene and infusing the colors with a deep, muted palette.\n\nIn the distance, several islands or land masses are faintly visible through a mist or light fog, lending an air of mystery and isolation. The water appears serene and undisturbed, enhancing the stillness and quiet mood of the setting. No people or moving objects disrupt this tranquil scene, emphasizing a sense of abandonment and timelessness. The composition of the photograph, with the pier leading into the expansive body of water, draws the viewer's eye towards the horizon, inviting contemplation of the vast, natural landscape and the impermanence of human-made structures.","title":"Looking northeast from Eastport's dilapidated pier toward proposed supertanker shipping channel. Channel lies between small islands at upper left and the larger island (Deer Island, New Brunswick, Canada) at upper center. Such use depends on Pittstown Oil Company getting permission to build a refinery in Eastport.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["543408","548105","547044","545005","547584","547594","543057","544672","554004","551978","547585","543241","547575","547581","547040","547068"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["pier","timelessness","masse","mystery","fog","island","disrepair","horizon","support","plank"]}
