{"path":"546229.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene outside a small church, specifically the Church of Christ, on a sunny day. A young boy, standing prominently in the foreground, faces away from the camera, looking towards the church. He is next to a large white sign indicating the church's name and service hours, which are scheduled at 10:00 AM, 6:00 PM, and 7:30 PM.\n\nThe small, white-painted church building features a simple architectural style with a gabled roof and a visible front entrance. The church front includes small windows and a sign near the roof identifying it as the Church of Christ.\n\nIn front of the church, a congregation of people can be seen. This group, comprising adults and children, is gathered in small clusters, some interacting with each other. The attire of the people varies from dresses to pants and casual shirts, suggesting a semi-formal community gathering. The overall atmosphere is congenial and lively. \n\nThe setting is complemented by a clear blue sky and lush green grass, with a few trees providing shade to some areas of the scene. This is either a pre or post-service scenario, given the gathering and timing indicated on the sign. The composition of the photo, focusing on a child engaging with the sign and observing the congregation, suggests a theme of community and belonging.","title":"Sunday services in Leakey","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["546233","558397","557666","546210","547414","557951","552479","547336","547332","547425","556238","558403","554035","557083","554208","558023"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["church","congregation","sign","am","gather","timing","schedule","child","belong","community"]}
