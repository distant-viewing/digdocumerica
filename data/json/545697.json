{"path":"545697.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and vibrant scene within a rocky canyon. The setting is characterized by large, curving rock formations with a predominantly red-orange color, which suggests it might be sandstone typical of desert landscapes or locations such as the American Southwest. The canyon walls engulf the scene, curving inwards towards the top, creating a tunnel-like effect.\n\nCentered in the scene is a figure, equipped for hiking or climbing, facing away from the camera and toward the canyon's opening or another rock wall that isn't visible. The person appears to be examining the area or preparing for a climb, indicated by what seems to be a rope coiled and held in one hand. They wear typical outdoor wear: long pants, a jacket, and a backpack, which points to some preparedness for rugged terrain.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky, contrasting sharply with the rich tones of the rock. The sunlight illuminates the top edges of the rock formations, highlighting their texture and stratification. The overall composition emphasizes the grand scale of the geological features relative to the human figure, suggesting themes of exploration, adventure, or solitude in nature.","title":"In the maze, a wild area in the western part of the park hikers must navigate by map and compass","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545305","544917","544899","544931","545762","544895","545758","545759","544898","544903","545755","545571","545693","545777","544902","544341"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","rock","stratification","preparedness","climbing","formation","coil","engulf","curve","tunnel"]}
