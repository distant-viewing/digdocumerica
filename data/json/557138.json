{"path":"557138.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures an older man positioned in what appears to be an outdoor setting, possibly near or in a parking area. The man wears a yellow short-sleeve button-down shirt and blue and white striped overalls with a patch that reads \"Big Smith\" on the chest. He also wears a dark flat cap. The man is looking towards his left with a soft expression, and his skin shows signs of aging.\n\nIn the background, partial views of two vehicles are visible. The closest car to the man has a white roof and a visible segment of its body which suggests it’s either blue or black. The other car behind and to the right of the man appears to be green or blue. The surrounding environment suggests a rural or semi-rural area, with greenery visible behind the vehicles.\n\nThe lighting indicates it's a bright sunny day, casting shadows on the man’s face and the cars, enhancing the texture and colors in the scene. The focus and composition center on the man, making him the main subject while the background, though out of focus, supports the setting and context of the image.","title":"Portrait of an area inhabitant attracted to the flea market at White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy. It is sponsored by the Ma Hush Ka (White Cloud) Historical Society to raise money for the local museum housed in the 100-year-old schoolhouse. Some people would like to see the place restored as an example of a 19th century Kansas river town. It was named for the last great Iowa Indian chief whose tribe was given land in the area by treaty in 1836.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["547277","547364","547313","548302","558333","554025","545391","546092","547355","545401","547338","545087","544349","549051","543849","547416"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["man","car","overall","chest","segment","aging","skin","button","vehicle","parking"]}
