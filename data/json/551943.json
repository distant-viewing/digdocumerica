{"path":"551943.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene involving earth moving or land management activities near a waterfront. In the foreground, a military-style truck equipped with a large dumper, painted in dark colors with a white star emblem, is tipping soil or sand onto a cleared area on the embankment. A man in dark clothing is standing to the right of the truck, facing away from the camera and overlooking the operation.\n\nTo the right in the image, there are two residential houses located close to the edge of the embankment, overlooking a large body of water. The house nearest to the camera is a two-story structure with a pale exterior, featuring an attached porch and a separate smaller construction alongside it. The second house can partly be viewed behind the first.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the area is sparsely wooded with bare trees suggesting the season could be late autumn or winter. There is no visible snow, but the ground appears to be wet and there are grey, overcast skies in the background, adding to the bleakness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the scene seems to convey efforts to either protect the waterfront properties from erosion or to modify the land for development or other uses, amidst a stark, wintry landscape.","title":"Army corps of engineers builds up shoreline after erosion caused by severe storm endangers lakeside homes.
