{"path":"543806.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a desolate and industrial scene characterized by a significant amount of pollution and debris. It depicts an area littered with numerous discarded objects, primarily focusing on old, rusty barrels that appear heavily deteriorated. These cylindrical containers are of varying sizes and colors, with many showing signs of decay such as peeling paint and dents. The barrels are scattered haphazardly across the muddy, barren ground.\n\nIn addition to the barrels, there are also pieces of broken metal and other unidentifiable industrial debris mixed into the clutter. Some metallic pieces look twisted and torn, suggesting they might have undergone severe mechanical stress or degradation.\n\nThe background of the image features a hill range which provides a stark, natural contrast to the foregroundâ€™s industrial waste. The hills appear dry and are sparsely vegetated, indicating a possibly arid environment. There is a hint of vegetation at the foot of the hills, and the sky is overcast, adding a further gloomy tone to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and the elements within the photograph evoke a sense of environmental neglect and degradation, highlighting the impact of industrial waste on natural landscapes.","title":"Industrial junk pile (near the Colorado River) from the Union Carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543762","552883","542494","553433","552884","546000","556324","552248","546004","552885","549307","544810","553045","547907","555871","546913"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrel","degradation","waste","hill","dent","stress","piece","clutter","addition","debris"]}
