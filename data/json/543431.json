{"path":"543431.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a rugged coastal landscape under a warm sunlight. The foreground features a dynamically textured seascape where the deep blue ocean churns against a jagged shoreline of rocky cliffs. The cliffs are adorned with vibrant patches of orange and green vegetation, lending a stark contrast to the dark waters.\n\nMoving inland from the coast, the landscape transitions into a series of rolling hills, which exhibit a variety of earthy shades—ranging from green to golden brown—suggesting different types of vegetation or land use. A winding dirt road is carved into one of these hills, enhancing the sense of remote ruggedness in the scene.\n\nDominating the mid-ground is a hillside covered in shadow, in stark contrast to the illuminated coast and distant hills. This suggests the photo was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as indicated by the long shadows and the warm tone of the light.\n\nOn one of the more gently sloping parts of this landscape, a small, isolated building complex can be seen, likely a farm or a rural retreat. It seems connected to the broader area via narrow, meandering roads, underscoring the sparsely populated and undeveloped nature of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the interplay between natural beauty and isolation, framed by the dramatic lighting and rich, textured landscape.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543424","543428","543304","543297","543433","543328","543435","543051","553910","543291","543430","543249","543300","545173","543184","553774"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coast","cliff","hill","churn","retreat","seascape","ruggedness","carve","landscape","hillside"]}
