{"path":"547608.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a sandy beach setting with a tranquil and natural atmosphere. The composition highlights a stretch of beach with fine, pinkish sand. Notable are the faint tracks, perhaps left by a vehicle, that run parallel and vertically across the image, guiding the viewer's eye toward the horizon. \n\nSparsely scattered across the sand are small tufts of grass, pebbles, and occasional debris, adding textures and variety to the sand's surface. The grasses are thin and wiry, with a greenish-brown hue that contrasts subtly against the pink sand.\n\nIn the distance, along the center-right of the image, the beach meets the calm, blue sea. The line where the sea meets the sky is clear, under what seems to be a relatively clear sky. On the beach, far in the background, there are two figures. These figures are small due to their distance from the camera but give a sense of scale and life to the otherwise deserted landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a quiet moment on a serene beach, potentially in the early or late part of the day, as suggested by the soft and diffused lighting.","title":"Tracks on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547607","545280","547612","547600","547596","551554","547496","547492","548221","543287","548088","548220","555402","557509","554159","543493"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","meet","tuft","sea","figure","pebble","grass","guide","distance"]}
