{"path":"555239.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph portrays a man engaged in manual work, specifically focusing on inspecting or adjusting a large machine component. He wears a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves, plaid trousers, and a yellow hard hat, indicating a setting that likely requires safety gear. He is holding what appears to be an orange manual or booklet against a cylindrical black machine part, possibly for reference or installation.\n\nThe scene is set in an industrial or warehouse environment, as suggested by the wooden pallets and metallic cylindrical drums or parts stacked around him. The background is dimly lit and slightly out-of-focus, emphasizing the worker's actions. The lighting primarily highlights the man and the machine parts, creating a focused and somewhat dramatic effect. The overall atmosphere suggests a scene of exertion and concentration within an industrial workspace.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspector simulates placing a \"stop sale\" sticker on a drum of chemical in Greenville, Mississippi.
