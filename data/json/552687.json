{"path":"552687.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a natural and rugged landscape featuring tall, steep cliffs that form part of a canyon or valley. The cliffs show layers of sedimentary rock, suggesting they could be part of a geologically significant area, possibly an erosion landscape or an escarpment typical of some mountain ranges.\n\nIn the foreground, the terrain is uneven and covered with small rocks and debris, indicative of a recent or ongoing excavation or landslide activity. There is a notable structure which appears to be an industrial or rail-related feature, such as a chute, conveyor, or part of a mining operation, constructed from metal and possibly concrete. It spans from the bottom near the photographer up the valley side, possibly used to transport materials down from higher elevations.\n\nA single person is standing on this structure, wearing typical outdoor or work attire, which aligns with the setting being used for industrial, mining, or construction activities. The individual seems to be inspecting or managing the equipment or activity associated with the structure.\n\nThe environment is remote and predominantly natural as there are no visible buildings or other human-made structures besides the featured chute and minimal visible vegetation. The sky is clear, suggesting a dry, bright sunny day which might be typical for the area. Overall, the scene offers a view into a blend of natural beauty and human industry, highlighting interaction with and adaptation to a rugged terrain.","title":"The colony plant (near GRand Valley in the Piceance Basin) after years of research, has taken oil shale from an underground mine and has successfully processed it in an experimental retort. Ten per cent of Colony's twenty-four million dollar research program has been devoted to environmental research. It has been found that certain species of grass will grow on processed shale if given water during the first two years.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543846","544418","555592","552545","545800","555587","545592","544902","544745","543838","545799","550414","552685","545755","545802","545805"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["chute","cliff","mining","valley","landslide","adaptation","photographer","rock","conveyor","canyon"]}
