{"path":"546002.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial setting on a body of water, most likely a lake or a calm sea. In the foreground, thick, dark-colored pipes run parallel and diagonally underneath a wooden pier, extending off the left edge of the frame. Notably, one of the pipes is fractured, and a substantial spurt of water is jetting out directly into the air, suggesting either damage or discharge which is not fully contained.\n\nThe pier itself appears somewhat dilapidated, with visible wear on its wooden support posts and planks. Below these structures, the water surface is captured, glistening under what seems to be daylight conditions.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is marked by a clear sky meeting the calm water, and distant electricity pylons stand symmetrically aligned, adding a layer of industrial presence to the scene. Overall, the setting is devoid of any visible human activity, conveying a sense of isolation and the mechanical nature of the location.","title":"Leak in pipeline that carries mined sulphur from lake gRande ecaille mine to port sulphur on the Mississippi river.
