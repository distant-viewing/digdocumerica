{"path":"552915.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene lakeside scene characterized by calm blue waters and a rugged, semi-arid landscape. The vantage point is aerial, providing a wide view over the shoreline.\n\nDominating the picture are two small plots of developed land located on opposite sides near the top of the image, each conducting possibly industrial or commercial activities. These areas are marked by the presence of small, flat-roofed white buildings near the water's edge. Adjacent to the buildings, multiple small boats are tethered to docks, some of which are also connected to smaller floating platforms.\n\nThe landscape surrounding these hubs consists of a rocky slope with sparse vegetation, likely bushes and small trees, indicative of an inhospitable environment not conducive to dense foliage. The overall impression is of a remote operational outpost located in a secluded natural setting, focusing on boating or possibly fishing activities. The wide expanse enables a tranquil yet isolated mood, emphasized by the limited human presence and built structures.","title":"Aerial view of campers on a beach at Pyramid Lake","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["556905","549521","544025","545969","543527","556966","542908","544756","548034","543579","548030","556928","544266","551219","552234","551207"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["enable","tether","hubs","locate","consists","fishe","conduct","plot","boating","lakeside"]}
