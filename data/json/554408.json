{"path":"554408.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and natural scene of a forested waterfall. The waterfall is composed of multiple cascades, each varying in size and flow. The water flows over and around dark, mossy rocks, creating a dynamic and somewhat turbulent scene. The surroundings are thick with lush green foliage, predominantly shades of dark green, hinting at a dense forest or woodland habitat. The leaves, some directly illuminated by sunlight, add a vibrant contrast to the darker, shadowed areas around the water.\n\nThe light filtering through the canopy casts intricate patterns and highlights the frothy white of the moving water. This lighting effect enhances the textural details of both the water and the surrounding vegetation. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet solitude and natural beauty, suggesting this could be a remote or less frequented spot.\n\nThe image is shot in such a way that the viewerâ€™s focus is guided along the path of the water, from the top cascades seen through the branches to the pooling water at the lower section of the image, offering a sense of motion and tranquility.","title":"Creek beside trail up Algonquin Peak, in the High Peaks region west of Lake Champlain","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["558087","557820","545878","545839","555220","555073","554409","545874","543869","543578","555210","550843","550979","542594","554113","555074"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","cascade","water","mossy","flow","frequent","dark","shoot","guide","white"]}
