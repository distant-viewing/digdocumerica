{"path":"553898.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This is an image featuring a close-up view of a body of water showing a dense and vivid reflection of the sky, foliage, and an oil slick. The oil creates swirling patterns of iridescent colors that mix with the blue of the reflected sky. The surface of the water is lightly distorted with gentle ripples, and there are green plant stems that dip down into the water, adding dynamic lines to the composition.\n\nThe surface reflections include a distorted view of trees and greenery, appearing almost dreamlike due to the combination of natural and pollution elements. These elements of the environment are flipped upside-down, due to the nature of reflections in water, creating an interesting visual effect that combines natural beauty with the interference of pollution. The bottom of the image is dark, enhancing the concentration on the central and upper parts where colors mix and interact vividly. Overall, the photograph captures an environmental statement, contrasting natural beauty with human impact.","title":"Polluted salt marsh in middletown.  (from the sites exhibition.
