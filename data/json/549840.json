{"path":"549840.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph showcases an urban scene focused on a pile of garbage bags on the sidewalk. The photo captures several large, yellow plastic bags filled with trash, alongside some black plastic bags bulging with waste. These bags are overflowing from a couple of metal garbage bins and additional cardboard boxes beside the bins. The setting appears to be a city street, indicated by the presence of parked cars, including a prominent vintage car directly in line with the garbage on the street.\n\nIn the background, there are several tall buildings, which hint at a dense urban environment typical of a city center. This is strengthened by the presence of street signs, including a \"NO PARKING\" sign directly next to a street lamp. The lighting suggests itâ€™s either early morning or late afternoon, given the angle and intensity of the sun casting shadows and illuminating the scene. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of city life with its ongoing struggle with waste management and the daily accumulation of refuse.","title":"Garbage is piled high on the sidewalk outside New York Medical Center.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545506","547878","545502","549833","545494","549839","550147","548370","550162","549752","549784","549751","549739","553039","548214","549842"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["bag","garbage","bin","street","plastic","city","waste","struggle","refuse","cardboard"]}
