{"path":"548757.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph presents a serene beach scene characterized by natural beauty and tranquility. The foreground of the image features a sandy beach strewn with some washed-up seaweed, which adds a touch of rough texture contrasting with the smooth sand. Close to the edge of the water, there is a long, weathered log stretched across the sand, pointing towards the sea, perhaps brought in by the tide.\n\nThe beach edges gently into calm ocean waters that exhibit subtle ripples, suggesting a light breeze. The colors of the water transition from a milky turquoise near the shore to deeper marine hues towards the horizon, indicating varying water depths.\n\nTo the right of the beach, a line of dense, lush greenery is visible, possibly small trees or dense shrubs, marking the boundary between the beach and the farther inland areas. This foliage seems thick and untamed, hinting at the natural and less developed character of the location.\n\nThe sky above adds drama to the scene, with significant cloud cover suggesting an overcast day. Despite this, the lighting in the photograph provides sufficient illumination to reveal the rich textures and colors of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition draws the eye along the shore, with the natural elements leading towards the gentle interaction between land and sea, evoking a sense of calm and solitude.","title":"Some of the remaining untouched beach at Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key.
