{"path":"544707.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene. The setting is characterized by a large body of water, likely a lake or calm sea, that reflects the mellow orange hues of the dusk. The sun is the dominant element, positioned centrally and high in the sky, radiating a warm, intense light that dominates the photograph.\n\nIn the background, there is a silhouetted horizon dotted with what appear to be industrial structures, including tall, thin towers or smokestacks. These dark shapes contrast with the bright sky and suggest a distant industrial waterfront or factory area.\n\nThe color palette primarily features rich oranges and dark browns, creating a warm, almost nostalgic mood. The reflection of the sun on the water adds a layer of texture and vibrancy, causing delicate ripples and sparkles in the water's surface. There are no visible people or moving objects, enhancing the image's tranquil and somewhat solitary atmosphere. The overall composition and the use of natural and industrial elements evoke a reflective and subtle interaction between nature and human activity.","title":"Setting sun, smog and derricks","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["548123","545030","557447","551956","544711","552294","552263","547731","552335","545022","550296","543144","542618","554759","550303","550304"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","radiate","sparkle","vibrancy","cause","waterfront","smokestack","orange","sunset","factory"]}
