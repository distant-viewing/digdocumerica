{"path":"556129.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is taken in a railway station during a bright day. The photo provides a view along several empty railway tracks that converge towards the horizon. On the left side, there is a platform covered by an overhang with fluorescent lights. The platform appears to be sparsely populated with a lone figure standing in the shadow beneath the overhang.\n\nTo the right, there's a more elaborately structured building which is labeled \"UNION STATION\" on a tower equipped with a clock. This part of the station features a traditional architectural style with a steeply pitched roof and a tall clock tower rising prominently.\n\nThe background shows a clear sky and some industrial elements in the far distance, including other structures and additional railway lines. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late afternoon, giving the scene a somewhat serene and deserted atmosphere.","title":"Union Station in Portland, Oregon, one of 450 passenger train terminals served by Amtrak in 1974. During that year the corporation listed 8,800 employees and operated 225 trains per day. A steady decline in ridership from the end of World War II to 1970 has been reversed since Amtrak assumed responsibility for most U.S. intercity passenger service. A total of 14.5 million passengers rode the rails in 1973.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556125","556768","556021","556778","548475","547656","556127","556649","556667","556854","556055","556123","556692","556120","547511","556673"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","overhang","clock","station","platform","tower","track","figure","afternoon","morning"]}
