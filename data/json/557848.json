{"path":"557848.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric scene inside what appears to be a car garage or repair shop. The image composition leads the viewer's eye from the foreground, featuring a person standing to the left side of the frame, across to the prominently displayed vintage car hoisted in mid-air.\n\nThe individual in the photograph is depicted in silhouette, creating an anonymous, somewhat mysterious impression. The person is leaning slightly forward, observing the car, possibly assessing the work or admiring the vehicle. The silhouette enhances the sense of being focused or engrossed in the task at hand.\n\nThe car, elevated on a lift, is an older model with distinct mid-20th-century design features, such as rounded edges and prominent chrome bumpers. It is painted in a shiny dark color that reflects the surrounding light. Details such as tail lights and reflective trim catch the light and draw attention.\n\nThe garage environment is painted in soft green hues, equipped with necessary utilities like a green hose and a more rugged, industrial equipment setup suggested by pipes and metallic elements overhead. The walls and a door in the background are also green, with hints of wear that add character to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photo conveys a sense of quiet concentration and nostalgia, symbolized by the retro automobile and the subtle lighting that provides a blend of shadow and illumination. The workshop environment suggests practical functionality and a place of labor and craftsmanship.","title":"Car being checked at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. The test includes a check of the exhaust pipe and engine compartment to visually look for smoke. Then the probe shown in the picture is inserted into the tailpipe. It carries exhaust gases from the engine to the analyzer which measures carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city must be certified annually.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557905","557891","553490","557870","557847","557906","557858","557885","557874","557860","557900","557852","557864","557853","557850","556703"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","car","admire","assess","craftsmanship","retro","silhouette","engross","bumper","hoist"]}
