{"path":"556631.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image features a wall constructed using a mix of old, rusted, and mud-covered tin cans, with apparent mortar or a concrete-like substance binding them. The cans, some crushed and others still retaining their cylindrical shape, are arranged in a grid pattern, similar to bricks in a wall. The cans displayed include recognizable brands with partially visible logos such as Pepsi and Fanta, among others that are too obscured or generic to identify due to mud coverage and wear.\n\nThe colors of the cans vary, showing faded shades of red, white, blue, and other mottled, rusted metal tones. The overall composition feels structured yet decayed, suggesting a form of adaptive reuse or an artistic statement on recycling and waste. The backdrop is slightly blurred, dark, and indistinct, which accentuates the focus on the textured and colorful foreground formed by the upcycled cans. The photo captures both a utilitarian functionality and a commentary on consumer waste.","title":"One example of wall construction in experimental housing using empty steel beer and soft drinks cans near Taos, New Mexico exterior and load bearing walls such as this use eight can blocks wired together and will be plastered over when the house is completed.
