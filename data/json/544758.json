{"path":"544758.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a small boat navigating through what appears to be a heavily silted body of water, possibly a river. The water is a dark brown color, heavily indicative of high sediment content, making the water opaque. The boat is pointed and streamlined, likely constructed for speed or easy maneuverability.\n\nIn the boat, two individuals can be seen, one at the front and another at the rear, both are likely handling the operation and steering of the boat. There is an array of contents in the boat, possibly equipment or personal belongings, but the small size and distance make it hard to discern details.\n\nThe surroundings of the river are not visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention entirely on the water and the boat. The light on the water suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle highlights on the ripples and waves around the boat, enhancing the texture of the water's surface.\n\nThe composition of the image, with its high aerial perspective, captures the isolation of the boat in a vast, possibly challenging environment, emphasizing themes of adventure or exploration. The stark contrast between the dark water and the boat further draws attention to the human element within this vast natural setting.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545043","545654","546976","547557","544532","544770","547674","549458","549417","547685","552310","547276","546317","550208","549066","550914"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","content","water","belonging","steering","rear","attention","speed","highlight","river"]}
