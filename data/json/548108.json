{"path":"548108.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features multiple fishing boats moored together on a body of water. There are four main boats visible, each of varying design and size, but all are equipped with masts and technical fishing gear. The boat named \"IDEAL\" is centrally and prominently positioned in the image; it is a larger vessel with a tall mast and substantial deck equipment suggesting a capability for commercial fishing operations. The other vessels, similar in design and function, surround \"IDEAL,\" and one has the name \"NADINE\" visible.\n\nThe backdrop reveals a hilly landscape densely covered with forest, suggesting a remote or less urbanized region, likely conducive to fishing activities. The hills appear to roll gently, and the forest is primarily coniferous, indicative of a cooler climate region possibly near a coastal area, given the presence of the large water body.\n\nOverall, the setting is tranquil with clear indications that these boats are used for professional fishing, given the industrial nature of the equipment aboard the boats. The image evokes a sense of calm but industrious maritime activity, possibly capturing a moment of rest or preparation in the daily routines of fisheries.","title":"Fishing boats at anchor on the Columbia River, not far from the spectacular Multnomah Falls.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["546939","548539","542911","548546","548535","547565","543035","544186","550306","547553","552296","547549","542873","552313","547552","550342"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["fishing","boat","mast","vessel","capability","region","indication","forest","equipment","routine"]}
