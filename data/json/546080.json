{"path":"546080.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape dominated by a large factory complex in the background. The factory features multiple large buildings, many equipped with tall silos and stacks, from which some are emitting white and darker smoke. The color palette of the factory is neutral, consisting mostly of grays and whites, which gives it a stark, utilitarian appearance.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a desolate, rugged terrain that appears to have been cleared or is unused, covered in debris and patches of scruffy vegetation. A small body of water, possibly a river or stream, meanders through this area, reflecting the gray sky above. The water body has a murky appearance and is bordered by rough, uneven land with scattered rubbish and plant life.\n\nThe setting appears industrial and perhaps somewhat neglected, offering a contrast between the natural elements of water and land, and the man-made structures. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of industrial activity amidst a somewhat bleak environmental setting. The power lines in the distance further emphasize the industrial overtones of the location.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant behind landfill area used for dumping industrial waste","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546084","552194","548070","546103","551156","548068","550724","550343","550868","549215","544328","551009","550684","546087","552246","552210"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["factory","land","appearance","silo","white","stream","stack","gray","complex","power"]}
