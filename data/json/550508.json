{"path":"550508.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is a stunning aerial shot capturing a vast wilderness scene. Its composition centers around a serpentine river that flows from the foreground deep into the background, twisting and turning through a broad, lush valley flanked by steep, rugged mountain slopes. The river appears bright and reflective, suggesting the presence of sunlight highlighting its water surface.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is predominantly shades of green, indicating verdant vegetation, which could be grassy or shrubby, covering the valley floor and creeping up the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains. The mountains themselves rise steeply from the valley and become increasingly rocky and barren as they ascend. The peaks of these mountains, visible in the distance, are capped with snow, suggesting higher altitudes and colder temperatures. These snow-capped peaks stand stark against a cloudy sky, breaking the monotony of the rugged terrain below.\n\nThe upper portions of the image feature a dramatic and cloud-filled sky, lending a moody atmosphere to the scene. No human activity, structures, or animals are immediately visible, emphasizing the natural and undisturbed nature of the environment depicted in this photograph. This setting is indicative of a remote, possibly protected area, meant to preserve its natural beauty and ecological importance.","title":"The view south from Dietrich Pass toward Chandalar Shelf from the pass, the pipeline will follow the east (left) side of the river channel to the Chandalar Shelf. The line and road will cross the river where it makes the sharp left Bend in the upper distance.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550529","550487","550498","550542","550523","550561","550627","550590","550509","550526","550403","550593","550562","550531","542700","550518"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","mountain","peak","slope","snow","monotony","temperature","importance","river","altitude"]}
