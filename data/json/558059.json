{"path":"558059.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a suburban area nestled in a richly vegetated landscape. The image captures a mix of residential and possibly commercial areas, divided by a main road running horizontally near the bottom of the frame. Alongside the road, various styles of houses with pitched roofs are visible, each surrounded by dense trees exhibiting the first signs of autumn colors. \n\nTo the bottom left, there are several buildings, including what appears to be a larger white structure resembling a church or a school, next to a parking lot. Below the main road, nearer to the bottom of the image, is a smaller road adjacent to a water body, possibly a river, bordered by greenery and a few industrial or small commercial structures.\n\nThe surrounding area transitions into more open land, possibly fields or lightly wooded areas, which stretch into the horizon where more dense vegetation resumes. The overall area conveys a serene, spacious, and possibly semi-rural setting, typical of many suburban localities blending into natural landscapes. The composition highlights the integration of human habitation with the natural environment, showcasing a balance of development and green spaces.","title":"Aerial view of Peninsula, Ohio, a village of period buildings located north of Akron. The town got its name when the Cuyahoga River made a high loop around the settlement. Now the loop is much shorter and the falls at the lower right are much lower than in the past when there was an aqueduct and mill. The Methodist church is seen at the lower left; above it is the Mother of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church. Main Street (Ohio Highway 303) is in the foreground.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["558057","548011","558112","551198","558061","544600","556974","547256","553936","556955","557552","558369","553700","557547","558060","544604"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["bottom","road","locality","integration","school","balance","church","habitation","autumn","transition"]}
