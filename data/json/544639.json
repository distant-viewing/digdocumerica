{"path":"544639.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image presents an aerial view of a coastal construction or industrial scene, possibly involved in land reclamation or development. In the foreground, there are clear blue waters with a long, dark construction barge or similar structure floating parallel to the shore. A small boat appears to be either guiding or attached to the barge. This setup indicates some ongoing marine construction activity.\n\nBeyond the barge, there are several bodies of water that could be man-made lagoons or channels, surrounded by patches of barren land with minimal vegetation. This suggests recent land alteration or excavation activities. A sizable crane is visible on the shore, supporting the idea of ongoing construction or industrial operations.\n\nIn the background, against the horizon, there is a contrasting landscape with taller buildings and developed structures, which may be a residential or commercial area. The contrast between the foregroundâ€™s industrial activity and the developed background underscores a developing region or expansion of urban infrastructure towards the coast.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a moment of industrial activity within a natural setting, highlighting human impacts on coastal environments through construction and development projects.","title":"Reclaiming land at Marco Island","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548361","544650","552206","544670","551574","551607","546833","544643","551612","547171","548779","548775","544636","548638","547996","547259"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["barge","construction","land","reclamation","lagoon","shore","idea","development","parallel","expansion"]}
