{"path":"554770.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a large mining operation scene filled with rugged terrain and heavy machinery. In the foreground and dominating the scene is a massive crane with a bright red body and a vibrant yellow boom. The crane is stationed on a wide crawler track that provides stability and mobility across the rocky surface. The structure of the crane includes a sizeable operator's cabin and a tall mast supporting cable systems.\n\nThe crane's yellow boom extends horizontally towards the right-hand side of the image, ending in a large metal bucket that's suspended above piles of grey rocks and rubble. The bucket is clearly used for heavy digging and moving of materials within the mine.\n\nSurrounding the crane are piles of loose rocks and a rugged uneven landscape indicative of a mining environment. Smaller vehicles, likely used for transport or additional mining tasks, can be seen parked or active around the area. These vehicles are dwarfed by the crane, emphasizing the size and scale of mining machinery.\n\nThe background features a somewhat overcast sky and more piles of extracted rocks, suggesting that this mining site is extensive and actively used. No people are visibly operating the machinery or present in the area in this snapshot, focusing all attention on the mechanical and geological elements of the site. The image captures the industrial scale and the harsh working environment typical of such mining operations.","title":"A huge shovel digs towards a seam of coal off route 800, note its size in comparison to the car by the tread of the machine","placename":"Sewellsville (Ohio)","location":"Sewellsville, Ohio","nn1":["545887","544134","545831","555586","545883","544165","544157","555593","552418","554826","554828","544156","554545","555644","555606","543639"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","crane","boom","pile","machinery","bucket","rock","digging","stability","extract"]}
