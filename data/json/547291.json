{"path":"547291.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a rural landscape dominated by expansive farmland in the foreground and a farmstead in the middle ground. The tilled earth of the farm field appears rich and dark, suggesting recent plowing or planting activity. Stretching across the image, the field is wide and flat with no visible crops at the moment.\n\nIn the middle distance, a collection of farm buildings forms the central visual interest. There are multiple structures, including a couple of traditional barns painted red, and several other utility buildings that are either white or metallic in color. These buildings are surrounded by minimal vegetation, primarily grass and a few trees, which are likely part of the property's boundary or windbreaks.\n\nA line of trees can be seen in the background, partially obscuring any farther view and effectively framing the farmstead. The sky above is slightly overcast with blue tones peeking through, casting an overall soft light over the scene without harsh shadows.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a peaceful and typical rural scene, highlighting agricultural land and farm outbuildings in a simple composition. The image evokes a sense of calm and solitude inherent to farm life away from urban hustle.","title":"A farm, west of Schuyler","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["544481","549222","547321","557946","547303","554819","547305","557183","547304","547426","551305","554767","547309","549257","549256","547350"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","till","planting","outbuilding","farmland","hustle","peek","field","barn","property"]}
