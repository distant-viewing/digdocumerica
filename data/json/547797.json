{"path":"547797.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph prominently features a light blue vintage car parked on a city street, viewed from a low angle that accentuates the car’s sleek hood and distinctive chrome bumpers. The hood of the car is decorated with a unique ornament: a striped and starred top hat inflatable, evoking an Americana vibe. It has a reflective surface that catches the sunlight, creating a small glare at the bottom center of the image.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment, likely in a bustling downtown area given the dense arrangement of tall buildings and shops. Directly in the background, there is a large, plain white building that starkly contrasts with the smaller, densely packed buildings adjacent to it. Storefront signs can be seen, including “FRANKLIN’S” in large bold letters adorned with lights, suggesting it might be a store or a restaurant.\n\nThe street alongside the car is lined with various other vehicles indicating a busy traffic time. The atmosphere conveyed is vibrant, possibly midday given the bright sunlight and clear blue sky above. The presence of old buildings and a specific styling of the signs suggest that the photograph could be from a few decades ago, capturing a lively downtown scene in an American city.","title":"In downtown Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["554297","556709","556713","555475","549882","552412","545216","549856","549895","549881","551135","555944","549872","545333","556724","556707"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["downtown","hood","car","ornament","glare","styling","restaurant","bumper","city","building"]}
