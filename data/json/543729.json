{"path":"543729.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents a large industrial mining operation set against a rugged mountain landscape. The terrain is uneven and extensively modified due to the mining activities. The mountainsides show signs of excavation, with exposed earth and rock surfaces in various shades of gray and brown. Snow patches are visible in areas that haven't been disturbed, indicating a cold climate or high altitude.\n\nThe center of the image features a massive, terraced excavation site with steep slopes made of loose materials, likely tailings or dump piles from the mining operation. There are several levels or benches created as part of the mining process, used to access deeper sections of the mine. Along these benches, sporadic structures, which could be equipment sheds or processing facilities, are visible. The presence of industrial buildings and structures suggests this as a significant and well-established mining site.\n\nA network of roads crisscrosses the area, likely used for moving ore and waste materials. On these roads, tiny, indistinct vehicles can be made out, possibly trucks or heavy machinery, which hint at the scale of operations and the large machinery used in the mining process.\n\nThe general environment is harsh and treeless in the immediate vicinity of the mining operations, but patches of forest can be seen on the surrounding slopes that have not been cleared or disturbed, contrasting the human impact with sections of natural landscape. The overall mood conveyed by the image is of intensive industrial activity within a remote, natural setting, emphasizing the scale and impact of human exploration and resource extraction.","title":"Colorado Fuel & Iron Company feldspar mine on Monarch Pass","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552686","544785","549174","543758","543857","544781","544111","544139","544789","554765","550407","553784","543754","544100","551065","552177"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mining","operation","excavation","bench","slope","mountainside","ore","process","machinery","site"]}
