{"path":"547679.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays an elderly man, appearing contemplative or reflective, set against a rural, possibly arid backdrop. He is wearing a classic cowboy outfit that includes a weathered, wide-brimmed cowboy hat and eyeglasses. His attire also includes a red bandana tied at the neck, which complements the rugged, outdoor aesthetic, suggestive of a working environment or agricultural setting.\n\nThe man is attired in a plaid, button-up shirt featuring primarily white with light blue and grey checks. Over his shirt, the red bandana stands out, neatly knotted to the side. His weathered hands are crossed casually, with one forearm resting on the other, suggesting a moment of rest or pause.\n\nHis facial expressions and the deep lines marking his face add character, indicating a life of considerable outdoor activity, possibly in farming or ranching. The background of the image is blurred but hints at a vast, open landscape typical of a ranch or farm, with a clear sky and a hint of distant trees or shrubs.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the subject off-centered to the right, draws attention to the manâ€™s face and upper body. The lighting is natural, likely midday sun given the shadows and brightness of the scene, enhancing the texture and colors of his attire and features. This photograph captures the essence of a rugged, rural life, embodied in the subject's attire, posture, and environment.","title":"Owner harlar prine looking over his wheat field on the edge of the Colorado river in the Palo Verde Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553091","552561","549120","549122","549042","549054","549051","551300","542613","546068","549199","554926","547313","544409","552103","554846"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["bandana","cowboy","ranching","attire","embody","subject","rest","eyeglass","ranch","midday"]}
