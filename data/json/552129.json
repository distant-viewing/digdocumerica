{"path":"552129.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a maritime scene featuring a large barge being towed by a tugboat. The barge, marked with \"PAC 212-2 SEATTLE\" on its side, is substantial in size and primarily black with some visible cargo or equipment on its deck. Adjacent to the barge is the tugboat named \"JUPITER,\" prominently displayed in white letters along its side. The tugboat is also painted black and white, which contrasts sharply with its darker counterpart. Both vessels are in motion on the water, suggesting a towing operation.\n\nIn the background, there is a large industrial building, vividly blue with a prominent red \"V\" structure on its side. This building also features several large windows and a dome-like structure on its top, possibly housing some mechanical equipment. An American flag is visible, flying atop the tugboat, adding a patriotic touch to the scene.\n\nThe overall environment is industrial, with a focus on maritime activities related to transportation or logistics. It's a clear day, and the water is relatively calm, reflective of the organized, operational nature of the enginery and tasks at hand.","title":"Tugboat hauls barge down industrial waterway of the Duwamish River.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550892","546938","546830","546845","550895","546909","550893","548200","546832","549802","545073","550896","550872","550951","549819","550894"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","barge","v","tow","logistic","equipment","dome","fly","cargo","letter"]}
