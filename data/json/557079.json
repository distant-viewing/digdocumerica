{"path":"557079.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two elderly men engaged in conversation outdoors. The first man on the left is dressed in a full black robe, suggesting he could be a clergyman, possibly a monk or a priest. He has dark-framed glasses and a serene expression whilst attentively listening or speaking to the other man.\n\nThe second man on the right is dressed in more casual attire featuring a moss green blazer, a beige shirt, and a light grey-striped tie. His expression is animated, possibly mid-conversation, suggesting an engaging discussion. He appears to be somewhat older than the first man, with more pronounced facial features and white hair.\n\nThe background indicates a lush, green, well-maintained garden with a solid brick building partially visible. This setting suggests the conversation might be taking place in a secluded, peaceful location, possibly a monastery garden or a similar tranquil setting.\n\nThe overall composition and natural outdoor lighting create a sense of warmth and calmness, enhancing the notion of a thoughtful, possibly philosophical conversation between the two individuals.","title":"Father Eugene Dehner, professor of biology at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas, and Claude Warner talk on the grounds of the college.
