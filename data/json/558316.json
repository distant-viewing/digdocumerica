{"path":"558316.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Truman, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of someone lighting a gas stove. The primary focus is on the person's hand, which is using a match to ignite the stove's burner. The flame is clearly visible as it burns brightly. The hand holding the match appears aged, suggesting it could belong to an older adult. The stove itself is old-fashioned, and the image has a somewhat dim, greenish hue that adds a slightly eerie or retro feel to the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurred glimpse of what seems to be a kitchen environment. There is a small white kettle placed on the stovetop next to the burner. The edges of the photograph are shadowy, drawing the viewer's attention directly to the flame and the action of lighting the stove. Near the top right of the frame, part of a window with daylight coming through can be seen, suggesting this activity is taking place during the day. This scene captures a simple, everyday task, but the low light and close-up add a dramatic effect to the composition.","title":"Closeup of the wood burning stove used for cooking in the kitchen of Mr. and Mrs. August Vogel. Mr. Vogel chops the wood to keep the stove kindled. The couple live in a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. New Ulm was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. The town has grown steadily since 1950 with the arrival of manufacturing firms.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558317","553531","555444","551361","553054","551360","554862","558298","554443","554511","552105","555441","555529","557356","554896","549349"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["stove","burner","flame","kitchen","close","hand","gas","up","daylight","action"]}
