{"path":"554660.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil and picturesque outdoor scene that beautifully captures the essence of fall. The backdrop is a dense forest thick with deciduous trees showing a vibrant array of autumn colors including rich shades of red, orange, yellow, and green. This lush, multicolored foliage creates a vivid tapestry of colors, indicating the peak of fall season.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water that appears calm but with slight ripples, suggesting a light breeze. On this waterbody, a small sailboat is visible. The sailboat has a white hull and a sail that is partially red and white, adding a distinct dash of brighter colors against the darker water surface.\n\nThe overall composition of the scene is idyllic and serene, with the sailboat providing a focal point of human activity amidst the natural beauty of the changing seasons. The lighting suggests it might be midday or early afternoon, given the brightness and clarity of the colors in the foliage and the visibility details in the scene.","title":"Sailfish sailboat skims past bright fall colors on Ausable Lake","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548118","554751","552039","554758","554757","554649","554737","554648","554635","554714","554486","552038","552292","552345","543613","554749"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["sailboat","fall","season","waterbody","tapestry","foliage","breeze","midday","sail","color"]}
