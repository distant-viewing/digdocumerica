{"path":"547683.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph shows a multitude of round, shallow pans scattered across a wet, muddy terrain that is indented with patterns resembling ripples and tread marks. The pans, which appear to be metal, are of varying sizes and are filled with a reflective liquid, likely water, that captures the light. Several of these pans are tilted or submerged into the mud, suggesting they were placed carelessly or affected by movement in the mud.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of disarray yet also of an organized pattern due to the semi-uniform distribution of the pans. The ground is dark and appears to be rich in texture, highlighted by the sunlight casting shadows and creating a reflective sheen on the surfaces of the water-filled pans. This setup, combined with the natural lighting and the extensive coverage of the area by these objects, provides a visually striking scene that merges elements of human activity with natural textures. Some elements like a wooden beam diagonally crossing the scene suggest human interaction or a possibly abandoned work site. The photograph does not include any people or animals, focusing entirely on the interaction between these objects and their muddy environment.","title":"Discarded tires litter the shoreline of the middle branch of Baltimore harbor near waterview avenue","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["554347","553867","544992","545029","545623","550837","549086","545634","543644","545680","552420","550574","552983","543523","548631","555545"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mud","marnks","resembling","tilte","disarray","distribution","multitude","coverage","sheen","object"]}
