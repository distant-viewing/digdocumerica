{"path":"545442.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, heavy with the air of pollution and activity. The focal point of this image is an industrial plant with several architectural and mechanical structures. Large, dark plumes of smoke or steam billow from several points, contributing to a dense, overcast atmosphere.\n\nForeground: The foreground is less detailed and slightly obscured, possibly by a fence or barrier, with some small, grassy outgrowths at the bottom of the frame, hinting at a vantage point taken from beyond the industrial site's immediate area.\n\nMidground: A man is visible in this section, walking across a concrete area, wearing light-colored industrial attire that includes a helmet. He appears small relative to the massive scale of the structures around him, emphasizing the immense size of the facility.\n\nBackground: Dominated by tall, vertical structures possibly related to processing or energy production. Pipes, ducts, and metal frameworks criss-cross between the larger buildings, creating a network of industrial complexity. The entire scene is shrouded in a haze that mutes color and detail, likely a mix of mist and emissions.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the gritty reality of industrial operations, focusing on environmental impact, scale, and the human element within this expansive setting. The image has a historical or documentary feel, emphasizing themes of industry, labor, and possibly environmental degradation.","title":"U.S. steel plant hazed over by its own emissions","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["557248","545447","557373","550982","545992","557374","557214","551555","546122","547010","557225","546108","542999","550343","550181","545507"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["duct","point","documentary","reality","mute","scale","shroud","degradation","production","emission"]}
