{"path":"543455.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and quaint scene of two individuals walking on a narrow dirt path that winds through dense and vibrant vegetation. The scene is characterized by a lush backdrop of green bushes and tall grasses, suggesting a secluded natural setting, like a trail in a park or rural area. The surroundings are thick with various shades of green and dotted with yellow flowers, contrasting the clear blue sky that peeks through the foliage.\n\nIn the foreground, a male figure appears closer to the camera. He is walking towards the camera, his face partially visible and carrying a child on his shoulders. The child, who seems cheerful and enjoying the ride, clasps his hands loosely around the man's forehead for balance. The man is wearing a green shirt and colorful pants, adding a vibrant touch to the natural tones of the setting.\n\nBehind them is another individual in motion, also facing towards the camera but further down the path. The positioning and action in the photograph convey a sense of casual, joyful motion, possibly during a hike or a leisurely walk.\n\nOverall, the photograph emits a sense of tranquility and familial warmth, capturing a moment of simple pleasure and connection with nature.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543456","557983","543233","553377","545512","544337","554506","552407","544739","553755","558097","553373","554662","551942","551736","546783"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["walk","camera","forehead","path","motion","clasp","child","hike","pleasure","positioning"]}
