{"path":"545191.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal moment featuring fishing activities. The setting is a beach with the ocean in the background. The focal point of the image is a view from inside a fishing boat that's presumably on the sand, looking out towards the sea.\n\nIn the foreground, inside the boat, we see the boat's equipment including a steering wheel, control levers, and part of the boat's deck cluttered with various objects necessary for fishing expeditions. The registration number \"7976 AZ\" is visible on the side of the wheelhouse, indicating the boat's official identification.\n\nThe middle ground features another bright yellow fishing boat entering the water. It has a handful of people aboard, actively engaged in launching it off the beach and into the sea. The people are clad in casual, functional outdoor clothing suitable for maritime activities.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large, distinct rock formation jutting out of the ocean, creating a dramatic silhouette against the clear sky. This natural feature adds a majestic element to the seascape, contrasting sharply with the human activity at the beach.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, taken during what appears to be late afternoon based on the lighting, gives the viewer a vivid impression of daily life and labor at a fishing beach, characterized by the interaction between humans and the natural marine environment.","title":"Salmon fishing on Cape Kiwanda, site of proposed nuclear plant","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["545081","547552","550942","545007","545056","545120","554147","547553","547564","544976","547549","546939","547556","545223","545178","543156"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","beach","ocean","launch","lever","sea","identification","expedition","registration"]}
