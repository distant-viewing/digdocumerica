{"path":"545115.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a large expanse of water covered densely with small, bright green algae or possibly duckweed. The surface of the water is completely obscured by this green covering, giving the image a textured, almost land-like appearance. The light, possibly from the sun, reflects off the water in the background, creating a bright, glowing effect that contrasts sharply with the darker foreground. There are no visible people or animals in the scene. The background features faint silhouettes that could be distant trees or structures lining the horizon, yet they are too indistinct to identify clearly. The overall mood conveyed by the image is serene and a bit mysterious, emphasized by the natural lighting and the thick green layer covering the water.","title":"Sea algae on estuary of rogue river","placename":"Gold Beach (Or.)","location":"Gold Beach, Oregon","nn1":["552525","545387","550834","543555","557445","558009","544765","542554","543558","547509","543561","554623","542582","547639","554603","551352"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["covering","algae","identify","water","bit","animal","cover","glow","expanse","sun"]}
