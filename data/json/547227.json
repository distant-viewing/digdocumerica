{"path":"547227.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vivid landscape featuring a meandering river and human-made elements. The river, characterized by its muddy brown water, curves through the scene from the upper left to the center. Surrounding the river on both sides are dense patches of leafless trees, indicating either a seasonal change or a region that does not support lush foliage.\n\nTo the right of the river, the landscape shifts to a more urban setting with a large blue rectangular reservoir bordered by an eggshell-white embankment that distinctly contrasts with the natural brown and green hues of the environment. Next to the reservoir, there are buildings with light-colored roofs, possibly related to the management of the water resource or nearby recreational facilities. A cluster of vehicles can be seen parked near one of the buildings, suggesting human activity and utility of the area.\n\nThe composition also includes a transportation touch, evident from the roads and railway tracks that run parallel to the river, hinting at a blend of natural and industrial influences in this region. These tracks and roads facilitate connectivity and suggest a corridor frequently used for transit purposes, potentially paralleling urban and suburban boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, the image captures the serene blue sky filled with scattered clouds, blanketing the entire landscape and providing a calm, expansive feeling to the scene. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, aiming downwards and covering a broad geographic area, providing a comprehensive perspective on how natural and human elements interact in this environment.","title":"The dalecarlia reservoir and the potomac river","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550392","555753","549081","547995","548001","556964","549262","557958","557420","552594","550861","557506","550546","550885","543767","546351"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["reservoir","river","track","corridor","region","embankment","connectivity","parallel","shift","facilitate"]}
