{"path":"554832.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric view of a curving, unpaved rural road with a vehicle in motion. The scene is enveloped in a subdued, possibly twilight ambience, accentuated by purplish and dark tones. A pickup truck is seen traveling along the road, creating a plume of dust behind it, which adds a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nThe road winds through a gently rolling landscape, bordered by bare trees and grasses, which suggest that the season could be either late fall or early spring. Utility poles running alongside the road inject a human presence into the otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe photograph is shot from an elevated perspective, looking down upon the road, which enhances the feeling of observance and distance. In the background, a continuation of the road can be seen meeting a pavement, leading off into another area, possibly signaling a transition from rural to a more developed region.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of idyllic rural life, movement, and the passage through nature, underscored by isolation and a touch of melancholy due to the lighting and color filters used.","title":"A huge coal truck with tires eight feet high powers towards a Hanna Coal Company processing area off Route 100, near Morristown, Ohio, and Steubenville.","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["554130","556986","549002","556429","557468","547300","545886","545880","556960","545349","554127","547354","554131","554805","554031","554154"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","continuation","filter","pickup","ambience","pavement","passage","dust","fall","twilight"]}
