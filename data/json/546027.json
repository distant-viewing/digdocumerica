{"path":"546027.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene dominated by a large, metal hopper structure with two prominent cone-shaped discharge points that rest on top of cylindrical supports. These supports are placed on what appears to be two flat concrete blocks at the base, surrounded by a ground covered in gravel.\n\nUnderneath the hopper, crouching between the discharge points, there is an individual wearing a faded red long-sleeve shirt and dark trousers, complemented by a baseball cap and gloves. This person seems to be engaged in a task, likely related to the operation or maintenance of the hopper, as they are reaching towards a metal bucket which might be used to collect or distribute materials from the hoppers.\n\nThe setting around the hoppers is industrial, with visible metal siding of buildings in the background. The environment indicates outdoor light, possibly in the daytime given the clear blue sky visible in the upper portion of the photo.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of industrial activity, focusing on both the infrastructure and the working person involved, hinting at processes possibly related to manufacturing, storage, or transport within an industrial compound.","title":"The exterior of a large enclosed sandblasting unit at the Avondale shipyard.
