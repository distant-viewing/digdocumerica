{"path":"555173.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"The image displays two microscopic strands with a highly magnified and detailed view, which appears to be photographed using polarized light microscopy, a technique often used to enhance the visual properties of specimens. Each strand shows distinct bright, vivid colors predominantly in shades of yellow, red, blue, and green, which may indicate different material properties or stress patterns.\n\nThe strand on the left displays more linear and straight patterns, with predominantly longitudinal striations in red and green. The right strand shows a detailed arrangement of cells or segments in a repetitive pattern, highlighted by dark and light bands that could be characteristic of fibrous biological materials or crystalline structures.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, providing a stark contrast that emphasizes the colors and detailed textures of the strands. This kind of visualization is typical in materials science or biological studies to examine the internal structure and composition of various materials, potentially for research purposes such as studying fibers' physical properties, structural integrity, or other scientific analyses.","title":"Phase contrast microphotograph of stained Douglas fir fibers.
