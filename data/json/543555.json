{"path":"543555.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a shallow aquatic environment. The main focus in the image is a textured, algae-covered surface visible under a thin layer of clear water. The algae appears in abstract patterns consisting of dark and light brown colors, resembling a rough and uneven terrain. Speckles of light reflected in the water add a sparkling effect to the scene.\n\nIn terms of composition, the algae form organic clusters that cover most of the image, interspersed with areas of clear water that reveal the bottom surface underneath, enhancing the depth and dimension of the photograph. The lighting seems to be natural, as indicated by the soft highlights and translucent quality of the water.\n\nThe background is not clearly distinguishable, adding to the focus on the textured algae and the water's surface in the immediate foreground. There are no human activities or other objects visible in the image, emphasizing the natural and undisturbed state of this aquatic ecosystem.","title":"Scum on waters of truckee river","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["546202","543554","542582","543558","543187","545115","545674","546875","555023","555069","547509","555626","547541","544765","545923","550834"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["alga","dimension","water","surface","sparkling","consiste","term","resembl","ecosystem","textured"]}
