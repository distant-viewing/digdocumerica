{"path":"545088.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures three men in an expansive, natural setting that seems to be a marshy field or grassland. One man is on the left side of the image wearing a green T-shirt and looking towards the horizon, as if he's observing something in the distance. In the center, another man wearing a denim jacket over a plaid shirt and jeans is in mid-stride alongside the third man who is also walking and dressed in a yellowish shirt and beige pants. They appear engaged in a casual conversation while strolling near a large fallen log, which is a key element in the foreground of the image.\n\nThe setting is marked by tall grasses and wildflowers, suggesting a wild or less-manicured landscape. The sky above is partly cloudy, indicating variable weather, and a mountain range can be seen faintly in the background, contributing to a sense of a wide-open space. The overall composition conveys a moment of casual exploration or discussion in a tranquil outdoor environment.","title":"Scientists from the national marine fisheries service hammond, Oregon, on Astoria estuary after a field trip.
