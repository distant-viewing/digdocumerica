{"path":"549062.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a man sitting in the rear of a boat gliding across a body of water at high speed. The man appears focused and slightly tense, likely due to handling the boat or the speed at which they move. He is dressed in a light-toned, buttoned shirt and a dark green jacket; as he looks down, possibly at a piece of equipment or controls within the boat.\n\nThe boat itself creates a strong, frothy wake as it moves, churning up water that splashes around the sides and behind it, spotlighting the speed and movement within the scene. In the background, there is a picturesque view of distant mountains and a clear sky, indicating a serene and vast landscape, possibly early in the morning given the gentle lighting.\n\nThe overall image conveys a sense of adventure and focus, combining the elements of natureâ€™s calm and the exhilaration of speed.","title":"California fish and game biologist on the Colorado river regular checks are made of river's temperature, oxygen content salinity level, and fish content","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545179","546976","550840","557242","549458","554196","554199","546317","545156","544973","544758","553411","544115","549417","548520","545740"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["speed","boat","tense","glid","churn","ton","rear","move","wake","button"]}
