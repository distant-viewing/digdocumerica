{"path":"552282.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures two men fishing from a small boat on a body of water. Both men are actively involved in the act of fishing. The man standing in the front of the boat is wearing sunglasses, a red baseball cap, and a brightly colored red and pink shirt, leaning forward as he uses a long-handled fishing net to scoop something from the water. The second man, visible behind the first, appears to be steadying himself by holding onto the fishing rods or other equipment, and wears a beige or light gray vest over a long-sleeve shirt.\n\nThe boat is equipped with various fishing gears and appears to be a motorized boat given the engine visible at the back. The water is relatively calm with small ripples suggesting light movement, and the background shows a distant forested shoreline under a cloudy sky, enhancing the serene yet focused fishing scene.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting suggest this action might be taking place during the day under overcast conditions, providing a soft and diffuse light that highlights the men's focused activities without harsh shadows. The scene evokes a sense of peaceful and methodical engagement with nature.","title":"Crab netting at Brinnon tide flat on the Hood Canal brings out large crowds during the spring and summer minus tides.
