{"path":"549405.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a large sailboat actively sailing in a body of water. The sailboat, positioned on a tilt due to the wind and speed, captures the dynamic movement of sailing. A large, predominantly white sail dominates the frame, filling the upper left side of the image with its outstretched surface catching the wind. The hull of the boat, dark in color, contrasts starkly against the white sail and the blue water. \n\nA person is visible on the boat, appearing near the bow and peering out toward the camera. They are wearing casual sailing attire with a life jacket, suggesting safety precautions are being observed. The water around the boat is choppy, with whitecaps indicating a windy condition conducive to sailing.\n\nIn the background, although slightly out of focus, other sailboats can be seen, suggesting that this scene might be part of a sailing event or a popular sailing area. The sky is overcast, giving a muted light to the scene, which accentuates the white of the sail and the darker tones of the ocean and boat hull. The overall composition conveys the thrill and adventure of sailing, highlighted by the angle and action depicted.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the race.
