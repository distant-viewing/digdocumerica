{"path":"543153.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and natural coastal scene. Dominating the foreground is a large, gnarled tree trunk, dramatically bent into an arching shape. The tree's rough bark is prominently displayed, adding texture to the image. Its weathered appearance suggests it has endured harsh conditions, possibly shaped by the strong winds typical of coastal areas.\n\nBeyond the tree, the image opens up to a scenic view of a rugged coastline. Rocky outcrops and scattered boulders characterize the landscape, framing a small figure standing near the waterâ€™s edge. The person, dressed in casual outdoor attire, appears to be engaged in observing the sea or perhaps exploring the area.\n\nThe background reveals a wide expanse of choppy sea that stretches to the horizon, speckled with white waves under a partly cloudy sky. The distant shore rises gently with rolling hills that hint at a larger landscape beyond, inviting contemplation of the expansive natural environment. This setting is typical of coastal regions where the interaction of land and sea creates continuously changing and picturesque scenery.","title":"Driftwood on beach","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543134","543307","542884","547118","545130","545122","543061","543090","542976","543297","543291","543080","545173","543067","545111","542888"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","shape","speckle","outcrop","endure","boulder","explore","bark","arch","open"]}
