{"path":"543199.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a beautiful natural setting by the sea. It features vibrant patches of pink and white wildflowers covering uneven, rocky terrain. The flowers create a stunning, dense carpet that drapes over the landscape. Some rocks and boulders are visible, poking through this floral blanket, hinting at the ruggedness of the coastline.\n\nIn the middle background, one individual can be seen standing on a rock by the edge of the water. The person is facing out towards the sea, possibly watching the waves or enjoying the solitude. This person is wearing a shirt and pants, which appear quite casual and suitable for an outing by the sea.\n\nThe sea itself is a significant part of the scene, its surface dotted with numerous rocks and small boulders that break the surface of the water, creating small waves around them. The water transitions from a more turbulent near the rocks to a calmer surface further away.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, which enhances the colors of the wildflowers and gives the photograph a tranquil, moody atmosphere. The overall composition of the image, with its natural beauty and the solitary figure, evokes a sense of peaceful solitude and the beauty of nature.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543404","542968","543401","543399","547592","543203","553997","543202","545101","543074","543066","542917","543389","553805","543255","543196"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sea","wildflowers","rock","boulder","wave","calmer","solitude","surface","outing","carpet"]}
