{"path":"546384.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial silhouette against a dusky twilight sky. The scene is dominated by the dark outlines of several industrial structures, including multiple large smokestacks from which dark smoke is emanating. These stacks stand prominently against the glowing orange backdrop of the sky during sunset or sunrise, which provides a stark contrast to the darker foreground elements.\n\nPower lines and utility poles crisscross the upper part of the image, adding a sense of depth and complexity. These lines contribute to the industrial theme, suggesting a network of energy distribution supporting the facility. In the midst of these dark structures, there is a glimpse of sunset light, which shines through some parts of the framework, creating small yet bright reflections.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a typical scene of heavy industry with a focus on energy production or manufacturing, characterized by its towering smokestacks and dense infrastructure. The atmospheric lighting emphasizes the dramatic impact of industrial activities on the environment.","title":"Oil refinery in the sunset","placename":"Ponce (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544684","553847","545414","545425","545410","544696","545446","547090","547200","544708","545421","544688","551030","545438","545418","552165"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["energy","smokestack","sunset","distribution","midst","sunrise","production","line","complexity","manufacturing"]}
