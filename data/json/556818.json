{"path":"556818.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy commuter moment inside an underground subway station. Featured prominently is a crowd of people, both men and women, many of whom are dressed in business attire typical of mid-20th century work culture, including suits, ties, and dresses. The commuters exhibit a variety of expressions, mostly serious or focused, indicative of a typical workday rush.\n\nThe setting is an aged subway platform with curved walls and ceiling, reinforcing the underground setting. The platform is narrow, filled almost entirely by the crowd. Two subway trains are visible, one parked at the platform where people are boarding or disembarking, and the other train is visible in the background on an adjacent track. The train at the platform prominently displays the number 7 and a sign indicating \"Main Street.\"\n\nOverhead, linear fluorescent lights provide illumination, casting a stark, artificial glow onto the scene. The platform and its structures show signs of wear and age, with visible stains, chipped paint, and general dilapidation. In the background, a series of advertisements can be barely discerned along the top of the platform's wall, typical of such public transit locations. \n\nThe photo has a vintage feel, underscored by its grainy quality and monochrome color palette, capturing a slice of urban life and transport from a bygone era. The perspective used in this photograph, taken from the end of the platform, creates a deep view down the tunnel, adding to the scene's depth and the feeling of busy movement.","title":"Morning rush hour passengers going to and from subway trains operated by the New York City Transit Authority. The system is of crucial importance to the city. In 1970, 2.1 million persons each work day were carried to and from work, approximately 47 percent of the work force. However, voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover operating costs.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556815","556823","556821","551894","556774","556812","551883","556819","556650","556697","556682","556651","551886","551895","556660","556779"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","subway","commuter","train","crowd","workday","stain","rush","tunnel","wall"]}
