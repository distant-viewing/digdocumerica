{"path":"549085.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a powerboat racing event. Numerous sleek racing boats are closely packed in the water, each adorned with vivid colors primarily in hues of red, white, and blue, and featuring various sponsor logos and racing numbers. The boats have a sharp, pointed front and are equipped with high-powered outboard engines.\n\nEach boat hosts a pilot, who can be seen wearing helmets and life vests for safety, preparing for the race. The drivers are seated near the rear of the boats, close to the engines, suggesting these are lightweight, high-speed race boats, possibly hydroplanes.\n\nThe background of the image shows additional crew members and spectators gathered closely along a dock or boarding area. These individuals are engaged in pre-race preparations and discussions, adding a sense of excitement and activity to the scene. The atmosphere is dense with anticipation and the noise of boat engines and chatter likely fills the air.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a vibrant and intense moment typical of powerboat racing events, highlighting the energy and detailed coordination involved in such competitive sports.","title":"At the start of annual outboard world championship boat race on Lake Havasu near Parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549731","550879","549733","549732","547708","542697","550840","549389","549425","547450","548520","549082","548058","549934","549400","546912"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["racing","boat","engine","race","boarding","noise","pilot","coordination","anticipation","event"]}
