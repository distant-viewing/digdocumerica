{"path":"550708.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene likely focusing on environmental pollution or industrial waste. In the foreground, there's an engineered water channel or ditch lined with concrete, through which a white, possibly chemical, effluent is flowing. The flow of this effluent is somewhat foamy, suggesting it might be carrying pollutants.\n\nAt the top center of the image two large smokestacks dominate the skyline of an industrial facility. White smoke or steam is billowing from the tops of these chimneys, dispersing into the air against a pale blue sky. The factory appears dense with several structures and tanks, painted in neutral tones.\n\nElectrical lines cross the upper part of the image, suggesting the proximity of this industrial area to other infrastructure. The overall atmosphere is slightly dull, possibly due to light conditions or the photographic film used, giving the image a dated feel and emphasizing the environmental concerns typically associated with such facilities.\n\nThe surrounding environment is not richly detailed, but there are distant hills and sparse vegetative growth visible behind the industrial buildings, indicating that this facility is likely on the outskirts of a more populated area or in a less naturally abundant location.","title":"Lime recovery system at the Oxford Paper Company mill at Rumford on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["544775","550875","546808","550193","550172","551009","552019","546884","546080","551567","545236","551034","550868","551555","548068","544294"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facility","ditch","flow","engineer","pollutant","disperse","outskirt","channel","film","concrete"]}
