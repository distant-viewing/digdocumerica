{"path":"556921.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a cleared, roughly rectangular area surrounded by a dense forest of coniferous trees. The central clearing is likely a constructed facility, possibly for logistics or storage, given the presence of large structures that resemble open warehouses or shelters. There are three long, narrow buildings that appear to have roofs reflective in nature, perhaps made of metal, which are aligned parallel to each other. Adjacent to these buildings, on the right-hand side of the rectangle, is a large dirt area that stretches the length of the clearing. Two small structures, resembling standard shipping containers or small buildings, are situated near the center of the clearing, positioned so they face each other across a paved area that appears to be a road or path, intersecting the site horizontally and providing access to it. The composition of the image, with the vast, dark green forest encompassing the man-made installation, highlights the contrast between natural and developed land use.","title":"Aerial view of a typical storage yard at the Bangor annex navy installation.
