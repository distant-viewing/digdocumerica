{"path":"556816.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling fast food scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, focusing on a hamburger stand in what appears to be a food court or a similar indoor public space. The central element of the image is the bold, diagonal sign, prominently featuring the word \"HAMBURGERS\" in alternating black and white stripes.\n\nThe environment is busy, with numerous patrons either queuing at the counter or milling about in the background. The overhead structure is characterized by exposed beams and pipes, contributing to an industrial or utilitarian vibe often found in such venues during the period. The lighting is generally fluorescent, casting a stark, even light over the scene, and the decor features simple, functional elements.\n\nThe foreground shows a diverse group of people: a man in a striped shirt and slacks is facing the counter with a woman in a striped dress standing nearby. Meanwhile, a couple of other individuals are seen in mid-conversation or walking through the area, engaged in various activities. Most are dressed in typical casual or work attire of the era, such as slacks, shirts, and skirts.\n\nIn summary, the photograph vividly portrays a moment of everyday life, where people from various walks of life converge in a communal space for a quick meal, reflecting an era-specific social and cultural milieu. The composition of the image, with its focus on human interaction and the bustling atmosphere, tells a story of social connectivity in public spaces.","title":"Hamburger stand offers customers a quick bite while waiting for their subway train on the 42nd Street station operated by the New York City Transit Authority. A new line on 2nd Avenue is being built. Originally it was intended to relieve overcrowding on the Lexington line, but ridership has decreased and the new line is not as necessary as when it was proposed. In 1967 the new line cost was estimated at $151 million, now it is figured at $2 billion.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545457","554187","547779","551887","554866","553319","547855","556825","551494","556214","551844","546216","551419","551888","549909","551495"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["slack","counter","food","space","patron","era","connectivity","walk","decor","venue"]}
