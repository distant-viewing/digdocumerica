{"path":"547099.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene along a lakeside pathway at dusk. The composition shows a broad water body on the left, with choppy surfaces suggesting a mild breeze. Along the right edge of the picture, a stone pathway stretches into the distance, framed by patches of grass and occasional trees. Some snow or ice patches anomalously lie on the pathway and grass, indicating the image was likely taken in cold weather.\n\nTowards the horizon, the image features a city skyline with various buildings silhouetted against a fading light sky. A mixture of high-rise and low-rise structures can be seen, some with distinctive architectural shapes, highlighting an urban environment. This scene conveys a peaceful coexistence of natural and urban elements, likely taken during the late afternoon or early evening hours as suggested by the soft, dim lighting and long shadows.\n\nA few small figures are visible walking along the path, individually and in pairs, lending a human element to the predominantly serene environment. Their presence adds a sense of scale and liveliness to the otherwise quiet lakeshore setting. The overall mood of the photograph is contemplative and calm, with the soft colors and low light enhancing the tranquil atmosphere.","title":"Looking south along Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552263","550014","549986","552311","543577","546392","554405","551280","547127","547180","552319","551776","544709","557570","557493","553440"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["pathway","rise","liveliness","lakeside","breeze","ice","grass","coexistence","pair","hour"]}
