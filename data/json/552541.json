{"path":"552541.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a rural landscape scene, predominantly featuring agricultural fields under cultivation. The fields are marked by long, parallel rows which appear recently plowed or harvested, presenting a geometric pattern of alternating dark and light stripes. A significant visual element is a large, robust tree standing prominently on the right side of the image. The treeâ€™s dense canopy suggests mid to late-season growth, providing a stark visual contrast against the regularly patterned fields.\n\nDirectly beneath the tree, there is a small, simple structure, possibly a shed or an old outhouse, adding a rustic touch to the scene. This structure is old and weathered, with a door that appears slightly ajar.\n\nThe background offers a distant view of a flat horizon where further agricultural fields are visible. There are faint outlines of buildings and possibly silos in the far distance, suggesting a farming community nearby.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat subdued, with overcast skies and a palette dominated by blues and greens, emphasizing a cool tone and mood. The scene is devoid of visible people or moving objects, contributing to a tranquil, perhaps solitary impression of rural life and agriculture.","title":"Burnt field","placename":"Carbondale (Ill.)","location":"Carbondale, Illinois","nn1":["552484","552466","555537","547649","557946","547303","557183","545040","547291","544481","547304","555541","552515","557023","547288","549182"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["field","cultivation","silo","shed","agriculture","farming","stripe","growth","outline","canopy"]}
