{"path":"544036.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, possibly a mining or a processing facility. There are multiple elements contributing to a complex industrial landscape:\n\n1. **Water Bodies**: In the forefront, there are several artificial water channels or pits visible. These are filled with dark-colored water and scattered with large piles of what seems to be mine waste or aggregates. Two piles are particularly pronounced, emerging above the water's surface.\n\n2. **Infrastructure**: Spanning across the scene are concrete pathways and a narrow metal bridge connecting different parts of the facility. These pathways and the bridge show visible wear and rust.\n\n3. **Buildings**: Towards the background, there is a large rectangular building constructed from concrete and metal. The building appears aged and shows signs of deterioration. Attached to this structure are metal chutes or slides colored yellow, giving a sense of the buildingâ€™s potential functionality in processing or moving materials.\n\n4. **Vegetation and Terrain**: The landscape surrounding the facility is arid, with sparse vegetation visible behind the building. The terrain slopes around the edges, hinting at erosion or construction shaping the land.\n\n5. **Utility Structures**: To the left and right background, electrical power lines and pylons are visible. These confirm the industrial nature of the location, suggesting significant power usage.\n\n6. **Sky and Lighting**: The sky is deep blue and cloudless, indicating a sunny day which casts shadows defining the structures and embankments prominently.\n\nOverall, the scene presents an industrial or mineral processing facility amidst a rugged terrain, with elements designed for specific industrial operations involving water and materials handling. The environmental impact and the age of the facilities suggest long-term industrial use.","title":"Area of copper smelting plant where iron is \"leached\", or separated out.","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544044","544048","551612","543669","544037","555787","552427","544569","551611","551556","544702","544788","549965","544179","549508","554764"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["facility","processing","pathway","power","metal","pile","chute","bridge","slide","building"]}
