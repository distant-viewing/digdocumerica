{"path":"549122.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In this photograph, an elderly man is smiling warmly at the camera, exuding a cheerful and inviting demeanor. He is dressed in a style typical of a cowboy, featuring a brown cowboy hat adorned with a decorative feather on the left side, and he wears round, wire-framed sunglasses. The man is wearing a plaid shirt with tones of red, yellow, and black, further reinforcing the rustic, Western theme.\n\nThe shirt is neatly tucked into his pants, belted with a simple black leather belt, featuring a modest buckle. It seems he's also sporting a wristwatch on his left wrist, obscured partially by his shirtsleeve.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors in a rural or natural area, with a blurry background suggesting a green, rolling landscape that might be a grassy field or a gentle hill. The lighting is bright and natural, indicating it might be midday, which casts a clear light on the man and highlights his cheerful expression and the textures of his apparel.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is jovial and pleasant, capturing a moment of genuine happiness and comfort in a natural setting. This portrait not only focuses on the man's joyful expression but also subtly tells a story of his lifestyle or heritage through his attire and the surrounding environment.","title":"Bud Redding is one of the Sarpy Basin ranchers who is resisting the Westmoreland Coal Company's attempts to buy their land for strip mining.
