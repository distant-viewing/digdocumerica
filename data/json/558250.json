{"path":"558250.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at what appears to be an outdoor setting related to shoe or sneaker testing. The central part of the image shows a man dressed in a light yellow shirt and white shorts seated on tan steps, adjusting his shoes. He is surrounded by various pairs of shoes laid out in front of him on the ground, seeming to be in the process of either testing them out or selecting a pair.\n\nBehind the man, a series of metal frames creates a geometric pattern of X-shapes, adding an industrial or architectural detail to the setting. Hanging from these frames are several large, conical objects, resembling megaphones or speakers, which are directed downward.\n\nBeyond the frames, another section of the building or complex can be glimpsed, filled with chairs and masked by some further clutter, providing a hint of a populated space or perhaps a waiting area.\n\nThe sun casts sharp shadows which fall across the steps, rails, and frames, suggesting either morning or late afternoon. The man seems focused and possibly engaged in a conversation or preparing for activity, evident through his posture and the placement of his hands as he adjusts his shoe. This scenario likely indicates a setting where footwear performance is assessed, possibly for sports or orthopedic purposes.","title":"An adult checking out a shoe bargain among merchandise placed outdoors by merchants in New Ulm, Minnesota, during their annual summer crazy days sale.
