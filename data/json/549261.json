{"path":"549261.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft lighting. It features rolling hills covered in lush green fields, predominantly utilized for agriculture. The patterns of varying shades of green suggest different crop types or stages of growth.\n\nA striking element in the scenery is a winding, red dirt road that cuts through the landscape, enhancing the depth of the photograph and drawing the viewer's eye toward the horizon. The road is bordered by fences, indicating cultivated and managed parcels of land.\n\nScattered across the fields are patches of trees and shrubs, adding texture and breaks in the verdant expanses. In the distance, the terrain rises gently to form more pronounced hills, which are faintly obscured by a mist that blurs the lines between land and sky, contributing to the tranquil and expansive feeling of the scene.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the image, emphasizing the quiet and uninhabited nature of the area at the time the photograph was taken. The overall composition of the photograph, with its broad, sweeping views and peaceful setting, evokes a sense of calm and solitude.","title":"The Bud Redding Ranch in Sarpy Basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["547300","555603","549236","557087","549182","549235","545040","549257","549142","549146","557557","557748","555567","549256","555624","549222"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["parcel","land","field","hill","agriculture","break","calm","crop","road","stage"]}
