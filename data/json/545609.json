The plaque, belonging to Newspaper Rock in Indian Creek State Park, Utah, is made of metal and features engraved text and the Utah state seal. The background of the metal plaque is light gray, and the text is darker, making it easily readable. The text explains that Newspaper Rock showcases petroglyphs created by the ancient peoples who lived in the area many centuries ago, highlighting the historical significance and the mystery of the meanings behind the petroglyphs believed to be related to hunting magic and other cultural narratives. Three periods of time are noted, with the earliest dating back to around 900-1500 A.D., attributed to the Fremont horticultural peoples, or basketmakers. The text also mentions that the namesake 'Newspaper Rock' according to Navajo language translates to \"rock that tells a story\", hinting at its cultural storytelling significance. The Utah state seal, positioned at the bottom-right of the plaque, features an eagle above a shield with a beehive motif, symbolizing statehood, perseverance, and industry.","title":"Plaque describes \"Newspaper Rock,\" at Indian Creek State Park.
