{"path":"546635.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a city street scene, seemingly taken around the 1960s or 1970s given the style of vehicles and fashion. On the right-hand side of the image, a police officer wearing a dark uniform and cap stands in the street beside a parked classic car, possibly a Ford Mustang. He appears to be writing a ticket or examining a small notebook.\n\nIn the background, there's a busy street lined with parked cars and moving vehicles, including a variety of sedans and a large, dark truck. The architecture along the street features older commercial buildings, characterized by storefront signs, one of which is clearly labeled \"Budgets.\" The way the buildings are structured and the design elements suggest an urban setting typical of mid-20th-century American cities.\n\nPublic infrastructure includes street lamps and parking meters lining the foreground where the Mustang is parked. Sidewalks run along either side of the street, edged with low shrubs and fairly young trees indicating some form of urban planting. The scene captures everyday urban activity with a focus on law enforcement and automobile culture typical of the era. The atmosphere appears ordinary and somewhat subdued, likely a weekday scenario in a bustling city environment.","title":"Officer writes ticket for illegal rush hour parking","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546631","555461","549932","546661","554293","556709","546743","554309","546653","550139","549882","554354","554297","556724","556718","556717"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","city","enforcement","law","notebook","ticket","planting","meter","officer","police"]}
