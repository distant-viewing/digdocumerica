{"path":"544365.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a man inside a dimly lit storage area filled with large sacks, possibly containing agricultural products like grain. The man is seated on one of these sacks, wearing a light-colored long sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a cap. He is looking towards the camera with a relaxed posture, leaning back slightly with his arms resting on the sack.\n\nThe background shows a wooden beam structure indicative of an old or rustic building. The area is softly illuminated by natural light filtering through small openings, which creates a series of small bright spots across the scene. The sacks are neatly stacked in rows forming aisles, and they fill the space, reaching up to the wooden beams of the ceiling, indicating a possibly large quantity of stored goods.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of old-fashioned manual labor and storage methods in a rural or agricultural setting. The mood is serene and subdued, with a focus on the individual amidst his work environment.","title":"Reclining on feed sacks","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["549048","552684","553516","549036","547427","547395","554945","553517","543478","552104","555297","556316","555532","554936","548455","554855"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["sack","beam","storage","aisle","quantity","method","filtering","grain","product","opening"]}
