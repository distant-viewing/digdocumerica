{"path":"558102.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The image depicts a rustic scene in a woodland setting during what appears to be autumn. In the foreground, there's a thick cover of foliage including several trees, shrubs, and scattered leaves on the ground, suggesting the autumn season due to the variety of colors such as browns, yellows, and greens.\n\nThe background features a traditional wooden house partially obscured by the dense tree cover. The house appears aged, with a dark roof and lighter colored walls, possibly weathered wood siding. It has at least two visible levels, with windows that are slightly visible through the trees. There are multiple items scattered around the exterior of the house, including a red wheelbarrow, white buckets, and other unidentifiable objects that contribute to an impression of rural life and possibly some ongoing outdoor activities or storage.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph portrays a secluded, maybe somewhat neglected environment, emphasizing a sense of quietness and isolation typical for rural or semi-wild settings. The atmosphere might be damp and cool, which is suggested by the overcast sky and the wet surfaces visible in the image.","title":"The top of an archaeological site called the botzum mound with a date of 500 b.c., according to the Cleveland museum of natural history.
