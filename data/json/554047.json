{"path":"554047.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene, capturing an individual engaged in manual labor in a field. The person, whose face is partially obscured by a wide-brimmed hat layered over with a red bandana patterned with white accents, is intently working with the soil. They wear a striped, multicolored, short-sleeved shirt and are equipped with heavy-duty gloves, suggesting the physical nature of the task.\n\nThe laborer is bending forward toward the ground, handling a bundle of long thin sticks or canes, which are tied together securely with a strap or rope. This bundle appears to have been freshly harvested, possibly for agricultural use or transport.\n\nThe field itself is rich and dark, indicative of fertile soil, freshly tilled or harvested. The background reveals a wide expanse of similar fields under a subdued sky, suggesting an overcast or cloudy day. In the distance, gentle hills or low mountains can faintly be seen, adding a rural, spacious feel to the setting.\n\nThe scene evokes a sense of hard work and agriculture, emphasizing the person's active role in farming or crop management. The protective clothing and the nature of the bundle hint at specific types of crops or agricultural practices specific to the region or the crop season.","title":"Planting sugarcane, the island's chief crop.
