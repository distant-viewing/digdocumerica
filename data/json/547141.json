{"path":"547141.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a scene from a clear day outdoors with a vintage aesthetic. On the left side of the image, part of a classic station wagon is visible, featuring a prominent rear with metallic ornamentation and the name \"Ford\" visible, indicating its make. The car is parked on an asphalt surface, and its long shadow stretches across the ground, hinting at a time around midday or early afternoon.\n\nTo the right, a person stands at the edge of a stone wall that acts as a barrier. The individual is turned away from the camera, looking out over the wall towards a landscape that isn't visible due to the camera angle. The person wears a distinctive, long plaid coat in various shades of red, blue, and yellow, and what appears to be green pants and dark shoes. The person's attire, including a large hat, gives off a retro vibe which complements the vintage appearance of the station wagon.\n\nThe sky is a clear, vivid blue without visible clouds, creating a crisp backdrop that contrasts sharply with the subjects and emphasizes the brightness of the day. The simplicity of the composition focuses attention on the person and the car, evoking a sense of solitude and contemplation. The open space over the wall suggests a scenic viewpoint, possibly overlooking a natural landscape, which the person seems to be enjoying.","title":"Observing a gale on lake Michigan from the breakwater at Michigan city","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["546093","544641","550152","552995","542862","548958","548752","547185","552780","551119","554920","555944","546849","545321","557874","549002"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["person","wagon","wall","station","retro","asphalt","rear","camera","midday","overlook"]}
