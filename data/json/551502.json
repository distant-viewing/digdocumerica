{"path":"551502.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"In this photograph, two young individuals, likely teenagers, are seen sitting on a sidewalk in a bustling urban environment. The person on the left, who appears to be a male, is wearing a purple t-shirt with a white collar and shortsleeves, along with blue jeans, seated with one knee drawn up and an arm resting on the knee. The person on the right, appearing female, is wearing a colorful tank top and blue pants, sitting more relaxed with legs crossed to one side. She has her hand shading her eyes from the sun as she looks upwards, presumably towards the sky or maybe an interesting sight out of frame.\n\nThe background features a “space clock,” a public device encased in a protective glass with a wood frame, displaying various dials and information plates about space. It significantly contrasts with the organic and casual appearance of the young individuals in the foreground. The background also shows a crowd of people, including a likely older male figure in a grey suit, and women in various casual and street attire, suggesting a diverse age range among the bystanders or passersby.\n\nThe environment suggests a sunny day, given the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground, and the overall ambiance of the scene feels lively and typical of a busy city area with pedestrians engaged in different activities. Overall, the composition captures a candid urban moment blending technological curiosity and youthful leisure.","title":"Resting against the weather station in Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553166","553185","551451","549909","546443","545423","551462","553164","550188","553151","551461","552970","551434","553183","546452","551447"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["knee","encase","female","teenager","passersby","sit","dial","clock","sight","collar"]}
