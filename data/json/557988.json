{"path":"557988.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, natural landscape scene featuring two individuals on horseback. They are positioned in a grassy area, appearing to have paused or slowed down in their ride. The person on the left sits atop a black horse and is turned slightly towards the camera, wearing a red jacket, blue jeans, and riding boots. The individual on the right, riding a white horse and facing away from the camera, is dressed in a black jacket and blue jeans, giving the impression of casual, functional attire for horseback riding.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a panoramic view of a forest with a mix of autumn-colored trees in shades of green, yellow, and orange, suggesting that the photo was taken during fall. The woodland borders a wide, cleared field that exhibits signs of recent harvest, underscored by the grey, overcast sky which adds a moody, tranquil tone to the setting.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, there is a hint of a trail marked by a post on the right side, possibly indicating a path for horse riding or hiking. The overall composition of the photo presents a tranquil moment of connection with nature, facilitated by horse riding. The colors, lighting, and landscape together convey a calm, picturesque day outdoors.","title":"Horseback riders along buckey trail near furnace run, site of a collapsed covered bridge.
