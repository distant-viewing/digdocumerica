{"path":"543774.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic and dry landscape under a clear blue sky. It prominently features a fenced-off area with a barren, yellow-orange ground which suggests an arid environment. The fence, made of wire with metal posts, extends diagonally from the forefront to the middle of the image, creating a perspective line leading the eye across the scene.\n\nAt the center and beyond the fence is a large, flat area with a similar yellowish-orange hue, possibly a dry riverbed or a field lacking vegetation due to arid conditions. This central area is bordered by layers of sediment or soil, showing a range of earthy tones from yellow to deep brown, hinting at geological layering or erosion. A stark contrast is provided by the backdrop which consists of a sizable, smooth hill or mountain, largely devoid of vegetation, reinforcing the harsh, dry nature of the landscape.\n\nThere are no people or moving objects visible, and the scene is devoid of significant vegetation, emphasizing desolation and tranquility. The composition focuses largely on the natural environment and the palpable stillness of the area, underlined by a clear sky that complements the barren ground below. The color palette is dominated by earth tones, with the bright sky adding a pop of color that enhances the aridity depicted.","title":"Union Carbide uranium mill's settling ponds are located near the San Miguel River.","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["544019","549156","545819","555642","545823","550397","555885","554817","549183","545895","544401","549132","548673","549179","555573","552420"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["fence","layering","pop","riverbed","vegetation","desolation","sediment","stillness","erosion","wire"]}
