{"path":"543240.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, two people are engaging in fishing activities by the waterfront. On the left side of the image, a person is seated on the ground, focusing on assembling or handling fishing equipment. This individual is dressed in a brown sweater and dark pants. To the right, another individual stands while interacting with a portable, cylindrical object that appears to be a fishing reel or similar equipment; this person is clad in a red jacket and a patterned headscarf, and is bending over to perhaps fix something at the base where a bag also sits.\n\nThe background features a shimmering body of water under bright sunlight, creating a visually striking reflection on its surface. The shoreline is rugged with scattered rocks. The environment suggests a serene and peaceful setting, primarily devoted to the leisurely activity of fishing. The overall mood conveyed is tranquil and focused, set in an outdoor, natural landscape.","title":"California--zmudowski state park","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["552324","550851","552291","545178","547884","553081","543222","551393","549935","552326","552317","548160","548738","548735","554008","543516"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","reel","assemble","headscarf","fix","equipment","person","sweater","waterfront","clothe"]}
