{"path":"554161.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene rural scene, primarily dominated by a pastoral landscape. At the forefront, a lone horse grazes on the green pasture. The horse's posture is relaxed and it is busily engaged in grazing, demonstrating the tranquility of its environment. Directly in the frameâ€™s center stands a stark, leafless tree that appears aged or dead, adding a rugged character to the scenery. This tree, with its branches bare and reaching upwards, is a striking contrast to the soft, grassy field.\n\nBehind the grazing horse, the middle ground shows a simple wooden barn or farmhouse structure, with a slanted roof and what appears to be a covered porch area. The building seems functional and unadorned, typical of utilitarian farm architecture. Several fences, both immediate to the building and stretching across the fields, suggest the area is designated for livestock management.\n\nFurther in the background, the landscape gently rolls, and is dotted with clumps of shrubs or small trees, enhancing the rural feel. The horizon merges with a cloudy sky, suggesting an overcast day which casts an even, soft light over the entire scene, muting the colors into a palette of greens, browns, and grays.\n\nOverall, this photograph exudes a peaceful, bucolic atmosphere, capturing a moment of everyday rural life. The composition, with its central positioning of the dead tree and the horse, draws the eye naturally across its elements, from the living creature and the symbolism of life continuing in the presence of decay, to the human marks on the landscape represented by the barn and fences.","title":"Pasture","placename":"Kamuela (Hawaii)","location":"Kamuela, Hawaii","nn1":["543726","556957","542622","557186","556586","546102","552501","552562","555538","542805","555577","551229","556958","554801","554800","557749"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","grazing","barn","fence","mut","pasture","farmhouse","clumps","creature","designate"]}
