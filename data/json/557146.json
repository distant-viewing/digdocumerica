{"path":"557146.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and bucolic landscape scene. A person is shown sitting in the foreground, observing the view. They are sitting with their legs crossed on the ground, wearing blue jeans and a red vest over a long-sleeved blue shirt. The person's hair is long, tied back, and appears to be a redhead, though they are facing away from the camera, which adds a contemplative and anonymous quality to the image.\n\nThe foreground features dense, lush foliage, transitioning from shades of green to hints of autumnal red and yellow, suggesting the photograph might have been taken in early autumn. The variety of trees and shrubs create a thick blanket of leaves, some of which are beginning to show seasonal change.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of thick woods, the landscape opens up to reveal a grassy field under a clear, bright blue sky. This expanse offers a stark contrast to the densely wooded area, providing a sense of openness and calmness. The horizon is flat, indicating a vast plain typical of certain rural or semi-wilderness areas in temperate zones.\n\nOverall, the composition is peaceful, with natural colors and a clear division between the dense foreground and the spacious background. This setup, along with the thoughtful positioning of the lone observer, evokes a sense of reflection and appreciation for nature.","title":"Students from Kansas State University at Manhattan contemplate the hills during the second annual Tallgrass Prairie National Park Conference held at Elmdale, Kansas, near Emporia in the Flint Hills region.
