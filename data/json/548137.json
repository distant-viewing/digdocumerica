{"path":"548137.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial or water treatment setting. It features several large, open water tanks divided by walkways, with metal railing frameworks around them. These tanks appear to be functioning, with water visible in some sections. The infrastructure is contained within a perimeter enclosed by a chain-link fence.\n\nBeyond the fence, towards the left of the image, stands a large semi-truck labeled \"Water Reclamation Research,\" indicating the function or a project associated with the facility. The truck is parked on a gravel area and set against a backdrop dense with coniferous trees, emphasizing a rural or less urbanized setting. Above this scene, the sky is visible with a few mild clouds dispersed across it, suggesting a clear day. The overall scene is tranquil with no visible people, suggesting a focus on the facilities and their function rather than human activity. The area is well-lit, indicating the photograph was taken during daylight hours.","title":"Part of sewage treatment plant for the city of Spokane","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548151","543573","545840","543571","543574","548212","543572","549636","542987","549635","547568","548216","547262","545836","543568","546895"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["function","fence","tank","truck","perimeter","link","facility","treatment","project","chain"]}
