{"path":"550052.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant urban park scene set against a backdrop of high-rise buildings. In the center of the image is a pond or lake, where a small, decorative fountain is visible, around which several pedal boats full of people are gathered. The foreground features numerous individuals seated along the edge of the water, possibly enjoying a sunny day out in the park.\n\nThere are several colorful balloons in the very immediate foreground, with two distinctly more prominent than the others. One of the balloons is green and the other is peach; both have texts or designs which are not clearly legible, adding a playful element to the scene. These balloons are likely held by visitors to the park, who are not visible except for their silhouettes against the sunlight.\n\nAbove the scene, the trees are lush and green, suggesting that the season is either spring or summer. The branches of the trees frame the image nicely, with the leaves casting patterns of light and shadow across the scene. This vegetation contrasts sharply with the urban environment of skyscrapers in the distance, which loom over the park, providing a stark reminder of the city that surrounds this peaceful green space.\n\nOverall, the composition successfully captures a bustling yet tranquil urban park atmosphere, where city dwellers have come to enjoy the outdoors, whether by relaxing near the water, pedaling on the pond, or simply strolling through the park. The presence of natural elements and human activity combined construct a lively and scenic urban tableau.","title":"Touring public gardens in the ever popular Swan Boat.
