{"path":"551996.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph displays an aerial view of a cluttered salvage yard adjacent to a body of water, possibly a river or stream, which borders the site on its lower side. The salvage yard is densely packed with numerous discarded vehicles including cars, trucks, and vans in various states of disrepair and disassembly. Several piles of scrap metal and other materials are scattered throughout the area.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the salvage yard is a mix of vegetated areas with trees and open ground that appears to be unkempt and overgrown with patches of bare earth. To the right of the photograph, there is a more open area where the density of discarded vehicles is somewhat less.\n\nSeveral small buildings, possibly sheds or workshops, can be seen throughout the yard. These buildings appear to be makeshift structures, likely used for storage or as workshops related to the salvage operations.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph shows a contrast between the man-made chaos of the salvage yard and the natural river edge. The photograph may invoke themes related to environmental impact, the lifespan of consumer products, or the economic realities of scrap and salvage businesses.","title":"Auto wreckers and auto junk-yard on Meridith Avenue unwanted autoMobile Bodies and parts are dumped into Arthur Kill.","placename":"Staten Island (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Staten Island, New York","nn1":["548819","548422","552740","546267","545340","547610","546268","549023","552072","547611","545010","542656","552999","545059","545365","545851"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["salvage","yard","scrap","workshop","discard","consumer","reality","chaos","relate","invoke"]}
