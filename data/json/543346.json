{"path":"543346.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal scene enriched by blooms and architectural elements. On the right side, thereâ€™s a long, narrow structure with one wall entirely made of vertically aligned rectangular windows, reflecting the shimmering sea and enhancing the openness to the surrounding landscape. The roof of the structure extends slightly over the windows, indicating it might be a sunroom or a porch facing the ocean.\n\nThe left side of the photograph reveals a natural coastal landscape featuring a steep, rocky cliff adorned with dense patches of pink blooming flowers which blanket the slopes, contrasting vibrantly against the rugged terrain. A narrow dirt path cuts through the flowers leading towards the cliff edge, suggesting a scenic viewpoint or trail commonly used to admire the seascape.\n\nThe background showcases the rough coastline with rocky formations that protrude into a calm sea. The water reflects sunlight creating a luminous effect near the horizon. The sky is somewhat overcast, casting a gentle diffused light over the entire scene, which gives the colors a soft, muted appearance typical of coastal regions in foggy or misty conditions.\n\nThis photograph beautifully captures the tranquil yet rugged beauty of a coastal environment harmoniously coexisting with human-made structures designed to capitalize on the panoramic views of the sea.","title":"Southern California -- Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543401","543340","542968","543363","543399","554081","543066","547592","543184","557429","554082","543404","543337","545110","543291","543426"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["bloom","sea","coastal","cliff","capitalize","diffused","foggy","protrude","seascape","coexist"]}
