{"path":"545533.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged landscape of an expansive mining or excavation site. Dominated by rocky terrain, the image shows a broad dirt track that curves through the center, flanked by large mounds of rubble and debris. The ground is uneven and littered with various sizes of stones, boulders, and dirt, suggesting recent or ongoing excavation activities.\n\nThe scene is set under a partly cloudy sky with sunlight casting shadows across the terrain, enhancing the rough and uneven surface of the area. The background is marked by slopes covered with similar rocky debris, devoid of any vegetation, emphasizing the barren, industrial nature of the site. The overall impression is one of a desolate and heavily worked landscape, typical of mining or large-scale earth-moving operations. No machinery or people are visible in the scene, focusing the viewer completely on the environmental impact and the sheer scale of human alteration to the landscape.","title":"Devastated area-site of a strip mine near Route 269","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["554804","552004","552422","555614","544139","554802","545529","547591","555622","545677","550574","554765","544418","554836","554769","555621"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavation","mining","dirt","site","alteration","scale","rubble","debris","boulder","mound"]}
