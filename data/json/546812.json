{"path":"546812.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people, primarily children, gathered on a boat or ship, likely on some kind of tour or excursion. The children are diverse in appearance, wearing various casual and colorful attire typical of styles from the mid-to-late 20th century, which suggests the time period of the image. They are looking outwards, off-camera, possibly focusing on a point of interest or listening to a guide. One adult in red stands out, suggesting she might be leading the group or providing supervision.\n\nIn the background, the port setting features several large ships. The nearest ship, named \"VENUS B,\" is a large cargo vessel with visible deck equipment and structures specific to maritime shipping activities. Other ships and port infrastructure fill the background, indicating a busy maritime industrial scene.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of casual interest and learning, with the children's expressions ranging from curiosity to mild distraction, typical of young groups on educational outings. The setting is overcast, contributing to the somber lighting and muted colors in the photo.","title":"School children on a harbor tour aboard the \"port welcome.\"  Here they watch the unloading of ships at dundalk marine terminal, a Maryland port authority facility","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["554176","554189","546797","545961","545728","546839","549373","549910","548115","549410","547838","549412","553799","545957","554177","549326"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ship","port","child","interest","group","excursion","tour","distraction","learn","outing"]}
