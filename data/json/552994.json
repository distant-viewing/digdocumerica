{"path":"552994.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a vividly dynamic natural landscape, possibly depicting the effects of environmental disruption, such as mining or deforestation. The foreground of the image displays a visibly turbulent stream, filled with muddy, rushing water rich in sediments, indicative of recent soil disturbance. The water's color and force suggest it could be the result of runoff from recent precipitation or melting snow, further influenced by the disturbed earth.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, slightly blurred by the foreground elements, there are ramshackle wooden structures that appear to be part of a mining operation. These structures, likely for storage or as shelter for workers, are in a state of disrepair which suggests that the site might be old or currently inactive. The presence of these buildings establishes a sense of human impact, contrasting with the wild state of the landscape.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a rugged terrain, showcasing steep, bare hillsides stripped of vegetation. This could indicate extensive logging or land clearing for mining. The lack of vegetation on the slopes contributes to soil erosion, as evidenced by the sediment-rich stream.\n\nIn the background, one can see mountains partially covered with snow, suggesting this photograph might have been taken either in late spring or early autumn. The mountains, coupled with the occasional standing dead trees and scattered patches of surviving forest, offer a reminder of what the landscape might have originally looked like.\n\nThe sky above is dramatic, with large, fluffy clouds that hint at potential rainfall. This interesting contrast in weather elements adds a dynamic quality to the scene, highlighting nature's resilience and ongoing changes.\n\nOverall, the composition of this image captures both the serene natural beauty and the stark, haunting impacts of industrial activities on the environment. It serves as a powerful visual narrative about the consequences of human exploitation of natural resources.","title":"Acid drainage from mine (from the documerica-1 exhibition for other images in this assignment, see fiche numbers 20, 21, 22, 23","placename":"Rico (Colo.)","location":"Rico, Colorado","nn1":["543709","543815","544734","543670","553420","544943","555209","545656","555569","543721","555598","542881","552062","554815","543759","542880"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mining","sediment","stream","snow","rushe","state","melte","consequence","runoff","soil"]}
