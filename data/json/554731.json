{"path":"554731.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene set against a forest silhouette. The main subjects of the image are the silhouettes of various tall trees, likely conifers, punctuating the skyline. The trees are uneven in height and density, with some presenting broken or bare branches that add texture and a slight roughness to the landscape. \n\nThe sky occupies the upper third of the image, displaying a compelling mix of colors transitioning from a deep blue at the top to warmer golden and orange hues near the horizon where the sun is setting. Wispy, delicate clouds streak across the sky, diffusing in colors that gently blend with the dying light, giving the clouds a faint glow.\n\nThe foreground is mostly dark due to the backlighting of the sunset, emphasizing the outlines of the trees against the sky. The sun, partially visible through a gap in the trees at a lower right angle, casts a soft glow and creates a feeling of depth and perspective in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the natural lines of the trees and the direction of the sunlight to guide the viewer's eye through the image, creating a sense of peace and the quiet end of a day. The photo evokes a contemplative mood, typical of sunset scenes observed in solitude.","title":"Virgin white pines silhouetted against a sunset in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at Moose River Plains","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["542625","547719","552335","543137","550646","547705","552338","543145","543415","543410","554403","543621","554760","554404","557447","542618"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sunset","glow","die","sun","tree","backlighting","silhouette","gap","peace","conifer"]}
