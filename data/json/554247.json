{"path":"554247.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This image captures a scene at a snowy ski resort. In the foreground, we see a ski lift carrying pairs of skiers uphill. The chair lift is complete with safety bars and footrests, and the riders are dressed in winter ski gear, including helmets and goggles. One visible pair has the person on the left wearing a red jacket, while other outfits are less distinct due to the angle and distance.\n\nBelow the ski lift, several other skiers are descending down the groomed slope. The slope features well-maintained snow, and the skiers appear to be mid-motion, enjoying their run.\n\nThe background is densely populated with tall evergreen trees heavily blanketed in snow, indicating recent snowfall. The trees stretch up the slope and out of the frame, emphasizing the height and natural beauty of the mountain environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a vibrant winter sport atmosphere in a mountainous, tree-filled setting, illustrating both the activity of skiing and the quieter moment of ascending on the lift.","title":"Chair lift goes to the top of snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554254","554248","554234","554245","550017","554246","554236","550004","554257","554235","554253","554239","554244","554292","554242","554251"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","lift","skier","slope","winter","pair","snow","goggle","snowfall","skiing"]}
