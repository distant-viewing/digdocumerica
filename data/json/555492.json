{"path":"555492.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a dense accumulation of old and damaged cars, appearing to be a scrapyard or junkyard. Several layers of stacked vehicles fill the frame, predominantly featuring colors like white, blue, red, and metallic finishes. Many of the cars are from the mid-20th century, featuring characteristic large tail fins and chrome details typical of automobiles from the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a yellow vehicle with a visible brand name \"Dodge\" on its side, indicating it's likely a commercial truck. The vehicles are closely piled on top of each other, showing various states of damage and deterioration, such as crushed bodies and shattered windows, suggesting they have been discarded after reaching the end of their useful life.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a partial view of a structural metal framework, presumably part of the scrapyard's infrastructure, possibly used for moving or stacking the cars. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene, further enhancing the somber and abandoned feel of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects themes of obsolescence, decay, and the cyclical nature of industrial materials. The dense stacking and variety of car models also evoke a sense of chaotic history, frozen in a pile of metal.","title":"Stacked autos are crushed and shipped to Japan, then return to the United States as Toyotas and Datsuns to begin the cycle once again.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["553005","545365","552739","555491","545340","545303","542656","545545","552738","552999","543166","547476","553006","546268","553004","542590"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["scrapyard","car","obsolescence","1950","vehicle","junkyard","fin","deterioration","finish","tail"]}
