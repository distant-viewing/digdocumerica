{"path":"552470.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a playground with four traditional metal-frame and plastic animal-shaped riders, seen through what appears to be a fence in the foreground. The riders include a red horse, a white horse, a grey pony, and a yellow horse. These playful structures are mounted on springs and positioned on a sand or fine gravel surface, intended for children to sit and rock on.\n\nThe setting is a sunny day, casting defined shadows of the animal riders and the fence onto the ground, enhancing the sense of a bright, clear environment. In the background, across a paved road, there is a large building labeled \"City of Lexington.\" This building has multiple garage-like doors and seems like a municipal or utility facility, painted in light beige with darker beige or brown trim.\n\nThere are no people visible in the scene, giving the playground a somewhat abandoned and still atmosphere, juxtaposed against the casual utility of the municipal building. The overall setting suggests a small-town environment, focused on community facilities and child-friendly recreational areas.","title":"Playground in Lexington","placename":"Bloomington (Ill.)","location":"Bloomington, Illinois","nn1":["547875","547192","549666","551720","555946","546562","545867","549674","551725","555928","547871","555901","556290","548488","555931","549653"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["rider","horse","playground","animal","utility","fence","child","facility","beige","garage"]}
