{"path":"551754.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a section of a city street highlighting two juxtaposed architectural facades. On the left is a building painted in a light color with white ornamental details around the windows, consisting of refined arches and keystones. This building features an air conditioning unit branded \"FEDDERS\" positioned above the ground floor window. The right side of the photo shows a darker, possibly brown or dark gray, older building with stone facade details including arched windows and decorative moldings around them.\n\nBoth buildings feature windows adorned with potted plants and green foliage, adding a touch of natural beauty to the urban setting. The windows on the dark-colored building have reflections and slightly dirty glass, suggesting it is well-used and perhaps residential. A lone black lamp post is visible on the left, contributing to an atmosphere suggestive of a quiet, possibly historical district within the city.\n\nThe photo is taken in natural daylight without direct sunlight, casting a soft even light across the scene which allows for the architectural details to be clearly visible. The overall scene gives a sense of calm urban life, possibly in a historic neighborhood focused on preserving its architectural heritage.","title":"Window boxes at 69th street between central park west and Columbus avenue in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551722","557643","545356","550107","550024","555902","556046","558030","553472","551778","551442","551629","543360","555912","556249","550122"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["window","facade","conditioning","detail","molding","building","heritage","city","preserve","brand"]}
