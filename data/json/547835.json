{"path":"547835.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a hauntingly striking image of a mostly submerged car in a body of water. The car appears severely damaged and abandoned; it is mostly intact but shows signs of significant wear and deterioration. The roof is partially caved in, and the windows are missing, suggesting the vehicle has been exposed to the elements for an extended period.\n\nThe vehicle is set against a water backdrop that reflects a clear sky, creating an expanse of blue around the dark silhouette of the car. In the distance, a low-lying landmass, possibly a cityscape or shoreline, is visible under a broad daylight setting, emphasizing a sharp contrast between the man-made ruin and the natural environment.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a sense of desolation and neglect, with the car serving as a stark focal point amidst the vastness of the water and sky. This scene might provoke thoughts on environmental issues, the longevity of man-made materials, and the stories behind deserted objects.","title":"Abandoned car in Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547911","547839","547605","547484","547481","546315","546318","547132","555849","555850","547601","547597","553007","546173","549107","548752"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","cave","ruin","provoke","deterioration","landmass","miss","desolation","thought","issue"]}
