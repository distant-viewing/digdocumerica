{"path":"554985.jpg","date":"January 1967","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a densely forested area, showcasing a variety of trees in a natural, somewhat wild state. The main focus is on a peculiarly shaped tree in the foreground, its branches thickly covered with a vibrant green moss. The limbs of this tree twist and stretch in unusual, almost contorted patterns, giving it a striking and somewhat eerie appearance.\n\nBehind this moss-covered tree, there's a backdrop of more trees, both evergreen and deciduous. Some of these trees are bare, likely indicating that the image was taken in either autumn or winter. These leafless trees have thin, intricate branches that create a delicate contrast against the darker, evergreen trees.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, which enhances the saturation of the green moss and lends a moist, possibly chilly atmosphere to the scene. The ground is not visible but it can be inferred that the undergrowth is likely dense with foliage, common in forested environments like this one.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of untouched wilderness, highlighting the textures and forms of the trees with a focus on the natural beauty and complexity of the forest ecology.","title":"Bigleaf maple along the soleduc river in the Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554961","555058","542958","545271","555000","554980","554958","554976","555057","555183","555125","543487","555054","555008","555043","554975"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","tree","twist","infer","limb","branch","undergrowth","forest","saturation","complexity"]}
