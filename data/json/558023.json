{"path":"558023.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint, historic-looking white church set against an autumnal backdrop. The church features a traditional architectural style with a triangular pediment supported by columns. At the center of the pediment is a decorative circular motif. The entryway consists of a single white door, framed by side windows and topped with an ornate rectangular window insert, welcoming visitors. Above this, the building transitions into a tower structure that caps off with a steeple, adding a vertical emphasis to the composition. The steeple itself is topped by a weathervane, characteristic of classic church designs.\n\nSurrounding the church, foliage in shades of gold and orange indicates it is fall. A carpet of fallen leaves blankets the ground, adding vibrant natural tones that contrast with the churchâ€™s stark white exterior. The sunlight filters through the trees creating a soft, diffused lighting that gives the scene a serene, slightly nostalgic quality.\n\nCompositionally, the church is centrally located within the frame suggesting a focal point of community and stability. The surrounding trees partially frame the church, and the pathway leading to it is also littered with leaves, suggesting less recent human activity. The photo encapsulates a peaceful, untouched quality, typical of a serene countryside church that might serve as a calm refuge or a historical landmark within its community.","title":"Bronson church, an episcopal parish church built in 1835 in the greek revival style in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
