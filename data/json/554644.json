{"path":"554644.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene dominated by a silhouetted mountainous landscape. There are three prominent mountain peaks visible. These mountains, with their gradually sloping contours, are set against a sky that transitions from a deep blue at the top to a vivid mixture of pink, yellow, and lighter blue hues closer to the horizon, suggesting either a sunrise or sunset.\n\nIn the sky, slightly to the left of the center, there is a crescent moon brightly visible. Beside it, to the right, are two bright celestial bodies—possibly planets or bright stars—adding to the tranquil and somewhat mystical ambiance of the scene. The sky's gradient and these celestial elements suggest that this photograph was taken during nautical twilight, a time when the sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon.\n\nThe entire scene is enveloped in a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, evoking a sense of solitude and the beauty of the natural world at a moment when day and night converge.","title":"Evening star shines over the Adirondack Forest Preserve from phelps mountain (4,100 feet) in the high peaks range","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["545347","543604","544870","555131","542681","554403","557560","545860","550646","552927","543577","543023","544359","554643","543590","554962"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["twilight","moon","degree","converge","star","mountain","sunrise","world","night","horizon"]}
