{"path":"544886.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of slender, leafless shrubs in a sandy environment. The central focus is on a cluster of thin, reddish-brown branches protruding from the ground, flanked by fewer, sparse branches around it. The shrubs cast delicate, intricate shadows on the smooth, light-colored sand beneath them, enhancing the visual texture of the scene.\n\nThe background appears softer and less defined, suggesting a larger sandy area with few other plant interruptions, creating a sense of desolation or minimalism. This environment may be a beach, desert, or sandy field, indicated by the broad expanse of sand and the clear light that bathes the scene, suggesting a bright day. The color scheme is primarily natural tones of brown and beige, emphasizing the tranquility and stark nature of the scene. Overall, it's a simple composition that focuses on the interplay of light, shadow, and natural forms.","title":"Great sand dunes national monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["548739","544879","545579","545855","552428","552433","546124","548672","543192","545843","550490","544019","544440","545879","544921","545724"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sand","interruption","shrub","branch","scheme","desolation","protrude","close","up","define"]}
