{"path":"548297.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing in front of a fish market named \"Carlos' Market.\" He appears to be an employee, as he is wearing a striped polo shirt underneath a white apron that covers his front from the chest to the knees. The man has dark hair and is gazing directly towards the camera with a neutral expression.\n\nAbove him, there is a large sign that features the name of the market in stylized lettering, announcing \"Carlos' Market\" followed by \"Fish\" in a slightly larger and bold font. Additional text on the sign advertises \"Fresh Daily Mano'o, Crabs and Shrimp,\" indicating the types of seafood sold at the market. The sign's background is white, which helps the bold, red and blue text stand out.\n\nThe background of the image also includes a glimpse of the market's outer wall, which appears to be constructed of white horizontal siding. A metallic garbage can is visible on the left side of the frame, partially cut off. The overall setting suggests a simple, no-frills market environment that focuses on fresh seafood. The light source and shadows suggest that the photograph was taken during the daytime.","title":"Market on river road (between New Orleans and Baton Rouge).
