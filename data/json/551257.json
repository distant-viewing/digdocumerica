{"path":"551257.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, an older man and a young woman are interacting onboard a boat moored near a lake. The man, wearing a light khaki outfit and a park ranger-style hat, is handing a metal object, perhaps a tool or part of the boat, to the young woman. She is dressed in a red and purple patterned bikini, standing on one leg as she reaches out to take the item from the man.\n\nThe setting includes a clear blue sky and calm waters. In the background, there is a dock with sheltered areas that house more boats, suggesting this could be a marina or a private docking area. The boat itself appears well-equipped, with various controls and steering instruments visible in front of where the man is kneeling.\n\nThe overall mood is cooperative and educational, perhaps indicative of a learning scenario or a maintenance activity being guided by the older man. The lush greenery across the water and the peaceful environment complement the serene, outdoor setting commonly associated with lakeside activities.","title":"Water patrol supervisor Dan Needham stops to refuel at Bikini Beach, a floating service station with a self-explanatory name.
