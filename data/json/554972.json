{"path":"554972.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense, lush forest scene. The ground is covered with a rich tapestry of green vegetation, including various types of small leafy plants and scattered ferns that emerge prominently from the forest floor. Several mature trees with thick trunks, displaying rough, moss-covered bark, dominate the midground of the image. These trees are tall, and their branches are not visible in the frame, suggesting their considerable height.\n\nThe forest appears old and relatively undisturbed, indicated by the natural chaos of the undergrowth and the moss that hangs from the branches, adding an almost ethereal quality to the scenery. There is a soft light filtering through the canopy, casting dappled shadows across the ground and highlighting sections of the forest floor with patches of light, enhancing the deep, natural greens of the foliage.\n\nThe photograph does not include any human or animal figures, focusing entirely on the tranquility and untouched beauty of this natural environment. The composition and lack of human presence evoke a sense of serene isolation and the timeless beauty intrinsic to a mature, temperate rainforest.","title":"Climax spruce forest with ground cover of Oregon oxalis bead ruby and western sword/fern in the queets valley of the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555000","545285","555043","555028","554957","554958","554975","555054","554970","555057","554425","554961","546947","554999","554992","545271"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","moss","rainforest","floor","branch","chaos","tapestry","fern","filtering","undergrowth"]}
