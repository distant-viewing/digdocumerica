{"path":"546779.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an underwater scene, characterized by a somber, slightly murky ambiance. The focal point is a dead fish, prominently displayed in the foreground with its silvery body partially reflective under the water's subtle illumination. Its eyes are clouded over, and its mouth is slightly agape. Surrounding the fish are dark, decomposing seaweeds or aquatic plants, spread out casually across the frame. The background and base of the image consist of small, multicolored pebbles ranging in hue from light beige to dark browns and soft reds, suggesting a natural aquatic environment, possibly a riverbed or a shallow lake section. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, conveying a sense of the tranquility and isolation typically found beneath the water's surface.","title":"Dead fish on the shore of Middle Branch, Baltimore Harbor near Port Covington","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550878","555560","546185","547704","547737","546782","552067","546846","548973","545161","555556","546138","548713","546784","547687","555543"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["fish","seaweed","riverbed","pebble","beige","illumination","mouth","base","red","brown"]}
