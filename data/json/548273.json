{"path":"548273.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a moment inside a subway car, likely taken during the 1970s or early 1980s, given the style and context. The image prominently features a man seated alone on a bench inside the subway. The man is dressed in a light brown, textured blazer over a multi-colored, patterned shirt, and he wears round glasses. His expression appears contemplative or possibly fatigued, and his long hair falls around his shoulders.\n\nThe subway car itself is marked with widespread graffiti â€” a common sight in New York City's public transportation during this era. The graffiti includes various forms of tag signatures and some larger pieces that span across the panels above the windows. Prominent among them are words in both black and red spray paint. There's visible tagging like \"Period Smith,\" \"William Dever,\" and other less discernible names.\n\nAdditionally, a sign that reads \"BROADWAY LOCAL\" indicates the route of the subway line. The windows of the car show reflections of the interior, making it slightly difficult to see outside.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the lone individual amid the chaos of graffiti and the confined space of a city subway, evokes a sense of urban solitude and perhaps reflects the social environment of the time. The lighting is somewhat muted, with natural light filtering through the subway car's windows, contributing to the introspective mood captured in the scene.","title":"Vandals have spray-painted this subway car.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553823","554325","556811","556813","548261","548260","556780","548255","548258","556814","556691","556652","548256","556669","556653","556665"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["subway","graffiti","car","window","tag","chaos","blazer","sight","filtering","show"]}
