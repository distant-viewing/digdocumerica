{"path":"556123.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban railway station area. The primary focus is the Union Station, an architectural masterpiece, featuring a large, ornately designed domed structure as part of its facade. The station's name \"UNION STATION\" is prominently displayed in bold lettering.\n\nSeveral trains are visible, parked along the multiple tracks extending from the station, indicative of a busy transit hub. The trains appear to be vintage, with rounded, metallic blue carriages.\n\nIn the forefront, there are vehicular activities including numerous cars from what looks like the 1950s or 1960s, based on their designs. The cars are parked and in motion on a road that runs parallel to the train tracks.\n\nThe background features other urban elements including towering buildings and large billboards, one notably advertising \"SCHENFELD'S for FURNITURE\". The skyline offers a mix of mid-twentieth century architectural styles with commercial buildings. \n\nThe overall atmosphere captured in the image is one of dynamic urban movement, showcasing a blend of transportation and architectural elements from a past era.","title":"The Coast Starlight passenger train at the Tacoma, Washington, depot.
