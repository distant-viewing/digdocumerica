{"path":"550178.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a city landscape viewed from a higher vantage point through a haze, likely indicating either early morning fog or smog. In the foreground, the scene includes a road bending around a lush area dotted with green trees. The road is marked with a yellow right-turn arrow sign, suggesting a curve ahead, and several cars are visible traveling on the road. Various vehicles, including a red car and a dark-colored car, add a touch of color and movement to the scene.\n\nThe midground is a mix of green spaces and scattered trees, contrasting with the urban environment. A distinct feature in the middle distance is a bridge, hinting at the city's infrastructure for navigating waterways or ravines.\n\nIn the background, the city skyline emerges through a misty haze, with several high-rise buildings making up the city's core. Notably, a tall, slender tower stands prominently, possibly a landmark structure within the city. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is slightly muted due to the haze, providing a sense of depth and distance. The natural elements in the foreground juxtaposed with the urban skyline create a dynamic interplay between nature and urban development.","title":"On july 20, 1973--day of a pollution alert--Cleveland skyline is barely visible from west shoreway","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545467","553021","550190","546707","545451","549846","548365","548414","548317","553846","556193","549620","553020","552394","545432","551141"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","haze","road","core","car","navigating","arrow","smog","trees","landmark"]}
