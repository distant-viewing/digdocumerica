{"path":"551368.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a single violet-blue flower that appears delicate and slightly translucent against a soft-focus background. The flower, likely a wild species, has one visible bloom with five rounded petals, creating an almost symmetrical form. At the center, yellow anthers are prominently visible atop slender filaments, clustered tightly and contrasting with the petals. Surrounding the flower, the background is a blur of deep greens and hints of violet, suggesting a shaded or dim environment typical of a natural woodland or a moist area, contributing a serene and intimate feel to the image. A single green stem attached to the flower bends elegantly, implying grace and organic movement. Subtle lighting enhances the texture and color of the petals, emphasizing their delicate beauty amidst the enveloping greenery.","title":"Spiderwort (Tradescantia) blooms in Lake of the Ozarks State Park at Osage Beach","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["555034","555035","550462","545706","550464","555033","554574","547613","549230","553368","544444","554586","543623","555189","557167","554576"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["petal","flower","violet","grace","stem","blur","woodland","bloom","specie","form"]}
