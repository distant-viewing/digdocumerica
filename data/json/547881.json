{"path":"547881.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph shows a textured, white brick wall upon which several items and paintings are displayed. Dominating the image are two colorful murals painted directly on the bricks. On the left, the mural depicts a green boat on water with several figures, all underneath a massive leaf, accompanied by the text \"Going to Stella Maris for Bait.\" On the right, a second mural represents a seascape scene at sunset with a silhouetted sailboat, accompanied by the words \"Stella Maris Fresh Fish Daily.\"\n\nTo the left, a large analog scale with a round, white dial hanging from the wall sits near its maximum capacity marker. Below and next to it are various metallic and stained containers, including what seems to be a rusty cylindrical drum and other round bowls or lids, possibly used in a fish market or bait shop, reflective of the murals' nautical theme.\n\nThe inclusion of the scale and containers in the setting, along with the thematic murals, suggests that this photograph might be taken at a fish market or a related business, aimed at depicting a local charm and nautical culture through art and functional objects. The overall ambiance is rustic and evocative of a maritime community.","title":"Fish store in Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545274","543413","552513","542914","558256","543210","557567","547856","542812","558281","545951","554093","546943","545221","550306","557657"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["mural","market","fish","container","bait","brick","lid","capacity","bowl","painting"]}
