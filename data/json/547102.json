{"path":"547102.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet industrious scene at dusk, featuring a waterfront with industrial equipment silhouetted against a dramatically colored sky. The sky is painted in hues of deep blues, purples, and pinks, reflecting the setting sun, which adds a vibrant backdrop to the industrial setting.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm water mirrors some of the sky's colors and the outlines of the structures. Prominently visible are two large cranes, one in the middle and one on the right, which are particularly accentuated against the sky. These cranes, along with smokestacks releasing plumes of dark smoke, suggest an area involved in heavy industry, possibly a construction site or a shipping dock.\n\nOn the left side of the image, more industrial elements such as chimneys and additional equipment contribute to the sense that this is a working waterfront area, perhaps involved in manufacturing or processing. These elements are somewhat obscured by the dim light but are still identifiable by their distinct industrial shapes.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural beauty of the sunset with the man-made industrial environment, creating a striking and somewhat contemplative scene. The photograph conveys themes of industry and nature coexisting, with the day's end providing a moment of visual peace amidst the continuing activity of the industrial site.","title":"Dredge barge at work inside breakwater of consumer power plant at Ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["546114","545430","545646","551956","548851","543003","551140","544684","558140","552164","547084","545438","550819","545030","552717","552156"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["waterfront","crane","industry","site","release","involve","peace","shipping","coexist","equipment"]}
