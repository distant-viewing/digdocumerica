{"path":"548157.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a tall, cone-shaped structure emitting a dense, voluminous plume of smoke or steam into the sky. The foreground is dominated by the dark silhouette of this structure, underexposed due to lighting conditions, which makes its details hard to discern. The structure appears to be industrial, possibly part of a factory or a plant, and there are some mechanical elements and frameworks visible around it.\n\nThe background shows a daylight scene with a predominantly clear blue sky filled with scattered clouds. The enormous plume of smoke or steam is the most visually striking element, rising dramatically into the sky, and appears tinged with shades of white, gray, and slight brown, indicating the possible intensity of the emissions.\n\nVisible in the far background behind the structure are gentle rolling hills and a slightly mountainous terrain, suggesting that the industrial site is likely located in a rural or semi-rural area. The overall composition of the image, contrasting the natural beauty of the sky and landscape with industrial activity, evokes themes of environmental impact and industrialization.","title":"Wigwam burner at the Louisiana Pacific lumber plant at Post Falls, Idaho","placename":"Coeur d'Alene (Idaho)","location":"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","nn1":["546237","550938","544704","550939","551026","545990","546760","551056","550871","544958","551052","544966","542997","550983","545994","557302"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plume","steam","smoke","cone","industrialization","intensity","structure","emission","framework","factory"]}
