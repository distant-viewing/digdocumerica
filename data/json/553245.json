{"path":"553245.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a toddler playing with water from a fountain. The child, a young boy with light-colored hair, appears to be around two or three years old. He is shirtless, wearing only a light-colored diaper or shorts. The boy is sitting on a wet surface, likely made of stone, and is positioned close to a black polished granite fountain from which water is flowing down onto his head and body. His expression seems curious and slightly cautious as he reaches out his right hand towards the stream of water, touching it gently. His left hand is placed on the stone, possibly for support or balance.\n\nThe background is somewhat blurred due to the focus on the foreground, but hints of greenery suggest the setting might be outdoors in a park or a similar public space. The lighting in the photograph is natural, suggesting it was taken during the daytime. The overall mood conveys a sense of playful innocence and the simple joys of childhood. The water droplets are captured in motion, adding a dynamic element to the scene.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
