{"path":"545545.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of crushed and compressed scrapped cars in various states of decay and dismantlement. The cars, which primarily appear to be models from the mid-20th century, exhibit a variety of colors, mostly faded, including blues, whites, reds, and rust. They are haphazardly stacked upon each other, creating a mountain of metal debris.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, striking structure that resembles a gasometer or water tower. This structure has a circular form with a visible geometric framework made of metal girders, which supports a dark, possibly metallic framework cylinder, likely for storage purposes. The sky behind the scene is clear and brightly blue, enhancing the contrast between the natural and the industrial elements in the image.\n\nThe scene captures a poignant juxtaposition between technological advancement, represented by the large industrial structure, and the obsolescence and decay symbolized by the heap of discarded automobiles. The composition and the elements within the frame evoke themes of industrial decline, environmental concerns, and the impermanence of modern conveniences.","title":"AutoMobile graveyard","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["546172","554352","554320","545303","554348","552738","555492","553005","542656","553006","551517","551547","552739","542660","552765","545365"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["framework","advancement","obsolescence","compress","decay","convenience","girder","cylinder","decline","crush"]}
