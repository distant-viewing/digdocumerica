{"path":"558309.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Bisping, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a scene with two men and a fire truck in an outdoor, rural setting. In the foreground, a man is depicted prominently; he is wearing a fireman's uniform including a dark blue jacket labeled with a patch and dark pants, adorned with reflective stripes. His attire is completed with a white helmet bearing a crest and black rubber boots. He is walking towards the camera with a slight smile, holding a pair of gloves in his left hand.\n\nIn the background, another individual is seen partially; this person wears a white shirt and is facing away from the camera, engaged in an activity at the rear of the fire truck. The fire truck itself is red, equipped with compartments, hoses, and emergency lights. It appears to be parked off-road, amidst dry, ploughed ground.\n\nThe setting is a wooded area in what seems to be late autumn, as suggested by the bare trees on the hills that rise in the background. The sky is clear, and the natural light indicates it might be midday or early afternoon. The overall feel is of a calm yet professional emergency services operation in a rural setting.","title":"Wallace \"whitey\" wolf is a lieutenant in the volunteer fire department.
