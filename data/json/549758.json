{"path":"549758.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of numerous seagulls flying over a large pile of garbage. The seagulls dominate the foreground, captured in various stages of flight, creating a bustling and somewhat chaotic visual impression. The garbage heap, which spans across the lower section of the photo, consists of assorted debris and discarded items, hinting at the communal or industrial scale of waste.\n\nThe background features a blurred city skyline with several buildings under a smoggy or hazy sky, suggesting environmental pollution or possibly just early morning or late afternoon light. No humans are visible in the scene, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention entirely on the interaction between the natural (the birds) and the human-created (the garbage and cityscape) environments. \n\nThe photo seems to convey a stark contrast between the natural world and human impact, highlighted by the presence of wildlife amidst pollution and waste. The overall tone might evoke themes of environmental concern and the coexistence of urban development with nature.","title":"Piled-up garbage at Hackensack Meadows landfill attracts thousands of scavenging seagulls.
