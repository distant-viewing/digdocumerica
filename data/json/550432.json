{"path":"550432.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a single red fox sitting squarely in the middle of what appears to be a gravel road. The fox is looking directly at the camera, displaying its prominent features such as its sharp, alert eyes and pointed ears. It has a lush, reddish-brown fur coat with a mix of gray around the neck and a white underbelly, culminating in a full, bushy tail that curves around slightly towards its body.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred, primarily consisting of the gray, rough texture of the road. There are no discernible structures or other animals in the immediate vicinity, which helps to emphasize the solitude and focused presence of the fox in this setting. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of quiet and watchful calm, with the fox positioned as the clear subject amidst a simple, uncluttered environment.","title":"Young female fox near Galbraith Lake camp","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550430","550431","542630","542629","550436","550468","554621","551376","544916","543279","545564","550803","550802","542778","555668","550386"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["ear","tail","fur","neck","gravel","vicinity","calm","road","gray","coat"]}
