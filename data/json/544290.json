{"path":"544290.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring a patchy brown and white horse standing in a field of tall, lush green grass. Nearby, there is a light blue, slightly weathered rowboat resting on its side on the ground. The boat appears old with some visible wear and tear, suggesting it has been exposed to elements for some time. The background is dominated by tall reeds or grasses, enhancing the natural, secluded feel of the setting. The overall lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and contributing to the calm, quiet mood of the image. The composition balances the natural elements with the man-made object, inviting contemplation of the interplay between nature and human activity.","title":"Pony tied to boat","placename":"Delacroix Island (La.)","location":"Delacroix Island, Louisiana","nn1":["547750","547761","553069","543726","551229","554161","557186","550780","550779","547017","542972","551327","553066","556957","542956","552501"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["tear","rowboat","reed","grass","horse","contemplation","interplay","wear","boat","object"]}
