{"path":"552025.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an industrial landscape dominated by a large number of storage tanks, primarily concentrated on the left half of the image. These cylindrical tanks vary in size and are positioned in clusters, surrounded by paved areas and some structural facilities. The center and foreground of the image feature a meandering river or estuary with multiple bends, flowing through a landscape that appears partly marshy and partly industrial.\n\nThe riverbanks are irregular, displaying patches of what looks like vegetation or mudflats, and there are several narrow inlets or channels branching off the main river. The colors in these water bodies range from dark blues to muddy browns, suggesting varying depth or sediment content.\n\nOn the right side of the image, adjacent to the river, there are additional industrial facilities. These include more storage tanks, possibly silos, and industrial buildings with flat roofs. The background shows a more densely industrial zone with similar structures, possibly indicating a large industrial complex or plant.\n\nThe overall scenery is devoid of visible human activity or natural habitation, emphasizing an industrial use environment. The sky above appears cloudy, casting soft lighting over the scene and enhancing the industrial gray and metallic tones of the tanks and buildings.","title":"Rahway River in Linden area, flowing into the Arthur Kill.
