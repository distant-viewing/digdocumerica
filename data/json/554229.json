{"path":"554229.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures an urban winter scene bustling with activity. Set in a downtown street framed by snow heaps on either side, the image predominantly features three individuals and their dogs.\n\nOne individual in the foreground, donned in a brown jacket and jeans, is leading a dog on a leash; this dog resembles a large breed with thick fur, possibly an Irish Wolfhound. Across the sidewalk, nearly at the center of the frame, another person dressed in a patterned winter jacket, also walking an equally large and shaggy dog, seems to be in the middle of interacting either with their pet or observing something out of frame. Farther back, another person walks away from the camera, sporting a dark brown or black winter coat.\n\nThe photo's background reveals a typical city street during wintertime, lined with commercial buildings displaying signs, storefronts, and a couple of visible balconies. Vehicles and a few other pedestrians can also be seen moving along or standing by, contributing to the bustling, midday vibe. Accumulated snow alongside the street, cleared to make way for pedestrian and vehicle movement, underscores the cold weather setting.\n\nOverall, this scene communicates a lively community atmosphere with people going about their daily lives, even amidst a snowy, urban setting.","title":"Walking dogs on the Aspen mall","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554275","554279","549863","549986","554258","554214","554230","554263","551856","557181","553822","551819","554291","557272","552754","556226"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["dog","winter","pedestrian","street","snow","leash","pet","breed","don","accumulate"]}
