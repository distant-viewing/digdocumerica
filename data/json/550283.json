{"path":"550283.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid outdoor scene featuring two boys engaged in play on a dilapidated car. The car, a once polished sedan, now appears weathered and is situated on an untended field with overgrown weeds and bushes. The vehicle's color is blue, and the roof has sustained significant damage, with parts of its metal frame exposed.\n\nOne boy is seated on the trunk of the car, dressed casually in a light-colored t-shirt and darker shorts. He is looking towards the ground, perhaps inspecting something or deep in thought. The other boy, wearing an orange t-shirt and dark shorts, is in a dynamic pose on the car's roof, mid-jump, as if he's balancing or leaping from one part of the car to another.\n\nIn the background, a stark contrast to the foreground's playful and somewhat chaotic aura, an industrial landscape with multiple smoking stacks and large buildings spans the horizon, suggesting the area might be on the outskirts of an industrial town or city. The factories and the smoke emitted contribute to a sense of grit and ruggedness in the environment.\n\nAdditionally, to the left background, there's a low brick wall and a sign partially visible with graffiti on it, adding an urban feel to the setting. Overhead, the sky is clear and blue, providing a bright atmosphere to an otherwise grimy and abandoned setting. The overall composition of the image portrays a narrative of carefree youth set against the backdrop of industrial decay.","title":"Vacant lot and abandoned car equal play area and playthings","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549272","551031","550249","556166","551003","545404","544402","544794","553489","557987","543947","555950","547883","545319","545953","545246"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","car","short","smoking","jump","aura","weed","youth","dark","graffiti"]}
