{"path":"543896.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat worn and aged red and white truck, loaded with a mix of what appears to be wooden frames or perhaps parts of discarded furniture. The truck is parked on a rough, muddy terrain, facing a large dug-out area filled with various discarded materials. There are copious amounts of broken and unused items such as cardboard boxes and electronic parts strewn around the truck and in the aggregate pile.\n\nIn the background, there's a large excavating machine, possibly a bulldozer or a backhoe, operating in the dug-out area, moving or managing the piles of waste material. The operator is visible under an umbrella, suggesting an effort to protect from the sun or rain.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is characterized by mounds of earth and small vegetation, indicating that this area might be on the outskirts of a developed region or in a designated dumping or construction area. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a somewhat gloomy appearance, enhancing the discarded and derelict nature of the location.","title":"Solid waste is dumped into trenches at this sanitary landfill","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["553041","550270","547208","547922","549743","542549","548348","550266","547975","549795","542538","549936","547093","543828","549949","549940"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dug","truck","derelict","pile","dumping","operator","discarded","designate","strew","broken"]}
