{"path":"543269.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene set against a majestic backdrop of a snowy mountain range. In the foreground, a large flock of sheep is grazing on a patch of green land. The sheep are closely grouped together, predominantly white in color, which contrasts with the rugged, earthy tones of the surrounding landscape.\n\nBehind the sheep, the terrain rises into a gentle slope covered with shrubs and scattered rocks, transitioning into steep mountain slopes. The mountains dominate the background, with their peaks covered in snow, indicating a late spring or even summer setting, as lower elevations appear free of snow. These mountains are large and imposing, with snow highlighting their contours and crevices, creating a dramatic and natural contrast with the clearer, unfrosted valleys below.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes the vastness and untamed beauty of the natural landscape, with human presence (represented by the flock of sheep) appearing small and integrated within the larger scale of nature. The sky, visible at the top of the image, is a clear blue, suggesting a bright, clear day, which enhances the visibility of the mountainous details and adds to the vividness of the scene.","title":"Grazing flock","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544933","555820","554928","552555","552556","554779","550452","552557","557747","550453","553073","550450","543720","543654","544384","550411"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sheep","flock","snow","mountain","slope","peanks","crevice","graze","integrate","transitione"]}
