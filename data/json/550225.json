{"path":"550225.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial area dominated by the features of a large steel mill and its associated infrastructure. The composition is centered around a canal or river, which is intersected by a bridge. This canal serves both as a waterway and a means of segregating different parts of the facility.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a pile of material, possibly raw resources like coal or iron ore, located on the banks of the water channel. It appears to be an open storage or staging area for these resources. The right bank showcases a variety of industrial buildings, tall smokestacks, and extensive piping, all indicative of heavy manufacturing and processing activities typical of a steel mill. Smoke or steam can be seen emanating from several stacks, suggesting ongoing operations.\n\nThe foreground features complex networks of pipelines and industrial equipment, which are likely involved in the transportation and processing of materials. Overhead conveyors or girders cross the image diagonally, demonstrating the integration of heavy machinery and infrastructure designed to support constant and intensive industrial work.\n\nThe overall color palette is composed of industrial tones—muted grays, metallic blues, and rusty reds—and reflects the industrial nature of the scene. The lighting suggests it is midday, as the sun brightly illuminates the area and creates stark shadows that contrast with the metal structures.\n\nThere is no visible human activity in this photograph, which might imply automation or simply an angle that does not capture the workers in the facility. The image captures the scale and complexity of modern industrial operations, specifically those associated with heavy industry and steel production.","title":"Cuyahoga River waterfront","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547069","553891","549966","557227","557223","557216","546769","549511","549510","547060","547101","549494","557222","549508","550961","545992"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["steel","mill","canal","resource","processing","bank","girder","ore","pipeline","integration"]}
