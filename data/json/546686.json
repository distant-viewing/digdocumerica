{"path":"546686.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a busy multi-lane highway, filled with numerous vehicles in both directions, signaling a typical scene in a metropolitan area during peak traffic hours. The highway lanes are distinctly marked and the vehicles include a mix of sedans, trucks, and vans, predominantly from what appears to be the late 20th century, given the styles and models of the vehicles.\n\nOn one side of the highway, there's a waterfront, indicating that the road runs adjacent to a river or a large body of water. A barrier separates the water from the road for safety. Along the opposite side, the landscape includes lush greenery topping what appears to be a steep roadside slope, and beyond the immediate highway area, there are buildings that suggest a nearby residential or commercial district.\n\nThe upper side of the image also shows another level of roadway integrated with the highway system, featuring additional vehicle activity and hinting at a complex infrastructure, possibly an overpass or a bridge connection.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its high viewpoint and detailed capture of everyday urban life, emphasizes the bustling nature of city transportation and the built environment's interaction with natural elements like the nearby water.","title":"Key bridge, looking north from Virginia to the district","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547780","546681","546734","546713","546709","552712","546608","548391","546726","555781","556194","547770","552719","546612","546707","547785"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","vehicle","overpass","integrate","trucks","van","district","signal","waterfront","roadside"]}
