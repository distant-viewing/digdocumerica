{"path":"545373.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a contemplative moment and showcases a profile view of a woman seated indoors. The setting appears to be dimly lit and the overall atmosphere is somber and introspective. The woman, prominently featured on the right side of the frame, has a striking appearance characterized by her full, rounded afro hairstyle. Her features are finely illuminated, highlighting her expression which appears introspective and poised.\n\nShe is wearing a patterned blouse or dress and a pair of earrings, adding subtle detail to her silhouette against the darker, blurred background. In the background, there are other individuals who appear to be engaged in their own activities, though their forms are not clearly discernible due to the shallow depth of field and low lighting, lending a sense of isolation to the woman in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting in the scene is key to its mood, focusing mainly on the woman’s profile and catching highlights on her skin and the contours of her hairstyle while leaving much of the surrounding details in shadow. This choice in lighting enhances the contemplative and serene quality of the image, directing the viewer’s focus entirely on her.","title":"Services at Sixth Avenue Baptist Church","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["558319","544437","554345","556414","553499","553534","546479","556143","553223","556516","556151","556412","553532","546558","546564","556318"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["hairstyle","woman","earring","poise","choice","skin","profile","detail","lighting","contour"]}
