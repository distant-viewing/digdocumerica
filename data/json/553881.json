{"path":"553881.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of an agricultural field, capturing an interesting geometric pattern of parallel lines across the terrain. There are two tractors in the field, each equipped with large sprayers, actively dispensing mist or chemicals onto the crops which creates trails of white smoke behind them. The lines in the field are likely created by the planting arrangement of the crops and contribute to the visual impact of the image, emphasizing depth and perspective.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the textures and lines of the field, creating an interplay of light and shadow that enhances the linear geometry. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a sense of scale and the intensity of agriculture activities, showcasing how machinery and human endeavors transform and dominate natural landscapes. The hues and tones suggest this photo might have been taken during late afternoon, where the shadows are elongated and the sunlight warm.","title":"Spraying fertilizer. (From the sites exhibition.
