{"path":"546478.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene centered around a young person sitting in a shaded nook formed by the intersection of two brick walls. The person, partially obscured by shadows, is engrossed in reading a book, sitting cross-legged with one foot resting on the wall, enhancing their casual, comfortable posture. They are dressed in a long sleeve top and jeans, with a pair of bright yellow sneakers that stands out as a vivid contrast to the mostly reddish-brown and muted tones of the scene. Their curly hair cascades over their shoulders and down their back.\n\nThe walls surrounding the individual have a rich texture characterized by a uniform grid of bricks, showing variations in color from deep reds to browns with slight weathering that adds to the rustic feel. The sunlight casts soft, dappled shadows upon the brickwork, presumably through a canopy not visible in the frame, which adds a dynamic and somewhat mottled pattern on the surfaces and the ground.\n\nCompositionally, the image is carefully framed to capture the deep shadows of the architectural nook, providing a sense of isolation and intimate space amidst the expansive brickwork. There's a mystical quality achieved through the balance of light and shadow, emphasizing the personâ€™s immersion in their activity, disconnected from the outside world. The photograph conveys a serene ambiance, inviting a contemplative mood reflecting solitude and the joy of reading.","title":"Cleo rogers memorial library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546474","553535","546500","546564","546554","546560","546470","545510","546566","546561","552723","545525","553222","555428","546555","543835"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["brickwork","shadow","mottle","person","dappled","immersion","sneaker","cascade","sit","wall"]}
