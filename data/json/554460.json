{"path":"554460.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a person sitting on a rocky terrain, possibly atop a mountain or large rock. This individual is dressed in outdoor attire, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, dark pants, and hiking boots. They have a blue bandana on their head and are resting with one arm on a nearby rock, gazing off to the side, seemingly in contemplation or admiration of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe setting is characterized by rugged natural beauty with exposed large rocky surfaces, sparse vegetation, and a few smaller rocks scattered around the foreground. Notably, there is a large rock with vertical cracks and patches of lichen or moss, which carries a plaque, hinting that the location might hold historical or commemorative significance.\n\nThe background offers a breathtaking view of a mountain range, with several peaks layered under a hazy or misty sky, suggesting either early morning or evening lighting conditions. The atmosphere appears serene and somewhat mystical due to the soft, diffused lighting and the purple-blue tint of the sky.\n\nThis setting suggests a remote, tranquil location ideal for reflective solitude or appreciation of nature’s grandeur. The composition uses the person’s relaxed posture and distant gaze to draw attention to the vastness and beauty of the natural environment around them.","title":"Plaque at top of Mount Marcy, New York, describes early exploration and history of the area, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545753","543503","554500","554514","545780","545300","545767","554507","544902","557146","544341","557118","543378","545762","545571","545755"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["rock","admiration","plaque","bandana","lichen","appreciation","crack","tint","mountain","hiking"]}
