{"path":"545466.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a red semi-truck in motion, depicted with a notable motion blur effect that conveys a sense of speed and motion. The truck is the central and sole focus of the image. It features a traditional box-shaped cab with a slightly streamlined design, painted in a vivid red hue with visible striping and decorative decals, adding character to its appearance.\n\nThe truck is equipped with large side mirrors and a visible exhaust pipe, extending vertically above the cab. The tractor part of the truck is visible without a trailer attached, showing the frame, wheels, and undercarriage components including the drivetrain and axle.\n\nThe background is a blurred streak of neutral colors, suggesting a motion-blurred landscape, typical of what one might see when driving at high speeds. This blurry backdrop accentuates the rapid movement of the truck. The road itself is not distinctly detailed, but there is a faded white line indicating the edge of the traffic lane, enhancing the feeling of highway speed.\n\nOverall, the photograph employs dynamic blurring techniques to emphasize the speed and kinetic energy of the semi-truck on the road, giving a compelling representation of motion in still photography.","title":"Alabama--Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["554360","542953","545930","549902","548264","556429","542803","556986","555875","547666","555505","543173","545367","542606","557385","554832"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["speed","motion","truck","cab","decal","undercarriage","employ","exhaust","technique","tractor"]}
