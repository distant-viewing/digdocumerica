{"path":"550280.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat industrial and polluted beach scene. On the left side, there is a chain-link fence with a warning sign reading, \"WARNING - POLLUTED WATER - MAY CAUSE ILLNESS - KEEP OUT\". The sign emphasizes the unsanitary conditions of the area.\n\nThe foreground prominently displays several industrial containers, one labeled \"CHLOR\", indicating it contains chlorine. The containers are positioned on a patch of bare ground, which forms the immediate setting.\n\nIn the middle ground, the beach stretches across, littered with debris and scattered objects that resemble driftwood and refuse. The ground is muddy and imprinted with tire tracks, suggesting recent vehicle movement.\n\nIn the background, at the beach's edge, a single figure, possibly engaged in cleaning or similar activity, adds a human element to the scene. Further in the distance, a serene water body contrasts with the industrial setting, and the shoreline curves gently into the background. Another structure or industrial facility is faintly visible in the far distance, partially shrouded by haze or mist, which adds an air of isolation to the scene.\n\nAbove, the sky is filled with cumulus clouds, suggesting fair weather, which contrasts with the pollution and degradation seen at ground level. The overall composition of the photo juxtaposes natural beauty and environmental neglect, providing a striking commentary on human impact on nature.","title":"White city beach sign warns against swimming in polluted lake erie.
