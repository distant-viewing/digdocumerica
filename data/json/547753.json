{"path":"547753.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a lamentable scene of water pollution, contrasting natural beauty with environmental neglect. Several white ducks, apparently unbothered, are seen swimming amongst a large collection of floating debris and litter in a body of water. The surrounding water is dark, reflecting the shadows of nearby trees, highlighting the floating pieces of trash that include plastic bottles, paper containers, and other unidentifiable pieces of refuse.\n\nThe backdrop features a dense treeline along the far bank under a bright, clear sky, suggesting a secluded or rural setting. This juxtaposition of the serene natural environment with the invasive pollution creates a poignant statement about human impact on nature.\n\nForeground details are sharply focused particularly on the debris and the closest ducks, lending a clarity that emphasizes the plight of the environment captured in the shot. The overall composition and content of the photograph effectively convey a message about environmental awareness and responsibility.","title":"Ducks swim amid litter on shores of White Rock Lake.
