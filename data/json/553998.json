{"path":"553998.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a woman standing in front of a pineapple field. The woman is positioned off-center to the left of the image, dressed in a red button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to her elbows. She has short, dark, wavy hair and her arms are crossed in front of her. She is smirking slightly as she looks towards the camera.\n\nTo her right, there is a wooden stake in the ground with the number \"5303\" on it, possibly marking a specific area or plot within the field. The pineapple plants are lush and extend deep into the background, filling the midground of the photo with their thick, spiky leaves. \n\nThe background under a slightly overcast sky shows more of the pineapple field extending towards the horizon, giving a sense of vast agricultural space. The color palette of the image is primarily natural greens from the plants, accented by the red shirt of the woman, which stands out vividly against the more muted tones.","title":"Elizabeth Rains, Lanai resident, is suing the State Land Use Commission and Lanai Company (which is planning urban development of island) for illegally reclassifying thousands of acres of land for urban use. Her suit also asks that developers be prohibited from building on beaches, particularly at Manele Bay pineapple fields in background.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["554012","553697","553813","558245","543319","554049","557520","543480","544192","554106","544747","546383","558244","547281","554078","557478"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["field","woman","stake","elbow","front","plot","plant","button","midground","shirt"]}
