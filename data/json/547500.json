{"path":"547500.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a wide expanse of a lush wetland. In the foreground, the image is dominated by dense marsh grass that appears swayed or bent, suggesting the presence of wind or a recent disturbance. The grass features a variety of colors, from deep greens to light browns, indicating possibly different species or varying stages of growth and decay.\n\nMidway through the image, the landscape opens up to reveal a broader vista. Here, the marshland extends into a flat field, spotted with similar marsh vegetation but in a more muted brown color, possibly due to different lighting or seasonal changes. This part of the landscape forms a contrasting band between the rich greens of the foreground and the lighter sky visible on the horizon.\n\nThe background features a calm sky with subtle gradations of light, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light, enhancing the serene and natural feel of the scene. No animals or human figures are discernible, focusing all attention on the natural terrain and its quietly dramatic appearance. The overall composition emphasizes the openness and quiet beauty of the wetland habitat, inviting contemplation on the tranquility and complexity of such ecosystems.","title":"Salt marsh in tiverton","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547544","547924","547532","547589","553856","545033","547488","544530","547604","547547","557498","544515","544773","542525","550783","553085"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","marshland","broader","gradation","green","marsh","vista","band","openness","disturbance"]}
