{"path":"553471.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph shows an outdoor scene where three men are engaged in activities around an old brick building, likely involving maintenance or renovation work. The building is constructed of red bricks and features large bay windows with wooden frames, partially boarded up.\n\nOne man is standing on a ladder that leans against the building, working directly on the window frame or possibly the building's facade. He wears a painter's outfit with a cap, suggesting he might be painting or cleaning. On the ground, another man, also in lighter clothing, stands watching or assisting, close to a grassy area hinting at an urban setting with some greenery. A third individual is partially visible; we see him from behind, near the ladder.\n\nThe background of the photo includes the clear blue sky and parts of adjacent buildings with similar architectural style, indicating this scene is set in an older residential or mixed-use neighborhood. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day. The attention in composition is focused on the interaction between the men and the building, emphasizing the work being done.","title":"Mulky Square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
