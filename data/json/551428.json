{"path":"551428.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a roadway lined with a series of recreational vehicles (RVs), which are parked in an orderly fashion along one side of the road. Each RV appears to be attached to a truck or a car. The scene suggests a gathering or possibly a temporary RV park setup.\n\nThere are vehicles visible, including trucks and cars, suggesting that the owners might be living or travelling in these RVs. Some individuals can be seen standing near or moving around the RVs, indicating social or operational activities, perhaps involving setting up or maintaining the campsite.\n\nThe background is relatively bare with some leafless trees, indicating it might be late autumn or winter. The overall atmosphere is somewhat muted, with a gray sky and a lack of vibrant colors, lending a quiet, perhaps chilly air to the setting.\n\nThis photo likely depicts a moment of travel or a temporary stay, possibly associated with a larger event that draws RV travelers to congregate like this. The presence of many people and vehicles in a coordinated setup suggests organization and a sense of community among the participants.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
