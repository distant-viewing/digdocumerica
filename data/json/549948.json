{"path":"549948.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph depicts a man inspecting or possibly repairing a part of a large truck, specifically a dump truck. He is dressed in a blue t-shirt and black pants, with his hands and one knee visibly dirty, suggesting he has been working. The man is bending over and using both hands to manipulate or examine the hydraulic machinery that appears to be connected to the dump bed of the truck.\n\nThe dump truck is large and predominantly white, equipped with heavy-duty, deeply treaded tires and a reinforced dump bed. A large hydraulic arm, partly rusted and covered in dirt, is central in the image, attaching the truck's cabin to the dump bed, which is lifted slightly, indicating either maintenance is being carried out or that it's stuck in some manner.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, probably within a construction or industrial area, considering the ground is uneven and covered with loose soil and small debris typical of such environments. The lighting suggests the photograph was taken during daylight, providing a clear view of the detailed texture of the truck and its components, as well as the surrounding ground. The angle of the shot is from the side, slightly looking upward, focusing on the interaction of the man with the machinery.","title":"Working at the croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["547922","555636","549652","550270","549770","549956","547232","550266","544098","542538","544161","557914","544083","555907","549202","555866"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["dump","truck","bed","tread","machinery","manipulate","consider","knee","repair","stick"]}
