{"path":"543605.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, mountainous landscape likely during the late afternoon. The image features a serene lake nestled in a valley, its surface reflecting light and bordered by densely forested slopes. Surrounding the lake are steep, rocky mountains, some of which have patches of snow on their higher elevations, indicating that the photo might have been taken in late spring or early summer. The foreground is dominated by a mix of pine trees and shrubs, suggesting a viewpoint from a higher altitude looking down into the valley. The lighting in the photograph creates high contrast between the illuminated tops of the trees and the darker tones of the mountain shadows and lake. This scenic portrayal is typical of mountain wilderness areas, possibly within a national park or protected natural area, characterized by its unspoiled beauty and tranquil atmosphere.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["557769","543816","554761","550641","555696","543547","555692","543569","554399","543582","550599","555130","543643","555698","556926","555703"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","mountain","valley","illuminated","portrayal","scenic","protect","elevation","altitude","viewpoint"]}
