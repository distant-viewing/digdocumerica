{"path":"550213.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, yet dynamic, outdoor scene likely in a forested area. The main focal point is a small dam or water barrier constructed of concrete and logs, which is partially obstructing the flow of a clear stream, creating a series of small, picturesque waterfalls. The water below the dam forms a calm, dark pool that reflects the surrounding trees and sky.\n\nThree individuals are visible in the scene, engaging with the environment in different ways. On the left, a man stands on a log that extends over the water, facing slightly away from the camera towards a woman who is cautiously walking towards him on the same log. Both individuals appear focused and are possibly discussing or enjoying the challenge of balancing on the log. On the far right, another man stands more relaxed at the edge of the concrete dam, wearing a pink shirt and looking towards or possibly speaking with the other two individuals.\n\nThe background of the scene is rich with verdant green trees under a bright and clear sky, suggesting a peaceful, natural setting away from urban areas. The light and shadows indicate it might be midday, which enhances the vibrancy of the natural colors in the photograph. This image captures a moment of human interaction with nature, emphasizing leisure and perhaps a sense of adventure or exploration.","title":"Enjoying the Rocky River in Columbia Township","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546338","550209","550238","546199","550222","546922","553413","553397","551423","553414","554501","553412","549639","551499","558065","544342"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["log","dam","individual","waterfall","challenge","midday","vibrancy","pool","concrete","adventure"]}
