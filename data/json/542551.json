{"path":"542551.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene set against a rural backdrop. In the forefront, a large sign reading \"Valley Nitrogen Producers, Inc. Basic in Nitrogen and Phosphates\" prominently displayed with a stylized \"N\" and \"P\" representing nitrogen and phosphates respectively. The sign is situated beside a road with visible tire tracks, indicating recent vehicle activity.\n\nBehind the sign, a wide field spans across the photo, showcasing a variety of vegetation, potentially farmland in early stages of growth or natural grassland. This suggests the location is in a rural area where agriculture might be prevalent.\n\nIn the background, the industrial complex of Valley Nitrogen Producers can be seen. There are multiple large storage tanks, some spherical and others cylindrical, painted mostly in white. These tanks are typically used for storing chemicals or gas in industrial plants. Extending from some of these tanks are pipelines and structures that support the functionality of a chemical or processing plant. Notable too are the tall stacks emitting steam or smoke, a common sight in factories involved in chemical processing.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, which might indicate a sunny day without much pollution, aside from the emissions from the factory stacks. Overall, the image juxtaposes industrial activity with a pastoral landscape, underlining interactions between agricultural regions and industrial operations.","title":"Plant's emission is local air pollution problem.","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["542552","543159","543764","542553","549960","546064","545998","542589","545836","551082","550917","553933","543872","544179","542620","546398"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["tank","chemical","factory","stack","processing","pipeline","sign","farmland","grassland","sight"]}
