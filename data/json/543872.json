{"path":"543872.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area amidst a landscape featuring a mix of natural and modified terrains. In the center of the image, there is an industrial facility composed of several large structures, some of which appear to be storage tanks or silos, connected by various roads and surrounded by patches of cleared earth.\n\nThere is a noticeable plume of smoke or steam rising from one of the structures, indicating active operations or processing. The layout of the plant suggests it could be related to energy, manufacturing, or waste processing.\n\nBordering the facility, there are roads that curve around the area, with one prominent asphalt road cutting across the bottom part of the image. Adjacent to this road, at the bottom left, there's a river or canal, flowing from the foreground into the background, and is lined with white materials along its banks which could be sandbags or construction-related materials.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes forested areas with dense trees, suggesting the facility is located in a rural or semi-rural area. There's minimal visible habitation or other buildings close to the facility, indicating it's possibly isolated from densely populated areas.\n\nThe overall setting is quite verdant, implying the photo was taken in a region with significant natural foliage, possibly in the early morning or late afternoon given the muted lighting and long shadows cast across the ground, enhancing the slightly eerie and isolated feel of the facility in its environment.","title":"Soft coal-burning power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543764","550339","545841","549727","551201","544573","545833","550856","543768","551567","550331","548195","551994","542620","544495","546122"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["facility","roads","modify","related","manufacture","cleared","process","asphalt","canal","material"]}
