{"path":"546136.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a scene, presumably outdoors, focusing on a group of people engaged in a casual gathering. The central figure in the frame is a person dressed in a brown suede jacket and blue jeans, sitting on a green folding chair. The person is seen from the back and has a holster with a gun tucked in it, visible on their right hip. This detail suggests a setting where carrying a firearm openly might be commonly accepted, possibly hinting at a rural or Western cultural environment.\n\nNext to this central person is another individual, partially visible, wearing a red jacket and denim jeans, similarly seated on a folding chair. The focus here isn't sharp, putting emphasis on the primary subject with the gun holster.\n\nIn the background or peripheral view, there are visible elements like disposable coffee cups and napkins on a table, suggesting the presence of food or drink likely shared among the group.\n\nThe environment bears a casual, rustic ambience possibly tied to a community gathering, outdoor event, or a casual social meet-up in a setting where carrying guns is part of the local custom or practice. The overall mood seems relaxed, with people comfortably engaging in conversation or enjoying a meal together.","title":"Jack hilliard, deer hunter, wears his handgun while playing poker at the hunters' camp.
