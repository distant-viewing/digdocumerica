{"path":"552156.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a striking industrial scene depicted against a dramatic sunset backdrop. The composition effectively contrasts the natural world with human industrial activity. In the foreground, delicate branches of a tree, silhouetted darkly, frame the photo and set a naturalistic tone. Beyond these branches, the central focus of the image is a large factory, its structures outlined against the glowing sky.\n\nThe most dominant elements are the thick, voluminous plumes of smoke billowing out from several tall smokestacks at the factory. These smokes are tinted by the sunset, creating a mix of gray and slightly luminous shades, which starkly contrast with the warm hues of the sky behind. The industrial complex features several visible buildings and structures with hard, angular lines, and the overall factory setting is intricate with various mechanical components and sections interconnected.\n\nThe sky, transitioning from a deeper orange near the horizon to a softer yellow and then a darker shade as it recedes upward, serves as a vivid backdrop, imbuing the scene with a poignant ambiance. The juxtaposition of the natural elements in the foreground and the industrial activity in the background highlights the environmental impact of human industry, suggesting themes of pollution and the alteration of natural landscapes.","title":"Smoke and steam rise from the Crown Zellerbach pulp mill.
