{"path":"544079.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image captures a dramatic and atmospheric view of a suburban area, possibly during a dust storm or under unusual weather conditions. The sky is dominated by a vivid orange and reddish hue, suggesting the presence of a large amount of dust or an intense sunset, contributing to an almost apocalyptic ambiance. Below this fiery sky, a densely populated suburban landscape stretches across the foreground and into the midground. \n\nThe housing closely packed together consists mostly of single-story structures, possibly with flat roofs, common in arid or semi-arid regions. The streets are orderly, with curved and straight lines visible, and there is little visible vegetation, supporting the idea of an arid climate.\n\nIn the background, a range of low mountains or hills can be seen, further setting the scene in a likely desert or desert-surrounding area. There is a significant contrast between the natural, untouched mountainous background and the developed residential area, emphasizing human habitation's impact on the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition, with its juxtaposition of the intense sky, the orderly suburb, and the rugged natural backdrop, creates a striking image that captures a moment of natural severity impacting human settlement.","title":"Dust storm rises over Phoenix on Labor Day, 1972.
