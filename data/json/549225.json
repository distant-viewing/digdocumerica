{"path":"549225.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape scene predominately showcasing diverse flora and geological features. The foreground is dominated by close-up details of wildflowers and grass, primarily showing a plant with thin, long leaves and delicate purple flowers. Surrounding the wildflower are dry, tan grasses and scattered green shrubs, all set against a reddish-brown earthen ground, speckled with small rocks.\n\nAs the viewer's gaze moves to the midground, the terrain transitions into a rugged and rolling hillside densely populated with a variety of trees, primarily conifers. These hills show a mix of green hues, suggesting different types of vegetation. This area is marked by undulating topography with small hillocks and valleys, giving depth and texture to the scene.\n\nThe background extends into a panoramic view of a broad valley that fades into distant, more softly contoured hills under a large expanse of sky. This distant view provides a sense of vast open space, characteristic of a natural, possibly highland or mountainous region. The sky above is lightly overcast with hints of blue peeking through, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. \n\nOverall, the composition gives an impression of tranquil wilderness, emphasizing the beauty and serenity of a natural landscape untouched by urban development.","title":"The roy fly ranch in sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["557189","550536","557099","552903","552442","549238","550439","557098","550441","550440","545723","555666","549150","547540","557191","556990"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["wildflower","valley","undulating","distant","serenity","hill","peek","reddish","speckle","topography"]}
