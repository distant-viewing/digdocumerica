{"path":"548990.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts three individuals participating in what appears to be a baptismal ceremony in a large body of water, set against a scenic backdrop of distant mountains. The central focus is on the ritual being performed, showcasing a man on the left, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, who leans over to address a young person, presumably receiving the baptism. This youth is wearing a white baptismal robe and a yellow head covering, listening intently or praying, with their eyes closed and hands poised near their face.\n\nAnother man, dressed in black, stands nearby to the right, observing or aiding in the ceremony. His attire suggests a more formal or ecclesiastical role, possibly a priest or minister.\n\nThe group is standing in shallow water that reaches up to their lower legs, reflecting the light and surrounding them in gentle ripples. The background features a rugged coastline with mountains that descend directly into the sea, under a bright, clear sky, emphasizing the serene and solemn nature of the activity. The scene is tranquil, composed, and rich in natural beauty, heightening the spiritual moment captured in the photograph.","title":"Baptism ceremony performed by members of the \"church of god in christ\" of north Las Vegas","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["548995","548992","547712","556234","548988","558405","558239","547332","554008","544770","553413","549012","554517","542556","546336","547336"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["ceremony","heighten","covering","robe","receive","address","poise","youth","black","aid"]}
