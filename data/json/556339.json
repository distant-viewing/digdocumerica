{"path":"556339.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a group of workers, likely miners or construction workers, gathered together during a break or at the end of their shift. Each worker is dressed in heavy-duty work attire, including helmets with lights, which suggests they might be miners or involved in underground work. They are covered in dirt and grime, indicating physical labor and exposure to rugged conditions. The helmets are adorned with various stickers, which add a personal touch to their otherwise uniform gear.\n\nThe central focus of the image is on two men in the foreground who are looking directly at the camera with mild expressions. One of them, wearing a striped shirt, is notably less dirty compared to his colleague, suggesting varying levels of exposure to the work environment or differing duties. The camaraderie among the workers is palpable; some are casually interacting with each other, adding a human element to the tough working conditions depicted.\n\nThe background is out of focus but shows industrial elements like concrete structures, possibly part of a mine entrance or a large industrial building, reinforcing the industrial and labor-intensive theme of the photograph. The overall mood is one of gritty realism, showcasing a moment in the lives of these workers with authenticity and respect for their professions.","title":"Miners just leaving the elevator shaft of Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia at 4 p.m.  There are three mine shifts.
