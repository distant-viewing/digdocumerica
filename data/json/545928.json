{"path":"545928.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures two people, presumably fishermen, active at what seems to be a narrow floating dock or structure on a large body of calm water. The first individual wears a red shirt and is standing on an elevated platform, focused on handling a large white bucket. The second individual is beside the first, on a lower section of the dock, and appears to be engaged in a task that involves reaching towards or into the water.\n\nThe dock itself looks to be rudimentary, built with a mix of wood and metal components. At the far end of the dock, there's a makeshift barrier with a gate-like appearance, possibly for controlling access or as part of the dock's functional design.\n\nThe water is still, reflecting the sky and elements of the dock beautifully, creating a serene atmosphere. The sky is clear and without visible clouds, suggesting early morning or late afternoon, based on the soft lighting.\n\nIn the background, a mountain range stretches across the horizon, adding a sense of remoteness and wilderness to the scene. The area around the waterbody seems sparse and rugged, suggesting this might be a location not in immediate proximity to urban developments.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a quiet moment in a scenic, natural setting with a focus on manual, possibly artisanal fishing activities.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["545936","550851","543465","554200","544126","544260","546800","545911","552291","545178","544306","543231","546980","554517","547020","545940"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["dock","waterbody","fisherman","remoteness","gate","bucket","reach","proximity","barrier","access"]}
