{"path":"554498.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a playful moment among children on a grassy field. The focus is on a young boy in the foreground performing a handstand. He's wearing a horizontally striped tank top and his head is turned downward towards the ground while his body is arched gracefully with feet up in the air.\n\nNext to him, there's another child who is partially visible and seated on the grass. This child, appearing in a light-colored shirt and dark pants, is observing either the boy doing the handstand or something else outside the frame.\n\nTo the right side in the background, there is a stationary object that resembles a small turtle on the grass, hinting at a possibly calm and natural setting. The environment overall conveys a sense of a leisurely day with vibrant green grass under a seemingly bright, open sky, though the sky is not visible in the image. The children appear to be engaged in casual, playful activities, typical of a relaxed, outdoor setting.","title":"Children examine a box turtle at stillwater, New York, near Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544354","556537","553512","554072","557410","547188","556437","555921","555915","556136","551010","549318","546453","543688","549274","545307"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","boy","grass","stationary","do","foot","perform","resemble","arch","turn"]}
