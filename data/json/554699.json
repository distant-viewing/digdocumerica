{"path":"554699.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene in front of a historic-looking, large wooden hotel or inn. The building has several levels, each featuring a balcony with decorative railings and a variety of window styles, including dormer windows on the top level. The architecture of the building appears Victorian, with intricate wooden trimmings and a complex roof structure that includes multiple peaks and red chimney stacks.\n\nIn front of the hotel, there is a well-manicured lawn with a pathway leading to a lower veranda that embraces the building's front. Parked on the driveway are two vintage cars, which suggest the image might be set around the mid-20th century. One of the cars is a light green station wagon, and the other car is partially visible on the left side.\n\nThere are several people visible in the scene who appear to be engaging in casual conversation. On the right, a group of five people includes two adults and three younger individuals likely children. They seem to be enjoying a sunny day outside. On the left, near the station wagon, are two women, one of whom is adjusting something on the car, while the other appears to be entering or leaving the vehicle. The attire of the people, which includes long pants and light jackets, suggests a cool but pleasant weather setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a nostalgic charm, capturing a moment of leisure and social interaction in a quaint setting that feels both historical and serene.","title":"Famed Ausable Club, an exclusive private club","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557684","556766","551119","557660","554063","553425","557641","544853","557655","551116","558037","543365","550120","544389","557661","555944"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["hotel","wagon","car","front","station","trimming","level","driveway","people","balcony"]}
