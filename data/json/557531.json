{"path":"557531.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lush valley extending towards a distant coastline, providing a view of a natural, tranquil landscape. The valley is flanked by sloping hills covered predominantly in dense greenery, dominated by various types of trees and shrubs. The foreground comprehends a mixture of dense vegetation and open patches of land.\n\nScattered across the valley floor are a few small, rustic buildings which appear to be residential houses or perhaps small farmhouses. These structures are simplistic and blend into the natural environment with minimal visual impact; some have light-colored roofs which subtly reflect the sunlight. Nearby these buildings, there appear to be small plots of cultivated land or gardens, and a couple of open fields that may be used for agricultural or pastoral purposes.\n\nThe valley floor features a few narrow roads or pathways that wind through the landscape, connecting the scattered buildings and allowing for local access throughout the area. There is no visible heavy infrastructure, suggesting a possibly remote or rural setting.\n\nToward the horizon, the land gradually transitions into a view of the sea. The coast meets the ocean, which stretches vast and tranquil, meeting the sky at a distant horizon. The sky is clear and light, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon timeframe, and the overall lighting gives the scene a peaceful, serene quality.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its vast depth and range of natural colors—from the vibrant greens of the foliage to the blues of the distant ocean—creates a picturesque and tranquil rural vista. The image evokes a sense of calm and isolation, away from urban hustle and encapsulated in nature.","title":"Leo Carrillo State Park on Highway #1 near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County, is free from commercial development.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557557","552582","550528","552593","544892","545001","548172","557537","543746","553978","555624","556341","557107","555603","548050","556462"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["valley","land","meet","ocean","timeframe","floor","farmhouse","vista","hustle","coast"]}
