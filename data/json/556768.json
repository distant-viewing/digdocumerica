{"path":"556768.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image features a train station scene captured from an elevated perspective. The photograph shows two sets of railway tracks in the foreground that are parallel and mostly empty except for a partial view of a train in the lower right corner. The train appears to be either arriving at or departing from the station.\n\nOn the platform, there is a group of people, many of whom appear to be waiting. The platform is equipped with a simple shelter structure which has a sharply pitched roof, providing sun and rain cover for daily commuters or travelers. The people on the platform display a casual posture, some are sitting, and others are standing and appear engaged in conversations or waiting activities.\n\nThick green foliage surrounds the area, suggesting that the station might be in a suburban or semi-forested location. The sun casts strong shadows, indicating it is either morning or late afternoon. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, typical of a day-to-day routine at a local train station.","title":"Southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority (septa) train pulls into a station in the northwest part of Philadelphia.  Some 30 million commuters used the 157 bus and train lines during 1973.  Total ridership was 293 million, an increase from the 273 million in 1971.  Annual budget of $180 million is provided half by state and local governments and half from fares.  Improvements in equipment, service and fringe parking have helped to increase ridership","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556767","556673","555967","556125","548475","556855","556100","556129","556778","556021","556051","556670","556772","556827","556074","556124"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","station","platform","wait","depart","pitched","arrive","sun","commuter","traveler"]}
