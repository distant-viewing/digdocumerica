{"path":"556597.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seen engaged in preparing or inspecting a set of yellow diving equipment. The focus is on his back, where large, cylindrical tanks are mounted; the tanks are bright yellow, fitted with black harnesses or straps. The man is wearing a dark green outfit, possibly a diving suit, and there are tubes or hoses like those used for breathing apparatus connected to his gear. His curly hair is windswept, suggesting an outdoor setting. \n\nHe is surrounded by several similar pieces of diving equipment, laid out or packed in wooden crates, indicating a preparation area possibly for a diving expedition or training session. In the background, lush green forested hills and a slightly overcast sky are visible, suggesting a remote or natural setting. A tall pole with what seems to be a small wind turbine or similar device on top is also visible, adding to the impression of an operational or expeditionary base camp. The overall atmosphere is busy yet focused, with a partial view of another person, indicating that this is a group activity.","title":"Wilson Day of Whitesville, Kentucky, a miner who is a member of the safety team from the Beth Elkhorn Coal Company, adjusts a gas mask back pack during the Kentucky State Mine Safety Contest at Benham, near Cumberland.
