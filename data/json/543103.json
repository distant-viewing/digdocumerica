{"path":"543103.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a scenic coastal landscape with a sign as the main foreground element. The sign states \"Shelter Cove Harbor,\" describing it as \"The only natural deep water harbor of refuge between San Francisco and Portland.\" It is part of a Discovery Tour, labeled as point 6 at Shelter Cove Sea Park.\n\nIn the background, you can see a panoramic view of the coastline, characterized by its rugged cliffs, a curved bay, and a forested area. The ocean is visible with sporadic white wave patterns close to the shore, suggesting mild surf conditions. The coastline is dotted with some buildings, likely related to the harbor mentioned on the sign.\n\nThe surrounding terrain has grass and shrubs, typical of coastal areas, with small coniferous trees scattered throughout, contributing to a peaceful natural environment. The sky is overcast, hinting at a cool or mild weather setting. The overall composition focuses on the interplay between the informative sign and the natural beauty of the coastal landscape it describes.","title":"Vacation homes for L.A. residents.
