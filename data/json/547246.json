{"path":"547246.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph features a man working on a small, somewhat weathered boat on a river. The boat is named \"BD-6 3\" as indicated on its side, and has a distinctive emblem with a red background and a white symbol on the cabin. The man appears to be engaged in an operational task, as he is managing a yellow, mechanical device that extends into the river from the deck of the boat. This machinery seems to be equipped with a metal basket or net, which is submerged in the river water, possibly used for collecting or dredging.\n\nThe man is wearing casual work attire which includes a striped long sleeve shirt, jeans, life vest, and gloves, indicating safety and preparedness for his tasks. His posture suggests focus and involvement in controlling or adjusting the equipment.\n\nThe boat itself has several functional features such as fenders hanging along the sides to protect it from impacts, and various objects on the cabin that likely serve for navigation and communication. The river is muddy, suggesting either high sediment content or disturbance from recent activity. In the background beyond the tree-lined shore, buildings can be faintly seen, placing this scene likely near a populated area. The sky is clear and the weather appears to be fair, underscored by the bright daylight illuminating the scene.","title":"The job of clearing drift from the Potomac and Anacostia rivers is done by the Army Corps of Engineers.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["552120","544755","557242","546301","552863","546063","544226","546885","552115","548882","548304","544646","549331","554445","551046","544973"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","river","cabin","dredging","fender","preparedness","task","emblem","basket","communication"]}
