{"path":"554224.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts two levels of outdoor pools filled with several bathers during what appears to be winter, given the presence of snow on the ground and the colder environment. The uppermost pool, surrounded by a wooden deck and fence, is considerably larger and more crowded, with people engaged in social interactions or just relaxing in the water. The foreground features a lower pool where one individual is seen swimming alone, which allows for a clearer view of the water's surface. Both pools are framed by robust wooden beams, adding a rustic aesthetic to the scene. The natural snowy elements visible on the ground and the cold outdoor ambiance contrast strongly with the warmth likely felt in the heated pools, suggesting a serene, communal bathing experience.","title":"Members of the ski club of Washington, D.C. soak out muscle fatigue at the Continental Inn pool.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554225","558143","555891","548549","548083","552012","548548","548085","552706","557717","551092","544339","558144","551093","546899","548585"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["pool","warmth","experience","deck","winter","beam","aesthetic","snow","fence","ground"]}
