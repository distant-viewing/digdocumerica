{"path":"546995.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street parade scene. It features a group of women dressed in uniform khaki outfits which include skirt suits, matching hats, and gloves. They are marching in a parade, carrying the American flag proudly, as they walk in a well-coordinated formation through a city street.\n\nThe setting shows a typical urban street lined with red-brick buildings, and various business signs such as one for \"Personal Loans\" and another that reads \"Blue Front\" can be seen, suggesting a commercial area. The parade appears to attract observers as several people, including children and adults, can be seen watching and mingling on the sidewalks.\n\nThe day is sunny and bright, contributing to the vividness of the colors in the scene, particularly the blues and reds of the American flag which stand out against the neutral tones of the uniforms and the urban backdrop. The image embodies a moment of community pride and participation, reflective of a celebratory or memorial procession within an American town setting.\n","title":"Memorial day parade, held by the black community, draws participants and spectators from the neighboring islands","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["549577","556278","552656","552654","557714","552660","557710","547022","552653","549572","553237","557715","556280","556274","554450","549571"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["parade","flag","street","procession","embody","mingle","pride","coordinate","khaki","participation"]}
