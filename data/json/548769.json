{"path":"548769.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph showcases a scene on a boat with three people engaged in an activity, set against a vivid blue sky and sea backdrop. The foreground is slightly obscured by the silhouette of a person's head, casting a shadow and framing the scene beyond. On the boat, two men are focused on examining a large map or a layout spread open between them.\n\nThe man on the left, who is wearing a life jacket and sunglasses, seems to be pointing and discussing specific details on the map. He appears prepared for water activity with his outfit. The man on the right, dressed in a light-colored shirt and tie, holds one side of the map and seems to be either explaining or consulting about the contents displayed. His attire suggests a more formal role, perhaps as a guide or a leader.\n\nThe background reveals a calm sea and a clear sky with minimal cloud cover, hinting at favorable weather conditions. The element of water and the boat setting suggest that the activity could be related to navigation, water exploration, or scientific research, emphasizing a sense of purpose or investigation. The overall composition with the contrasting foreground silhouette and the focused exchange over the map conveys a moment of planning or decision-making in a serene marine environment.","title":"Shell oil research engineers on an expedition to study reefs in john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo.
