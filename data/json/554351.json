{"path":"554351.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph features the Statue of Liberty seen from a distance, set against a clear, slightly gradated sky that transitions from a pale violet at the top to a lighter hue near the horizon. The statue stands prominently on the right side of the frame, depicted from about the waist up. It holds a raised torch in its right hand and a tablet in its left arm, iconic symbols associated with the statue.\n\nIn the foreground, occupying about the lower third of the image, there are tall, dense reeds or grasses, suggesting the photo was taken from across a body of water, possibly a marshy or coastal area. The reeds are swayed slightly, indicating a breeze, and they are colored in shades of purple and blue, blending with the background sky and giving the image a monochromatic feel. The focus is a bit soft, likely due to the wide aperture setting or intentional artistic choice to highlight the atmospheric conditions or the distance of the statue from the viewer. This setting and composition create a sense of peaceful solitude and highlight the majestic isolation of the Statue of Liberty in its surrounding environment.","title":"Statue of Liberty seen from the New Jersey flats.","placename":"Hoboken (N.J.)","location":"Hoboken, New Jersey","nn1":["555740","549803","553862","555723","548352","548349","548351","554350","549761","549781","549760","549763","554296","558115","549790","554359"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["statue","reed","violet","waist","choice","third","symbol","breeze","purple","distance"]}
