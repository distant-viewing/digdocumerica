{"path":"552142.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and moody landscape at twilight. The scene is dominated by a large, expansive body of water that stretches into the distance, meandering through a dense forest. The water appears calm and is a darker shade, reflecting the dim light of the sky above.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is covered with thick forests, predominantly composed of coniferous trees, giving a feeling of seclusion and wilderness. The forests are silhouetted against the sky, suggesting it is either early morning or late evening.\n\nThe horizon is lined with rolling hills or low mountain ranges, which add a sense of depth and scale to the landscape. The sky above is dramatic, filled with thick clouds that vary in intensity of color from deep gray to lighter shades, possibly indicating the presence of fading natural light.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image is quite dark, focusing on shades of blue, gray, and black, promoting a tranquil yet somewhat somber atmosphere. There are no visible human activities or man-made structures, emphasizing the natural and untouched state of the environment. The composition and the time of day lend a quiet, almost melancholic tone to the scene, making it a powerful portrayal of natural beauty and solitude.","title":"Waterways of lower Puget Sound near Olympia","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554405","552336","553569","557000","550777","543590","543604","554397","543577","543608","543611","545213","554608","542994","556910","557572"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["forest","shade","promote","seclusion","portrayal","intensity","meander","twilight","make","lend"]}
