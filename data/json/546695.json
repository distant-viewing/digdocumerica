{"path":"546695.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a bustling industrial scene, possibly a depot or a staging area for utility or construction vehicles. The image features an array of vehicles and equipment, primarily in bright orange coloration, indicating they are likely municipal or construction-related. These include bucket trucks, cranes, and various other heavy machinery geared for operations such as lifting, digging, and construction maintenance. \n\nOrganizationally, the vehicles and equipment are neatly parked in rows, filling much of the paved area visible in the photograph. There are also some white trucks, possibly indicating different utilities or operational functions compared to the orange vehicles.\n\nCentral to the image is a large metal pylon structure (an electricity pylon), indicative of the area being linked to electrical power utilities. This pylon suggests the presence of high-voltage power lines, aligning with the possibility that these vehicles are part of a power company fleet.\n\nIn the background, there are additional components that underscore an industrial setting: smaller structures which could be warehouses or offices, and a fenced perimeter surrounding the lot. The environment around this industrial zone includes sparse vegetation and what appears to be dirt areas, possibly unused or undeveloped land. There are also roads bordering the area, facilitating access.\n\nThe image captures a sense of organized activity and readiness, possibly in preparation for deployment to a construction or maintenance site, emphasizing the role of such facilities in operational logistics for city services or large infrastructural projects.","title":"Company parking area","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555779","547054","547929","544061","548353","547220","548433","546212","555759","555761","549779","546719","549479","548444","555755","546732"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["pylon","construction","vehicle","power","utility","possibility","maintenance","depot","digging","lifting"]}
