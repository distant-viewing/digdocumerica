{"path":"548840.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a serene and somewhat surreal landscape scene, characterized by a soft, muted color palette dominated by shades of lilac and purple, suggesting either an early-morning or twilight time. The focal point of the image is a large expanse of calm water, reflecting a gentle light.\n\nIn the foreground, two silhouetted ducks float peacefully on the surface of the water, adding life and a sense of scale to the scene. Further into the middle of the frame, numerous thin, bare tree trunks and branches emerge from the water, scattered unevenly. These trees appear to be partially submerged, indicating that the area may be a floodplain or wetland.\n\nThe background is a smooth gradient of light purple, blending almost seamlessly with the water, and there are no discernible structures or landforms that interrupt the vast expanse. The overall atmosphere is quiet and tranquil, evoking a feeling of isolation and stillness. The soft focus and pastel tones contribute to the image's dreamlike quality.","title":"Marshland fowl at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547744","557493","550735","542994","554608","544679","557561","550389","554752","552336","550788","550775","544577","543611","550746","557572"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["purple","duck","expanse","landform","water","wetland","stillness","gradient","twilight","trunk"]}
