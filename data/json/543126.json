{"path":"543126.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and atmospheric night scene at a natural lakeside setting. It prominently features salt formations, which are large, rugged, and detailed, showing multiple layers and textures. These salt formations are jutting out into a body of water, their intricate structures highlighted against the darker surroundings. The water beside these formations captures light reflections, which add a shimmering quality to the scene.\n\nIn the background, a mountain range under twilight conditions can be observed, adding depth and a hint of mystery to the composition. Above the mountain, a full moon hangs bright and clear in the dark blue sky, casting a gentle light over the landscape and contributing to the tranquil and slightly eerie atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a vivid portrayal of natural geological wonders under moonlight, creating a compelling interplay between light, shadow, and natural forms.","title":"Tufa \"towers\", porous rock formations, created by the heavy saline content of Mono Lake.","placename":"Lee Vining (Calif.)","location":"Lee Vining, California","nn1":["557603","543771","544725","552893","545586","552891","544870","545347","543604","547245","552894","544721","544679","543577","550646","557000"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["salt","formation","moon","wonder","mountain","portrayal","lakeside","mystery","night","twilight"]}
