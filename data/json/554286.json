{"path":"554286.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures an antique shop exterior in wintertime, featuring various objects and decorative pieces displayed outside. Notably, the scene is set against a backdrop of a lightly snow-covered ground and a white wooden building, which houses the shop 'Town and Country Antiques of Aspen', as indicated by two signs prominently hanging on the buildingâ€™s siding.\n\nTo the left of the scene, there is a wooden board, potentially part of larger furniture, placed horizontally, showcasing intricate design details such as elegant cut-outs and possibly glass panes. In front of it, there lies an ornate wooden dresser with several drawers, sporting traditional handles and standing on curved legs, characteristic of antique furniture.\n\nTo the right, positioned closer to the building, stands a striking sculptural figure of a Native American dressed in traditional attire, including a feathered headdress. The statue appears to be made from an opaque, possibly carved material.\n\nThe entire composition is illuminated by stark sunlight, casting deep shadows and highlighting the snow's texture and the smooth, polished surfaces of both the furniture and decorative statue. The setting suggests a quaint, possibly historic, location devoted to the heritage and sale of antique items in a rustic, outdoor environment.","title":"Luring customers on an Aspen street","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["555377","554288","544148","554214","557756","548242","554184","547808","557804","554291","554281","551695","543132","544911","554458","552607"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["furniture","statue","shop","snow","heritage","handle","pane","cut","sale","board"]}
