{"path":"544224.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene set in a natural, tranquil environment. In the image, two individuals are aboard a small sailboat that is gliding gently over calm waters. The boat is equipped with a large, triangular sail, prominently displaying a geometric design in dark blue and white, with the lettering \"DAH\" visible on the sail.\n\nThe background reveals a lush landscape consisting of tall, aged trees draped with Spanish moss, conveying a sense of a humid, possibly subtropical climate. This backdrop adds a verdant, almost mysterious ambiance to the scene. The water, reflecting the muted light and the greenery, adds a ripple effect that enhances the sense of gentle movement.\n\nBoth individuals on the boat are seated, appearing relaxed and absorbed in their activity of sailing. One might assume that they are navigating or simply enjoying their time on the water. The overall composition and the elements within the frame suggest a leisurely day spent enjoying nature and the peacefulness of sailing.","title":"Sailing in Mandeville Harbor","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["547273","551539","552345","548521","544669","543941","552343","548506","549411","548118","551541","547757","544667","543217","548517","548527"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sail","glide","enjoy","spend","boat","absorb","peacefulness","drape","lettering"]}
