{"path":"548553.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment featuring two individuals rowing in a small blue boat on a body of water. The person at the rear is rowing and appears to be a shirtless man with dark hair, navigating the boat. He is actively rowing, holding a wooden oar that dips into the water, creating splashes.\n\nSitting at the front of the boat is an elderly man dressed in a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and khaki pants, wearing sunglasses. He sits relaxed, his hands on his lap, facing slightly to his left towards the viewer, giving a full view of his profile.\n\nThe scene is calm, highlighted by the broad expanse of tranquil water that fills the background, merging seamlessly with the horizon in a monochrome color scheme. The lighting suggests it might be midday due to the brightness and the clear visibility of the subjects and their small reflections on the water surface. The overall mood is peaceful and leisurely, capturing a moment of simple enjoyment and companionship on the water.","title":"Boating on one of the lakes in Century Village Retirement Community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["550835","544270","553411","553800","552123","553403","549417","546356","544980","546976","546352","550975","549411","554196","549363","551539"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["row","boat","oar","dip","khaki","water","companionship","sit","rear","scheme"]}
