{"path":"544840.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an open road where three motorcyclists are riding down the highway. The riders are moving away from the viewer, towards the horizon. Each motorcycle appears to be loaded with gear, potentially for a long journey, indicated by the bags and equipment strapped to the bikes. The bikers are dressed in typical riding gear, including helmets and jackets, which suggests safety and preparedness for the road.\n\nThe environment around them is expansive, showcasing a rural or less densely populated area. The road is flanked by utility poles and fencing, indicating it is still a maintained route despite its remote feel. The landscape features rolling hills and open fields, with no buildings or other structures in immediate view, which contributes to a sense of openness and freedom.\n\nIn the background, mountains can be seen under a partially cloudy sky, adding a majestic and picturesque quality to the setting. The road stretches straight into the distance, framed by the natural beauty of the terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the motorcyclists centrally positioned and the road leading into the distant mountains, evokes a sense of adventure and exploration within a serene natural landscape.","title":"Vacationers on motorcycles","placename":"South Park (Colo. : Flat)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544844","548890","551382","548987","545598","548690","553955","554874","545367","553954","545150","554690","554876","553102","555670","553785"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["road","gear","riding","preparedness","fencing","strap","motorcycle","freedom","bike","rider"]}
