{"path":"543124.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a mesmerizing natural scene featuring a vibrant rainbow arching over a rugged mountain range. The photograph shows the rainbow appearing prominently against a dark, moody sky, which enhances the saturation and visibility of the rainbowâ€™s colors.\n\nThe mountains in the scene are steep and jagged, suggesting they are part of a high altitude region. The crests and troughs of the mountains are well-defined, with some patches of snow clinging to the slopes, indicating that the photograph might have been taken in late spring or early summer when snow has not yet completely melted.\n\nThe foreground of the image presents a ridge that leads into the mountain range, covered with sparse vegetation and dark soil, likely signifying a harsh, rocky terrain. The lighting on the mountain faces is dim, possibly due to the time of day being either dusk or dawn, contributing to a dramatic and somewhat solemn atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the natural elements of the mountain and the spectacular rainbow, combined with the play of light and shadow, creates a serene yet striking visual experience. The elements come together harmoniously to highlight the rugged beauty of the natural landscape under a remarkable atmospheric condition.","title":"Rainbow above Mono Lake.
