{"path":"555672.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image features a rugged, mountainous landscape as viewed from an aerial or high vantage point. The terrain is uneven and primarily barren, with patches of grey, brown, and hints of green showing sparse vegetation. Numerous small white patches indicate leftover snow or ice scattered across the landscape. A few small ponds or lakes can be seen, reflecting the sky and adding a dark, mirror-like contrast to the rocky surroundings.\n\nThere are no visible structures or people, highlighting the untouched and remote nature of this region. The background features a range of mountains with similarly rocky and snow-patched characteristics. The sky above appears clear with ample daylight illuminating the scene, hinting at a crisp atmosphere typical of high elevations. This landscape is likely situated in a part of the world where such rugged and sparsely vegetated terrains are common, possibly in a high-altitude area known for its natural beauty and challenging environment. The overall impression is one of solitude and untouched natural wilderness.","title":"View southeast across thompson pass to the lowe river valley.
