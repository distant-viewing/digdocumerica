{"path":"542937.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image portrays a serene yet somewhat stark natural landscape scene, dominated by layers of visually striking and contrasting elements. In the foreground, there's a dense coniferous forest, largely made up of tall, slim pine trees with a few patches where the ground is visible. The middle ground shows an area experiencing what appears to be active deforestation, as suggested by the presence of smoke rising prominently within this clearing. The rising smoke could indicate environmental burning, which is often conducted as part of forestry management practices, suggesting human interaction with the land.\n\nThe untouched dense forest partially transitions into the cleared area and then stretches out again into the distance across undulating hilltops, contributing to a sense of depth in the photograph. These hills, also thickly wooded and enveloped in a blue haze, lead the eye toward a watery landscape shown in snippets in the background. Here, the water appears interspersed throughout the lower levels of the terrain, perhaps in the form of a river or wetlands, weaving through the forest. The entire scene is set under a soft, diffused lighting, possibly due to the overcast sky, which casts a gentle grimness over the landscape and enhances the somber mood elicited by the active smoke plume.\n\nThis photograph could carry meanings linked to environmental impacts concerning deforestation and natural habitat alteration. Its composition deeply engages with the themes of human impact on natural landscapes, juxtaposing untouched nature with intervened areas, reflected through the visual narrative of deforestation and resultant smoke.","title":"Pine slopes, partially cleared","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555150","555109","555088","555163","555135","548596","553565","557574","542819","545289","555136","555162","544962","545048","555221","548593"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["deforestation","smoke","forest","coniferous","burning","hilltop","alteration","impact","forestry","pine"]}
