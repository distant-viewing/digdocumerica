{"path":"543686.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and vibrant scene of rural life, set in a livestock pen under a bright blue sky with distant hills forming a gentle backdrop. The main subjects are two individuals and a herd of cattle predominantly colored white, with scattered markings of brown. \n\nOn the left, an adult man, dressed in a green long-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, is bent forward helping a young boy with a lasso. The man's focus is directed towards the task at hand, guiding the young boy in roping a calf. To his right, the boy, wearing a mustard-yellow shirt and green pants, is actively participating in the process, holding onto the rope and standing close to the man, suggesting a learning moment or apprenticeship-like scenario.\n\nThe setting is a wooden livestock pen, clearly functional and weathered, constructed from logs and poles that show signs of age and rugged use. The ground is dirt-packed, reflecting the arid environment typical of rural ranch lands.\n\nThis photograph exudes a sense of tradition and the transfer of skills from one generation to another, underscored by a tranquil rural landscape that offers a snapshot of pastoral life. The image is imbued with natural lighting that highlights the subjects and the dusty environment they are in, further emphasizing the authenticity of the rural setting.","title":"Youngster helps ranch hand with calf-bRanding","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543779","554949","552580","552564","543679","553108","552569","552565","553104","543776","554950","553106","549200","548959","552677","548830"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["boy","pen","livestock","calf","mustard","subject","herd","authenticity","transfer","lands"]}
