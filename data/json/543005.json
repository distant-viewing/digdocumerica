{"path":"543005.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, focusing on what appears to be a factory or plant. A dominant feature is a tall chimney in the center-right of the composition, expelling a thick plume of white smoke into the sky. There are several other sources of smoke or steam visible in the image, coming from various parts of the facility.\n\nThe factory is surrounded by large piles of raw materials. In the foreground, there are numerous neatly stacked piles of lumber. Further back, to the right of the chimney, are heaps of a reddish material, possibly iron ore or bauxite, used in industrial processes.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is somewhat muted, mostly consisting of industrial metallic gray, rusty reds, and the natural color of the wood, contrasting with the bright white of the smoke and the blue of the sky. The overall setting gives a strong sense of an active, working industrial plant, likely involved in manufacturing or processing, emitting pollutants into the air. The image captures both the industrial activity and environmental impact, highlighting the intersection of economic production and environmental consequences.","title":"Northern California—Humboldt Bay—Eureka area","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550716","545244","545236","544777","546908","550869","545925","550329","546808","548068","550875","543011","550868","550328","546760","546884"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["smoke","chimney","factory","pile","ore","consequence","lumber","pollutant","heap","material"]}
