{"path":"553766.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a beachfront. We see a warm, golden sandy beach, nestled between lush green hills on one side and the deep blue ocean on the other, illustrating a thriving beach scene. The beach is lined with palm trees and has patches of shrubbery and sand dunes. People on the beach appear to be engaged in various leisure activities; some are strolling along the shore, while others are spread out on the beach, possibly sunbathing or enjoying picnics.\n\nThe ocean displays active waves, suggesting a breezy afternoon, with the water transitioning from a deep navy to a lighter shade of blue as it approaches the shore. In the background, mountains form a majestic backdrop, enhancing the serene and getaway feel of the scene. Just adjacent to the beach, there is a small settlement with modern-style buildings and a pier extending into the sea, indicating a blend of natural and developed environments.\n\nTo the right, nestled on the shoreline, are more structures, possibly commercial or residential, shaded by the abundant greenery. This combination of vibrant beach activity, lush flora, residential areas, and the vast ocean conveys a sense of peaceful coexistence and recreational harmony in what appears to be a popular yet tranquil coastal destination.","title":"Sea Life Park, like Paradise Park, is a commercial enterprise built in a conservation zone. An extensive collection of marine life ranging from anemones to whales is imaginatively displayed. The State Department of Land and Natural Resources controls land use in conservation districts which are primarily forest and water reserve lands.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553765","553982","553967","543254","553764","546408","557458","543089","545106","543303","557480","545162","553952","557463","543193","543425"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","ocean","nestle","beachfront","shore","navy","sunbathe","stroll","harmony","dune"]}
