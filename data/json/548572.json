{"path":"548572.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures a cheerful group of people of various ages engaged in a bicycle parade or event, riding together on a sunny day. The participants, who are mostly elderly, are riding bicycles and tricycles, several of which have baskets adorned with decorations such as flowers.\n\nThe people are dressed in casual, comfortable clothing suitable for biking and warm weather, including shorts, T-shirts, and sun hats. Some wear sunglasses, and one woman in the foreground wears a large, straw hat and white-framed sunglasses, adding a hint of festive flair to her appearance.\n\nThe background shows a bright blue sky with few clouds and is lined with palm trees, indicating a tropical or subtropical setting. The road they are riding on is wide and appears to be within a park or a similar recreational area given its cleanliness and the absence of traffic, enhancing the leisurely and safe atmosphere of the event. The image has a vibrant, community-oriented feel, suggesting an event that fosters social interaction and outdoor activity.","title":"Tricycle club of the century village retirement community meets each morning","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548574","548573","548570","551545","555500","555499","547209","548647","550069","552340","547241","546991","547870","543497","553759","556522"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["ride","bicycle","event","sunglass","tricycle","foster","flair","cleanliness","parade","hat"]}
