{"path":"547250.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a busy riverfront scene. The river, which dominates the foreground, has a distinctive muddy brown color. Several vessels are on the river, including barges aligned end to end near the bottom of the image, and a large warship moored along the pier at the center left.\n\nThe warship is prominent, painted gray with visible guns, exhaust funnels, and superstructures. It is docked along a riverfront that is bustling with activity. Close to the river, there are multiple rows of parked cars, indicating a popular or busy area, possibly for visitors to the ship or workers in the nearby establishments.\n\nThe background beyond the river features an urban landscape densely populated with buildings of various sizes. No prominent skyscrapers are visible, but a diverse array of mid-rise commercial and industrial buildings fill the scene. Towards the center-left in the far background, a slim monument can be seen piercing the skyline, suggesting a notable landmark in the vicinity. The photograph captures the essence of bustling mid-century riverfront commerce and naval presence amidst an urban setting.","title":"Aerial view of the Washington navy yard and the anacostia river.
