{"path":"546431.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a calm, urban setting, likely from the mid-20th century, featuring a predominantly overcast sky that contributes to a serene ambiance. The setting includes a pedestrian pathway characterized by a neat brick design, with a manhole cover noticeable on the path near the bottom-left corner of the image.\n\nOn the left side of the photo is a two-story brick building that features whitewash window accents and trim. The building hosts a small balcony on the second floor with ornate white railings, centered under which is a classical statue of what appears to be a female figure posed with one arm raised, adding a cultured and possibly historical or academic connotation to the building's function.\n\nThe environment around the building and pathway is mildly vegetated, with two mid-sized trees framing the pathway, their foliage lush and green suggesting spring or summer. In the middle distance, aligned with the path, is a young woman walking away from the viewpoint. She is dressed in a short, patterned dress with high boots, typical of mid-century fashion. Her blonde hair is long and loose.\n\nThe far right background shows a row of parked cars that gives a dully polished look typical of the era's automotive design, possibly the 1960s or 1970s. This line-up includes sedans with varied hues. The continuity of the architecture and cars along the street creates an orderly and peaceful suburban or college campus vibe.","title":"Restoration of Franklin Square area","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551742","546545","553550","549645","547388","550118","551723","545372","553840","548473","551739","546532","549381","544808","551477","550035"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["pathway","continuity","campus","brick","path","century","statue","accent","building","trim"]}
