{"path":"550162.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban setting, likely capturing a moment related to waste collection. In the forefront of the image, there are heavily piled up trash cans filled with various kinds of refuse, particularly noticeable are white plastic bags and assorted debris that spill onto the surrounding area. These trash cans are standard metal bins, indicating a scene from a time when such bins were commonly used.\n\nThe background features two men dressed in work uniforms, consisting of coveralls, suggesting they are municipal sanitation workers. They are walking in front of a large, old-fashioned garbage truck, which is parked in an alley or narrow street between residential or small commercial buildings. The truck has a faded and worn look, with its paint peeling, adding to the gritty urban feel of the scene.\n\nA young boy, previously unnoticed, is partially visible on the left edge of the frame. He appears to be watching the scene or perhaps waiting for the workers. He contributes to the candid and spontaneous nature of the photo, possibly symbolizing the daily life and routines within this community.\n\nThe setting is further framed by a sunny day, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the trash, truck, and surroundings. Trees and the architectural style of the houses hint at a residential area, possibly in a mid-20th-century American city. The overall composition of the photograph tells a story of routine urban maintenance, community, and the less-discussed but essential services that keep a city running.","title":"Collecting the garbage in inner city neighborhood, near east 125th street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550147","550154","549842","550150","549837","549844","545502","550159","544087","549839","549840","550146","546902","549751","550163","550158"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","bin","truck","can","sanitation","worker","alley","spill","tell","community"]}
