{"path":"558359.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features an elderly gentleman holding and likely playing an accordion. The man appears joyful and content, with his face partially lit and turned upward, possibly towards an audience or light source. He wears thick-rimmed glasses and a light blue shirt.\n\nThe accordion itself is intricately designed, featuring ornate patterns and decorative stars. It is a button accordion, evident from the multiple rows of round push buttons on the side being played, and piano style keys on the opposite side. The instrument's elaborate craftsmanship includes metallic and what seems to be pearl accents, giving it a rich, antique look.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dark, focusing all attention on the man and his instrument. The lighting emphasizes the joyful expression on the man's face and highlights the detailed design of the accordion, suggesting a setting that is intimate, possibly during a performance or personal play. The angle of the shot enhances the sense of engagement and affection the man has with his music.","title":"Christy Hengel, is one of a few manufacturers of concertinas in U.S. today.
