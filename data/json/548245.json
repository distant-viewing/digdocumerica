{"path":"548245.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts a quaint, serene street scene likely in a small town. In the foreground, there's a prominent white picket fence running along the left side of the image, leading the viewer's eye down the street. The texture and details of the fence, such as the shadows between the pickets and chips on the paint, are quite visible.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there's a street sign mounted on a pole, indicating \"MAIN STREET\" intersected by \"NETT ST.\" This street sign is situated at the corner, marking a crossroad that enhances the small-town feel of the setting.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo features a middle-aged man walking away from the camera down the sidewalk, dressed in a dark coat and hat, which reflects a bygone era or cold weather attire. Behind him, partially obscured residential and possibly commercial buildings line the street, characterized by their traditional architecture and older styling.\n\nDominating the background is a white church with a towering steeple that punctuates the skyline. This architectural detail not only serves as a focal point but is also emblematic of many American towns, where a church steeple often forms a central part of the community landscape. The church is nestled among bare trees, suggesting it might be late fall or winter.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is enhanced by a cloudy sky, which casts a soft, diffused light, muting the colors of the buildings and street, and giving a timeless quality to the scene. This kind of lighting and the arrangement of elements in the frame contribute to a feeling of nostalgia and peacefulness.","title":"Rockport's main street","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["558020","556950","551106","553327","556564","557954","557949","558037","550287","557758","557951","547440","558038","543353","556480","558030"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","church","picket","steeple","town","fence","styling","chip","nostalgia","peacefulness"]}
