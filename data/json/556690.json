{"path":"556690.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an interior space, which appears to be a subway or train car, through a glass window that is extensively covered with graffiti or paint. The graffiti, largely in flowing, curved styles typical of street art, obscures much of the detailed view inside the space. Looking through the distorted, paint-marked glass, several people are visible inside the car. The subjects are mostly seated, and the arrangement suggests the crowded, busy environment typical of public transport. The lighting within the car appears fluorescent, which gives a slightly harsh, artificial tone to the area. The photograph has a somewhat vintage, grainy texture, suggesting it might be from an older film camera, adding a layer of nostalgia and age to the image.","title":"Lexington avenue line subway passengers are partially hidden behind graffiti defacing a window on one of the cars of the New York city transit authority.
