{"path":"543411.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning and serene maritime scene at sunset. The primary focus is on a small, motorized boat in the center foreground, gliding across the shimmering water. The boat is manned by at least two people, possibly engaged in leisure or fishing activities. The water reflects the golden hues of the setting sun, dotted with sparkling highlights.\n\nIn the background, a large ship is anchored towards the left side of the frame, noticeable by its long, dark silhouette against the lighter horizon. On the right, further in the distance and partially obscured by atmospheric haze, another large vessel can be seen.\n\nThe entire scene is framed against a dramatic backdrop of hills or a coastal landscape, softly blurred and layered in varying shades of dark to lighter hues, suggesting distance and adding depth to the view. The sky is not prominently visible, suggesting that the focus is towards the horizon where the sun might be setting, blanketing the entire scene in a warm, golden light.\n\nThe image evokes a peaceful yet poignant mood, hinting at both the vastness of the natural world and the human activity within it, all encapsulated in the subdued light of twilight.","title":"Sunset on Little Sur","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544251","545170","543143","545055","551215","543956","543880","547556","543119","552293","548247","548117","553990","547230","550296","550039"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["glide","sun","boat","dark","anchor","hue","world","blanket","horizon","twilight"]}
