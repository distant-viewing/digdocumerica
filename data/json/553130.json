{"path":"553130.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape primarily characterized by dry, rugged terrain with a focus on construction and residential development against a scenic mountain backdrop. In the foreground, there is an expanse of rough, undeveloped land that appears to be a construction site or a recently excavated area, characterized by uneven soil and patches of sparse vegetation.\n\nThe middle ground features a line of single-story residential or industrial buildings with flat roofs, which appear to be part of a larger development. These structures are uniformly designed, possibly indicating a newly developed residential area or an industrial complex. There are vehicles, possibly including construction equipment, parked near these buildings, suggesting ongoing development or habitation.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large hill or low mountain, barren and sparsely vegetated, reflecting a dry or semi-arid climate. The hill's substantial presence looms over the scene, providing a natural contrast to the human-made structures in the foreground and middle ground.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a narrative of human expansion or development within a natural landscape, emphasizing interaction between constructed environments and the natural terrain. The use of color and lighting in the photo enhances the arid, warm feeling of the environment.","title":"New housing development","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["544816","546756","557530","553938","549067","547652","544400","547664","554817","545809","557516","555861","555883","552603","557726","555812"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","construction","expansion","mountain","hill","habitation","terrain","narrative","climate","complex"]}
