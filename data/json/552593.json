{"path":"552593.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a valley with a distinct rural landscape spread out between towering mountain ranges. The focus of the image is a small town nestled along a winding river that reflects the gentle light, enhancing the picturesque quality of the scene. Surrounding the river, the landscape is a patchwork of various shades of green, indicating cultivated farmland and possibly pastureland.\n\nNumerous fields, varying in shape and size, populate the valley floor, showcasing a mix of orderly agricultural plots and more natural land. These fields are crisscrossed by roads and dotted with occasional buildings, likely farms and homes, contributing to a sense of a lived-in and worked landscape.\n\nThe mountains that frame the valley are dramatic, with steep cliffs and ledges presenting a rugged outline against the sky. Their texture appears cragged and somewhat arid, in contrast to the lush valley, and their tops are tinged in a soft, possibly sunset light that suggests the photo was taken during late afternoon or early evening.\n\nThe sky above is clear and tranquil, adding a peaceful overhead canopy that complements the serene, rural setting below. The overall composition of the photograph, with its combination of grand natural elements and intimate human touches, portrays a harmonious interaction between nature and human endeavor.","title":"Rifle, southeast of the Piceance Basin, beneath the oil shale bearing Book (or Roan) Cliffs, is the major community in this region of sheep and cattle ranches.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["550528","543746","548199","550525","552595","546424","556341","545313","550497","550634","557531","548172","554059","542998","543750","549116"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["valley","in","patchwork","farmland","tinge","ledge","mountain","plot","field","endeavor"]}
