{"path":"543543.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic, tranquil scene with a strong natural and environmental focus. In the foreground, a gentle stream winds its way through a landscape dotted with rocks, twigs, and a predominantly green, mossy area along its banks. A prominent, partially decomposed tree stump anchors the left-hand side, while smaller boulders and sparse vegetation are scattered throughout the stream's course. \n\nThe middle ground features a wooden house with modern architectural elements, positioned slightly above the level of the stream, indicating a raised foundation likely for protection against flooding or moisture. The house displays a combination of horizontal and vertical lines with large windows and a muted brown and beige color palette that harmonizes with the surrounding environment. Its location suggests a serene, possibly secluded setting.\n\nBeyond the house, the background reveals a densely wooded area with pine trees and hints of snow-clad mountains, suggesting this setting might be in a mountainous or high-altitude region. The presence of electrical lines adjacent to the house connects it to modern utilities, contrasting with the otherwise natural and undisturbed environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes a harmony between human habitation and the natural environment, showcasing how buildings can be sensitively integrated into nature. The image invites contemplation about sustainable living and the importance of preserving natural waterways and landscapes.","title":"Silt contaminated lake and newly constructed house","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552986","551078","543526","554401","549457","553458","555134","546126","551526","554438","555218","554721","550351","555211","554549","556472"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["stream","house","decompose","mossy","foundation","harmony","flooding","twig","course","stump"]}
