{"path":"544819.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph features a large pile of crushed and stacked old cars in various states of disrepair and deformation at a scrapyard. The cars are of different colors, mostly having visible rust and damage, stacked haphazardly on top of each other. The heap extends high up in the background, filling most of the frame.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent sign reads \"NATIONAL METAL PROCESSING 1919 7th Ave.\" Below this, another line states \"THE PLACE WHERE OLD CARS RETIRE,\" indicating that this is a vehicle recycling yard. Additional directional information is given: \"TURN OFF AT WALNUT STREET 244-5557,\" which likely provides navigation guidance to this location along with a contact number.\n\nThere are no people visible in the scene. The background has a clear blue sky, which sharply contrasts the wreckage and metal chaos in the lower part of the image. The focus of the photograph appears to be on the vast amount of automotive waste and the concept of recycling old cars. The setting and items suggest an industrial area dedicated to metal processing and recycling.","title":"Auto junkyard, where cars are shredded and compacted","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["542656","552738","545303","554348","554320","546172","554352","553006","545545","554311","553005","551517","555492","551547","545340","552999"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["recycling","car","stack","processing","concept","recycle","guidance","metal","state","scrapyard"]}
