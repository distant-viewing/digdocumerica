{"path":"542522.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor river scene featuring dynamic, fast-flowing water. The river is turbulent, with white frothy waves crashing around numerous rocky outcroppings and boulders scattered throughout the watercourse. A man is standing on a prominent rock that juts out into the river, appearing focused on his activity. He is dressed in outdoor attire, possibly wearing waders, and is engaged in fishing, holding a fishing rod with his line cast into the rushing waters.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes lush greenery on the riverbanks, with grasses and small bushes adding a verdant contrast to the rocky river. The background shows more rocks and boulders, suggesting a rugged natural terrain typical of a mountainous or wilderness area. The overall mood of the scene is peaceful and serene, despite the vigorous flow of the river, providing a sense of tranquility and isolation in nature.","title":"California - Kings River, near Centreville","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542509","554520","550317","554519","542529","542744","553337","551408","550665","542646","553339","550217","543628","543453","552976","550666"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","boulder","fishing","outcropping","rock","rod","riverbank","flow","wilderness","bush"]}
