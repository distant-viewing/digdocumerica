{"path":"544941.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a view of ancient, multi-storied pueblo ruins nested within a natural rock cave. The dwelling is constructed from stone with each structure showcasing various numbers of rectangular windows and doorways, some of which appear to reach the height of two or three stories. The buildings are closely interconnected, demonstrating an intricate assembly of living spaces and storage rooms, which are characteristic of ancestral Puebloan architecture.\n\nThe background of the image prominently displays the rough and overhanging cliff face that shelters the structure. This natural cave offers a dramatic and rugged backdrop, while simultaneously providing protection to the dwellings built within its recess. The stonework of the buildings is in various states of preservation with visible signs of erosion and partial collapse.\n\nSeveral ladders, placed vertically against the buildings, indicate accessibility between different levels and spaces. The general environment appears dry and rocky, typical of southwestern American terrain where such ancient dwellings are commonly found.\n\nOverall, this image captures a remarkable example of prehistoric Native American architecture, beautifully integrating man-made structures within a natural landscape, exemplifying a sophisticated understanding of both construction and adaptation to the environment.","title":"Cliff Palace was once a village of over 200 rooms and 23 kivas (ceremonial spaces).","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544953","544952","544922","544927","544919","544948","544951","544923","545554","545567","544937","555286","544421","545550","544911","545565"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dwelling","cave","nest","recess","exemplify","example","stonework","ruin","preservation","adaptation"]}
