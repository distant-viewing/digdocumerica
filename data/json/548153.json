{"path":"548153.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a group of people engaged in outdoor winter activities in a snowy forest. The forest is densely populated with tall conifer trees, each heavily laden with snow, setting a serene, wintry backdrop. The sky is overcast, creating diffused natural lighting that enhances the wintery ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, several skiers and a person carrying a sled are visible. The skiers, equipped with poles, are partially clad in traditional ski gear, which includes caps and jackets in a variety of colorsâ€”red, black, and checkered patterns are discernible. Their skis are narrow and appear to be traditional cross-country types, appropriate for traversing the forest terrain covered in deep snow.\n\nThe composition of the photograph suggests a leisurely but adventurous outing, possibly a family or a group of friends enjoying the natural setting and the challenge of skiing among the trees. The scene is peaceful and conveys the joy of outdoor winter activities. The setting and attire indicate that the photograph could be a few decades old, considering the style of the clothing and the type of ski equipment.","title":"Members of the Oregon Crag Rats, a mountaineers club based at Hood River.
