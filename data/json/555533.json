{"path":"555533.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man focused on a detailed woodworking project within a rustic workshop setting. The man is dressed in a worn gray knitted cardigan, a red baseball cap, and a red-and-white flannel shirt, indicative of a casual, utilitarian wardrobe. His face shows concentration as he meticulously handles a piece of wood near a workbench.\n\nThe man is seated at a wooden workbench equipped with various tools and hardware, suggesting a personal or professional workshop environment. Behind him on the left, the partially exposed internals of a machine — possibly a lathe or grinding wheel — can be seen. This equipment, along with a circular saw blade attached to the bench, contributes a strong industrial feel to the setting.\n\nThe window on the right side of the frame allows natural light to infiltrate the space, highlighting dust particles and creating a warm, cozy atmosphere. Visible through the window are vague hints of a natural landscape, possibly indicating a rural location. Shelves on the wall hold additional tools and items, underscoring the functionality of the space.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses on the interaction between the man and his tools, capturing a moment of skilled craftsmanship. The overall ambiance reflects a blend of labor and passion, typical of artisanal or craft environments.","title":"This Vermont native of east bethel is known principally for his ability to cane chairs and straw buggy seats, but here he is sculpting a chair leg on his homemade lathe","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["557680","548252","558356","548231","556633","554432","557115","548455","557678","557945","553603","558324","558327","547427","552684","542497"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["tool","workshop","saw","flannel","hardware","cardigan","man","craftsmanship","blade","particle"]}
