{"path":"547751.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of nine children posing in front of a building labeled \"REHABILITATION-WELFARE OFFICE\". The building features a simple, mid-century architectural style with a brick base and white upper walls. The entrance of the building has two doors, one of which has some numbers visible, specifically \"220\" and partially \"2...\".\n\nThe children, a diverse group, vary in age and appear to range roughly from about 5 to 12 years old. They are dressed casually, wearing a mix of long-sleeve and short-sleeve tops, some with sweaters, and various styles of trousers. Their clothing suggests a cool but not cold climate, perhaps in fall or spring.\n\nOne child, front and center, proudly holds a small American flag. Another child, on the right end of the group, is holding a drum, while the child to the immediate left of center is raising a jump rope above his head, which adds a playful dynamic to the scene. The expressions on their faces range from smiling broadly to more reserved or serious looks, conveying a sense of camaraderie and youthful energy.\n\nThe setting is sunny, with shadows indicating either morning or late afternoon light, which gives the photograph a warm glow. The overall composition of the image captures a moment of childhood innocence and a snapshot of community life outside a government welfare office, likely intended to highlight social issues of the time.","title":"Youngsters at public housing project near Hemisfair grounds","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["556265","552759","545379","548227","550137","556437","545509","553096","552760","552958","556301","552589","553510","549865","548488","546873"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","office","group","sleeve","innocence","government","drum","camaraderie","front","childhood"]}
