{"path":"544716.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic and abstract scene that appears to be a close-up of a wet surface reflecting a unique and intricate pattern. The focal point of the image is a series of jagged shapes that seemingly zigzag across the frame, imparting a sense of movement and rhythm. These shapes are characterized by different shades of browns and tans, resembling layers or sedimentary rock strata found in geological formations.\n\nDirectly below these patterned shapes, there's the presence of what looks like a tiled surface, wet and reflecting the above patterns. The tiles are mostly dark with white lines of grout separating them. The wetness of the surface adds a shiny texture and enhances the reflection which contributes to the abstract nature of the image.\n\nThe overall composition is artfully structured with a blend of natural and geometric aesthetics, creating an engaging visual balance. The photograph has a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere due to its dark tones and reflective quality, invoking a sense of curiosity about the place and the exact nature of the photographed objects and surfaces.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["545850","552239","550372","555155","557626","555226","555177","555804","544992","550373","550606","554347","550726","544682","543554","547905"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["shape","surface","wetness","stratum","tan","rhythm","tile","close","balance","pattern"]}
