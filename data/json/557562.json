{"path":"557562.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene during what appears to be the early morning or late evening, given the soft lighting and shadows. The calm water of the lake reflects the objects and surroundings with notable clarity.\n\nIn the foreground, a small sailboat with a predominantly white sail is moored near a wooden dock. The sail is folded down and the boat is tightly covered, suggesting it is not currently in use. Next to the sailboat is a red canoe, adding a bright splash of color to the scene. The canoe is also docked and unoccupied.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a grassy bank that leads up to a well-maintained lakeside house. The house has large windows, a porch, and an extended roof that might provide shade or shelter to its outdoor areas. The presence of lounging chairs on the grass near the house indicates a leisurely atmosphere. Visibility in this sector is lower due to the distance and the shadows cast by the trees surrounding the house.\n\nThe background is dominated by lush green trees that line the opposite shore of the lake, reflecting in the water and framing the house. These trees enhance the sense of seclusion and tranquility in the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph conveys a sense of peaceful solitude and a moment of quiet reflection in a natural setting, emphasizing the beauty and stillness of the environment.","title":"Boats in front of a home on Malibu lake in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.
