{"path":"550976.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque natural scene, showing a river landscape dominated by a substantial waterfall in the background. The waterfall is split into several streams that cascade into a large body of water. Behind the waterfall, there's a lush, densely forested hillside, suggesting the photo was taken in a mountainous or highland region.\n\nIn the foreground, a man in a boat is rowing gently across the wide river. His small boat is positioned towards the right side of the frame, and he appears to be mid-stroke with his oars. His presence adds a sense of scale and human interest to the otherwise wild scene.\n\nThe photo is framed through natural elements, with tree branches subtly intruding into the top corners of the image, providing an enclosed, intimate view of the scene. The overall mood is tranquil, with the natural beauty and grandeur of the setting suggesting an untouched wilderness area.\n\nIn the far background, small buildings or structures can be seen near the edge of the forest, indicating some human habitation but it does not dominate the landscape. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day and adding vibrancy to the vivid greens of the trees and the white, frothy water of the waterfall.","title":"Glen Ferris, on the Kanawha River near Gauley Bridge, is a popular spot for camping and fishing.","placename":"Charleston (W.
