{"path":"549202.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a large, yellow, heavily soiled construction vehicle, possibly a dump truck, focusing on its undercarriage and rear tire. The tire is thick and deeply treaded, indicative of heavy-duty equipment used in rugged terrain or construction sites. Underneath the vehicle, a pool of dark oily liquid is evident, pointing to either a leak from the truck or a spill on the ground, which stretches into the foreground of the image. \n\nThe background presents a natural, rural landscape with gentle rolling hills. One of the hills is capped with distinctive rock formations. The terrain is bare with minimal vegetation, primarily grass, and scattered shrubs, typical of a semi-arid region. The sky is mostly clear with a few small, white clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall scene is isolated and tranquil, contrasting sharply with the industrial element introduced by the construction vehicle. The perspective of the photo, from ground level looking upwards and across, emphasizes the impact and intrusion of human activities (represented by the truck and the oil spill) into the natural landscape.","title":"Construction vehicles at railroad construction site in sarpy basin.
