{"path":"550494.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, expansive natural setting. In the foreground, a prominent pair of antlers lies on the ground, bleached white, possibly from an elk or deer, suggesting the passage of time and the cycle of life in the wilderness. The antlers are set against a rich tapestry of grass and small shrubs that blanket the earth in various shades of yellow and green, showing signs of a dense, fertile landscape.\n\nThe middle ground extends into a lush meadow that seems to be nestled within a valley. A narrow stream or perhaps a small pathway runs through the middle of the meadow, seemingly splitting it into two symmetrical halves, hinting at water nearby which is supporting the vegetation.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by rolling hills that gradually ascend into distant mountains. These mountains, under a grey, overcast sky, have their peaks slightly enshrouded in mist, adding a sense of depth and mystery to the setting. The overall lighting is subdued, indicating either a cloudy day or an early morning or late afternoon time frame, which enhances the moody, tranquil, and somewhat introspective ambiance of the landscape.","title":"A caribou rack lying at the foot of the hill which is the site for pump station #4.
