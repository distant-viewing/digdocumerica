{"path":"551377.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a duck swimming in a body of water, with the background dominated by dark, shadowy rocks. The duck is primarily white with some darker patches and has a distinctive red and black patterned face, resembling the features of a Muscovy duck. Its reflection shimmers faintly on the surface of the dark, still water. The lighting in the image is moody and subdued, contributing to an overall serene yet somewhat mysterious atmosphere. The composition and the natural, low-light setting focus attention on the singular duck, emphasized against the dark, almost black water and rock formations.","title":"Tame duck feeding along rocky shore","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["558092","553408","555551","548542","543663","543918","552221","551501","552993","546086","547753","548840","558091","544539","549553","550388"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","rock","swim","shimmer","resembl","subdue","dark","water","formation","reflection"]}
