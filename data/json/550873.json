{"path":"550873.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling industrial scene featuring a large ship, named James E. Ferris, engaged in loading or unloading cargo. The ship is a sizable, steel freighter painted in red and white, primarily used for bulk cargo, as suggested by its design and the material visible onboard. The ship flies the American flag prominently near the stern.\n\nA large, black cargo grab is suspended from an industrial overhead crane, capturing a substantial amount of bulk material, possibly ore or coal, indicating the ship's role in transporting raw materials. The crane structure spans the width of the photograph above the ship, adding a strong industrial element to the scene.\n\nThe backdrop is less distinct but indicates an industrial harbor environment with overcast skies, contributing to the gritty industrial feel of the scene. There are no visible people; instead, the focus is squarely on the machinery and the operation at hand. Actions such as these are vital for logistics and the transportation of goods in industrial economies, emphasizing the role of such ships in commerce and industry.","title":"Coal is unloaded from freighter in canal alongside the Charmin Paper Company.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546934","551582","547474","552008","546828","546881","552303","548125","555260","547056","548127","555797","551577","555283","550021","546755"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","cargo","role","material","crane","ore","economy","logistic","width","overhead"]}
