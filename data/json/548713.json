{"path":"548713.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a serene underwater scene, set in a clear, blue aquatic environment that likely represents a section of an ocean or sea. At the top of the image, the water's surface is visibly textured with light patterns, subtly disturbed, perhaps indicating the presence of gentle waves above.\n\nProminently, we see several fish swimming within the frame, with a natural yet dynamic arrangement suggesting normal marine activity. These fish exhibit streamlined, robust bodies, indicative of a species accustomed to strong currents or active swimming. Their scales reflect the limited light available underwater, contributing to a sense of muted glossiness against the predominantly blue environment.\n\nThe background shows elements of a coral reef or rocky underwater structure, characterized by rough textures and possibly adorned sparsely with marine flora. This backdrop adds both depth and context to the setting, inferring a natural habitat for the pictured fauna.\n\nThe quality of the image is perhaps characteristic of underwater photography, where details might be slightly softened by the diffusion of light in water, and the overall palette tends towards monochrome shades, dominated here by blues and muted greys. This scene effectively conveys a tranquil, almost isolated snapshot of marine life in its natural state, devoid of human interference and marked by a serene simplicity.","title":"Coral and marine life at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a few miles off Key Largo","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548719","548717","548722","548718","548677","555556","548682","548715","548721","548675","548681","548683","548680","548716","548678","548712"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["fish","diffusion","underwater","fauna","interference","reef","exhibit","swimming","current","photography"]}
