{"path":"548961.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a man in the process of milking a cow with the assistance of a mechanical device. The man, wearing a light-colored cap, a blue striped shirt, and overalls, is crouching beside the cow, attending to a metallic milking apparatus that is attached to the cow's udder. The cow, predominantly white with black patches, appears calm and is standing in a stable or barn-like setting.\n\nThe man's expression is focused and attentive as he handles the equipment, which includes a stainless steel milk bucket positioned beneath the cow. The setting has a utilitarian atmosphere, with a plain, possibly concrete floor and elements of the barn infrastructure faintly visible in the background.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts a routine agricultural activity, illustrating a blend of traditional farming and modern technology.","title":"Milking time on experimental farm operated by epa's national research center.
