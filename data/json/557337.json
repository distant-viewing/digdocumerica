{"path":"557337.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures two men inside a large industrial or warehouse space. The focal point of the image is a massive, multi-layered rectangular structure composed of numerous large, flat wooden panels or boards. These boards appear quite worn and have red paint marks on their sides, hinting at either previous use or some form of coding for organization.\n\nThe man on the left, who is partially obscured by the wooden structure, is dressed in a plaid shirt and dark pants. He is actively engaged, pointing to a specific area on the structure, seemingly explaining or discussing something related to it. The man on the right is wearing a dark suit and appears to be listening or observing attentively, his body slightly leaning forward towards the structure and his gaze directed towards the point of interest indicated by the other man.\n\nThe background shows the interior of a spacious metal shed with girded roofing, supported by steel beams. Natural light streams in from skylights above, illuminating the scene with soft, diffused daylight. On the far right, there is a glimpse of a red railing that suggests an elevated platform or additional level within the space. The industrial environment, combined with the scale of the wooden structure, suggests a setting related to construction, manufacturing or storage.","title":"Manufacturing facility of Sunglow Corporation, where backyard solar heating units are made under license from International Solarthermics Corporation of Nederland, Colorado. Walls of an A-frame structure shown in picture #14884 are made of 1/2-inch plywood bonded to four inches of closed cell urethane foam for insulation. The solar heating unit uses a cup shaped heat collector rather than the flat plate collector which is considered more conventional.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["546628","557945","554431","544022","554432","546036","554430","555236","554428","556314","544053","542546","546826","556503","557883","555373"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["board","code","point","skylight","man","structure","roofing","explain","organization","discuss"]}
