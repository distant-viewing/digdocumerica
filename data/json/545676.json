{"path":"545676.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph shows a zigzag pattern of barriers across what appears to be a muddy, silt-covered landscape, possibly an area of wetlands or a floodplain. The barriers are made up of cylindrical sections that are linked together, perhaps buoys or a type of floating containment boom. The landscape is large and open, with the barriers stretching across the width of the frame, creating a snake-like pattern from the foreground into the distance.\n\nIn the background, a range of low mountains or hills is visible, which are partially obscured by mist or low clouds, suggesting a damp or rainy environment. The sky is overcast with a uniform grayness, which adds to the gloomy, desolate atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe foreground contains dry, cracked earth and stones, indicative of variability in water levels in this area, showing both wet and dry conditions.\n\nOverall, the setting suggests an active environmental management or water control project in a natural but challenging setting. The lack of visible wildlife or human activity further emphasizes the possibly remote or uninhabited nature of the location.","title":"Epa supervised clean-up of the San Juan river oil spill.  285,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a burst pipeline and flowed 200 miles downstream before it was contained by a log boom.
