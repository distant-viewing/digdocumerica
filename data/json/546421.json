{"path":"546421.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph features a large outdoor advertisement billboard juxtaposed against high-rise buildings in the background. The billboard prominently displays the word \"NOW\" in stylized, bold red and orange letters, with a part of a message visible suggesting a promotional themeâ€”\"is your chance to grab At Paradise!!\" Below this, there is additional text promoting \"Playa Azul\" and a phone number. A small line at the bottom of the billboard attributes the sign to \"Another project of EHG Enterprises.\"\n\nThe background of the photograph shows two high-rise buildings. The building on the left is a multi-storey structure with a repetitive pattern of balconies that create a grid-like facade. The building on the right features a similar architectural style and appears to be part of an urban residential or commercial complex. The sky is clear, suggesting the photo was taken on a bright, sunny day.","title":"Luquillo Beach Condominium","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546425","548674","548730","545263","557419","547648","555380","544145","557502","547841","552985","556047","553689","551522","545241","544287"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["billboard","attribute","grab","phone","promote","rise","building","balcony","message","advertisement"]}
