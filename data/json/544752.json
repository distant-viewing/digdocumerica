{"path":"544752.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a landscape dominated by arid, barren terrain with rugged cliffs and undulations. The image features a winding river that creates a dramatic contrast with the surrounding terrain. The river, appearing dark and deep, carves through the landscape, bordered by steep rock formations that display vertical stratifications, indicative of geological layers exposed over time.\n\nOn one side of the river, there is a developed area visible as a line of closely packed structures—possibly a small settlement or a row of industrial facilities—along the water's edge, hinting at human inhabitation or utilization of this river for economic purposes. Dusty roads, faintly etched into the terrain, connect this area with other parts of the landscape.\n\nThe other river bank features more pronounced cliffs and elevated plateaus, providing a stark visual texture. The terrain's overall color palette is a mix of earth tones—ranging from deep browns to reddish hues, punctuated occasionally by darker patches, likely vegetation or shadowed areas.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the elements of water and arid land, highlighting the stark natural beauty and the minimal human presence in a largely inhospitable environment. The river likely plays a crucial role in whatever settlement exists, possibly serving as a lifeline in a dry region.","title":"Colorado--South Platte River","placename":"South Platte River (Colo. and Neb.)","location":"South Platte River, Colorado","nn1":["543977","548933","552908","552548","545632","545640","545633","545329","544744","550414","544748","545629","543976","545794","545636","545787"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","settlement","terrain","cliff","stratification","etch","plateaus","exist","undulation","pronounce"]}
