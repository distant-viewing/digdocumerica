{"path":"551468.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a contemplative scene centered around a young woman and an artistic fountain. The woman, apparent from her youthful features and length of her straight brown hair, is seated behind the fountain, which is the dominant foreground element. She is wearing a blue jacket and seems to be either deep in thought or calmly observing her surroundings.\n\nThe fountain is notable for its sculptural qualities; water cascades vigorously over what looks like a curved, dark stone or concrete surface, creating a dynamic and splashing water effect. The texture of the water is distinctly captured, contrasting sharply with the smoothness of the fountain's surface.\n\nIn the background, other people can be faintly seen in a setting that suggests a public or communal space; possibly a courtyard or park area within a corporate or college campus environment, given the architectural structures and hints of vegetation.\n\nThe overall composition uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the fountain and the young woman, leaving the background softly blurred. This directs the viewer's attention to the interplay of natural elements (water and human) with the man-made (sculpture and architecture), all filtered through a lens of quiet reflection. The ambient lighting is soft, possibly indicating an overcast day, which adds to the introspective mood of the image.","title":"Water fountain at nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["550748","552700","551858","551484","553281","549982","553224","551480","553181","553207","551663","551449","550747","551467","551793","557268"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","smoothness","courtyard","woman","campus","sculpture","lens","cascade","thought","water"]}
