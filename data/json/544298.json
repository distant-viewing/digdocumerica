{"path":"544298.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large accumulation of garbage in a natural environment. In the forefront, thereâ€™s a substantial pile of trash that includes a variety of discarded items such as aluminum cans, plastic bottles, paper, and general household rubbish, all scattered haphazardly. A prominent feature in the center is a rusty, red barrel overflowing with more refuse, particularly filled with empty cans that seem heavily weathered and dirty, suggesting they've been there for some time.\n\nThe background contrasts sharply with the garbage, composed of dense, dark green foliage of trees and shrubs, indicating that this pile is situated in a wooded or forested area. The disparity between the natural beauty and the human-made waste sharply highlights environmental neglect and pollution issues.","title":"Litter on small public beach","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["551247","557307","543589","553433","551440","550687","550801","544640","552100","550798","542494","552098","544637","555228","544644","550352"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["garbage","can","pile","aluminum","rubbish","refuse","household","barrel","accumulation","bottle"]}
