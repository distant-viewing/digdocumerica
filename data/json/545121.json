{"path":"545121.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph is an aerial shot capturing a coastal town adjacent to a forested area and an expansive beach. The town is situated on the left side of the image, closely bordered on one side by a calm body of water that could either be a river or a bay, and on the other by streets and sparsely spread houses and buildings. Most of the buildings are small, suggesting a modest, possibly residential neighborhood. There are visible roads intersecting through the town, some vehicles, and few visible people suggesting a quiet, daily activity.\n\nThe right side of the image prominently features a long beach with waves forming white foamy patterns as they meet the shore. The beach is littered with an extensive amount of driftwood and debris stretching along its length towards a more forested region. The waves are rhythmic, creating parallel lines of foam extending down the shoreline.\n\nIn the foreground and extending along the curve of the coastline, a road runs parallel to the shoreline, and is lined with more debris and driftwood, indicating that the area might be prone to strong tides or storm surges that deposit natural material inland.\n\nThe separation between the man-made environment and the natural shoreline is clear, with the town orderly placed while the beach remains wild and untamed. The contrast between the dense green forest against the community and the sandy beachfront illustrates diverse natural and human landscapes coexisting. The overall composition presents a serene though vivid picture of coastal life, environmental dynamics, and community layout.","title":"Center of the quinault indian reservation on the quinault river","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543427","554156","547984","557453","553765","550363","556954","556953","557463","543088","557504","554102","543423","543362","543438","543425"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["town","beach","driftwood","shoreline","beachfront","wave","separation","tide","community","dynamic"]}
