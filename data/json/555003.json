{"path":"555003.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up of a young conifer tree, focusing on its branches and nascent cones. The tree has numerous branches extending from a central point, each densely covered with needle-like leaves. The leaves are vibrant green, indicative of healthy growth. Along the branches, numerous small, bulbous cones are emerging. These cones are light green and clustered in groups, suggesting early developmental stages.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, consisting of darker green hues that suggest a forested environment. This blurring highlights the conifer's branches and cones, making them the clear focal point of the image. The lighting appears natural and diffused, with no harsh shadows, which enhances the detailed textures of the tree's needles and cones.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its detailed focus on botanical elements against a blurred natural background, conveys a serene yet vibrant depiction of young conifer growth in its natural habitat.","title":"New growth on a 10-year-old spruce on a south facing slope in olympic national timberland, Washington.
