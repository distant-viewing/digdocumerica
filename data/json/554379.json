{"path":"554379.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a car-related book stall in a fair or market setting. At the top of the image, there is a prominent, simple black and white sign reading \"CARBOOKS.\" Below this, a larger banner states \"KNOW YOUR CAR INSIDE-OUT.\"\n\nThe stall is filled with numerous books specifically about cars and related topics. The books are meticulously organized on shelves that cover the back and side walls of the booth. Each book is displayed with the cover or spine visible, and the covers show a variety of colors and designs, mainly reds, blues, and whites. Some recognizable themes on the books include car repair, model cars, and automotive guides.\n\nIn the foreground, two people, a man and a woman, are seen attending the booth. The woman, dressed in a dark top, seems to be engaged in operating a cash register or similar machine placed on a table, marking records or handling sales transactions. The man, wearing a red shirt and sunglasses, is observing something off-camera with a pensive look.\n\nThe overall composition and the items on display give the stall a very organized and professional appearance, focused entirely on automotive literature. The setting suggests a concentrated marketplace environment focused on specialized interests, designed to attract enthusiasts and buyers looking for automotive knowledge and collector items.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554375","554380","554381","554373","554372","553187","557918","554385","557864","554376","557927","549871","548219","552766","557905","557919"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["book","stall","booth","car","marketplace","cash","topic","spine","transaction","register"]}
