{"path":"545061.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a marine scene at a fishing pier. In the foreground, there is a cluttered wooden dock strewn with various fishing gear and marine supplies. The focus includes several open boxes: one is filled with fish, suggesting recent fishing activity, while others appear to be empty or hold other materials. Also visible are a red coiled hose, some scattered metal fittings, and parts of what appear to be marine machinery.\n\nIn the center and extending to the background, the dock leads to a body of water where a fishing boat named \"CITY BOY\" is moored. The boat, primarily white with red trim, is docked alongside a wooden pier, which has a building with a gabled roof at its end. \n\nThe overall scene captures the everyday working environment of a fishing pier, highlighting aspects of commercial fishing with a focus on the equipment and boats used. The setting appears calm, with overcast skies and still water reflecting elements of the dock and boat.","title":"Seafood processing plant","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["547562","547565","550306","542911","546998","548228","542914","546943","543465","548547","548037","546939","542873","547552","544993","545189"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","pier","dock","boat","fitting","hose","supply","fish","box","end"]}
