{"path":"546868.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a narrow water channel that flows through an area seemingly under development or modification. The stream is bordered by sloping embankments covered in grass or small vegetation on both sides. Adjacent to one embankment, there is visible construction or industrial activity as evidenced by the presence of machinery, which looks like an excavator, and piles of materials that could be gravel or construction debris.\n\nThe water in the channel appears murky and carries various forms of debris and algae, indicating a level of pollution or stagnation. The surface of the water reflects some sunlight, suggesting the time might be either morning or late afternoon based on the soft lighting.\n\nIn the background, beyond the machinery, you can observe an open landscape that suggests more ongoing construction or an industrial area due to the apparent lack of residential or commercial structures. The sky is clear and mostly cloudless, contributing to the bright and vivid colors captured in the image.","title":"Algae flourish in Herring Run.
