{"path":"543212.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a bustling amusement park scene. The photograph showcases a large, intricate wooden roller coaster, dominating the scene with its complex structure and tracks looping in the background. To the left of the roller coaster is a building with a sign marked \"Auto Scooter\", indicating a bumper cars attraction. Above and to the right, cable cars suspended by wires add another layer of interest, conveying either park visitors or sightseers across the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there are people relaxing on what appears to be a sandy beach area, lying on towels and enjoying the day. The diversity of activities available in this setting—from beach lounging to thrill rides—creates a vivid, dynamic recreational environment.\n\nThe scene is set against a clear blue sky, further highlighted by some green foliage to the left, presumably trees lining the perimeter of the park. The vibrant colors and the clear, sunny weather suggest a lively and welcoming atmosphere typical of a day out at an amusement park.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543227","551295","554455","551298","551297","545458","549717","543218","549708","551296","547902","551299","556296","557475","551325","551720"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["roller","park","amusement","beach","thrill","perimeter","attraction","bumper","towel","ride"]}
