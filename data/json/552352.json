{"path":"552352.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This is a photograph of multiple sailboats captured from a high aerial perspective. The backdrop of the image is a deep blue, almost black, suggesting it might be taken during twilight or with a specific filter to produce a darker background. The sailboats, scattered across the frame, vary in size and orientation, showcasing sails predominantly in shades of white with some displaying more colorful designs featuring red, blue, and yellow hues.\n\nThe sails are set against the dark background, giving a surreal or isolated appearance to each boat, emphasizing their presence and the expanse of dark water around them. There's no visible land or horizon line, enhancing the feeling of open water and the vastness of the sailing area. The image conveys a sense of peacefulness and the beauty of sailing, yet retains a mysterious or dramatic tone due to the color contrasts and the unusual perspective.","title":"Sailboats at sunset on Spinnaker Run in race on Commencement Bay, Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552351","552353","552355","552345","551540","544669","543305","549403","548498","547781","543936","544697","544667","552346","553991","548118"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["sailing","sail","sailboat","orientation","perspective","filter","peacefulness","white","twilight","vastness"]}
