{"path":"548711.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a marine scene, showing a vibrant coral ecosystem. The main focus is on a complex cluster of staghorn coral, characterized by its elongated, branching structures with multiple narrow points. The coral is colored in dark blue and green hues, possibly due to the underwater lighting and the depth at which the photo was taken.\n\nPeering out from the shadows within the coral, a small fish, possibly a damselfish or a type of grouper, is partially visible. Its presence adds a sense of life and intrigue to the scene, illustrating the biodiversity typically found within coral reefs. \n\nThe background of the photo is dark, emphasizing the coral and the fish as the primary subjects. This darkness also suggests that the photograph might have been taken at a considerable depth or in a less illuminated area of the reef, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the coral structure and its inhabitants.\n\nOverall, the composition and the limited light create a mysterious and somewhat ethereal snapshot of underwater life, highlighting the beauty and complexity of coral ecosystems.","title":"One of the many species of coral at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a few miles off Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548712","548710","548678","548717","548682","548719","548677","548679","548722","548723","548676","548681","548713","548721","548716","548680"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","reef","fish","ecosystem","intrigue","inhabitant","biodiversity","darkness","depth","complexity"]}
