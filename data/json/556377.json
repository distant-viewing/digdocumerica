{"path":"556377.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a group of coal miners at the end of their shift, walking along a muddy, industrial landscape, most likely exiting a mine. The miners are wearing typical mining gear, which includes dark, dirty work clothes, heavy boots, and safety helmets with attached headlamps. Several of them carry lunch boxes and large, white plastic jugs that likely contain water or another beverage.\n\nThe setting is industrial and somewhat bleak, with barren trees and a rocky, exposed hillside in the background, suggesting an environment that has been affected by mining activities. A railway track runs parallel to the path the miners are walking on, and mining equipment or structures can be seen in the midst of these workers.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of tiredness mixed with the camaraderie, as the miners appear to be conversing with each other while they walk, embodying a scene of daily routine and the tough, communal nature of mining work. The image captures a moment in the lives of these workers, highlighting the physical labor and environment associated with the mining industry.","title":"Miners who have just returned to the surface of Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia and will be replaced by men on the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. Many of the miners carry their own water into work rather than use that provided by the company. They also use chewing tobacco while in the mines because they are not allowed to smoke underground.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556338","556337","556340","556393","556375","556374","556372","556392","556373","556348","556376","556359","556339","556363","556346","556347"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["miner","mining","walk","worker","jug","lunch","embody","headlamp","camaraderie","beverage"]}
