{"path":"556286.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph depicts a parade or ceremonial procession occurring on a wide street. The image is taken from an elevated angle looking down onto the road which shows clear road markings, including dashed white lines and a solid yellow line in the center.\n\nIn the procession, there are two lines of marchers dressed in ceremonial military uniforms, identifiable by their dark jackets, white belts, and tall, white ceremonial hats. Each member is carrying what appears to be a rifle with a bayonet attached. The procession is flanked on both sides by individuals in different uniforms: on one side there are figures in light khaki uniforms and white hats, while on the other side there are figures in dark suits and hats. These flanking figures could be officers or dignitaries.\n\nThe road itself is mostly empty aside from the procession, suggesting that the area may have been cleared specifically for this event. The background is out of focus, emphasizing the marchers on the street.","title":"The kadats of america, Chicago's most loved young black drill team, performing in one of many area parades.
