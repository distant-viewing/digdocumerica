{"path":"545498.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, presumably taken in the past due to the older model vehicles and style of signage. The scene is set on a moderately busy street lined with several cars and trucks typical of vintage American makes from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s based on their design.\n\nMultiple traffic signals hang over the street, showing a green light which suggests traffic is moving along the road. In the foreground, a prominent green car is in the center of the frame, adding a pop of color against the more muted city background.\n\nThe street itself is flanked by various buildings which appear to be a mix of commercial and possibly residential structures. Notable signage includes one large sign reading \"BOT. GARDEN,\" suggesting the presence of a botanical garden nearby. Below it, a hanging street banner reads \"BIRMINGHAM GREEN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT,\" indicating a community or environmental initiative.\n\nIn the backdrop, several high-rise buildings add to the dense urban environment. One visibly taller structure has minimalistic details and contributes to the notion of a mixed-use urban area, perhaps with offices or apartments.\n\nOverall, the scene captured is vivid with city life, depicting a moment in time in an American city with historical context evident through the vehicles and architectural styles.","title":"Reminder to all citizens","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550139","547369","547651","551135","549872","545216","556724","544793","549886","554297","549679","546743","546626","556709","549856","549882"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","city","signage","notion","hang","traffic","read","pop","past","apartment"]}
