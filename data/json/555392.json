{"path":"555392.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph displays a collection of handwritten notes pinned onto a dark-colored board, each note containing brief text entries. These notes appear to be used for recording information or reminders, and each is attached to the board with either green or white push pins. Several notes are visibly overlapping, and some edges are torn, suggesting frequent handling or adjustments.\n\nThe notes are written in different handwriting styles, suggesting multiple authors. The content of the notes seems to be related to numerical data, dates, and short descriptions or instructions, possibly indicating record-keeping or task assignments in a work environment. For example, some notes mention quantities and tank sizes, possibly in an industrial or logistical context. Dates such as “9/10”, “9/20”, and “9/17” might indicate deadlines or dates of note. The specifics of names, addresses, or locations in some texts suggest they relate to specific tasks, items, or places relevant to the users of this board.\n\nThe photograph itself has a certain vintage feel, likely due to its color saturation and the style of the notes and handwriting, which might suggest it was taken several decades ago. Overall, the image portrays a functional use of space for organization and communication, likely in a professional setting.\n","title":"When the major home oil dealer ran out of fuel a special board was activated for emergency deliveries.
