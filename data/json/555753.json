{"path":"555753.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a winding river flanked by extensive, diverse terrains. The river dominates the landscape, meandering through the scene with broad, curved bends that reflect the sky. The terrain varies on either side of the river with patches of emerald green vegetation, alongside large areas of earth-toned land, likely suggestive of land either under cultivation or development.\n\nWhat appears to be a road runs parallel to sections of the river, indicating human presence and development in the area. The landscape contains multiple bodies of water both large and small, signifying a possibly marshy or flood-prone region. Along the edges of the river, patches of darker green suggest thicker vegetation which could be natural relief areas or managed parklands.\n\nOn the horizon, a light haze mutes the transition between land and sky, implying humidity or dust in the air which is typical in riverine and developed landscapes. The composition of the photograph, with the river curving through the center, leads the viewerâ€™s eye along its path, emphasizing the natural and human-shaped dynamics of the region.","title":"Destruction of wetlands at Staten Island, New York. Lands adjacent to the Bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have direct impact upon the environment of the coastal waters. Stress factors affecting the Bight include air and water pollution, destruction of wetlands which are nurseries for marine life, and ocean dumping of municipal and industrial wastes.","placename":"Staten Island (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Staten Island, New York","nn1":["550392","549081","546351","547227","550623","557506","550885","549262","550616","547990","548916","550524","550545","552838","550593","555575"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","land","humidity","relief","bend","development","region","flood","cultivation","dynamic"]}
