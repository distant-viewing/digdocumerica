{"path":"543430.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a breathtaking aerial view of a coastal landscape. The scene features a rugged coastline where the deep blue sea meets a sandy shore, edged by cliffs and gentle waves. Along the shoreline, several areas of rocky outcrops project into the ocean, creating small bays and inlets.\n\nBehind the beach, the land quickly rises into a series of dramatic mountains and rolling hills that dominate the landscape. The mountains display a variety of earthy colors, ranging from deep browns to ochres and muted greens, suggesting a mix of bare rock and sparse vegetation. These mountains are creased with numerous gullies and ridges, providing a textured and dynamic backdrop.\n\nIn the middle section of the photo, nestled between the mountains and the coast, lies a green valley that appears to be used for agriculture. Patches of fields in different shades of green suggest cultivation, perhaps small farms or pasture lands.\n\nThe sky above the picturesque landscape is partly cloudy, with large white clouds casting shadows on the mountains, adding to the depth and contrast of the scene. The lighting from the sun, likely setting or rising, enriches the colors of the landscape, giving the entire scene a warm, golden glow.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is rich in natural beauty, showcasing the dramatic interaction between land and sea along with the rugged terrain, made even more striking by the natural light and cloud shadows.","title":"California -- Monterey","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["543328","543434","543432","543051","545934","543429","543300","543435","553995","543045","553983","543424","554052","554171","554020","543088"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["mountain","land","gully","sea","pasture","inlet","cultivation","coast","outcrop","project"]}
