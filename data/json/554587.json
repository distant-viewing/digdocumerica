{"path":"554587.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a flowering shrub with distinct botanical features. The image is focused primarily on two clusters of flowers that appear prominently against a darker, blurred background. Each cluster contains both open white blooms and smaller, unopened buds with potential flowers. The open flowers feature four white petals with a faint hint of texture, and they surround a central cluster of greenish buds poised to bloom.\n\nThe leaves of the shrub are large with a vivid green color and a slightly rugged texture, indicative of veins running through them. Each leaf displays a serrated edge, and the leaves' arrangement is opposite, with a prominent central vein that is darker green than the rest of the leaf surface.\n\nThe background, blurred for effect, suggests a natural setting, perhaps a lightly shadowed area under larger trees or in a garden, emphasizing the brightness and detail of the flowers and leaves in the foreground. The lighting in the photo is soft, likely natural sunlight filtering through an overhead canopy, which highlights the textures and details of the plant's features. The overall composition focuses on the beauty and intricate details of the plant, showcasing its natural environment and the stages of its blooming cycle.","title":"White hobble (Viburnum alnifolium), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554576","553366","545720","544875","545726","553368","554595","545695","553361","547613","554590","554575","554745","557500","542970","554574"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","bud","vein","cluster","leaf","leave","shrub","detail","texture","cycle"]}
