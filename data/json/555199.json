{"path":"555199.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph presents a rugged and desolated mountainous terrain with notable features indicating some form of natural disaster, likely a landslide. In the foreground, there's a large accumulation of debris consisting of numerous broken tree trunks, branches, and scattered rocks. These materials appear weathered and splintered, strewn haphazardly across the ground, suggesting that they were forcefully displaced.\n\nA narrow, unpaved road curves through the scene, prominently visible on the left side as it clings precariously to the steep mountainside. The road appears dusty and is edged by steep, bare cliffs on its left, while a precipitous drop to the valley is evident on its right. Small sections of guardrails, partially damaged or entirely missing, hint at the intensity of the disruptive event that passed through.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dimly viewed mountain range, partially obscured by a low-hanging mist or fog, with a sparse cover of trees or vegetation that seems to have also suffered from severe disturbances. The overall color palette of the image is quite subdued, with earthy tones of brown and gray, contrasting slightly with the dark greenish hues of the distant forest under the overcast sky.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of isolation and aftermath, capturing a moment of quiet following what must have been a dynamic and possibly catastrophic event.","title":"Erosion in the olympic national timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555103","555207","556445","549119","555089","543721","554548","555872","551064","545254","555087","543718","555136","555158","543600","545264"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["landslide","mountainside","guardrail","event","drop","cling","disaster","accumulation","disturbance","aftermath"]}
