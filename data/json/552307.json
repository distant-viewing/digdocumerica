{"path":"552307.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures an older man holding a large clam in his right hand. He appears to be a worker based on his attire: a yellow hard hat, which is spattered with mud, and a work jacket in muted green and tan colors, also covered in grime. His face shows signs of age, with prominent wrinkles and an inward smile, suggesting a sense of satisfaction or pride. His hand and the clam are both covered in mud, indicating he might have just harvested it.\n\nThe man's work jacket appears to be layered over a plaid shirt. Additionally, he's using his left hand to hold a tool, which is partially visible and looks to be a digging or clamming tool. The man is situated outdoors, evident from the out-of-focus natural background in muted blues and grays, possibly indicating a coastal or wetland environment.\n\nThe composition focuses on the man's expressive face and the clam, with a shallow depth of field blurring out the background and emphasizing the subject and his immediate action. The lighting and color saturation give the image a vivid quality, highlighting textures and colorsâ€”muddy yellows, earthy browns, and subtle shades of the man's clothing. This photograph not only documents a specific action but also evokes a narrative about the man's connection to his environment and labor.","title":"Ray Longmire of Olympia with a geoduck clam he has dug from the Dosewallips tide flats on the Hood Canal at Brinnon.
