{"path":"547471.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal scene, vividly depicting a tide pool area with dark, jagged rocks protruding at various angles. The rocks are wet, likely from the splashing waves, and have a glossy sheen that enhances their dark hue, forming strong contrasts against the lighter elements in the image. Clusters of seaweed and small pools of seawater envelop the rocks, adding texture and depth to the scene.\n\nNear the base of the rocks, the seaweed is thick and lush, primarily in shades of dark brown, indicating it might be a type of kelp or similar marine plant. The seaweed is interspersed with what appears to be smaller marine debris and scattered pebbles, reflecting light and adding varied color flecks to the predominantly dark foreground.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is visible with waves breaking against more distantly situated rock formations, those too are dark and rugged, possibly indicating a continuity of the geological features seen in the foreground. The sky above the sea is partially visible showing a mix of cloud and clear sky, suggesting changeable weather conditions typical of coastal regions.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo underlines the natural rugged beauty of a tide pool ecosystem, highlighting the textures and colors of the marine plants and the solid forms of the rocks. The lighting and the wet surfaces amplify the raw and somewhat moody aesthetic of the scene.","title":"Rocky shore on Rhode Island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543183","543135","547486","543292","543295","543984","543289","545122","543142","543306","543243","543309","543297","545173","543092","549353"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","pool","seaweed","tide","wafe","marine","fleck","continuity","underline","amplify"]}
