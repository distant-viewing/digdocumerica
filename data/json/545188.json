{"path":"545188.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on the deck of a fishing boat named \"King Fisher\" from Depoe Bay, in operation by Tradewinds. The boat, viewed from above, shows a top deck painted in vibrant red and blue, with white accents and seating areas arranged around its perimeter.\n\nThere are four individuals on the boat. One person, at the stern, is seemingly handling equipment or perhaps organizing gear near an open compartment that might serve as storage or a fish hold. This individual is dressed in a blue jacket and dark pants. Another person, dressed in a white jacket and dark pants, is standing near the center of the boat, facing forward, possibly holding onto a railing or involved in a conversation with the third person, who is dressed similarly in a white jacket. The fourth individual is wearing a dark jacket and is engaged in an activity involving ropes or gear towards the forepart of the boat.\n\nThe surrounding water is calm and a dull grey in color, suggesting overcast weather conditions. The overall feel of the image conveys a sense of preparation or winding down from activities, commonly associated with fishing or boating operations. The setting is purely maritime, focused on the immediate environment of the boat and its occupants. The composition of the photo, with its elevated angle, places an emphasis on the layout of the boat and the activities of the people on board, capturing a moment typical of a fishing expedition or routine maintenance at sea.","title":"Oregon--Depoe Bay","placename":"Depoe Bay (Or.)","location":"Depoe Bay, Oregon","nn1":["545056","545093","547551","545178","545185","554200","555719","545158","546053","547552","555802","547562","548503","546939","547559","547564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","jacket","fishing","deck","gear","person","organi","expedition","perimeter","viewed"]}
