{"path":"547067.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"In this photograph, there's an elderly man seated on a park bench. He is dressed warmly in a dark knee-length coat and a brown fedora hat, pairing these with dark trousers, white socks, and black shoes. The man has a distinctively engaged expression as he reaches up with his right hand, possibly waving at someone or something off-camera. His left hand rests on a newspaper placed beside him on the bench, with the visible headline reading \"CLEANUP SALE.\" \n\nThe setting is an open park area during what appears to be late afternoon, judging by the lighting and shadows. The background features a well-maintained grassy field, dotted with a few trees and a line of parked cars in the distance. There's a hint of a suburban environment beyond the park, suggested by sparse architectural elements. The serene park atmosphere contrasts with the dynamic gesture of the man, adding life and narrative interest to the scene.","title":"Hailing a friend in montrose harbor","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["548615","549321","547355","552722","553208","553176","551397","552523","547816","557713","554845","543037","552727","551940","555991","548302"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["park","bench","headline","fedora","sock","newspaper","knee","sale","hand","judge"]}
