{"path":"542761.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a busy highway, specifically showing the notable signage for the Interstate 405, known as the San Diego Freeway, in California. The large, prominent signs indicate directions for going north towards Santa Monica and San Diego. Below these signs, there are directional arrows aligned with the lanes to guide traffic accordingly.\n\nIn the foreground on the left, there is a parked car marked as an \"Air Pollution Control Vehicle Patrol\" vehicle, suggesting that it is used by a governmental agency or department involved with monitoring or managing environmental or traffic-related matters. This car has the distinctive black and white coloring typically associated with law enforcement or public service vehicles.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, there is a merging traffic sign, cautioning drivers about incoming vehicles from another access point.\n\nThe highway itself is bustling, with several vehicles in view including a prominent red truck carrying what appears to be cargo or equipment on its flatbed, as well as another dark vehicle in motion behind the traffic sign.\n\nIn the background, the environment consists of a clear sky, utility poles, and greenery lining the sides of the highway, typical of urban freeway outskirts. The scenery indicates a well-traveled, functional urban transportation route, critical for commuter and transit activities in the area.","title":"Air pollution control department officers checking for violators on highway.","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["547785","542760","553018","556785","547823","553720","552001","555451","549902","547811","550182","546686","549890","545455","556194","542755"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","highway","vehicle","sign","freeway","enforcement","law","caution","flatbed","arrow"]}
