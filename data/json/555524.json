{"path":"555524.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph captures an older man engaged in the process of collecting sap from a maple tree for syrup production, set in a snowy woodland scene. The man, likely in his 60s or 70s, wears a yellow shirt, gray pants, and a plaid cap. He bends slightly as he handles two large metal buckets, suspended from a yoke that he carries over his shoulders, traditionally used to transport the sap. He appears to be either placing the buckets on the ground or preparing to pick them up.\n\nThe setting is a forest, with numerous trees visible in the background, and the ground is covered in snow, indicating that it is winter or early spring, which is the typical season for sap collection. Directly next to the man is a maple tree with a tapping device installed, connected to a metal bucket placed on the snow-covered ground to collect the dripping sap. The sunlight filtering through the trees hints at clear weather, casting shadows and giving a vibrant contrast to the scene. This image not only documents a traditional activity but also evokes the serene and labor-intensive nature of rural life and self-sustenance.","title":"This dairy farmer near Randolph center, Vermont, averages about 400 gallons of maple syrup each spring.
