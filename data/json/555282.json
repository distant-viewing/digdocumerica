{"path":"555282.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil evening scene, characterized by a striking pink and purple hue that bathes the entire image, likely due to the timing around dusk. In the background, a city skyline forms a silhouetted, yet distinctive, profile against the softly lit sky. The skyline features various high-rise buildings including prominent twin towers standing taller than the other structures, and a selection of buildings of various sizes and architectures including spires and modernist structures.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a large water body, presumably a river, which reflects the colors of the sky and enhances the serene mood. On the river, a tugboat is visible; it appears to be in motion, heading toward the left side of the frame, leaving a trail in the water.\n\nThe scene is further enriched with the presence of small buoys in the water and subtle textures on the water's surface, suggesting calm but steady movement. The overall composition of the photo, with its elements of water, industrial activity, and urban architecture, juxtaposed against the natural beauty of a sunset sky, evokes a sense of quiet endurance and the passage of day into night.","title":"Lower Manhattan skyline in New York City taken from the Port of Newark, New Jersey","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552264","552263","556188","548339","546392","550758","555716","547110","552265","556189","546114","553788","551210","547102","543965","543119"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["skyline","selection","timing","water","buoy","spire","tugboat","architecture","enrich","river"]}
