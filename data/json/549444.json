{"path":"549444.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene of a group of people at what appears to be a picnic or a casual gathering in a forested area. The setting is surrounded by tall pine trees, providing a dense and green backdrop to the activities depicted.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman is engaged in serving or preparing food. She is dressed in a red blouse and a headscarf, adding a vibrant touch to the scene. She is focused on pouring a sauce or a similar condiment over a large tray of food, which seems to contain a mix of chopped ingredients.\n\nAround her, several other individuals can be observed. To the left, a man wearing a cowboy hat and a patterned shirt stands, while another man, donning a red plaid shirt, is partially visible behind the first. To the right of the woman, a man with a yellow cap and jacket appears to be watching the food preparation. Another partially visible individual is on the extreme right.\n\nIn terms of objects and other elements, there is a variety of picnic essentials visible. There's a large blue cooler and multiple containers including jars and cans, possibly containing ingredients or beverages. Coffee mugs and a stack of red plastic cups also suggest the serving of drinks. The picnic area is organized with a makeshift table setup, likely boards or planks laid over something to create a flat surface for food preparation and serving.\n\nThis scene communicates a relaxed, communal outdoor meal in a rustic setting, highlighting a moment of leisure and social interaction among the group.","title":"Lunch stop for members of Snake River raft trip through Hells Canyon.
