{"path":"547645.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image features a row of beach houses lining a sandy beach area. The photograph captures an array of similar yet distinctive wooden houses, each with different exterior color schemes and designs. Most of the houses have gabled roofs, and at least one has a unique A-frame style. There is visible weathering on the wood which suggests these structures have withstood various environmental elements over time.\n\nFronting each house are wooden decks or porches, equipped with railings, and some have stairs leading down towards the underlying beach. The houses are built on stilts, likely as a precaution against flooding and to provide a better view of the surrounding area.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a field of tall beach grass that appears dry and somewhat overgrown, indicative of coastal vegetation. The sky is notably clear with a vivid blue tone, suggesting it might be a sunny day. The environment suggests a tranquil seaside locale, typically used for vacation or leisure purposes.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, the perspective taken from the ground level through the beach grass, adds an element of depth and natural framing to the scene of the houses and their architectural features.","title":"Housing on dune of barrier beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547641","547633","547644","547636","547567","549987","543361","547030","543362","553967","551164","545052","545108","545110","557523","553928"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["house","beach","precaution","stilt","vacation","porche","flooding","seaside","gable","locale"]}
