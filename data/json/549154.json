{"path":"549154.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, rural scene. In the foreground, a white, wooden fence stretches from the left to the right side of the image, guiding the viewer's eye into the distance. The fence sits on lush green grass and is adorned intermittently with pink flowers.\n\nBehind the fence on the left side, a large tree with a divided trunk features prominently, its branches laden with dense green foliage. In the middle distance, there's a yellow house with a sloped roof and a visible dark door. It's partially obscured by the foliage of the tree and another coniferous tree beside it.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured by the multiple trees planted around the fenced yard. The overall atmosphere suggests a peaceful, well-tended domestic rural environment, possibly a farm or a country home. The image is rich in natural colors like green and earthy tones, contrasting with the bright white of the fence and the soft yellow of the house.","title":"Roy Fly Ranch near Sarpy Basin.
