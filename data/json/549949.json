{"path":"549949.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a landfill or waste disposal area. In the foreground, a garbage truck is actively dumping rubbish onto a large pile of waste. The truck is colored black and bears the message \"HELP KEEP OUR VILLAGE CLEAN\" in white lettering. The side of the truck is visible, and the front part of the upper dumping mechanism is raised, allowing trash to spill over into the landfill.\n\nA man, possibly a worker, wearing a dark uniform, is visible near the front of the truck. He is interacting with the vehicle, possibly controlling the dumping process or preparing to do another task related to waste management.\n\nThe pile of waste where the trash is being dumped contains a mix of various discarded items such as boxes, bags, metal scraps, and other unidentifiable debris, depicting a typical scene of municipal waste.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears barren and dusty, typical of a landfill area. However, beyond the immediate area of the landfill, there are trees and a mountain range, adding a natural and more serene backdrop to the scene which contrasts sharply with the foreground activity. The sky is clear and blue. This depiction showcases an environmental management activity, emphasizing waste disposal in a designated area, likely aimed at keeping the surrounding community clean as indicated by the truck's signage.","title":"Dumping garbage at the Croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549749","549746","549945","549940","549936","546761","547208","549743","543821","543828","546257","549942","546246","549792","554541","548210"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","landfill","truck","dumping","disposal","dump","keep","trash","management","pile"]}
