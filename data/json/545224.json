{"path":"545224.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a series of makeshift, weathered markers standing in a muddy tidal flat. Two prominent markers, positioned in the left and right foreground, display square signs with the inscription \"NO\" visible above a blotted, indistinguishable text. Each sign is affixed atop a thin, vertical pole that appears weathered and slightly crooked.\n\nThe scenery also shows other similar but unmarked poles, scattered unevenly throughout the area, sticking out from the mud at various angles. The surface of the flat is uneven and water-soaked, reflecting the light and creating a pattern of wet and dry patches of mud and shallow pools of water.\n\nIn the background, a dense formation of fluffy, cumulus clouds fills the sky, suggesting an expansive atmosphere. There appear to be no structures or people present, emphasizing a barren and somewhat desolate natural environment. The color palette of the photo is mostly subdued, with muted tones of blue, gray, and earthy browns, conveying a serene yet stark coastal landscape.","title":"Oyster beds of Willapa Bay at low tide","placename":"Washington (State)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548248","544220","544687","545680","549453","545183","544729","545109","545294","556943","546109","552236","545676","543108","555382","552147"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["marker","mud","flat","cumulus","soak","pole","affix","inscription","stick","pool"]}
