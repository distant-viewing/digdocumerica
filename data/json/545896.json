{"path":"545896.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This aerial photograph showcases a serene suburban or rural scenario. The composition is dominated by a large water body, appearing like a curved, flowing river or large canal on the left, bending around a lush green landscape. On the right side of the image, adjacent to the water, you can see two residential buildings. One is a larger home with a symmetrically curved driveway leading to it from the nearby road, landscaped with neat grass and surrounded by several trees, possibly shading the home and drive. A smaller building, possibly a garage or guest house, stands slightly separated from the main home, again surrounded by well-maintained grass and foliage.\n\nIn front of the homes, closer to the bottom of the image and closer to the viewer, there are two more buildings that seem more functional, perhaps related to maintenance or storage. The entire area is richly green, indicating a well-maintained or naturally fertile area. The largest building features what appears to be a small patio or courtyard.\n\nTo the left, a patch of land extends into the water, almost forming a peninsula, with patches of greenery and brown dirt, suggesting either a dry period or construction activity. Across the water body, structural elements protrude into the water, possibly for controlling water flow or related to a bridge.\n\nOverall, the scene is tranquil and residential, isolated enough to suggest privacy and a close-knit community or family space, with ample space allocated to each building and lots of natural landscape surrounding each structure.","title":"Brays bayou - concrete creeks","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["556994","556993","556981","556972","558045","547256","556964","558059","544503","546831","550757","544558","547264","552232","558060","551523"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["home","courtyard","guest","water","patio","maintain","flow","building","privacy","peninsula"]}
