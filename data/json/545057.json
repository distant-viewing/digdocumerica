{"path":"545057.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a seascape scene with a central focus on a white cabin cruiser boat navigating across choppy blue water. The boat features a prominent cabin with windows and is topped with various maritime required equipment, such as an antenna and multiple protrusions that likely serve navigational and communication purposes. There are several people visible on the boat, though due to the distance, individual details are not clearly discernible.\n\nIn the background, a distant coastline with low hills or mountains stretches horizontally across the image. The terrain appears somewhat forested and is dotted with possibly small buildings or structures, indicating a populated area. Above this landscape, the sky is a major highlight, showcasing vast, billowing clouds that range in color from bright white to shades of gray, indicating a dynamic weather atmosphere typical of a maritime environment.\n\nThe photograph seems to capture a moment of leisure or travel on the water, with a serene yet vivid depiction of natural elements surrounding the mariners. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility mingled with the inherent dynamism of open water and shifting skies.","title":"Gill net fishing on the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["552050","544667","543402","546317","555718","549380","545156","554101","557813","548733","548516","555715","545900","542903","546049","555693"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["cabin","boat","cruiser","protrusion","dynamism","antenna","seascape","communication","depiction","highlight"]}
