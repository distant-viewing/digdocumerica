{"path":"549191.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph portrays a dusky or twilight scene of an expansive, flat landscape, which appears to be a mix of grassland and mild undulating terrain. The sky is vast, filled with a gradient of blues and purples, suggesting late evening light. There are some clouds scattered lightly across the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a series of fences and unpaved roads can be seen. These elements add to the rural, undeveloped nature of the area. The middle ground hosts several distinct but distant smokestacks emitting white and grey smoke or steam into the air. These smokestacks suggest an industrial activity in an otherwise natural and open landscape. Between the foreground and the smokestacks, the terrain is sparsely vegetated, consisting primarily of grasses and small bushes.\n\nThere are no visible people or animals in the image; the focus is largely on the contrast between the industrial features and the natural environment. The quiet, almost solemn atmosphere is underscored by the muted colors and the expansive, uninterrupted horizon. The presence of the industrial elements in such a landscape may evoke themes of development, environmental impact, or isolation.","title":"This 750-megawatt power plant, located on the North Platte River, is part of the massive strip-mining development planned for the Powder River region.","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543668","545020","547539","544676","545048","551061","557381","549965","552188","554807","545239","545989","548850","548404","544173","545971"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","grassland","purple","gradient","terrain","twilight","steam","animal","bush","fence"]}
