{"path":"551271.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two adults, a man and a woman, captured in a relaxed, outdoor residential setting. The man is seated on a patio chair, facing slightly towards the camera with a calm and content expression. He is dressed casually in a light blue polo shirt, patterned shorts, and sporty white shoes with black accents. His arms rest comfortably on the armrests of the chair, and he has one leg crossed over the other, highlighting a relaxed posture.\n\nThe woman stands to his right and is partially cropped from the image; she appears to be in mid-conversation or movement. She wears a light green, sleeveless top and white pants, accessorized with a thin belt and dark sunglasses. She is holding a glass that appears to contain a white, possibly alcoholic, beverage. Her stance and facial expression suggest a casual and comfortable interaction.\n\nThe surroundings indicate they are on a wooden deck with a natural, lush backdrop of trees and foliage, suggesting they might be in a forested or garden area. A stone chimney structure is partially visible behind the woman, and the deck is adorned with small potted plants with bright red flowers, adding color and life to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition has a casual and inviting atmosphere, highlighting a moment of leisure in a natural and serene setting.","title":"Guests at a party given by a retired advertising executive at his home at the \"land of the fifth season\" development, an affluent residential enclave in lake ozark","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551272","551273","551827","557779","554222","554900","557363","548614","557031","557030","548620","544219","554494","546209","543511","545232"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["deck","chair","adorned","woman","patio","inviting","white","polo","pot","accessorize"]}
