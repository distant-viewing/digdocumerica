{"path":"557926.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a car wash on a rainy day. A man dressed in a light-blue uniform is kneeling while cleaning the back of a vintage, shiny blue Volkswagen Beetle, which has its trunk lid open. In the background, a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a light jacket, is standing and observing the man's work. \n\nThe setting appears to be a garage or a service station with a roof extending over the car wash area, providing shelter from the rain. Beyond the station, we can see a residential street lined with houses and parked cars, including more Volkswagen Beetles visible in the distance.\n\nThe photo conveys a sense of everyday life and routine maintenance, enhanced by the gloomy, overcast weather which suggests a damp and cool atmosphere. On the right side of the frame, an oil dispenser or tool cabinet with a red front is partially visible, adding to the industrial feel of the setting. Puddles on the ground reflect the ongoing or recent rainfall, contributing to the scene's wet conditions.","title":"Service station mechanic adjusts the engine for a young woman whose vehicle had failed the emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Although the station does not have the same type of exhaust analyzer that the city uses, he will be able to adjust the carburetor to pass inspection. Emissions testing has been in effect for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons since January, 1975.
