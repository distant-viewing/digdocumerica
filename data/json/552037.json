{"path":"552037.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely taken during the twilight hours due to the soft lighting and long shadows. The composition centers on a large industrial building complex with multiple structures, emitting white smoke from a tall stack which contributes to a sense of ongoing industrial activity.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a well-maintained grassy area with signs posted prominently: one directed to \"Overlook Parking,\" suggestive of a viewing or vantage point nearby, and another indicating a direction to \"Niagara Falls,\" which could suggest the geographical location or perhaps a direction to a notable landmark or destination. Additionally, there's a stop sign adjacent to the directional signs, placed at a junction likely in a road within the industrial complex or a nearby area.\n\nTowards the right of the photograph, towering electrical transmission towers emphasize the industrial theme, carrying multiple power lines. These structures accentuate the industrialization and the functional infrastructure supporting the facility.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky, contributing to the vivid contrast against the industrial foreground, enhancing the visibility of the smoke and other elements in the environment. The overall scene captured in this image portrays a blend of industrial activity and structured landscape amidst natural lighting conditions.","title":"Industrial plant on Niagara Falls parkway","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["557374","550168","546122","543011","557225","543813","550982","557293","547200","556501","544691","542999","551026","552190","544173","557294"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["direction","complex","junction","tower","smoke","transmission","sign","industrialization","destination","landmark"]}
