{"path":"550276.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a slightly disheveled beach scene with various elements that suggest environmental concern. In the foreground, a chain-link fence crossing the image horizontally is a prominent feature, with a warning sign attached that reads, \"WARNING THIS WATER IS POLLUTED WITH HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES SWIMMING AND WADING ARE PROHIBITED BY ORDER OF CITY OF CLEVELAND.\" This indicates the beach is likely unsafe for recreational use.\n\nBeyond the fence, the sandy beach is littered with debris including branches and miscellaneous trash. Noteworthy objects on the sand include a large metal drum and what appears to be a paint container, further emphasizing pollution issues.\n\nToward the right of the image, a lone individual stands near the water's edge, seeming to look out over the lake. The person's presence adds a human element to the scene, juxtaposed against the environmental degradation.\n\nThe beach stretches along the edge of a body of water, likely a lake given the context of Cleveland. The water seems calm with gentle waves lapping at the shore. In the distance, industrial structures are faintly visible, contributing to an overall industrial backdrop, which might explain the pollution.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast weather condition which adds to the gloomy, neglected feel of the scene. This photograph effectively highlights environmental neglect and human impact on natural settings, framed by a day under cloudy skies.","title":"White City beach sign warns against swimming in polluted Lake Erie.
