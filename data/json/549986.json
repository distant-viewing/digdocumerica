{"path":"549986.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a serene winter scene in a park setting. In the foreground, two large, leafless trees with a dark colored bark stand prominently, framing the image on the left side. Between these trees, a paved path curves gently from the foreground into the background of the scene. On this path, a pair of individuals seems to be enjoying a leisurely walk together.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo shows several small groups of people engaged in various activities. On the left, close to a frozen pond which reflects a bright, pale blue sky, a group of people sits on some rocks, apparently in conversation. Near the center and right areas of the pond, others are ice skating, adding a dynamic element to the scene. \n\nIn the background, the city skyline provides a stark contrast to the natural elements in the foreground. Several high-rise buildings, including a notably tall, cylindrical building, suggest an urban environment. The architecture appears modern, and some buildings are partially obscured by the trees that dot the park landscape. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is calm and leisurely, offering a glimpse of city life harmoniously coexisting with a peaceful park setting. The color tones are somewhat muted, with a dominant palette of blues and grays, hinting at the chilliness of a winter day.","title":"Ice skating in the public garden","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551776","547099","550051","547784","544808","553469","551767","550075","546535","549490","549516","550014","548406","551550","557257","557271"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["park","pond","winter","path","walk","city","ice","group","bark","pair"]}
