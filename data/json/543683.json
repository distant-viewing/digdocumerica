{"path":"543683.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene of a cowboy's perspective as he brands or marks a calf. The image is taken from an overhead angle, giving a clear view of the man’s hands and the top of his head. The man is wearing a brown wide-brimmed cowboy hat and is dressed in a dark jacket, indicating that the task is being carried out outdoors, likely in cooler weather or as protection from the sun.\n\nIn the foreground, you can see the dusty, soil-rich ground, with small rocks and bits of dry vegetation scattered. The calf, which is mostly outside of the frame, appears to be on the ground, with only its hindquarters visibly featuring a freshly branded mark — a cross inside a circle, symbolizing some form of ranch identification.\n\nThe environment suggests a rural setting, typically used for cattle ranching. The ground is barren and earthy, which is characteristic of an outdoor livestock handling area. The photograph likely aims to capture the authentic and routine practices in ranch life, highlighting the traditional method of livestock management.","title":"Ranch hand bRands calf","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553106","552575","543686","548952","548959","553104","552569","552677","553110","554949","543776","552565","543779","549033","553108","552564"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["calf","ranch","cowboy","livestock","ranching","identification","method","cattle","circle","cross"]}
