{"path":"554694.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a rustic scene dominated by a large wooden building with a gabled roof. The building has a textured wooden exterior, painted in a light color, with dark shingles on its pitches. There are several skylights or window features on the upper part of the roof, suggesting loft or attic spaces. In front of the structure, there's a small, covered entryway that leads into the building.\n\nTo the left of the image, a man stands near the building's porch. He is wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, and appears to be of middle age. His pose suggests he may be taking a break or overseeing something. Adjacent to him, parked next to the building, there's a vintage Chevrolet pickup truck, painted in a teal or sea-green color. The truck's design places it sometime in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe background shows a dense tree line consisting of tall conifers, marking the boundary behind the building. This backdrop provides an impression of a wooded or rural setting, adding to the serene and secluded atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe scene is well-lit, seemingly under the soft light of either morning or late afternoon, adding a gentle and calm quality to the image. The setting, the attire of the man, and the style of the vehicle collectively suggest a time frame around the mid-20th century, possibly in a forested or mountainous area.","title":"Main building at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Newcomb (N.Y.)","location":"Newcomb, New York","nn1":["555295","557671","554561","556766","558101","546149","543588","557691","546142","544865","547658","551111","558109","544824","545137","550019"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["building","skylight","truck","entryway","teal","century","oversee","shingle","conifer","pickup"]}
