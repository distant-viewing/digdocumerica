{"path":"548945.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a vividly landscaped shot featuring both natural and human-made features. At the forefront of the image, a large body of water separates two major landmasses, with a bridge crossing from one side to the other. The water is dark and reflects the bright blue of the sky.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the water, the land is rugged and sandy, displaying sparse patches of vegetation. This area appears mostly undeveloped except for a few structures and parked vehicles near the shoreline. The roads curve gracefully, following the contour of the lake.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, the land is more developed. This area features residential or small commercial buildings clustered together closely, surrounded by roads that provide orderly access through the region. These buildings are compact, suggesting a small community. In comparison to the left side, this side has more trees and landscaping around the properties.\n\nIn the background, the terrain transitions into a rugged mountain range with peaks visible on the horizon, giving a vivid sense of the region's topography.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures the contrasting development between two lake shores, connected by infrastructure, yet each retaining a unique character in harmony with the natural surroundings.","title":"London Bridge, transplanted here in 1971, crosses arm of Havasu Lake, which is fed by Colorado River.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["556966","548918","555684","556919","547098","549504","556951","550757","552594","553792","556915","552243","556937","548941","557532","557501"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["side","comparison","lake","crossing","region","harmony","landmass","land","topography","property"]}
