{"path":"546206.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted canal or drainage ditch. The water in the canal is a milky, turbid white, possibly indicating chemical contamination or pollution. The canal is flanked on both sides by dense vegetation, including tall grasses and bushes, which appear somewhat overgrown.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial scene. A cement plant or factory with a large storage silo painted in white and a cylindrical structure is visible. This facility is surrounded by a high concrete wall. Several power lines run in parallel on the right-hand side of the image, indicating the presence of an established electrical infrastructure. The composition of the photograph leads the viewer's eye straight down the canal toward the industrial structures, emphasizing a stark contrast between the natural environment and industrial activity.\n\nOverall, the image captures a disturbing interaction between nature and human industrial activity, highlighting environmental concerns related to industrial pollution.","title":"Contaminated water in drainage ditch behind Pittsburg Glass Company.","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546116","543636","550708","551562","544775","550193","548192","552019","547907","544702","550959","544779","546398","546117","547485","550694"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["canal","ditch","pollution","cement","drainage","contamination","disturb","parallel","establish","silo"]}
