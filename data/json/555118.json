{"path":"555118.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and densely forested scene. The frame is mostly filled by the narrow, tall trunks of several trees, which rise vertically across the image. These trunks appear to be predominantly coniferous trees, based on the needle-like foliage. The sunlight filters through the tree branches from above, casting patterns of light and shadow on the forest floor and the lower branches, highlighting them against the darker areas of the composition.\n\nThe background reveals layers of similar trees, contributing to a sense of depth and density in the forest. The light plays an essential role in defining the atmosphere of the scene, creating contrasts between the illuminated green-yellow hues of the foliage and the deep, dark tones of the shaded areas. Overall, this photo evokes a quiet and secluded natural environment, untouched and lush. The image is void of any human presence or artificial structures, emphasizing the pristine and tranquil character of this woodland area.","title":"Hemlock trees in Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550791","554425","555120","554393","542725","555116","549234","555051","546947","554965","554394","555114","542931","558082","547643","553574"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","trunk","branch","foliage","needle","tree","density","define","role","character"]}
