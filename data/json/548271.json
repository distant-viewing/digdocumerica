{"path":"548271.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a heavily graffiti-covered wall. The graffiti is dense, with a mix of large scribbled tags, drawings, and various styles of lettering. Dominating the scene is a large, burgundy-colored tag in bold style that reads “SKY.” There are smaller writings and drawings surrounding this main piece, each contributing to the chaotic visual texture of the image. Numerous words, symbols, and phrases are overlapping, penned in different sizes and colors, including dark red, blue, yellow, and black.\n\nThe background wall appears to be composed of white tiles, suggesting an urban environment such as a subway station or a similar public space often targeted for graffiti. The state of the wall, covered with multiple layers of markings, communicates a locale with a high degree of foot traffic and human interaction, possibly hinting at underlying social or artistic expressions within the community.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph gives it an almost gritty, underground feel, highlighting the vibrant and rebellious nature of street art. The photograph serves as a vivid showcase of urban graffiti culture, conveying themes of territory, identity, and expression in public spaces.","title":"Vandals have spray-painted messages on walls of this subway station (116th Street).","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555939","549865","547005","548476","556232","551926","554325","553506","556231","548266","556690","555750","555901","556811","554324","548258"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["drawing","tag","graffiti","wall","scribble","burgundy","underlie","identity","writing","phrase"]}
