{"path":"546060.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a devastated landscape, most likely from a logging operation. The foreground features a wet, muddy area cluttered with fallen trees, broken branches, and scattered debris. Among the visible objects are logs, a puddle that reflects the sky, and parts of metal machinery, possibly related to logging activities. \n\nThe background shows a dense arrangement of tree stumps and standing dead trees devoid of foliage, indicating the area has been cleared. This scenery is particularly bleak as there is little to no green vegetation visible; instead, hues of brown, black, and gray dominate the view. \n\nThe sky, visible through the sparse canopy, seems overcast, suggesting an overclouded or late afternoon time. This setting underscores a somber mood, reflecting the consequences of human intervention in nature.","title":"Bayou segnette swampland, which has been devastated by runoff petroleum sludge from a nearby natural gas installation stumps of giant virgin cypress trees attest to the ravages of industrial pollution","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555230","545138","555092","555208","555162","555136","555150","542865","555094","542827","555148","542828","545254","542850","542829","547661"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["consequence","objects","fallen","devoid","logg","stump","puddle","clear","intervention","underscore"]}
