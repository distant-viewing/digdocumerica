{"path":"550165.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an urban area featuring a variety of elements both man-made and natural. Central in the image is a large, symmetrical park with pathways forming a cross that intersects at a circular center. The circular center is accentuated with what appears to be a fountain or monument. The grass is a lush green and the pathways are bordered with shade trees.\n\nSurrounding the park, the urban infrastructure includes roads filled with cars indicating midday traffic. Directly flanking the roads, parking lots populated with cars suggest active office buildings or facilities nearby. A series of industrial or commercial buildings are observable close to the park, distinguishable by flat roofs and rectangular shapes.\n\nIn the background, further enhancing the industrial vibe of the area, there are extensive railway tracks densely packed with freight containers, indicating a major transportation or shipping hub. Beyond the rails, there is a wide highway bustling with moving vehicles. \n\nAdditionally, large bodies of water are visible in the far part of the photo, likely a river or waterfront area, with ships visible at a distance, hinting at an active maritime industry.\n\nThe layout and structures suggest this might be a densely populated and industrially active city area near a major water body, possibly close to downtown due to the presence of commercial vehicles and a well-maintained public park.","title":"Willard Park, on Lake Erie shore","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551505","546579","548406","555762","546698","548434","546616","549479","556947","557501","546624","553559","555755","549480","547765","546673"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["park","pathway","monument","cross","freight","shipping","fountain","downtown","hub","midday"]}
