{"path":"554999.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene and lush forest scene centered around a large tree trunk. The tree is imposing, with a wide base and enveloped by and dripping with green moss, which is characteristic of damp, old-growth forests. The atmosphere looks specific to a temperate rainforest, likely found in regions like the Pacific Northwest of the United States.\n\nThe tree's bark is dark and rough, indicating its mature age and the harsh conditions it has withstood. Several branches extend outward from the trunk, also covered in moss, suggesting very high humidity in this environment.\n\nThe ground around the tree is rich with various types of small ferns and underbrush, contributing to the dense greenery in the image. Small patches of sunlight filter through the canopy, highlighting areas of the forest floor and providing a natural contrast in lighting that enhances the deep greens and earthy tones prevalent throughout the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of tranquility and ancient wilderness, untouched and rich with flora typical of a thriving, old-growth forest. There are no visible paths or signs of human activity, emphasizing the natural beauty and solitude of the location.","title":"Mature spruce in the queets corridor of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555000","554958","554977","545278","555057","545271","554961","542791","554966","554972","542958","554976","554975","554970","555028","550792"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","forest","growth","trunk","thriving","humidity","rainforest","fern","envelo","tree"]}
