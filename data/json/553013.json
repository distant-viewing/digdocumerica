{"path":"553013.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, focusing on equipment used likely for processing or transferring materials like coal or metal ores. The scene is dominated by large piles of blackish material, possibly coal, both in the foreground and partially engulfing the bottom of a conveyor belt system.\n\nAt the center and right of the image, there is an imposing structure that includes a tall chimney emitting a thin wisp of smoke. The structure supports several mechanical components, including what appears to be a hopper for collecting materials and other machinery for processing these materials. Beneath this, directly to the right of the chimney, is a small control room or operator's booth, enclosed with windows and elevated on a metal frame.\n\nThe prominent conveyor belt angles upward from the left of the frame towards this central structure, suggesting it is used to transport materials from the piles up into the machinery for further handling. The machinery and structures feature a utilitarian design, typical of mid-20th-century industrial equipment, comprising mostly steel and other metals, with functional, robust engineering focused on durability and operational efficiency.\n\nThe background shows clear blue skies, indicating the photo was likely taken on a sunny day. There are no visible trees or much other vegetation, reinforcing the heavy industrial nature of the location. The lighting and shadows suggest midday or early afternoon. This setup is characteristic of many industrial operations dealing with bulk materials, where continuous handling and processing of these materials are required.","title":"Shredded steel to be recycled.
