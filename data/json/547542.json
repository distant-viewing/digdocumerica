{"path":"547542.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a mysterious and somber scene. A landscape is shrouded in a dense, fog-like smoke, possibly from a fire or other source of air pollution. The foreground is relatively dark and features a broken wooden fence on the left side, hinting at rural or semi-industrial surroundings. Sparse grass and litter suggest the land could be unused or abandoned.\n\nIn the middle ground, the smoke dominates, obscuring much of the view and creating a blanket that separates the foreground from the background. The smoke is thick and widespread, adding a sense of depth and texture to the scene.\n\nThe background is partially visible through the haze and includes a higher elevation with trees and a distinctive building, possibly a church or old tower, that rises above the smoke. The silhouette of this structure against a mellow sky, which shows hints of orange and purple, possibly indicating sunrise or sunset, adds a dramatic and almost eerie element to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph is atmospheric, evoking a sense of stillness and perhaps abandonment or aftermath, with a strong interplay of natural and possibly man-made elements.","title":"Nearby fields are filled with smoke from open burning city dump","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["545048","553625","547673","549191","550984","545239","548596","551054","550987","551061","555087","547539","543668","553563","545975","557578"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","abandoned","hints","broken","shroude","aftermath","sunrise","church","separate","blanket"]}
