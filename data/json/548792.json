{"path":"548792.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene at dusk or night, where the primary focus is a bonfire set against a backdrop of tall, dense pine trees. The fire is bright and blazing in the center of the image, giving off intense light and casting a warm glow. Surrounding the fire, the environment is dark, indicating it might be late evening.\n\nIn the foreground, grass and wild vegetation are visible, contributing to a somewhat rural or wilderness setting. The presence of a car on the left side of the photo suggests this location might be a campsite or a similar recreational area accessible by vehicles.\n\nThree individuals are standing near the fire. They are dressed in casual or possibly outdoor attire suitable for cooler evening weather. It appears they are engaged in a casual gathering, possibly enjoying the warmth of the fire or preparing for a nighttime event.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its natural elements and human activity, evokes a sense of leisurely outdoor recreation typical of camping or bonfire gatherings. The lighting, focused mainly on the fire and its immediate surroundings, adds a dramatic touch while also highlighting the silhouettes and actions of the people present.","title":"Bonfires are permitted on the camping ground of long key state park, midway between key largo and Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["551315","551399","545778","551431","546026","546013","557028","551314","544855","545774","557577","551402","555160","544008","554863","542727"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["fire","gathering","casual","evening","campsite","nighttime","camping","recreation","warmth","night"]}
