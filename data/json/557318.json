{"path":"557318.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a unique architectural detail, focusing on a series of large, reflective windows or panels. This scene is composed of multiple angular segments that create a geometric pattern.\n\n1. **Windows/Panels**: There are several large panels, possibly windows, that are framed by a metallic edging. These panels are inclined at an angle, reflecting the sky and clouds vividly, which creates an impressive visual contrast between the sky above and its reflection.\n\n2. **Framework**: The panels are supported by what appears to be wooden frames or supports. The wooden borders are visible on the sides of the panels, adding a natural texture against the smooth, reflective surfaces of the glass.\n\n3. **Ground**: The ground visible between the glass panels is covered with gravel, composed of small stones that provide an uneven, textured look. This adds a tactile quality to the image, contrasting with the sleek surfaces of the reflective panels.\n\n4. **Sky**: The sky is an important element in the image, as it is partly cloudy which provides dynamic patterns of light and shadow in the reflections seen in the panels. The clouds are fluffy and white against a light blue sky, indicating possibly fair weather.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes symmetry and reflection, using the mirrored surfaces to play with perception and depth. The image evokes a sense of modern design, possibly part of a contemporary architecture project or an art installation that interacts with the natural environment surrounding it.","title":"Flat plate solar heating collectors built by the Solaron Corporation and installed on the roof of the Gump Glass Company in that city.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557333","555329","548649","546521","557280","548648","555326","553839","555305","544012","546531","545869","555318","549880","546506","544561"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["panel","reflection","symmetry","glass","surface","segment","art","installation","project","cloud"]}
