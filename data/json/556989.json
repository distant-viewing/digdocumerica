{"path":"556989.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural or semi-rural scene featuring a prominently displayed real estate sign for \"Warner Unlimited Inc.\" The sign, which includes a phone number and specifies \"400 BLDG. BELLEVUE, WA,\" stands in the foreground to the left side. The scene behind it shows a wide open field with tall, dry grass, partly shadowed under the direct sunlight. This field is enclosed by a rustic, wooden fence that stretches across the middle background of the scene.\n\nTo the right, a line of tall, narrow trees stretches into the distance, suggesting a boundary or a windbreak beside another field. The background further showcases a clear sky and hint of foliage and landscape in the far distance, possibly indicating the outskirts of a town or the edge of a developed area. The atmosphere of the image conveys a quiet, serene outdoor setting with an emphasis on open space and undeveloped land. The lighting suggests that it is either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and soft, golden hue bathing the landscape.","title":"View of agricultural property which is part of a proposed \"new city\" north of silverdale.
