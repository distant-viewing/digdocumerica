{"path":"554606.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic forested wetland, showing a mix of dense and vibrant greenery interspersed with a muddy, water-filled landscape. There are tall coniferous trees, primarily displaying spruce or pine, that dominate the frame, but showing some signs of wear like broken branches. In the foreground, grass and reeds line a small body of water, which is likely part of a beaver pond given the visible accumulation of sticks and mud forming a dam-like structure.\n\nReflections of the trees can be seen on the waterâ€™s surface, adding a mirror effect to the scene. The area appears lush and mostly untouched, suggesting a remote or protected natural setting. The sky is clouded, supplying diffuse lighting and soft shadows, enhancing the natural, earthy tones of the scene. It's a serene depiction of a forest ecosystem actively shaped by both flora and fauna.","title":"Small beaver dam in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["546205","546200","554717","550345","554525","558009","547011","554607","545033","544593","552438","553465","550786","545488","544589","550341"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["spruce","fauna","supply","reed","forest","pine","accumulation","mud","stick","depiction"]}
