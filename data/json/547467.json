{"path":"547467.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph displays a large sailing ship with a classic design, navigating through what appears to be open water. The ship is tilted slightly to the side, indicating it is sailing with the wind. It features multiple sails that are fully deployed, demonstrating a setup typically used for maximizing wind capture. The sails are off-white in color and set against a slightly overcast sky providing a dramatic backdrop.\n\nThe hull of the ship is visible and appears robust, painted in a dark color that contrasts with the lighter sails. On the rear of the ship, a flag is flying, suggesting a national or maritime affiliation, but the details on the flag are not clearly visible due to the distance and angle.\n\nThere are several people on the ship, though their activities are not distinctly clear; they seem to be involved in managing the sail or perhaps simply enjoying the sail. The ocean around the ship shows some gentle waves, indicative of a breezy but not overly turbulent sea.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is one of adventure and nautical travel, recalling historical or perhaps recreational seafaring. The composition leverages natural light, which, though muted, effectively highlights the textures and forms of the sails and the ship.","title":"Schooner on chesapeake bay, seen during the early hours of the","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549431","547459","549403","544667","547463","549395","549405","549392","549396","547465","549394","547458","548498","548494","547456","547461"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","ship","flag","deploy","leverage","wind","affiliation","maximize","mute","rear"]}
