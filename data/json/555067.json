{"path":"555067.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a natural setting dominated by lush, green clover leaves covering the majority of the frame. The leaves are densely packed, exhibiting a rich shade of green and showing their distinctive three-lobed shape which characterizes this plant. Some leaves have water droplets visible on them, reflecting the environment's moisture and possibly recent rainfall.\n\nNestled among the clover, roughly centered in the image, is a small frog. The frog's coloration blends somewhat with the wet, dark soil underneath as well as with the green hues of the surrounding plants, making it somewhat camouflaged. Its body is visible, with its limbs tucked closer to itself, suggesting a resting or stationary pose.\n\nThe overall composition focuses tightly on the interaction between the natural flora and fauna, emphasizing the frog's blending into its environment. The play of light and water droplets adds a fresh, vibrant quality to the scene. The photograph offers a glimpse into a micro-habitat, highlighting elements of the ecosystem typically unseen in larger landscapes.","title":"A toad, Oregon oxalis and moss in the Queets River Valley of Olympic National Park, Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557587","542971","549145","544280","551362","555042","551363","555066","542554","557606","555197","558077","555040","554993","543565","555044"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","leave","resting","fauna","limb","tuck","blend","majority","coloration","rainfall"]}
