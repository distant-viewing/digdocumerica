{"path":"554113.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an impressive waterfall flowing down a steep, vertical rocky cliff surrounded by dense foliage. The waterfall creates a long, narrow stream of white water that contrasts strikingly with the dark, mossy green of the cliff faces. The surrounding vegetation, which includes large, leafy bushes or small trees in the foreground, is lush and varies in shades of green, enhancing the natural, pristine feel of the scene.\n\nThe image has a somewhat dark tone, possibly due to the lighting conditions or the depth of the scene, with the waterfall centrally positioned and acting as the focal point. The elevation point from which the photo was taken gives a straight-on view of the cascade, suggesting a vantage point from across the valley or on an opposite ridge. The overall composition and the secluded environment portrayed in the photograph evoke a sense of solitude and the sublime power of nature.","title":"Akaka falls state park","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["555073","545878","558087","554408","542699","555210","544456","550697","545874","548021","544344","545839","542698","555220","543578","554409"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","cliff","point","cascade","green","varies","act","elevation","ridge","stream"]}
