{"path":"547319.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman lying inside a sophisticated piece of equipment, likely some form of medical or scientific imaging device. The setting appears to be a laboratory or clinical environment.\n\nThe woman is positioned on her back, leaning on a transparent, sloped support that seems to be part of a larger machine. She is wearing a patterned, sleeveless dress and her legs and arms are partially secured with what look like straps or restraints at the wrists and ankles, ensuring she remains still during the process. Her expression is neutral, and she seems calm, possibly observing the operation of the equipment.\n\nAbove her, there is a substantial, metal machine component, which is equipped with multiple cylindrical units that could be part of the operational technology of the device. The machine is likely positioned directly over her midsection, suggesting that it might be conducting scans or treatment that focuses on this area of the body.\n\nThe background is sparsely detailed but hints at an industrial or clinical setting with a light blue wall. There is minimal additional context provided about the equipment or the environment, enhancing the focus on the woman and the machine. This setting and arrangement indicate that the photograph aims to capture either a medical procedure, a scientific experiment, or a demonstration of the technology.","title":"Whole body counter is used to measure natural levels of radiation.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548861","548860","546327","556575","545482","556567","546344","546269","556571","548856","556574","548891","547729","545399","556570","545478"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["machine","technology","device","equipment","ankle","woman","procedure","demonstration","wrist","strap"]}
