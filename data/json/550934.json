{"path":"550934.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene likely from the mid-20th century, showcasing a blend of beach-goers' activities and vintage automobiles. The beach is bustling with people; some are sunbathing under large yellow and blue beach umbrellas, while others walk around or stand by the cars.\n\nIn the foreground, a line of weathered wooden posts, possibly remains of an old fence, leads the visual line across the packed sandy beach. Parked prominently are several vintage cars reflecting the automotive style of the period, with notable fins and shiny chrome detailing. These vehicles are a mix of sedans and wagons, indicating a popular beach outing day.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a woman in a white dress and sunglasses appears to be attending to a large yellow boat or board placed on top of one of the cars, possibly preparing or securing it. Another woman in the foreground, dressed in a dark outfit and white hat, leans on one of the wooden posts, observing the scene.\n\nThe background fades into the horizon where the blue sky meets the calm sea, devoid of any dramatic waves, adding a peaceful element to the bustling beach atmosphere. The overall ambiance reflected in the photo is vibrant yet relaxed, characteristic of a sunny beach day where people enjoy the outdoors and the company of each other amidst the backdrop of classic mid-century American leisure culture.","title":"Wind, sand, and cars--stewart, or east beach, at Galveston island","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["545857","547499","550925","547478","557475","550922","550921","545237","550933","547495","545252","546412","548929","547503","546794","550930"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","vintage","post","goer","car","sunbathe","bustle","fin","attend","umbrella"]}
