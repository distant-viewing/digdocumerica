{"path":"548700.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of six people leisurely walking along a shallow water's edge at a coastal area. The setting is picturesque with calm, blue waters extending towards the horizon under a clear sky. The group consists of various individuals, possibly a mix of adults and children, with some wearing swimsuits and others in shorts and a shirt, suggesting a warm, sunny day ideal for beach activities.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a stretch of wet sand or a mudflat, indicative of a low tide revealing the area where these people are walking. To the left of the frame, there are interesting elements like some wooden posts sticking out of the water, with a few items possibly tied to them, such as a red cloth and a white spherical object which might be a buoy or a makeshift sign.\n\nThe background shows a tranquil sea bordered by a lighter strip of water, hinting at sand under the shallow surface. Far off in the distance, towards the center of the image, a lone tall, slender structure, possibly a mast from a sailboat, pierces the horizon, adding a touch of solitude amidst the vastness of the water.\n\nThe surrounding nature includes greenery, some bushes or short trees on the beach, framing the bottom edge of the photo and contributing to the sense of a secluded, natural environment. The overall vibe is serene, making it a snapshot of a peaceful moment in nature with human interaction subtly blended in.","title":"Tourists at the public beach near long key in the central Florida keys","placename":"Florida Keys (Fla.)","location":"Florida Keys, Florida","nn1":["547009","543072","555402","547697","546982","548697","548696","547974","543418","557507","544274","546953","543225","548695","543310","550234"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","far","mudflat","tall","pierce","bordere","buoy","water","walk","cloth"]}
