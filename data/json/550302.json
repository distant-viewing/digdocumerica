{"path":"550302.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene likely in an urban setting, given the presence of tall modern buildings surrounding a bustling public space. The setting is a green, well-kept park area with lush, manicured grass and leafy trees. Sunlight streams through the foliage in the upper-left corner, suggesting a sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, we see individuals enjoying the outdoors. A man sits on the grass, dressed casually in a grey shirt and dark pants, gazing forward towards the crowd. Near him, possibly holding a camera, sits another individual in a white and red garment.\n\nThe mid-ground is dominated by a gathering of people around a raised, rectangular fountain or planter with benches incorporated into the design. The crowd is dense and appears to be engaged in a communal activity or event, with several people standing or sitting close to each other, suggesting a social or possibly a public event.\n\nTowards the background, the crowd thickens near what appears to be a small stage with a speaker, indicated by a denser group of people facing towards a focal point, not completely visible in the picture.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is vibrant and communal, with people dressed in a variety of mostly casual outfits, indicating a relaxed social event. Buildings with large glass facades surround the park, reflecting the day's bright sunshine and contributing to the urban feel.","title":"\"after work festival\" draws downtown workers to chester commons, mini-park at east 12th and chester streets.
