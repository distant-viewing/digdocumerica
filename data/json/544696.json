{"path":"544696.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The sky in the background is tinged with yellow and blue hues, creating a striking contrast against the silhouette of a large factory or industrial plant. Thick, dark smoke billows out of at least two tall stacks, floating upwards and blending with the lighter clouds above. The factory buildings are detailed with numerous levels, staircases, and metal constructions, all outlined against the lighter sky due to the lighting from behind. In the foreground, there are faint silhouette outlines of power lines stretching across the scene, linking the composition to the theme of industry and energy. The image evokes a strong industrial vibe, emphasizing themes of pollution and environmental impact.","title":"Sunset and smoke","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544684","544173","545446","547090","546384","544700","544688","544708","553847","545425","542999","545421","551026","555737","542544","557381"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","silhouette","theme","staircase","sunrise","stack","energy","vibe","outline","sunset"]}
