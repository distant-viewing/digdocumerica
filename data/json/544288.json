{"path":"544288.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene yet slightly ominious swamp or wetland scene dominated by aquatic vegetation and clear blue skies. At the forefront, there is an old, faded green rowboat partially filled with water and decaying leaves, suggesting it hasn't been used recently. The boat is moored against a flooded wooden dock, which is barely visible above the water's surface.\n\nTo the left, a weathered wooden post prominently displays a bright yellow \"POSTED NO TRESPASSING\" sign, reinforcing a sense of abandonment or restricted access. Attached to this post and extending into the water is a chain-link fence, partially submerged and running parallel to the dense, lush green water plants, possibly water hyacinths, that thickly cover the waterâ€™s surface.\n\nIn the background, the water stretches to a line of trees and what appears to be the distant shoreline, with a few buildings barely visible. The overall atmosphere is quiet and desolate, yet filled with the vivid colors of nature under a bright sky. The scene captures a juxtaposition between human-made objects and natural growth, highlighting themes of neglect and the resilience of nature.","title":"Natural gas installation","placename":"Larose (La.)","location":"Larose, Louisiana","nn1":["547510","550834","545008","552128","547017","548248","544567","550788","550780","550779","545969","544181","544532","546066","550789","553085"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["post","trespassing","water","swamp","rowboat","link","chain","resilience","wetland","access"]}
