{"path":"546725.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a congested highway flanked by lush green trees. There are multiple lanes of traffic, with one side of the highway showing heavy congestion as the cars appear to be at a standstill or moving slowly. On the other side, the traffic is lighter and the vehicles are more spaced out, indicating smoother traffic flow.\n\nIn the background, there are large white buildings with flat roofs, possibly office buildings or industrial complexes. These structures are surrounded by parking areas and are also nestled amidst large expanses of trees. The time of day seems to be either during twilight or under overcast conditions, casting an overall dim light over the scene, which gives the photograph a somewhat moody or solemn tone. The composition effectively contrasts the natural green areas with the bustling human activity of transportation, underlining themes such as urbanization and the environmental impact of vehicular traffic.","title":"Beltway, naval ship research and development center Maryland","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546721","546603","546734","546714","546587","546711","546583","546733","546713","546607","546686","547780","546612","546681","546670","548391"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","highway","urbanization","congestion","underline","lane","twilight","office","nestle","complex"]}
