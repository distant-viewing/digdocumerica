{"path":"556116.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene likely at a railway yard. In the foreground, on the left side of the frame, there is an individual standing near a traditional, somewhat rusty fuel pump with a spigot and flexible hose. This person, a man appearing to be a railroad worker based on his attire, is wearing a light-colored hard hat, a blue work shirt, and blue jeans. He is facing toward the right, looking at a large, silver passenger train labeled \"AMTRAK\" in blue, bold letters along its side. The train extends diagonally across the photo from the foreground toward the background on the right side.\n\nThe worker stands on a gravel surface, typical of rail yards, which appears wet, possibly indicating recent rain. The environment is overcast with a cloudy sky, contributing to the industrial ambiance of the scene. Overhead electric lines for powering trains can be faintly seen against the gray sky.\n\nThe photograph likely depicts a moment of routine maintenance or inspection, capturing the everyday operations and work environment in the railroad industry. The focus and composition emphasize both the worker and the machinery, suggesting a narrative around human interaction with large-scale transportation technology.","title":"Expo '74 passenger train is serviced at the Wenatchee, Washington, train station during a 10-minute stop enroute from Spokane to Seattle. Amtrak reversed a 25-year decline in ridership after it assumed responsibility for most U.S. intercity rail passenger service in 1971. Use of the track is leased from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556109","556860","555973","555986","556087","555561","556882","556896","551006","556064","556872","551921","556892","556108","555957","556410"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","worker","railroad","yard","fuel","pump","inspection","work","technology","gravel"]}
