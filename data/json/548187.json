{"path":"548187.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene industrial scene set around a waterway. In the foreground, a large barge, topped with a load of red and brown material, possibly soil or ore, is being pushed by a tugboat painted in white. The boat features a small tower structure with visible navigation equipment. The water around the boat shimmers gently with the light, reflecting a vivid blue sky.\n\nBoth sides of the waterway are lined with greenery, predominantly pine trees, providing a natural border to the industrial activity. On the left bank, a road runs parallel to the shoreline, accompanied by a few sparse industrial buildings, suggesting a light industrial or semi-rural setting. The right bank is densely wooded, giving the scene a more secluded feel.\n\nThe background is marked by a soft, distant mountain range under a hazy sky, contributing to the tranquility of the setting. You can see an extensive flat terrain leading to these mountains, indicating that the area might be located in a valley.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, taken from an elevated perspective, gives an expansive view of the operations within a broader landscape context, capturing the juxtaposition of industry and nature.","title":"Sawdust barge in Camas Slough near opening to Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550951","551148","551515","551038","557235","546938","556481","550901","553826","550900","548186","544271","555401","548059","548200","557309"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["waterway","bank","ore","load","boat","tugboat","navigation","mountain","barge","border"]}
