{"path":"550048.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a moment outdoors on a grassy field. There is a woman in the foreground, with a focus of light accentuating her facial features, enhancing the thoughtful expression as she carefully looks downwards. She is holding a large, dark, rectangular object — potentially a photographic shade or reflector — which is positioned to mostly obscure her body from view. Her hair is voluminous and styled to fall naturally, and she appears to be wearing a casual denim jacket.\n\nSlightly behind and to the side of her, there's another individual only partly visible, largely obscured by the object the woman is holding. Only part of this person's sunglasses and dark hair can be seen, and they also appear to be looking down or possibly aiding the woman in her activity.\n\nThe ambient lighting and deep green grass suggest an outdoor setting during daytime with ample natural light. The entire image conveys an informal and relaxed atmosphere, possibly related to a creative or photographic activity given the props involved. The clear focus on the woman, along with the bokeh effect that softens the image of the man behind, centers the viewer’s attention on her and her handling of the object.","title":"The common and, behind it, the landscaped public gardens provide rest and recreation in metropolitan Boston.
