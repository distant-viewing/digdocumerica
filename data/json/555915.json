{"path":"555915.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph captures a young boy from a side view, standing in a grassy field. He appears to be shirtless and is wearing a baseball glove, suggesting he might be playing or ready to play baseball. The boy has curly hair and a thoughtful, somewhat serious expression on his face. In the background, other children can be faintly seen engaged in outdoor activities, possibly also playing baseball. The background is a broad expanse of greenery that likely represents a park or a recreational field, and the image is underlaid by an overcast sky, giving a serene yet slightly moody atmosphere to the scene. The overall composition and color tone convey a nostalgic and timeless slice of childhood.","title":"Puerto rican boy playing ball in hiland park of Brooklyn New York city.
