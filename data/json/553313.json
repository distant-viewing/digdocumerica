{"path":"553313.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a city scene. The image shows a large group of people gathered in a public square surrounded by city buildings. The square is lined with trees and has a few small patches of grass. Several outdoor umbrellas are visible, possibly belonging to a café or vendors in the area.\n\nThe gathering in the square appears to be a significant event; the density of the crowd suggests a festival, rally, or some form of public celebration. One can notice variations in the crowd density, which seems more concentrated towards one side of the square. The square itself includes a few artistic or monument-like structures that add to the visual interest of the space.\n\nAround the square, multiple buildings of varying architecture and heights surround the space, indicating a downtown or central city location. The roads around the square have a few cars lined up, hinting at either a temporary roadblock due to the event or typical city traffic controls.\n\nAt the top edge of the photograph, a part of another very tall building is visible, suggesting this photo was taken from a high-rise building, giving a top-down perspective on the urban scene below. The buildings, characterized by flat rooftops, some with visible rooftop units, represent typical mid-20th-century commercial architecture. The scene is highlighted by a clear sky, indicating that the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day.","title":"Looking down at Fountain Square during a performance by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553273","551795","551797","553317","549988","551798","553287","551800","553324","551801","551802","552726","551799","551823","550003","551796"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["square","city","rooftop","density","crowd","café","monument","building","event","vendor"]}
