{"path":"556737.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In the photograph, there is an African-American woman standing in what appears to be a city street scene. She wears a two-toned (orange and black) coat and is raising her fist, which conveys a sense of activism or protest. Her eyes are closed, and her expression seems solemn or perhaps focused, adding an emotional gravity to the scene. Behind her, there is a car with its windows partially rolled down; inside the car, obscured figures can be seen.\n\nThe background suggests an urban setting, evident from the architectural style of the buildings and the faintly visible commercial signage, one of which reads \"Charlies‚Äù in a circular logo with a dark background and light text. The overall mood of the photo is somewhat muted, given the overcast sky and urban environment, which adds a somber tone to the scene. The composition focuses on the woman, using her position in the frame and her gesture to draw attention to her as the main subject of the photograph.","title":"Washington, District of Columbia policewoman directs motorists in a monumental traffic jam in May, 1974, during a bus strike in the metropolitan area. During the strike, which lasted several days, police were shifted from other duties to direct traffic at key intersections. Some 250,000 persons who normally rode the buses were forced to find alternate forms of transportation, usually their car. The metro bus system usually operated 1,800 vehicles during the rush hour.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556254","553154","556151","553321","552720","557039","547191","547190","549863","557908","557904","552745","556289","546623","556216","556765"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["activism","gravity","protest","gesture","woman","car","logo","position","signage","coat"]}
