{"path":"552407.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting with a group of people casually walking along a paved path. The group appears to be a family or a gathering of friends, including children and adults. There are three adults and four children visible, moving away from the camera, seemingly in conversation or enjoying a leisurely stroll.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, possibly in a park or a garden, with meticulously maintained lawns and an array of colorful flowers bordering the path. Tall, mature trees add depth to the background, contributing to a tranquil and picturesque environment. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or overcast day.\n\nIn terms of composition, the photo uses natural lighting and features vibrant natural colors from the flora. The path curving slightly to the right leads the viewer's eye through the scene, following the group's movement. The framing includes a partial view of another individual at the far left, who seems to be turning away from the camera, adding a dynamic element to the composition by capturing motion and interaction within the group.","title":"Family outing on the beautifully landscaped grounds of the canadian school of horticulture bordering the niagara parkway north of Niagara Falls, ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["551736","557985","543233","546783","552033","543455","553755","557940","551764","545512","553373","543456","544538","551712","557659","557206"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["path","group","adult","child","bordere","friend","flowers","camera","outdoor","framing"]}
