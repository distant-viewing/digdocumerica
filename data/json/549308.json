{"path":"549308.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This image depicts a construction or industrial scene near a large body of water, likely a river or bay. The primary focus of the image is an old-fashioned, large crane that extends diagonally across the frame. The crane has a red and white body with a long, lattice boom. The craneâ€™s hook dangles a suspended cage or platform carrying two workers; this platform is near the center of the image and is hoisted quite high, slightly above the middle of the crane's boom.\n\nOn the ground, there are several workers engaged in various tasks. One worker, dressed in light-colored clothing and a hat, appears to be walking on the waterfront toward or away from the camera. Another worker, wearing a blue shirt, seems to be operating or adjusting some equipment on the ground. The scene is cluttered with construction debris, including large pieces of metal, rubble, and equipment like pipes or cylindrical objects.\n\nIn the background, the opposite shore can be seen along with industrial or warehouse buildings. It's a sunny day with a slightly cloudy sky, which adds a bright backdrop to the industrial activity. This setting and the equipment suggest a mid-to-late 20th century time frame for the activities shown in the photograph. The overall impression is one of bustling activity at a construction or shipping site, highlighted by the use of heavy machinery and manual labor.","title":"Construction begins on the battery park development across from the world trade buildings on the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548559","546833","545648","547181","545655","551563","547216","548773","547615","555796","555285","544753","547171","547113","546033","554545"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","worker","boom","construction","equipment","platform","cage","hook","hoist","shipping"]}
