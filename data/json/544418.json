{"path":"544418.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged and expansive landscape that appears to be a large open pit mining operation set against a backdrop of striking geological formations. At the foreground of the image, there's a curving dirt road leading toward a large pile of dark materials, likely mined substances, adjacent to some basic infrastructure including what seems to be a conveyor belt system extending over a small bridge.\n\nThe middle ground shows a panoramic view of a vast, flat terrain sprinkled with sparse vegetation and punctuated by distant towering cliffs and plateaus. The natural rock formations are dramatic, characterized by their layered strata and erosion-carved shapes, suggesting an arid or semi-arid climate. These formations exhibit a range of colors from deep reds and browns to lighter creams and whites, indicative of sedimentary rock layers.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting a dynamic weather pattern, but still allows enough light to illuminate the landscape vividly. The general atmosphere is one of raw, natural beauty juxtaposed with human industrial activity, illustrating a scene of exploitation within a remote and dramatic wilderness. The color palette is rich and earthy, emphasizing the natural red and ochre tones of the terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition captures both the grand scale of the natural environment and the imposing, albeit small in comparison, scale of human industry within it.","title":"Arizona--Navajo Reservation","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["554804","554815","554768","544111","544100","549174","549242","549167","549170","544792","554765","543857","545529","543758","554769","544139"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["formation","stratum","plateaus","comparison","pit","scale","rock","cream","substance","belt"]}
