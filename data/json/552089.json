{"path":"552089.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts an environmental scene showing blatant pollution in a natural setting. A small, meandering creek is partly visible, surrounded by dense green foliage. The creek appears to be in a vegetated gully or ditch-like area. Littered throughout the scene are various discarded objects, prominently featuring large pieces of debris such as broken panels, possible parts of furniture or appliances, and other nondescript junk.\n\nIn the foreground, notable are huge pieces of what look like wood and segments of white panels, possibly parts of wall or building materials. More centrally in the image, there is a large, old-fashioned television set that remains mostly intact and stands out among the natural greenery due to its size and shape.\n\nThe background beyond the immediate scene of pollution shows a contrasting environment with an industrial or urban setting visible. A large building, possibly a factory, is noticeable with smokestacks emitting smoke or steam. A water tower is also visible, indicating a populated area not too far from the polluted site.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural environment against human neglect and environmental degradation, highlighting the intrusion of waste in nature, and possibly implying the broader impacts of urban and industrial activities on natural settings.","title":"This trash laden creek in Lawrence flows into the Kansas River.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["550352","556419","547897","547907","543589","551440","550800","551247","552100","547525","556942","552811","552098","550687","544810","550259"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["creek","panel","ditch","pollution","gully","television","appliance","piece","intrusion","segment"]}
