{"path":"550216.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph shows a curved road running next to a canal. The scene captures a tranquil, nature-infused environment with green foliage lining both sides of the road and the canal. The road, which appears dimly lit, perhaps suggesting early morning or late afternoon, features a single car driving away from the camera. The car is an older model, potentially form the 1970s or 1980s, marked by its compact, rounded shape and light color.\n\nBeside the road, there's a canal or stream reflecting the sky and the surrounding trees. The reflective surface creates a sense of calm and accentuates the depth of the scene. Overhead, there are utility lines and a street lamp visible, capturing a hint of the suburban or rural infrastructure.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes a serene, almost isolated setting, as there's no visible human presence other than the lone car, suggesting a moment of solitary travel or a quiet day in a less-populated area. The image also has an overcast sky which adds a soft light to the entire scenery, enhancing the quiet mood of the photograph.","title":"Old Ohio Canal looks lovely but smells bad.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546682","554070","558002","548100","549002","544991","552521","557010","544658","547659","551240","547388","556579","554031","546401","557528"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["canal","road","infuse","car","overhead","drive","calm","lamp","populate","stream"]}
