{"path":"550688.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene where nature's beauty contrasts with a warning of environmental pollution. In the foreground, a sign prominently reads \"DANGER - WATER POLLUTED - NOT FIT FOR SWIMMING OR DRINKING,\" indicating the severe impact of pollution. The sign, which appears weathered, has black and white lettering and is mounted on a post.\n\nBeyond the sign is a serene lake that extends towards wooded areas on both the left and the right sides. The lake reflects the clear sky above. In the background, there are hazy layered mountains, which enhance the depth and the aesthetic appeal of the scene. The mountain to the far right features an exposed rocky face, likely a cliff, adding a rugged texture to the otherwise lush, green landscape.\n\nThe surrounding area exudes tranquility with its clear water and dense forests, thus making the warning sign's message even more poignant and discordant with the seemingly pristine condition of the environment. The photograph seems to be taken during bright daylight, given the vivid colors and clear visibility of the distant terrain.","title":"Polluted androscoggin river in the \"shelburne birches\" area near the Maine-New Hampshire boundary","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["544813","553860","555385","550272","550280","552811","550223","555228","550723","558000","546805","550687","550812","547524","550686","545014"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["warning","sign","drinking","pollution","danger","lake","layered","fit","pristine","mountain"]}
