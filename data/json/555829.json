{"path":"555829.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image shows an activity on a large boat or ship, where several individuals are involved in maritime operations. The deck of the ship is equipped with heavy machinery including a large crane or lifting device. The crane's arm is extended over the side of the ship towards the water.\n\nSeveral people are visible on the deck, engaged in various tasks related to the operation. Some of the individuals are seen standing near the crane, possibly coordinating or managing the lifting process. Others are seated or kneeling on the deck, perhaps handling equipment, performing checks, or resting.\n\nOne person, dressed in diving gear including a wetsuit and fins, appears to be preparing to enter the water or has just emerged from it. Dive-related equipment is noticeable on the deck, indicating that the operation might involve underwater work.\n\nThe ship is floating on calm blue water, and the sky is mostly clear with a hint of haze, which suggests the photo was taken on a sunny day. The overall atmosphere of the image portrays a scene of active marine work, likely involving underwater exploration or mechanical operations related to maritime or oceanographic research.","title":"A diver from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ship \"Ferrel\" going down to check current meter stations in the bight. Water circulation in the bight is not yet fully understood. Current research will give a more accurate reading of how well the sludge and other wastes are being dispersed by the bight's natural circulation. They also hope to learn how much man's activities have disturbed the natural pattern.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555831","549597","555828","555832","555827","555797","549265","552862","555833","551046","549590","552861","549616","549351","545189","549618"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["deck","ship","crane","operation","dive","wetsuit","lifting","diving","check","fin"]}
