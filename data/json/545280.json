{"path":"545280.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach landscape predominantly covered with sand. The foreground and middle ground show an expansive sandy area with ripples and dunes, typical of a beach environment. Sparse vegetation, possibly adapted to sandy soil, is scattered across the field of view. These plants appear hardy, with small green leaves, some bearing yellowish fruits or flowers, adapting well to the coastal conditions.\n\nTowards the background, the ocean is visible with moderately calm waves breaking along the shore. Above the horizon, the sky takes up the top third of the frame, exhibiting a clear transition from a deeper blue at the top to a lighter, almost white hue near the horizon. This change in sky color suggests an open space, enhancing the feeling of tranquility.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or man-made structures in this scene, emphasizing the natural state and isolation of this beach environment. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, highlighting the untouched beauty of the coastal landscape.","title":"Motorists are permitted to drive their cars on this beach","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547596","547612","547607","543303","543192","548757","543287","551554","547015","543193","548220","547608","547592","545215","547697","555400"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["adapt","beach","fruit","dune","third","bear","horizon","change","sand","ripple"]}
