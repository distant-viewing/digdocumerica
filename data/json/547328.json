{"path":"547328.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man in a vibrant setting that appears to be an auction or a livestock event. He is wearing traditional western attire: a textured, light-colored cowboy hat, a short-sleeved checkered shirt tucked neatly into his trousers, black cowboy boots, and a western-style belt with a large, ornamental buckle. His expression is animated and his mouth is open, suggesting that he might be calling out or speaking loudly, likely conducting an auction or directing an event. \n\nThe background is dimly lit, focusing the viewer’s attention on the man. There are metal barriers, possibly part of the enclosures for livestock, visible around him. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the action and energy of the scene, giving a strong sense of motion and urgency to the man’s gestures. The man’s attire and the setting suggest a cultural context deeply connected with ranching or rural agricultural activities.","title":"At the annual lamb sale at seward county fairgrounds lambs are sold mostly to youngsters for use at 4-h club showings","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552664","552631","552579","547679","552666","552561","557042","552677","549120","553104","557043","549122","552665","549199","549051","546068"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["livestock","cowboy","buckle","ranching","event","man","call","urgency","enclosure","tuck"]}
