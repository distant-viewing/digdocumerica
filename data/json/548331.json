{"path":"548331.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid street scene from presumably a major U.S. city, possibly New York, characterized by its bustling urban atmosphere. The photograph's focal point is the line of shiny, classic cars, predominantly taxis, that are shown parked along a busy street. The cars, most notably the yellow cab in the foreground, exhibit the design elements typical of mid-20th century American automobilesâ€”rounded bodies, prominent tailfins, and gleaming chrome details.\n\nThe taxis and other cars are captured in a congested setting, suggesting either rush hour or a generally busy part of the day. The street is flanked by tall, shadow-casting buildings, contributing to the canyon-like feel typical of many urban downtown areas. Some skyscrapers can be seen rising majestically in the background, their facades partially illuminated by sunlight, hinting at the time being either morning or late afternoon.\n\nPeople can be seen walking along the sidewalk, going about their daily routines. They are dressed in what appears to be typical business attire, dating the photograph in an era when formal wear was more commonly worn in public spaces. \n\nOverall, the photograph is a snapshot of American urban life, capturing the hustle and bustle of city life, the architectural grandeur, and the aesthetic of automotive design from a bygone era.","title":"New york city canyon--tall buildings jut into the air; yellow cabs and other vehicles crawl through the congested streets below","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","554314","554331","549848","554316","554315","548410","554330","554297","549882","549876","549869","549868","549873","549872","556709"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","car","like","era","taxi","bustle","cab","rush","hustle","city"]}
