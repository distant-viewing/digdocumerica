{"path":"542555.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene featuring a river, a bridge, and natural landscape. In the foreground, a man is seen walking on a pebbly riverbank that curves gently into the water. He appears to be walking carefully on the rocky terrain while looking downwards, possibly at the stones or his footing.\n\nThe river itself is calm and mirrors the blue sky above. To the left of the man and the riverbank, there's a significant presence of greenery bordering the water, suggesting a lush environment. This river branches off into a larger water body, seen towards the center and right of the image, forming what appears to be a junction or confluence of streams.\n\nIn the background, there's a sturdy-looking bridge constructed with metal beams, somewhat industrial in design, crossing the river. The bridge frames the upper right portion of the photograph and leads to a flatter landscape visible on the other side. Beyond the bridge and river, the terrain is relatively flat and open, punctuated by a few sparse trees and some buildings in the far distance, hinting at a nearby settlement or community area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its expansive view of the waterway, bridge, and surrounding landscape, suggests a peaceful yet somewhat remote setting, possibly on the outskirts of a rural area. The image captures the interplay of human infrastructure with the natural environment, providing a snapshot of daily life and movement in this scenic locale.","title":"Water pollution from gravel plant upstream","placename":"Merced County (Calif.)","location":"Merced County, California","nn1":["548097","548096","548098","551527","552107","557996","551423","544542","551536","558005","557239","553355","542653","542558","550656","555575"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["bridge","river","riverbank","junction","locale","outskirt","settlement","terrain","stream","waterway"]}
