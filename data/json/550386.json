{"path":"550386.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a lone reindeer crossing a gravel road in a tranquil, scenic setting. The reindeer is in mid-stride, positioned slightly off-center to the left, with its head turned to its left looking towards the camera. It has a robust and healthy body, and its impressive antlers extend upwards and outwards.\n\nThe road on which the reindeer walks is composed of small pebbles typical of rural or less traveled paths, bending slightly as it extends into the distance to the right of the frame. The terrain surrounding the road is vast and flat, covered mostly by a grassy plain that stretches to the horizon, suggesting a remote or wilderness area.\n\nThe background is expansive, emphasizing the openness of the area, and features a soft gradient of early twilight or sunset colors, bathing the scene in hues of pink and purple, blending into the subdued lighting of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a serene moment of natural beauty and tranquility, capturing the reindeer in its natural habitat without any visible human presence or modern structures, offering a glimpse into a peaceful, undisturbed wild setting.","title":"Young bull caribou crosses gravel roadway near mile 0","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550381","550385","550378","550379","550384","550380","550377","545902","544571","552697","545898","546163","544916","558368","544114","543279"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["road","composed","outwards","antler","subdued","pebble","plain","openness","upward","extend"]}
