{"path":"555837.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a magnified view likely taken through a microscope. The background is a uniform, slightly gradient tan color that encompasses the entire image. Scattered across this plain backdrop are numerous small, circular and ovoid objects which are possibly cells or particles. These objects vary in size and clarity; some appear more defined with darker edges, while others are faint and less distinct.\n\nOn the far left, near the edge, there is a small circular object that is remarkably brighter with a visible halo, suggesting it might be a bubble or an artifact. None of the shapes exhibit internal structures that are readily distinguishable in this image, implying that the focus or magnification does not reveal detailed cellular or material composition.\n\nOverall, the image provides a visualization typical of what might be seen in biological or chemical microscopic analysis, focusing on observing and identifying forms and sizes of microscopic entities.","title":"Algae (smaller than 64 microns) which is plentiful throughout the Bight Apex near the dump sites and in polluted bays and estuaries was photographed at the Atlantic Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.
