{"path":"558101.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a rural setting during what appears to be the early hours of dusk, adding a slightly muted and moody tone to the scene. On the right side of the image, there is a rustic building with weathered wooden shingles and a protruding brick chimney. A portion of its roof is visible, and it appears to be covered in shingles as well. Alongside the building, various items and debris are scattered, including what looks like a metal bucket and wood pieces.\n\nTo the left, the ground is covered in grass and scattered leaves, suggesting it is either late summer or early fall. A rough path, possibly made from compacted soil and gravel, curves gently from the foreground towards the building and vanishes off to the side of the frame. This path is lined by overgrown grass and a few scattered wooden planks. \n\nThe background is densely filled with tall trees and bushes, indicating that the area is in or near a wooded locale. The trees seem to be in varying stages of foliage density, possibly showing the transition into the fall season. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and the overall calm and serene mood of the setting. There are no visible people or moving objects, enhancing the stillness and tranquility of the scene.","title":"An archaeological site called the Botzum Mound with a date of 500 B.C., according to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History is seen at the left of the photo at Riverview Road south of Bath Road at Northampton near Akron, Ohio. The area is rich in Indian history; the nearby Cuyahoga River was a major transportation artery for them as well as settlers who pushed into the area in the 19th century. The river provided water for the Ohio-Erie Canal built between 1825 and 1827.","placename":"Northampton Center (Ohio)","location":"Northampton Center, Ohio","nn1":["554822","558102","551076","547658","556961","545233","557025","552515","553809","556963","557013","558109","554084","555632","554767","558110"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["shingle","fall","path","locale","grass","gravel","bucket","plank","stillness","hour"]}
