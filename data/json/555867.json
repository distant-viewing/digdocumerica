{"path":"555867.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an environmental scene dominated by pollution in a water body. In the foreground, a man in work attire, wearing a cap and a blue checkered shirt with suspenders, stands on a muddy shore. He uses a long pole to rake or skim through a shiny, oily surface of a polluted river or pond. The water reflects a dark sheen, indicating the presence of oil or chemical pollutants.\n\nThe mid-ground of the image shows the extent of the water body, dotted with rocks and further patches of slick and foam, indicating severe contamination. The background features a flat and open landscape with sparse vegetation, power lines, and distant mountains under a slightly clouded sky, suggesting an industrial or deserted rural area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes an environmental issue, focusing on water pollution and possibly a cleanup effort, as evidenced by the man's activity and the general desolateness of the area. The setting appears bleak and neglected, underscoring the gravity of environmental degradation in the scene.","title":"Pumping operation underway which removed some 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil from the five acre pond. The liquid was neutralized after removal and trucked to a nearby site for disposal. The pond was cleaned up under EPA supervision to prevent possible contamination of nearby Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["545663","555868","557243","544784","544810","551560","544580","546116","555852","552127","551561","552085","551559","547524","550205","544175"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["rake","gravity","pollution","suspender","contamination","extent","pollutant","sheen","foam","degradation"]}
