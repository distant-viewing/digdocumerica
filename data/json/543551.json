{"path":"543551.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image features a serene outdoor scene likely captured at dusk or dawn, given the soft and dim ambient lighting. The photograph predominantly showcases blossoming trees, with white and pink blossoms densely clustered along the branches. The trees are partially silhouetted against a gentle and slightly varied green landscape that appears to be a well-maintained grassy field or lawn, possibly within a park or similar tranquil setting.\n\nIn the background, the trees somewhat obscure a dense line of darker, evergreen trees, which form a natural backdrop and contrast to the lighter, blooming trees in the foreground. The forest behind suggests a rural or semi-rural location. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the trees and the landscape.\n\nThere are no visible people or human activities in the scene, enhancing the sense of quiet and untouched natural beauty. The composition with the tree branches intersecting creates a texture-rich forefront, dynamically leading the viewer's eye through the picture while amplifying a sense of depth and stillness in the scene. This photograph communicates a peaceful and almost poetic aesthetic, capturing the essence of early spring or late fall when trees are in bloom.","title":"Lake Tahoe shore near King's Beach","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["554732","550033","543621","547643","546533","551678","555116","554718","547705","557024","542849","555217","557159","554733","555216","543581"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["blossom","tree","bloom","branch","amplify","communicate","intersect","stillness","lawn","essence"]}
