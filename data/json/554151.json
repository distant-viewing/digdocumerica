{"path":"554151.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features three traditional wooden sculptures finely carved in a style characteristic of Pacific Islander cultures. The central figure is more detailed and appears to be a humanoid form, standing with legs slightly apart and arms resting at the sides or slightly extended outward. The sculpture's face is large, with prominent circular eyes and an expressive mouth that makes it the focal point of the figure. Below the face, there is a carved design that might represent a body ornament or a patterned garment.\n\nFlanking this central figure are two taller, narrower sculptures that are more abstract and stylized. These sculptures feature repeated, vertical, rib-like designs running the length of the poles. The rightmost pole also has what appears to be a smaller face toward the top, with similar stylistic features to the central figure.\n\nThe sculptures are set against a backdrop of lush tropical palm trees, which suggest an outdoor setting, typical of a garden or a ceremonial space in a Pacific Island. The vivid greenery of the palms highlights the gray and weathered texture of the wooden sculptures, emphasizing their traditional artistic and cultural significance. This setting and the style of the sculptures suggest they are likely located in a place with rich indigenous traditions, possibly used in rituals or as guardians of a particular area.","title":"Ancient statues in city of refuge national historical park near honaunau on the western side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554150","554152","554153","549533","550496","546516","546512","558132","547832","558269","546457","558259","553747","549382","553769","548288"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["sculpture","figure","palm","face","ornament","rib","pole","repeat","stylize","tradition"]}
