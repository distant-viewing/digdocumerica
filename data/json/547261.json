{"path":"547261.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a damaged or partially collapsed wooden structure, which appears to be a fish farming or aquaculture facility located within a muddy river or lake. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, looking down onto the water body.\n\nThe structure consists of multiple enclosed wooden pens, which are interconnected by wooden walkways. Many of the pens and parts of the walkways have fallen into disrepair and decay, with some sections submerged underwater or missing altogether. Vegetation, possibly small trees or large shrubs, is growing haphazardly among the pens and on the banks, suggesting the structure might have been abandoned or not maintained for some time.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the image, a few people can be seen standing on a relatively intact section of the walkway. They are looking down toward the water or interacting in some manner, perhaps working, examining the facility, or perhaps fishing.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the lighting and the composition is serene yet melancholic, highlighted by the stillness of the water and the overgrown and deteriorating wooden structure. The water casts reflections and there are ripples around the structure, possibly from movement of the people or the water itself. The background features a nondescript treeline, reinforcing the rural or secluded setting of the scene.","title":"Fishing the muddied Potomac near Mt.
