{"path":"553396.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene where two individuals, possibly engaged in a leisurely conversation, are standing near the water's edge. The lake, expansive and reflecting the clear blue sky, suggests a calm, idyllic environment. The people, one facing towards the lake and the other slightly towards the camera, appear relaxed, wearing casual clothing suitable for an outdoor setting. \n\nA substantial part of the image is taken up by nature â€“ the lake itself, surrounded by dense forest that hints at seclusion and tranquility. The person closest to the camera wears a light gray jacket and blue pants, while the other, facing away, dons a long-sleeve dark shirt and light blue jeans, carrying a sweater or jacket over one shoulder. \n\nThe foreground features greenery, including a vibrant bush adorned with bright leaves that catch the sunlight, adding texture and depth to the scene. The lighting suggests it is a sunny day, enhancing the peacefulness and beauty of the natural setting. Overall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes an intimate and peaceful interaction set against the backdrop of a natural landscape.","title":"McTaggerts Mill Pond","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["545038","554494","543601","545229","546293","543203","543892","543535","554477","543505","553082","543951","557563","554493","549471","558093"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lake","jacket","seclusion","peacefulness","camera","sweater","shoulder","bush","sleeve","jean"]}
