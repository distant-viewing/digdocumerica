{"path":"556292.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a relaxed moment of a man lounging outdoors. The man is reclining comfortably in a folding chair with a floral pattern. He is dressed casually in a yellow collared shirt, blue jeans, and black boots, and he is wearing a white cowboy hat. His right arm is positioned over his head, lending a relaxed posture, while he seems to be taking a nap or resting his eyes.\n\nThe setting appears to be a public outdoor area, perhaps a park, with well-maintained grass. In the background, there's a substantial tree trunk and a building with a white brick wall. Notably, the wall has the word \"PLEASE\" in bold, capitalized letters painted on it, adding a curious element to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and leisurely, suggesting a quiet, sunny day where one can enjoy a moment of calm in a public setting.","title":"Black man enjoying a nap on a chaise lounge on Chicago's south side.
