{"path":"549423.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene of recreational sailing. In the image, two small sailboats are actively navigating through blue waters. Each boat is equipped with a distinctively colored sail; one is salmon pink with the text \"US 12514 USNA\" visible, while the other sports a deep green sail.\n\nIn the first sailboat, two individuals can be seen maneuvering their boat; one is steering while the other appears to be managing the sail. Both sport casual sailing attire, with the helmsman wearing a white shirt.\n\nThe second boat features a lone sailor who is attentively managing the sail. This individual is shirtless, showcasing an engaged posture as he sails.\n\nThe overall activity suggests a competitive or leisurely sailing event, with calm waters and mild weather, ideal for sailing. The background includes a soft grey horizon that subtly blends the sea with the overcast sky, hinting at subdued lighting conditions likely in either early morning or late afternoon. Light ripples on the water surface add a dynamic element to the tranquil maritime environment.","title":"Running before the wind on chesapeake bay in the Annapolis-Newport race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549425","549406","549421","548203","548526","543941","548510","548513","544021","549082","548517","549424","549386","549389","548514","549392"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailing","sailboat","boat","manage","sport","salmon","sailor","steer","maneuver"]}
