{"path":"557723.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting, likely a gallery or exhibition space, capturing a candid moment among visitors. The scene is relatively dimly lit, primarily illuminated by overhead track lighting that focuses on the wall adorned with photographs and possibly other artworks.\n\nA woman stands near the center-left of the frame. She has short, styled hair and wears large, round glasses. Her attire includes a light-colored blouse under a darker, open vest, complemented by a long skirt or pants. She holds a drink in one hand, which she is sipping using a straw from a disposable cup.\n\nThe gallery walls are dark, creating a contrast that highlights the displayed works and the subjects of the picture. Several other individuals are partially visible; a person in a white outfit stands in the background to the right, facing away from the camera.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a mood of contemplative engagement with the art, suggesting an event where visitors are casually perusing the works displayed. The composition focuses on capturing these incidental human moments within the setting of cultural or artistic appreciation.","title":"Guests at the \"Sound of Music\" opening night party examine progress photos and planned development drawings lining the walls of the Alpine Valley Investment Corporation office.
