{"path":"553422.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a central architectural detail of a buildingâ€”a rounded archway above a glass window, embellished with ornate, classical sculptural elements. The arch has a keystone at the top center and is framed with a decorative white molding that exhibits intricate detailing including a pair of carved floral swags draped over each top corner of the arch.\n\nWithin this architectural setting, there is a prominently displayed circular sign that reads \"FITCHBURG ALL AMERICA CITY,\" with the design featuring a top half of blue with white stars, mimicking the American flag, and the bottom half striped in red and white. The text on the sign is in bold, capitalized, white and red letters, which clearly state the pride or award designation associated with the city.\n\nThe building's facade is made of brick, showing a rich, deep-red hue that adds a contrasting backdrop to the white architectural details and the vividly colored sign. There are no people visible in the image, focusing the attention purely on the architectural and symbolic elements presented. The composition of the photograph cleverly accentuates this civic pride with a frontal, direct view emphasizing the grandeur and craftsmanship typical of historical civic buildings.","title":"Device over city hall doorway","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["550042","553421","547295","556046","557643","550038","558031","558130","555949","557093","558128","556121","558032","558162","557073","546440"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pride","half","arch","mimick","embellish","molding","archway","sign","craftsmanship","framed"]}
