{"path":"552575.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural outdoor scene, likely on a farm or similar setting. In the forefront, the focus is on a group of individuals engaged in an activity involving a small amount of smoke, coming from an area near the center of the image, where one man is kneeling. He along with another man standing nearby, both wearing cowboy hats, seem to be handling or controlling a situation potentially involving livestock (as suggested by the presence of the smoke and their actions, typically suggestive of branding or another form of livestock management).\n\nTo the right of the image, a young person in a striped shirt and another in a cowboy hat look on, either observing or waiting to assist. On the left, standing slightly apart from the main action, are two more individuals; one wearing denim and a cowboy hat and another bending over a white bucket, perhaps preparing something or cleaning.\n\nThe background features a natural, grassy environment with a wooden fence and sparse trees, indicating a secluded, rural setting. The lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, contributing to the mood of communal, rustic outdoor work.","title":"Three generations of Oldlands have ranched on Piceance Creek. In the summer they move 15 miles south to their cow camp, and their cattle graze on higher lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management and private oil companies.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["553108","553106","554922","552573","543686","553104","553107","554949","543779","548838","552567","552569","557061","552677","552581","553110"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["livestock","hat","action","cleaning","branding","smoke","situation","denim","bucket","amount"]}
