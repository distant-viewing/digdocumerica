{"path":"543012.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photo captures a rural setting where agriculture and industrial activity are juxtaposed. In the foreground, several cows graze peacefully in a fenced pasture, providing a serene and pastoral scene. In contrast, the background features a bustling industrial operation, likely a mill or factory, from which multiple plumes of smoke and steam rise into the air. The smoke is thick and varies in color, suggesting intense activity at the facility. This industrial backdrop creates a striking visual against the natural landscape and clear sky. The composition highlights the coexistence and impact of industrial activities on rural environments.\n\nDominating the midground are traditional farm structures including a large barn with a classic gambrel roof, and other smaller outbuildings. These buildings appear well-maintained, typical of a working farm. The overall scene is framed by lush greenery and trees that line the horizon, indicating that this location might be in a region with abundant natural resources and a significant rural economy. The contrast between the idyllic pastoral foreground and the industrious, smoke-filled background offers a poignant commentary on the balance between nature and industrial progress.\n","title":"Farm with wood chip burner","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["543010","549214","543159","552091","546398","546130","553933","543668","551049","544676","545989","543813","545013","543009","553842","550997"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","farm","economy","visual","pasture","outbuilding","cow","commentary","mill","progress"]}
