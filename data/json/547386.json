{"path":"547386.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively dance scene, characterized by motion and energy. The image shows multiple couples engaged in what appears to be ballroom dancing. The lighting casts a moody, somewhat dim ambiance, with shadows and spotlights creating a dramatic effect. The blur and swirl of several dancer's attire, particularly the skirts, convey movement and add a dynamic element to the captured moment.\n\nThe dancers are dressed in formal attire, with women in gowns and men in suits or dress shirts, reflecting a formal or semi-formal event. Colors of the dresses vary, with some appearing in lighter pastels and others in more solid hues. The men's attire is less distinguishable due to the lighting but generally seems to consist of lighter-colored shirts.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of celebration or social enjoyment, evident from the proximity and interactions of the dancers. The background is not sharply detailed, emphasizing the movement of the figures in the foreground and creating an immersive ambiance that focuses primarily on the dancing. The overall composition of the photograph, utilizing motion blur and selective focus, effectively conveys a sense of time and place, emphasizing the joy and fluidity of dance.","title":"Lincoln's 33rd annual square dance festival, held in pershing memorial auditorium","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547274","547334","547317","547403","558286","547387","547270","558284","558285","547371","553241","547271","547383","551710","557790","556309"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dancer","dancing","dance","fluidity","gown","attire","spotlight","motion","blur","movement"]}
