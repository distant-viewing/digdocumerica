{"path":"545456.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling night scene at a fair or event. Dominating the upper portion of the image is a large, neon sign that reads \"GRAND STAND ENTRANCE\" in red neon letters. Below this text is a vibrant neon star, with light rays extending outward in red, white, and blue colors, emphasizing the excitement and lively atmosphere typical of such an event.\n\nBelow the neon sign, there is a crowd of people in a dark setting, which suggests it might be late in the evening. The figures are mostly in silhouette due to the backlighting of the sign and other smaller lights around. There is a visible interaction among some attendees, while others are focused on a booth directly under the sign. This booth, illuminated by overhead lights, shows individuals engaged in what looks to be a ticket or information exchange, suggesting it might be an entrance or a place to gain further access to the event.\n\nFurther back, beyond the crowd, there are glimpses of other stalls and lights, possibly indicating more activities and concessions typical of a fairground. The general mood is one of activity and festivity, with the neon lights and vibrant activity setting a tone of enjoyment and communal gathering.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545448","553298","553331","545460","553257","545465","551298","553259","549022","553260","551321","549009","545462","555446","553196","545444"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["neon","booth","event","crowd","sign","festivity","exchange","ray","ticket","lights"]}
