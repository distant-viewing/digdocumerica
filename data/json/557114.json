{"path":"557114.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a side profile of a woman standing outdoors. She has her hair set in numerous small curlers that are held in place with white clips. The woman is wearing a light-colored blouse with a delicate floral print and a high neckline.\n\nHer expression appears contemplative as she gazes off to the side, not looking directly at the camera. The background is slightly blurred but features a pastoral setting, with hints of a rustic building and leafy trees in muted shades, which suggests it might be autumn or a cloudy day.\n\nThe focus is clearly on her, highlighting her hairstyle and the texture and detailing of her blouse. The photograph seems to capture a moment of everyday life, possibly in a rural or semi-rural community.","title":"Closeup of Mrs. Ruth Cruse outside her home in White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state.
