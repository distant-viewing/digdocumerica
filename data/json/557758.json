{"path":"557758.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural setting featuring a traditional white church and an adjoining cemetery. The church, with its simplistic architecture, has a steep gable roof topped with a modest steeple and a cross. Positioned slightly left in the frame, this building also has a covered porch where the entrance is presumably located. Adjacent to the church on the right, extending into the background, is the cemetery, dotted with various tombstones and grave markers that vary in size, shape, and material.\n\nThe cemetery contains several noteworthy structures resembling small, roofed gazebos that shelter some graves, adding a distinct and possibly ceremonial character to the space. The graves are adorned with floral arrangements and other memorabilia, signifying remembrance and respect for the deceased.\n\nThe setting is lush, with green trees flanking the background which suggests a secluded, peaceful location. The overcast sky and the lighting imply that the image was taken on a cloudy day, which enhances the tranquil and somber mood of the scene.\n\nThe image reflects a quintessential rural American landscape and could evoke themes of community, tradition, and memory.","title":"Chattahoochee United Methodist Church and graveyard on Georgia Highway 356 at Robertstown, a mile northeast of Helen. This low mountain area some 90 miles northeast of Atlanta attracts campers and fishermen. Also of interest is the business district of Helen which has been Renovated with a Bavarian alpine theme. Success of the project, begun in 1969, has led to new development which will affect both towns. A planning report for Helen cites the need for a balance between growth and public interest.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552016","554792","547440","556480","554208","550287","557951","554035","552451","554207","558024","557952","554033","548239","547324","546455"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","church","grave","gazebo","tombstone","remembrance","respect","memory","steeple","tradition"]}
