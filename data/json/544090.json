{"path":"544090.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of an urban area during twilight or under particular atmospheric conditions that impart a reddish, dusky hue across the scene. The image features a dense array of buildings spreading across the frame. In the foreground are buildings with flat roofs, possibly commercial in nature, while the midground transitions into a residential area with various house rooftops, some of which are lit by the ambient light.\n\nThe skyline is relatively flat, indicating the absence of high-rise buildings, characteristic of a suburban or a less densely populated urban area. In the background, faint silhouettes of hills or low mountains appear, shrouded by the haze that adds a sense of depth and emphasizes the vastness of the area.\n\nThe overriding reddish-orange tone of the image suggests either the presence of environmental factors like sunset or pollution, or it might be an effect of the photographâ€™s exposure or age. This coloring gives the scene a somewhat eerie or unnatural ambiance.\n\nThe overall mood is still and calm, with no visible movement or activity in the streets or buildings. The absence of prominent vegetation or trees in the bulk of the image points towards a highly urbanized setting. The quality and condition of the film, suggested by some visible imperfections like spots or scratches, imply that the photograph is possibly historical or taken with analog equipment.","title":"Dust storm rises over Phoenix on Labor Day, 1972.
