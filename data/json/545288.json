{"path":"545288.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features an up-close view of multiple tree trunks, displaying richly textured bark with peeling layers revealing varying shades from pale yellow-orange to deeper reddish-brown hues. The bark’s texture is uneven and rugged, characterized by its flakiness and striations of color that provide a vivid sense of the trees’ natural shedding process.\n\nIn the background, there is a hazy, picturesque landscape that holds a dense forest with trees receding into the distance under a slightly overcast sky. The backdrop features gradients of green from the foliage interspersed with softer, blue-gray patches likely indicating the presence of distant mountains or hills.\n\nThe foreground is somewhat blurred and suggests the presence of low-growing plants or bushes, possibly containing flowers as patches of pink and purple are subtly visible. These add a soft color contrast to the earthy tones of the tree trunks and the greens of the distant forest.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph focuses on the natural beauty and texture of the tree bark while subtly framing this with a serene, woodland environment that seems rich and lush, invoking a peaceful and natural setting. The image captures the interplay of texture and color beautifully, emphasizing the organic and dynamic characteristics of nature.","title":"Madrone trees with peeling bark","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550703","557616","551355","554974","545292","543488","542749","553587","557621","550792","553586","544662","554966","554967","555181","554592"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["bark","trunk","striation","texture","tree","green","forest","characteristic","purple","gradient"]}
