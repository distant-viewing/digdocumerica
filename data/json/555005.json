{"path":"555005.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image presents a close-up view of a frost-covered surface, characterized by intricate designs and textures in varying shades of blue and purple. The frost appears to have formed elaborate crystalline patterns, which resemble small branching structures or fern-like shapes. These patterns vary in their density and complexity across different parts of the image, creating a rich tapestry of natural art formed by the interactions of temperature and moisture. The lighting and shadows highlight the intricate details of the frost, enhancing the depth and dimensionality of the textures. The overall composition is somewhat abstract, drawing the viewer's attention to the beauty and complexity found in natural phenomena.","title":"Closeup of the bark of a mature spruce tree in the queets corridor of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543562","555226","557607","557197","543576","557609","543167","545865","557200","555155","557199","552907","557198","543098","547166","543770"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["frost","complexity","phenomena","temperature","tapestry","art","moisture","form","patterns","density"]}
