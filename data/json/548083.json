{"path":"548083.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at an outdoor swimming pool overlooking a wide river and a metallic-truss bridge. The pool area is surrounded by a wooden deck equipped with lounge chairs where several people are sunbathing. One person, wearing a black swimsuit, is mid-dive into the shimmering blue water of the pool, creating a sense of dynamic movement in the image.\n\nTo the left, another individual in a bikini and sunglasses is reclining on a lounge chair, seemingly enjoying the sun. Along the edges of the pool, there are other lounge chairs, some occupied and others vacant. A few large white planters are placed around the pool area, contributing a decorative touch.\n\nIn the background, beyond the pool and decking area, a large river stretches across the frame, flanked by city buildings and industrial structures in the distance. The prominent feature in this backdrop is the sizable, dark-colored bridge extending across the river, adding an industrial vibe to the otherwise serene and leisurely setting.\n\nThe sky is clear with only a few wisps of clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day, perfect for outdoor activities. The overall atmosphere is one of summer relaxation and recreation by the water.","title":"Swimming pool of Thunderbird Motel on the Columbia River within yards of the Interstate Bridge connecting Washington and Oregon","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548085","544339","552012","557717","558143","555891","548549","553443","551093","551092","553441","548548","551165","552706","551499","553439"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Waterfront Development"],"terms":["pool","lounge","chair","wisp","river","bridge","planter","bikini","truss","swimsuit"]}
