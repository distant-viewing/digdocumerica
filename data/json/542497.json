{"path":"542497.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a man engaged in some form of manual work. He is positioned partly inside what appears to be a large vehicle or machinery, visible from a low angle. The man wears a heavily-used blue coat and a white hard hat, suggesting that he is likely involved in construction or industrial work.\n\nHis focus seems to be on either adjusting or examining a wooden plank or beam, which he holds with both hands. The setting around him is industrial, highlighted by the presence of metal components and structures, and he is framed through an opening, possibly a window or cut-out in the machinery. The background is faint, mostly washed out by the sky, hinting that the photograph was captured during daylight with strong ambient light.\n\nThe overall composition gives a sense of active engagement and physical labor, emphasizing the rugged nature of the worker's environment and duties.","title":"Pilot of dusting plane","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["553603","555239","544171","544835","556391","556447","553618","556315","556866","547163","542783","556880","556865","546023","558379","556187"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["machinery","wash","opening","duty","work","plank","examine","component","adjust","beam"]}
