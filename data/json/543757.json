{"path":"543757.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged and hilly landscape. The area shown is a clear-cut mountainside, likely part of logging or mining activities. In the foreground and midground are remnants of tree trunks and stumps, hinting at extensive tree removal. The terrain is uneven and mainly devoid of vegetation, scattered with dirt and rocks, suggesting recent or ongoing industrial work.\n\nTowards the center of the image, there is an industrial site featuring several shacks and metal structures, including what appears to be a conveyor belt or loading platform. The buildings seem rustic and functional, typical of a mining or logging camp. There are piles of materials or debris close to these structures, indicating active work, storage, or waste from the operation.\n\nThe background of the photograph presents a steep mountain slope, partially covered in snow, indicating it might be spring or early autumn. This slope is densely forested at higher altitudes, presenting a stark contrast to the stripped area in the foreground. The sky is partly cloudy with hints of blue, suggesting a cool or temperate weather setting.\n\nA bare tree in the right foreground of the image stands out, reaching towards the sky, devoid of any leaves, possibly dead or dormant, which adds to the bleak, utilitarian feel of the scene. Overall, the photograph captures the impact of industrial activities on a natural landscape, highlighting environmental and ecological themes.","title":"Old silver and gold mine","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["545138","555150","555221","542865","555094","543709","555104","555136","555208","542820","555107","554811","546060","552584","542840","545534"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["mining","slope","removal","mountainside","bleak","camp","remnants","present","devoid","logg"]}
