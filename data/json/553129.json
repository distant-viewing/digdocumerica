{"path":"553129.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures an interesting contrast between suburban development and a grassy, rural foreground. The image shows a broad view of a suburban neighborhood, consisting mainly of single-story homes with similar roofing and architecture, laid out in a tight grid pattern. The roofs are dark, likely shingled, and the houses appear to be predominantly brown or similarly earth-toned. Each house features a modest yard, and the streets between them are lined with sedans typical of suburban residential areas.\n\nIn the foreground, a large grassy field contrasts sharply with the dense neighborhood. Two horses are visible, grazing on the green grass, which suggests this area may be on the outskirts of urban development, where suburban and rural environments meet. The field is enclosed by a simple, possibly wire fence, hinting at its use for grazing or as undeveloped land.\n\nThe overall setting is likely located in a valley, as the neighborhood seems to be surrounded by higher terrain in the background. The contrast between the natural, spacious foreground and the packed, uniform development conveys a narrative of encroaching urbanization into rural areas.","title":"Reno suburb","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["557436","557438","543106","553700","553704","544600","548825","557455","557440","553934","557552","553938","557427","546399","544510","557437"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["neighborhood","development","grazing","urbanization","encroach","roofing","house","shingle","graze","field"]}
