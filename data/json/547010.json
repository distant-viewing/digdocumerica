{"path":"547010.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely taken at a heavy industry factory, such as a steel mill or processing plant. The image is characterized by a general haze and muted color palette, perhaps influenced by air pollution and industrial emissions.\n\nIn the foreground, there are piles of raw materials, possibly wood or scrap metal, with some sections appearing to be neatly stacked while others are more haphazardly amassed. A crane with a prominent boom and a visible cab is also in the foreground, suggesting ongoing industrial activities or construction.\n\nThe midground and background are dominated by large industrial structures, including multiple buildings and towers with varying shapes and sizes. These structures are equipped with numerous pipes and chutes, which are integral to the operations of such facilities. Smoke or steam is being emitted from several stacks spread across the scene, contributing to the atmospheric pollution visible in the image.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph gives a sense of organized chaos typical in industrial zones, emphasizing functionality over aesthetics. The presence of emissions and extensive industrial equipment highlights the environmental and operational scale typical in such settings.","title":"The Brunswick pulp and paper plant","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["549967","542999","545992","545236","557225","550328","546884","549508","543005","553891","545442","550982","546191","550343","546107","545434"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["emission","pollution","chute","cab","chaos","boom","scrap","mill","functionality","midground"]}
