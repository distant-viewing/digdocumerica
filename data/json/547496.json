{"path":"547496.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image depicts a tranquil beach scene at twilight or early evening. The foreground of the photograph is dominated by sandy beach scattered with clumps of beach grass, likely adapted to the sandy, salty environment. The clumps are distributed unevenly across the scene, with patches of bare sand around them.\n\nMoving towards the center and background, the sandy beach extends to a narrow strip of water or wet sand that leads to a formation of rocks or a miniature rocky islet. This formation creates a slight barrier between the beach and the larger body of calm sea visible in the far background under a dusky sky. The color tones in the scene are quite subdued, with purples, soft blues, and hints of yellowish hues reflecting the low light conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition leads the viewerâ€™s eye from the textured and detailed foreground across the serene midground to the smooth, tranquil sea and sky in the background. The entire scene is enveloped in a peaceful atmosphere, typical of beach scenes at sunset or sunrise, emphasizing natural beauty and quietude.","title":"Little compton beach on Rhode Island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547492","557509","543091","547483","542890","547608","547612","548221","547479","545280","553989","543052","544985","548757","547599","551554"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","smooth","islet","formation","clump","sea","clumps","quietude","adapt"]}
