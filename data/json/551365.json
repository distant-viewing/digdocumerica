{"path":"551365.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene and somewhat ethereal scene centered around a single tree. The tree, with a prominently twisting trunk and draped with delicate, needle-like leaves, stands out against a moody, blurred background that fades into a soft focus, enhancing the tree's visual impact. The lighting in the image casts a warm glow on the scene, which is enriched by numerous tiny, glowing particles—likely insects or floating seeds—backlit by what seems to be either early morning or late evening light. This backlighting creates a shimmering effect around the tree and gives the photograph a magical, otherworldly quality. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and tranquil, inviting the viewer to contemplate nature and the beauty of small, fleeting moments captured in time.","title":"Insects buzz around the trunk of an old cedar at the top of the overlook at Lake Ozark.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["547546","542932","548709","542929","542931","554998","554099","557598","554732","542958","556473","554668","554994","554394","543448","543607"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["seed","insect","backlighting","particle","needle","tree","glow","trunk","evening","leave"]}
