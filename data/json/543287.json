{"path":"543287.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, characterized by its natural rugged beauty. The sandy shore is untamed, with a variety of footprints scattered across the fore and middle grounds, indicating the presence and recent passage of visitors.\n\nOn the left edge of the image, a prominent, darkly colored, textured tree trunk provides a natural frame to the beachscape. A few figures can be seen walking away from the viewpoint towards the background, giving a sense of scale and life to the environment. However, their details are not clear due to their distance from the camera.\n\nThe beach is flanked by craggy cliffs and rock formations that bring dramatic vertical lines and shadows into the composition. These geological features adds depth and texture to the scene.\n\nThe ocean, captured mid-surge, washes onto the shore with vibrant foam and clear blue waters, suggesting the powerful dynamic of the tides. This interaction between the water and land creates a lively yet calming rhythm visually emphasized by the white surf.\n\nIn the background, against a clear bright sky, more rocky outcrops emerge from the sea, contributing to the natural majesty and seclusion of the setting. The lighting in the photograph is vivid, enhancing the colors and casting highlighting details in both the landscape and the ocean.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a moment of quiet and natural grandeur, encapsulating the tranquil yet wild aspect of a coastal environment.","title":"California--garrapata beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"Garrapata State Park, California","nn1":["548757","547607","543069","543089","545280","546953","551554","546970","544989","543299","545106","547697","543055","547600","543252","547612"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","beach","shore","rhythm","surf","majesty","footprint","tide","wash","outcrop"]}
