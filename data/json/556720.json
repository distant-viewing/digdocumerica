{"path":"556720.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a city street featuring a line of parked cars, focusing primarily on a dark-colored sedan in the foreground. This sedan has several parking tickets tucked under its windshield wipers, indicating it has been parked in this spot for an extended period or has ignored parking regulations. The windshield also displays a parking permit on the lower left side, suggesting it might be allowed to park in this area, but perhaps has overstayed its permitted duration.\n\nThe car exterior appears somewhat dusty and worn, with metallic hubcaps and manual side mirrors. The interior of the car visible through the windshield shows tidy, uncluttered seats and a simple dashboard typical of older car models. In the row behind this car, other similarly styled vehicles are also parked along the tree-lined street, indicating a somewhat busy urban area.\n\nThe background features buildings with a uniform, modern architectural style characterized by geometric lines and minimal decoration, possibly governmental or commercial buildings. The street itself looks clean with marked parking spaces and appears to be maintained well, adding to the orderly yet restrictive urban setting. No people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer entirely on the interaction between urban parking regulations and vehicle owners.","title":"One unlucky motorist received a parking ticket for leaving his car in a \"no parking\" zone during a bus strike in Washington District of Columbia, during May, 1974. The strike forced 250,000 people to find alternate forms of transportation, usually the car monumental traffic jams were the result as drivers learned there were more autos than places to park legally. The metro bus system usually has 1,800 buses on the streets during the morning and evening rush hours.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549829","546631","546619","556735","556707","556709","555944","556717","546849","547954","551913","557692","546635","555748","545321","556790"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","windshield","regulation","car","sedan","street","owner","dashboard","ticket","mirror"]}
