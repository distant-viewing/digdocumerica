{"path":"555262.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures the process of scientific sampling on what appears to be a lunar or similarly barren and dusty surface. The image features a close-up of two gloved hands engaged in meticulous activity. The left hand is holding a small spade or scoop, which is being used to collect a fine, powdery substance from the ground. The right hand is holding a transparent container, presumably to secure the collected sample.\n\nThe surroundings visible in the photo include a stark, fine-grained surface, giving the impression of either moon dust or a specialized simulation material. The smooth, angular slabs or sheets next to the sampling area could be parts of scientific equipment or protective layers placed on the ground. The photo is indicative of an environment that requires precise handling and containment measures, such as space missions or experimental geological studies in controlled settings. The focus on the hands and equipment conveys a sense of careful scientific procedure being conducted in a unique or extreme environment.","title":"Closeup of inspection of pesticides by an agent from the environmental protection agency on a dock at the port of Newark New Jersey.
