{"path":"547095.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image shows a scene of a coastal road severely damaged, possibly by a storm or other natural disaster. In the foreground, prominently featured, is a large \"ROAD CLOSED\" sign, tilted to one side and suggesting disrepair or recent displacement. Behind this sign, the road itself is visible, but it is covered in debrisâ€”ranging from large wooden planks and trees to smaller rubble and scattered materials. This chaotic scattering indicates a violent disruption.\n\nThe road seems to lead into the background where choppy, ice-filled waters are visible, suggesting a cold climate or winter season. This body of water appears rough, with whitecaps and chunks of ice, which may imply recent or ongoing strong winds and rough weather conditions.\n\nTo the right of the frame, bare trees line the road, also hinting at a cold season as there are no leaves on the branches. The sky is lightly clouded but also shows areas of clear blue, suggesting that the photo might have been taken after the worst of the weather had passed.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a strong narrative of nature's impact on human infrastructure, highlighting disruption and the resulting inaccessibility of the coastal route. The mood is somewhat bleak, underlined by the visible damage and the cold, desolate environment.","title":"Washed out section of Lake Shore Drive in Beverly Shores","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547111","547081","554789","555199","556445","548692","557993","555582","544245","555597","544466","544458","547904","545624","548742","548197"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","disruption","ice","damage","season","whitecap","scattering","chunk","disaster","rubble"]}
