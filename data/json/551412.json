{"path":"551412.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of outdoor fish harvesting or transfer. In the scene, two individuals are engaged in the process of handling fish. The foreground shows one person, visible only from the back and partially, wearing a dark green quilted jacket and holding a bright yellow rope. This rope extends into the pit where the second person, who is more fully visible, is crouched. This person is dressed in a green sweater and a dark green knitted hat, appearing to be pulling up or steadying a white bucket filled with numerous small, silvery fish.\n\nThe background is sparse and rocky, indicating the activity may be taking place in a rugged outdoor location, possibly near a fishing area or a makeshift fishery. The ground around them is mostly dirt with scattered stones and rocks, suggesting a natural, undeveloped setting. The overall atmosphere is one of active engagement in a task, clearly set in a cold or temperate outdoor environment given the heavy clothing worn by the individuals.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
