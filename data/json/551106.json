{"path":"551106.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a small-town street scene, set in a valley surrounded by lush, wooded hills. The scene is taken during daylight with a somewhat overcast sky, giving a subdued tone to the colors. In the immediate foreground, power lines and poles line the street, crisscrossing the frame.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a street intersection where two men are pictured crossing the road. Both men are dressed casually, with one wearing a white shirt and dark pants and the other in a light shirt and blue jeans. They seem to be in mid-conversation as they walk.\n\nTo the right side of the photograph is a row of buildings with a distinct small-town architecture feel. Notably, there's a building with a sign that reads \"SPORT CENTER\". Beyond this, the sign \"Al's Club\" prominently advertises what appears to be a local bar or social club, further emphasizing the close-knit community atmosphere.\n\nThe vehicles parked and driving along the street seem to be models from the late 1960s or early 1970s, giving a historical context to the image. The cars are well-maintained, reflecting the era's automotive style with long bodies and distinctive chrome detailing.\n\nThe overall composition uses natural leading lines created by the street and power lines to draw the viewer's eye through the scene, from the foreground to the wooded hill backdrop. This setup captures a serene yet lively snapshot of everyday life in a small American town during this period.","title":"Evening on Main Street in Smithers","placename":"Charleston (W.
