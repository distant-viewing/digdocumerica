{"path":"547020.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene by a calm body of water that spreads into the horizon, under a clear sky that brightens up the area. On the left side of the image, there is a man standing in shallow water near the shore. He wears a helmet, a striped long-sleeved shirt, and trousers, suggesting a work-related activity. The man appears to be engaging with the water, possibly collecting or examining something.\n\nNext to this man, a large, dark-colored canoe is partly visible, floating close to the shore, which is strewn with small rocks and pebbles. On the right side of the image, another man stands on the rocky shore; he wears a red shirt, dark pants, and a dark cap. He holds a large bucket seemingly filled with objects, indicative of a similar work-related activityâ€”perhaps gathering materials or specimens from the area.\n\nTo the right of this second man is a massive pile of shells, indicating that the location might be used for shellfish gathering or processing. A small white structure visible behind the shell pile could be a storage or utility shed relevant to their activities.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on these two individuals engaged with the environment and their distinct tasks, illustrating a scenario of manual labor performed along a serene waterline.","title":"Blufton Oyster Co-op","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["544763","546307","546334","546758","552863","544755","545928","545077","549059","546349","546984","546338","547033","546044","543465","547504"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["shore","man","shellfish","pile","specimen","waterline","canoe","shell","pebble","work"]}
