{"path":"552925.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a sinuous river carving through a rugged landscape. The photograph captures the river bending slightly as it flows through the scene. The riverbanks are contrasting sharply with the dark water; they are lined with patches of vibrant green vegetation which stand out against the more uniform dull-green and brown hues of the surrounding terrain.\n\nThe landscape around the river consists mainly of arid grasslands or scrublands dotted with sparse vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees. The terrain is fairly open and does not show signs of urban development or agriculture, suggesting a natural, possibly remote setting.\n\nAdditionally, there are no visible human-made structures close to the river, enhancing the sense of isolation and untouched nature in the image. The composition of the photograph, with the river creating a natural leading line through the frame, provides a strong visual flow that guides the viewer's eye along the water's path. The overall ambiance conveys a tranquil yet wild aspect of the landscape.","title":"Aerial view of the truckee river near Pyramid Lake, showing extent of irrigation of surrounding land","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["544744","550616","552908","549456","542523","550542","553452","552548","552838","550571","549455","545632","550543","550577","550524","550527"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","carving","flow","grassland","agriculture","guide","terrain","riverbank","bend","aspect"]}
