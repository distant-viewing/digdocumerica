{"path":"555687.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal town nestled in a rugged landscape. There is a mosaic of natural and man-made elements:\n\n1. **Town Layout**: The town is systematically arranged with a network of perpendicular roads creating rectangular blocks. Predominately located on the left side of the image, the orderly streets are lined with various buildings which could serve residential, commercial, or possibly light industrial purposes. A prominent set of structures, possibly government or institutional buildings, are situated in the central part of the town.\n\n2. **Waterfront and Port Area**: Toward the lower left corner, there is a visible port area featuring several docks and moored boats, indicating it as a significant hub for marine activities. This portion of the town directly interfaces with a large body of water, likely a sea or a large lake.\n\n3. **Natural Features**: \n   - **Mountains**: The background is dominated by dramatic mountain ranges with sharp peaks, hinting at a region of significant geological activity or an area prone to glaciations.\n   - **Body of Water**: This large water body on which the town is situated reflects light and seems to extend into the distance, bordered by more mountainous landscapes, emphasizing the townâ€™s picturesque setting.\n   - **River**: A winding river cuts through the terrain from the right side of the image into the town, featuring distinct sediment or mineral-rich waters, as indicated by its bright, almost white color.\n\n4. **Vegetation**: The area is marked by patches of dense greenery, particularly noticeable on the mountains and surrounding the river. The inclusion of forested areas suggests a temperate climate with sufficient rainfall.\n\n5. **Surrounding Infrastructure**: Roads extend from the town into other parts of the image, indicating connections to other regions not visible in the photograph. There are clearings and patches that might be used for agriculture or other forms of land development.\n\nThe photograph provides a comprehensive view of a town thriving in a challenging yet scenic landscape, reflecting a balance between development and the natural environment.","title":"View south across Port Valdez from new townsite to pipeline terminus and site of deepwater tanker loading facilities. Four tanker berths will be built between Jackson Point (Peninsula on left) and Saw Island. Large building at lower left in the city is the Harbor View Hospital. The winding path between housing rows is a bicycle trail. The clearing at the right is for new homes for pipeline workers and management personnel.
