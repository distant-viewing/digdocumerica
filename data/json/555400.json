{"path":"555400.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene characterized by vast, slightly wet sands and a large water body, possibly a low tide scenario, underscoring the dynamic nature of coastal landscapes. In the foreground and middle ground, the damp sand reflects the sunlight, creating varying shades of dark blues and grays that form intricate patterns and ripples across the surface. The calm water mirrors the sky, subtly blending the elements of the landscape together.\n\nThere are two figures in the center of the image, quite small in scale compared to the expansive scene. They appear to be engaged in an outdoor activity, possibly digging or gathering something from the sand. Beside them, there are small, bright red elements, possibly equipment or markings related to their activity.\n\nThe background features large, green forest-covered hills rising dramatically on both sides of the water, framing the scene. Thereâ€™s a cliff visible on the left side, vertically distinguished by its sheer drop and dense vegetation. Additionally, a small structure, resembling a house or a lighthouse, is nestled among the trees at the edge of one cliff, adding a sense of human presence and scale to the extent of the natural vista.\n\nThe overall composition and colors of the photograph, including the lush greens of the forests, the dark hues of the wet sand, and the subdued lighting, create a serene, almost contemplative atmosphere, emphasizing the natural beauty and solitude of this coastal environment.","title":"Lowest flow on record for the Columbia River in the fall of 1973 was the result of sparse snowfall and rain the previous year. This beach resulted at Rooster Rock State Park, 18 miles east of Portland.
