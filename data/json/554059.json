{"path":"554059.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a mountainous rural landscape, showing expansive agricultural fields. The fields, varying shades of green and brown, are intricately divided by pathways and smaller plots, suggesting the intensive cultivation of the land. This patchwork of fields extends over rolling hillsides and is bordered by higher mountain ridges that fade into a hazy background, implying a large, sweeping valley.\n\nA distinctive feature in the landscape is a winding road that cuts a clear, sinuous path through the terrain. The road is lined with occasional clusters of vegetation or small structures that hint at a rural community or farmland infrastructure. Along the lower edge of the image, there appears to be a more clustered settlement with structures that are relatively denser than on the fields, likely a small village or a group of farmhouses. The entire scene is enveloped in a soft, purple light, which could indicate the time of the photograph being taken around dawn or dusk, adding a serene and somewhat mysterious aura to the landscape.","title":"Cane fields roll down the side of Puu Kukui to a section of shore where the best beaches of Maui are found.
