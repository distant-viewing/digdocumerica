{"path":"553930.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bird's-eye view of a residential street lined with houses and lush greenery. The street runs down the center of the image, stretching into the distance, flanked by palm trees and other tropical vegetation. Residential homes of various styles and sizes are situated on both sides of the street, displaying sloped roofs and surrounded by green lawns.\n\nThe street itself appears damp, possibly after a rain, and reflects some sunlight, adding a glistening effect. It is a straight roadway with what seems to be two lanes, marked by a centerline. The scene includes a few cars, both parked and in motion, suggesting everyday residential activity. There is no visible signage or people, which places the focus on the urban planning and residential architecture typical of this seemingly peaceful neighborhood.\n\nThe clarity and saturation of colors lend a somewhat vintage tone to the image, reflecting an ambiance that is both tranquil and ordinary. The photograph likely dates from the latter part of the 20th century, judging by the style of the vehicles and the overall quality of the film. The elevated perspective offers a comprehensive view of this serene residential area, highlighting its layout and the natural beauty surrounding it.","title":"Hillside homes on Honolulu's east side.
