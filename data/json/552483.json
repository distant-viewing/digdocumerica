{"path":"552483.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and moody rural landscape under a dynamic sky. The upper half features a sky filled with dense, billowing clouds that are beautifully backlit by the sun, resulting in an array of light and shadow effects. The clouds, ranging from bright white to darker grays, suggest that the weather could be on the verge of changing, possibly forecasting rain or a storm.\n\nIn stark contrast, the lower half of the image shows a wet agricultural field, likely after a rainfall, as evidenced by the shiny, reflective water puddles that follow the furrows of the field. The land is dark and rich in color, suggesting it might be fertile and used for farming. The furrows create a pattern of converging lines that adds perspective and depth to the scene, leading the viewer’s eye toward the horizon.\n\nThe horizon itself is barely distinguishable due to the low light conditions, which may be either dawn or dusk, enhancing the sense of tranquility and isolation. No human activity or buildings are visible in the scene, emphasizing the vastness of the natural landscape contrasted with the densely clouded sky. It’s a scene that invokes a sense of solitude and the natural beauty and power of the environment.","title":"Farmland","placename":"Kickapoo (Ill.)","location":"Kickapoo, Illinois","nn1":["550390","547793","545375","544944","550618","548673","544116","550391","545025","557575","543712","547356","544123","545907","549213","556962"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["half","puddle","storm","field","rainfall","cloud","horizon","farming","rain","dawn"]}
