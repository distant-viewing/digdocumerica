{"path":"544372.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a young child standing next to two large galvanized steel trash cans outside a simple, partially constructed structure. The child, appearing to be a boy, is dressed in an orange shirt and white shorts. His attention is towards one of the cans, his small hand touching its side, possibly exploring or playing.\n\nThe building beside him has unfinished wooden elements and a noticeable piece of plastic sheeting hanging over the entryway, suggesting ongoing construction or makeshift arrangements. There are hints of other equipment and materials nearby, including a large cylindrical tank partially visible to the left of the frame, indicating a setting that may be utilized for work or storage.\n\nThe ground near the child and around the building is sandy, and the background faintly shows a natural landscape, possibly a desert-like environment, under a dusky or twilight sky.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a sense of rural or outdoor living conditions, possibly temporary or in a state of transition, with a focus on the curious engagement of the young child with his immediate surroundings.","title":"Hank Talman's home on Navajo reservation.
