{"path":"552093.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts the inside of a cluttered, eclectic space that appears to be a shed or workshop. The interior is filled with an assortment of items, mostly old and used, scattered and hanging chaotically throughout the area. There is a high density of various objects including tools, household items, baskets, hats, boxes, and what appears to be machinery parts. \n\nThe lighting is natural, coming from a bright opening at the end of the room, possibly a door or a large window, through which a sunny, green outside environment can be glimpsed. This natural light contrasts with the darker, shadow-filled interior filled with objects.\n\nThe floor is barely visible, covered with scattered debris, including broken pieces of wood, discarded items, and possibly some natural detritus that has blown in from outside. Some items of note include a typewriter, a suitcase, metal pans, and what looks like a cereal box among many unidentifiable other pieces. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and disarray, suggesting the space is possibly unused or in the process of being cleared out. The abundance and variety of items hint at a long accumulation over time.","title":"The owner of this huge junk shop on the Kansas River in Bonner Springs died in 1971.
