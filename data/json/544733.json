{"path":"544733.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image showcases a harsh, environmentally impacted landscape, likely a salt flat or dried lake bed. The foreground prominently features cracked, desiccated soil, gleaming with moisture or possibly a saline residue that suggests recent evaporation. Depending on the location and context, these could be salt deposits.\n\nThere is stagnant water scattered unevenly across the surface, reflecting light and adding a shiny texture to the scene. These could suggest remnants of a recent high tide, flood, or rainfall that has partially but not completely evaporated. Some dead branches and foliage are strewn across the mud, which are possibly washed up or left behind as the water receded.\n\nThe horizon in the background meets a large body of water, indicating that this might be an area close to a sea or large lake, suffering from extreme seasonal variations in water levels or possibly long-term environmental changes. Sparse and seemingly lifeless, this landscape evokes a sense of desertion and stark natural beauty under a clear sky.\n\nThis place, devoid of any visible human activity or structures in this shot, emanates a quietude that is only disturbed by natural processes, reflecting a scene of natural desolation or drought. The overall tone and mood conveyed are somber and a bit eerie, illustrating the powerful impact of natural forces and perhaps human influence on landscapes.","title":"Leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544184","544721","543644","550397","544751","548703","552420","544687","557417","545593","552902","544180","555885","555610","544774","543652"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["salt","emanate","depend","residue","gleam","lake","impacte","reced","disturb","strew"]}
