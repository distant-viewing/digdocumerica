{"path":"553363.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a woman standing on a bridge gazing into the distance while holding a young child in a backpack-style carrier. The woman, wearing glasses and a striped shirt, stands slightly turned, showcasing the child in the backpack who is also looking away from the camera. The child appears thoughtful or intrigued by the scenery.\n\nThe backdrop shows a lively river landscape with turbulent, white-capped waters that seem to be rushing through a wooded area. Trees with rich, dense foliage line both sides of the river, contributing to a serene natural setting. The riverbed and the edges appear rocky, adding texture to the scene.\n\nThe bridge where they stand is constructed with metal and painted in light blue, which is chipping and showing signs of rust, particularly near the bottom of the railings, suggesting that it is relatively old or exposed to the elements. The overall composition captures a moment of quiet reflection or observation, set against the dynamic backdrop of moving water and a lush environment.","title":"Naturalists cross runnells bridge on way to woods along the nissitisset river (a branch of the Nashua), where rare ferns lady slippers and other wild flowers can be found","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["554506","553415","548794","542555","550836","543462","544230","544542","557744","551423","553377","558067","552295","553413","546199","543530"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["backpack","child","turbulent","chipp","bridge","moving","riverbed","rush","intrigue","observation"]}
