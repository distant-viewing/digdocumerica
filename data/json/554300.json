{"path":"554300.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of assorted metal scraps and machinery components, primarily appearing to be from vehicles and industrial parts. The heap is dense and chaotic, consisting of various sizes and shapes of metal objects, some of which include recognizable elements such as gear parts, possibly car doors, mechanical joints, wheels, and other fragmented machinery.\n\nThe metal scraps feature an array of rust and wear, indicating they have been exposed to the elements for an extended period. This gives the pile an overall dull gray and brown color palette that's occasionally interrupted by blotches of oxidized green and rust-red. No clear background is visible beyond the pile, suggesting the photo is tightly focused on the scrap heap itself. The pile takes up nearly the entire frame, emphasizing the vast quantity and disorderly nature of the discarded materials.\n\nThis scene conveys a strong visual impact related to themes of waste, recycling, environmental impact, or the lifecycle of industrial products. The overcast sky above contributes to the somber mood of the image, highlighting themes of abandonment and decay. There are no people visible in the image, focusing all attention on the environmental and industrial narrative suggested by the discarded metals.","title":"Flattened cars are ready for recycling.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554318","548109","548147","554301","547625","554346","554357","542585","548753","547611","554335","557308","547610","552740","554320","545059"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["scrap","pile","heap","metal","rust","lifecycle","quantity","machinery","recycling","theme"]}
