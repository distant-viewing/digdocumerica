{"path":"544603.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image of a butterfly perched on a vertical, purple-flowered plant, possibly a type of lavender or salvia. The butterfly is prominently displayed on the left side of the image, featuring an elaborate pattern of yellow and black on its wings, with touches of blue and orange near the edge of the back wings. The wings are partially open, highlighting their intricate design.\n\nIn the composition, the flower stem extends vertically, perfectly centered, adorned with multiple small, tubular purple flowers. This creates a vivid contrast against the predominantly dark, uniform background, which helps to isolate and emphasize the subject of the butterfly and the flower.\n\nOn the right, there are hints of green foliage, possibly leaves from the same plant, adding a touch of natural green to the otherwise dark backdrop. The lighting is subtle yet focuses primarily on the butterfly and the top section of the plant, enhancing the colors and details of the butterflyâ€™s wings and the texture of the flowers.","title":"Butterfly and wild flower near shark valley ranger station","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544553","543603","544619","544514","544479","551381","547818","544517","544618","544566","554839","544614","548284","548283","550464","545707"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","flower","plant","touch","perch","stem","isolate","purple","yellow"]}
