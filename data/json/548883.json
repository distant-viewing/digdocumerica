{"path":"548883.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial demonstration along a rural route. In the foreground, there is a dirt road that stretches horizontally across the frame with an old, rusty utility pole prominently standing on the left, running parallel wires across the top. The background reveals a flat, scarcely vegetated landscape under a wide, clear blue sky.\n\nDominating the scene is a small airplane soaring diagonally from right to left, slightly tilted upwards. This plane is emitting a thick, white smoke trail that creates a stark, dynamic line across the blue sky, enhancing the sense of motion and action. The smoke adds dramatic effect to the image, emphasizing the plane's speed and the direction it's moving. \n\nThe plane is captured in a moment of flight near the utility poles, which might suggest it is flying at a relatively low altitude, possibly as part of an air show or aerial display, given the formation of the smoke indicating a performative aspect. The presence of a clear horizon line places further emphasis on the planeâ€™s exhibition, underscoring both the vastness of the surrounding space and the bold maneuver it is performing.","title":"Crop duster plane over imperial valley farms","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["542793","548881","542717","542501","542500","549072","542577","542719","542495","544491","553873","544606","548841","542504","542506","548469"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","smoke","utility","soar","pole","demonstration","exhibition","airplane","maneuver","fly"]}
