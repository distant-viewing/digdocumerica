{"path":"552614.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photo captures a scene at an outdoor drive-in restaurant. In the foreground, a woman stands smiling, holding a tray with food and drink. She is dressed in a red and black checkered shirt, wearing glasses, and has her hair styled in a simple manner behind her head. Around her waist is a coin changer.\n\nThe environment includes several classic cars parked under a large, roofed structure, indicating a bay area of a drive-in restaurant. The cars are varied in model and color, including shades of black, red, blue, and more. This suggests a period setting that could range from the 1950s to 1970s, a common era for such cars and dining experiences.\n\nIn the background, further details of the location are visible. The drive-in is situated in a spacious area with a view of mountains and a relatively open sky. The framework of the roof is metal, typical of drive-in shelters designed to protect diners from weather elements while they enjoy their meals outdoors.\n\nA general atmosphere of casual, nostalgic dining emerges from the composition of the photograph, echoing a popular cultural experience in mid-20th-century America.","title":"The young waitress at the local a&w snack bar is saving her earnings for out-of-town schooling","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["547855","547862","554482","553211","547851","548544","546183","554188","556816","556538","557908","555422","547779","557684","554187","557766"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["drive","restaurant","dining","experience","1950","diner","car","in","tray","echo"]}
