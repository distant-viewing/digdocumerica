{"path":"556699.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a waiting area, possibly a bus or train station. The central figure is a young woman seated on a suitcase. She is wearing a bright yellow trench coat over casual clothes and is absorbed in reading a newspaper, which features several photographs. Her hair falls just past her shoulders and partially obscures her face as she looks down. \n\nBeside the woman, there is a clear, plastic-covered umbrella and a brown handbag, suggesting it might be a rainy day. She also wears simple red flats and blue jeans, and is seated in a manner that indicates a casual and possibly prolonged wait. \n\nIn the background, there are multiple other passengers. They are seated on benches, some engaged in conversation, others looking on or involved in their own activities. The surrounding environment looks stark and functional with a tiled floor, and it gives a sense of a crowded, public place. The overall mood conveys a typical day of travel with people waiting and preparing for their journey.","title":"Passenger perches on her suitcase while waiting for a train at the 30th street station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
