{"path":"547249.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive, symmetrically designed formal garden leading up to an elegant estate house. The view is taken from an elevated perspective, looking down a long, straight central grassy aisle that serves as the spine of the garden.\n\nThe central pathway is flanked by smaller, manicured pathways with geometric shapes, which connect various sections of the garden. On the sides of these pathways, meticulously maintained hedges, flower beds, and ornamental trees can be seen. The garden is rich with a variety of vibrant green hues, and small groups of people are scattered around, suggesting a leisurely atmosphere.\n\nThe main estate house at the end of the garden path is a large, traditional building with multiple windows and a central portico, supported by columns, hinting at neoclassical architectural influences.\n\nThe large, open lawn area in the foreground of the image contains a few trees and displays a softer, less manicured appearance compared to the structured garden paths and plots that surround it. Tiny figures of people are visible, enjoying the open space and natural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition is centered, with the main elements of the photo (the pathways, trees, and house) aligned in a way that draws the viewer's eye straight to the house, emphasizing the grandeur and controlled beauty of the estate and garden. The whole scene is encapsulated by a broad expanse of sky which gives a sense of openness and calm to the setting.","title":"Aerial view of Mt.
