{"path":"548410.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene likely from the 1970s, given the style of vehicles and signage. The scene is in what appears to be a densely populated city, possibly New York City, as indicated by the high-rise buildings and the iconic yellow taxis.\n\nForeground: The street is filled with a mix of vehicles, including several yellow cabs and cars from the 1970s era, distinguishable by their boxy shapes and chrome bumpers. A large dumpster loaded with debris, possibly from construction or renovation, is on the right side of the street, suggesting ongoing urban development or maintenance. Pedestrians, including a woman in a pink outfit crossing the street, navigate around the cars and construction, going about their daily activities.\n\nMiddle ground: The busy street continues with more yellow cabs, other vehicles, and lined with various shops and businesses. The hustle and bustle of the scene emphasize a typical busy day in an urban environment with people walking along the sidewalks. \n\nBackground: Several tall buildings dominate the skyline, featuring a mix of architectural styles typical of mid-20th century American cities. Visible signage, such as one for a hotel, hints at the commercial nature of the area. The density of the buildings and the narrowness of the visible sky suggest a typical downtown setting in a major city.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its busy street level contrasted against the vertical lines of the towering buildings captures the dynamic and somewhat chaotic essence of city life during this period. The presence of construction and a variety of transport options also speaks to the constant change and activity inherent in urban areas.","title":"Midtown Manhattan--garbage trailer container in right foreground","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","554314","554331","554315","549848","554330","548331","549873","549849","554297","546626","549882","549874","554329","549859","551135"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["cab","stroot","city","street","construction","signage","dumpster","boxy","taxis","1970"]}
