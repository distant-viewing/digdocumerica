{"path":"549813.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape scene featuring the East River in New York City. In the foreground, two garbage barges, heavily laden with trash, are being pushed and navigated by a red and black tugboat. The barges are densely packed with what appears to be white bags of waste, filling the entire deck of each barge and creating a stark visual contrast with the river water.\n\nIn the background, the riverbank is lined with high-rise buildings, predominantly residential apartment complexes, characterized by their uniform and modern architectural style. The buildings on the left most prominently extend along the river's edge, presenting a sharp drop off into the water, enhancing the urban waterfront aesthetic.\n\nThe distant horizon shows a progressive fade into a pale blue skyline, dotted lightly with other high-rise buildings which decrease in visibility as they recede into the distance. The photograph has a hazy quality, likely due to atmospheric conditions or the time of day when the photo was taken, which softens the further elements of the cityscape and provides a muted backdrop against the vivid activity in the river. The perspective is likely taken from a high vantage point, looking down onto the river, which emphasizes the bustling, yet methodical, transport activity along this urban waterway.","title":"Garbage scows being towed down the east river are seen from the 59th street bridge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549824","549814","549783","549817","557309","549799","553865","549822","549819","548390","549808","551170","549825","546785","548357","549816"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["barge","river","cityscape","decrease","drop","tugboat","push","rise","apartment","soften"]}
