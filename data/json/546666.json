{"path":"546666.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene that appears to be set on a cold or rainy day. In the foreground, there is a woman positioned to the right, facing away from the camera. She is dressed in a dark coat and skirt, with a red hat, and is carrying a large brown paper bag in one hand. The woman appears to be in motion, possibly walking towards a bus.\n\nIn the center of the image, a bus marked \"Shirley Express\" is prominently visible. It is branded with the logos of the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation. This bus is parked, and through the rear window, we can see several passengers inside.\n\nThe environment suggests a desolate, possibly chilly day, as evidenced by the barren trees in the background and what appears to be snow or rain falling, visible against the darker background. The ground is wet, suggesting recent precipitation.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo carries a somewhat somber tone, highlighted by the weather conditions and the lone figure approaching the bus. The image might evoke feelings of everyday travel or commuting in less-than-ideal weather conditions. The parking lot in which this scene takes place is otherwise empty, underscoring a sense of isolation or dreariness.","title":"Park and ride metro bus station, Springfield, VA.
