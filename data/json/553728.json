{"path":"553728.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a birdâ€™s-eye view of an urban area extending into a valley with distinct industrial and residential zones. The image portrays a large, bustling city with a prominent, straight roadway running vertically through the center, flanked by numerous smaller streets and blocks filled with houses. The scene is dense with buildings and green spaces scattered throughout the residential areas.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, the terrain slopes gently upward, transitioning into mountainous or hilly regions that are less developed. The right half features flat, extensive fields stretching out into the distance, suggesting agricultural activity, with few sparse structures. The skyline is dominated by mountains in the far background, slightly obscured by a haze.\n\nA standout feature in the image is the industrial area positioned roughly in the middle-right part of the city, identifiable by a tall chimney emitting a plume of dark smoke that trails over the cityscape. This suggests some form of heavy industry, possibly a power plant or manufacturing facility.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a blend of residential, commercial, and industrial developments within a topographically varied landscape, under a clear or slightly hazy sky.","title":"H-1 Freeway, like all Hawaii's highways, is virtually free of billboards.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["542674","551174","544073","544791","545354","542673","555755","549523","553300","553936","550553","548344","549979","553559","544502","553060"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","half","roadway","block","manufacturing","plume","chimney","zone","haze","cityscape"]}
