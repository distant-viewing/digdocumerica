{"path":"548286.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a flooded rural area under bright sunlight. A young person is seen paddling a small rowboat through the water, which has submerged what appears to be a yard. The person paddling the boat wears a short-sleeved shirt and trousers, hinting at a casual, warm-weather day.\n\nSurrounding the person is a landscape overwhelmed by floodwaters, reflecting sunlight and casting an array of sparkles across the surface. In the background stands a wooden, weather-beaten farmhouse or shed, surrounded by a wooden fence that is partially submerged, reinforcing the severity of the flooding. The area looks like it might typically be a farmyard, given the structures and fenced areas.\n\nTo the left foreground of the image, part of another wooden structure is visible, possibly a ramp or another building component. Electrical or phone poles can be seen both standing upright and leaning, indicating possible damage or neglect.\n\nThis scene evokes a sense of disruption and adaptation, as evidenced by the use of a boat for transportation in what would normally be a walking area. The overall mood is serene yet somewhat somber, capturing a moment of resilience in the face of natural adversity.","title":"Flood conditions at gRand pointe caused by a combination of \"back-up\" water from the recently opened bonnet carre spillway and extra heavy rains.
