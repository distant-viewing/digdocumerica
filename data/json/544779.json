{"path":"544779.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a polluted water body with substantial foam and debris. The location appears to be a canal or small river, with the contamination particularly noticeable due to the presence of foam and murky water, indicating environmental degradation. In the middle of the scene, there is a large, rectangular, abandoned object that resembles a piece of discarded industrial equipment, contributing to the polluted state of the water. The background features a stark industrial setting with multiple tall smokestacks emitting smoke, further suggesting industrial pollution as a probable cause for the state of the waterway.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by the foamy, polluted water, leading towards the industrial landscape in the distance. There's harsh natural light casting shadows and creating a high-contrast scene. The sky is partly cloudy but mostly clear, with noticeable contrails that perhaps hint at an area with frequent overhead air traffic. Vegetation is sparse and limited to a few bushes and trees lining the edges of the water body, indicating a somewhat neglected or harsh environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its emphasis on environmental pollution framed against an industrial backdrop, serves as a compelling visual narrative about environmental neglect and industrial impact on natural water bodies.","title":"The discharge point (into the South Platte River) of the Denver metro sewage treatment plant","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["549624","552989","550369","544775","545168","550206","550371","548090","552019","551562","546116","547907","551561","552127","543819","550193"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["foam","pollution","water","state","contamination","limit","body","canal","degradation","cause"]}
