{"path":"555707.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The image showcases a breathtaking aerial view over a coastal and mountainous landscape, dominated by deep blue waters. It appears to be a large body of water, possibly a sea or ocean, featuring several key elements. \n\nIn the forefront, there is a peninsula densely covered with coniferous forests, jutting into the water. This peninsula is characterized by its rugged, mountainous terrain and is connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land that seems partially covered by a road or path, hinting at minimal human activity.\n\nTowards the middle of the body of water, a large ship is visible, creating a wake pattern across the surface, indicating movement away from the peninsula. This suggests the area is navigable and used for maritime transport.\n\nThe background is dominated by a mountain range with snow-capped peaks, suggesting a cold or temperate climate. The mountains provide a majestic backdrop to the scene, enhancing the natural, unspoiled beauty of the area.\n\nThe expansive and open water, ample greenspaces, and towering mountains all combine to convey a sense of serene isolation and natural splendor, typical of a remote, wilderness area. The overall composition of the photograph, with its vivid colors and clear boundaries between land, water, and mountains, offers a stunning representation of a pristine natural environment.","title":"View west across the western-most point of Busby Island some 27 miles from the tanker port opposite Valdez. The ship in the distance is the tanker \"Alaska Standard\", which is 255 feet long and carries 1,078 Barrels of petroleum products (not crude oil) to coastal communities. Pipeline tankers will be as much as 900 feet long and 140 feet wide and carry up to 940,000 Barrels of crude oil.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555709","555710","550640","555689","555712","543374","542882","555692","555706","554020","548604","556906","555690","555696","543432","554024"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["peninsula","mountain","water","land","jut","representation","wake","strip","boundary","ship"]}
