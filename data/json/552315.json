{"path":"552315.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a man proudly displaying a large salmon he has presumably caught. The man, who appears to be middle-aged, stands outdoors under a blue sky with scattered clouds. He is wearing glasses, a cap, and a plaid shirt over a light-colored t-shirt.\n\nThe man holds the fish horizontally in front of him, supporting its body with both hands. The fish, with its shiny, speckled skin and gaping mouth, is a substantial size, nearly as wide as the man is tall. Its eyes are wide open, and it looks freshly caught given its glistening appearance.\n\nThe background is mostly clear sky with a hint of vegetation or structures (possibly the top of a fence or low buildings) visible at the bottom edge of the frame, just over the man's shoulders. This setting gives a sense of a spacious outdoor environment, likely near a body of water where the fishing took place. The focus and lighting in the photo emphasize the man and the fish, celebrating the catch as the central element of the composition.","title":"Al Brewer displays a 35 pound Chinook salmon caught by his wife on the lower Skagit River near La Conner in northern Puget Sound.","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552329","545180","552323","553095","552322","550297","552274","548114","552321","554523","552320","545165","543627","554519","543484","554520"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","man","salmon","catch","skin","mouth","t","shoulder","shirt","fishing"]}
