{"path":"552077.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene with multiple elements that offer a gritty, industrial feel. Predominantly in the frame are a series of tow trucks lined up along the right side of the street. These trucks carry large loads of crushed and compacted cars, stacked unevenly on their backs. The cars on the trucks appear heavily damaged and compressed, likely ready for scrap or recycling.\n\nThe street itself bends slightly to the left, with a quiet flow of traffic visible. There are a few vintage cars from around the 1970s traveling on the road, suggesting the period when the photo was taken. The cars feature classic designs, with prominent grilles and elongated bodies, painted in various light and dark tones.\n\nThe scene is bordered by lush green trees, adding a touch of nature to an otherwise industrial ambiance. To the right, there's a substantial brick building, adding to the urban environment. Additionally, there's a streetlamp and a few electrical and telephone poles lined up along the road.\n\nThe overall lighting presents a bright sunny day, casting deep shadows on the road and adding further depth to the three-dimensional piles of scrapped cars on the trucks. The quality of the photograph and the content offers a nostalgic glimpse into the past, emphasizing themes of industry and the everyday movement within a city.","title":"12th Street in the early morning looking south toward the Kansas River.
