{"path":"551608.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view showcasing a dramatic natural landscape where a river merges with a larger body of water, possibly a lake or an ocean. The river, flowing from the top-left of the frame, deposits silt and sediment into the larger water body, creating a vivid color gradient from brown to dark blue. \n\nThe surrounding terrain is densely forested, giving way to clearings where small structures, possibly homes or other buildings, are visible. These structures are located primarily on the right side of the image, sporadically interspersed among green patches that are likely fields or lawns. A road or path appears to wind gently through the landscape, accessible by a bridge over the river.\n\nThe shoreline is rugged and natural, with visible debris like logs strewn along the beach area, indicating a possibly remote or less developed region. The distinct color contrast between the reddish-brown of the river and the deep blue of the larger water body, along with the lush greens of the forest, make this image striking in terms of its natural beauty and serene isolation.","title":"Small, muddy river empties into Lake Superior.","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["555705","550885","550623","552838","550524","550562","549456","550580","550527","556964","553452","542909","550593","548916","542881","550577"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","deposit","body","term","sediment","clearing","gradient","lawn","log","way"]}
