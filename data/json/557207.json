{"path":"557207.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people in an outdoor setting during what appears to be the cooler months due to the bare trees and the clothing the people are wearing. The scene is set in a somewhat barren landscape featuring a large, open field with patches of grass and a lot of bare ground showing through. \n\nThe people, about a dozen in number, are spread across the field and are engaged in various activities. Some are walking in pairs or small groups, while others seem to be standing and possibly conversing. The attire of the individuals includes jackets and coats, suggesting it is cold.\n\nThe background consists of a wooded area with leafless trees, giving the photograph an overall dormant or muted feel. No buildings or other man-made structures are visible, suggesting this location might be a rural or semi-wilderness area. The sky is overcast, contributing to the chilly ambiance of the scene.\n\nCompositionally, the photograph is dominated by the natural scenery â€“ the vast field and the skeletal trees. The humans in the scene add a dynamic element, indicating leisure or perhaps a group exploration of the area. The muted colors of nature blend with the mostly neutral colors of the people's clothing, emphasizing the subdued, possibly early spring, season.","title":"Members of the National Audubon Society walk across a portion of the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary at GRand Island, Nebraska. They are planning to view some of the 250,000 lesser sandhill cranes that stopped here on their migratory route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Yukon Territory and Siberia. The birds are attracted by the Platte River, which has a marshy and shallow habitat. The area is threatened by a possible project to dredge and dam the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["557206","557939","557005","544821","557659","554665","557985","554670","552033","543234","554715","552407","554671","554667","551764","554669"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["field","group","people","dozen","month","clothing","pair","scenery","exploration","lot"]}
