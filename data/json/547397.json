{"path":"547397.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somber scene of a cemetery at dusk. The primary focus is on a large, old-fashioned water pump in the foreground, painted in a metallic finish, possibly cast iron, exhibiting a traditional hand-operated design with a long handle and a spout.\n\nThe background features an expansive cemetery dotted with various grave markers, headstones, and monuments, some elaborate and others more modest. Notable among them is a prominent obelisk-shaped monument towards the right side of the image. The landscape is lush with green grass, suggesting either spring or summer, and is bathed in the warm, glowy light of the setting sun.\n\nThe sky, a significant element in this composition, displays an awe-inspiring mix of colors and cloud formations, with shades of blue, orange, and purple blending together, creating a dramatic backdrop. Sunlight pierces through the clouds, casting long shadows on the ground and highlighting the textures of the grass and monumentsâ€”adding a layer of depth and contrast to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photo is one of reflective tranquility and peacefulness, typical of a cemetery environment but accentuated here by the dramatic lighting and the solitary positioning of the water pump in the foreground, which adds a historical or timeless element to the image.","title":"Cemetery on the south edge of Grafton, in the farming country west of Lincoln.
