{"path":"543184.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic coastal view. In the foreground, we can see rugged cliffs partially covered with wild bushes and flowers. A prominent, dark rocky outcrop juts into the sea on the left side of the image, around which the ocean water swirls. The background features an expansive view of a calm ocean with gentle waves forming whitecaps as they break. Parallel lines of surf lead your gaze into the distance.\n\nThe coastline continues into the backdrop with dramatic cliffs that border the ocean. On the top of these cliffs and rolling hills, the terrain is marked by sparse vegetation that appears sunlit, suggesting this image was captured in the late afternoon. The hillsides are bathed in a warm golden light, enhancing the undulating contours of the landscape.\n\nThe sky, visible at the top right corner of the image, is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day. The overall composition of this photograph, with its combination of rugged natural elements and serene ocean views, portrays a tranquil yet dynamic coastal scene, likely intended to capture the beauty and majesty of this picturesque location.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543049","543061","545125","543297","545129","543291","543300","542917","545226","543304","543249","543428","543080","545222","545230","543290"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","cliff","whitecap","surf","majesty","swirl","outcrop","gaze","hillside","combination"]}
