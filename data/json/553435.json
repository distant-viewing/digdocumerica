{"path":"553435.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an idyllic, nostalgic scene of outdoor recreation by a river. In the foreground, a child in red swim trunks stands on a tree trunk that slightly leans over the river, possibly preparing to jump into the water. On the sandy riverbank to the left, there are three other children. One appears to be playing with sand, another standing close to the water's edge, and the third is slightly behind the others, possibly interacting or observing.\n\nIn the river itself, a person is enjoying the water seated on a blue inflatable ring, drifting gently. The surrounding environment is lush and green, dominated by tall, dense trees that reflect off the tranquil, murky water of the river. The background shows the river stretching away into a slightly more open area, dappled with sunlight filtering through the canopy above.\n\nThe overall atmosphere evokes a sense of relaxed, summertime leisure and childhood adventure, typical of a day spent by the water in a natural setting. The perspective and composition of the photograph highlight both the individual activities and the collective enjoyment of the natural setting.","title":"This favorite spot for swimming in the Squannacook River is located near Groton in the Town Forest Preserve.
