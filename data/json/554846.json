{"path":"554846.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photo captures a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man with a deeply weathered and expressive face. His skin is quite rugged and shows signs of extensive sun exposure. The man has short, curly, salt-and-pepper hair and is wearing a white, slightly tattered t-shirt with a rip over the right shoulder.\n\nHe has a stern, intense gaze directed towards the camera, with slight squinting that could suggest sunlight in his eyes or the intensity of his stare. His face is slightly grimy which indicates he might be engaged in physical labor. The background is softly focused but reveals a natural, outdoor setting with green shrubbery and trees that suggest a rural environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a strong sense of rugged individualism and perhaps hints at a life full of hard work and exposure to the elements. It seems to capture not just the man's appearance, but a palpable sense of his life's experiences and environment.","title":"A resident of Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556563","542784","549054","542613","556443","543701","552872","547282","547179","552103","548616","544409","553055","557173","547028","553605"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["exposure","face","salt","portrait","shrubbery","skin","gaze","intensity","t","experience"]}
