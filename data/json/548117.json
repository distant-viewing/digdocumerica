{"path":"548117.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and visually striking scene of sailing at sunset. The sun, large and luminous, sets low in the sky, casting a vibrant orange glow that encompasses the scene. In the foreground, a sailboat is featured prominently, its sail fully unfurled and filled by the wind. The sail is striped horizontally in shades of red and white, with numbers '1546' and letters 'ALA' visible on it, possibly indicating its registration or club affiliation.\n\nThe boat is seen gliding on water that reflects the sun's rays, creating a shimmering pathway of light that stretches towards the viewer. This gives the water an appearance of glistening gold.\n\nIn the background, faint silhouettes of land and industrial structures, including cranes, are visible, indicating that this scene is near a port or an industrial area. The mountains in the distant horizon are barely visible through the haze, adding a sense of depth and scale to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is both calm and dramatic, characterized by the contrasting elements of natural beauty and industrial presence, encapsulated in the warm tones of the sunset.","title":"Sunset on the Columbia River at Vancouver","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553990","552293","552344","544665","548118","543613","552039","545170","544669","544251","543411","550758","553991","552343","551541","552038"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sail","sunset","unfurl","affiliation","club","glide","ray","sun","registration","encompass"]}
