{"path":"558067.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph is taken from a bridge, focusing on both the structural elements of the bridge and the serene natural scene below. The bridgeâ€™s thick, teal-colored metal beams frame the left side of the image, intersecting at various angles, and showing signs of wear such as chips in the paint and mild rust.\n\nBelow the bridge, a calm river winds through a lush woodland. The waters are still, reflecting the grayish overcast sky. Along the river, dense green foliage dominates the background, with leaves appearing in varying shades of green. \n\nOn the river, two canoes are visible, each carrying multiple occupants. The canoers, though distant and partially obscured by the overhanging foliage and the perspective of the shot, appear to be engaged in leisurely paddling, adding a dynamic human element to the otherwise tranquil natural setting. The scene encapsulates a peaceful outdoor activity juxtaposed with industrial features, illustrating a harmony between human activity and natural surroundings.","title":"Keel haulers club members are framed from the bridge across ira road as they paddle the cuyahoga river north of Akron the river is part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area between Cleveland and Akron.
