{"path":"549020.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image shows a tranquil scene captured during sunset. In the foreground, a large electricity pylon stands prominently against the sky. The pylon is of a typical lattice structure, made from metal with a narrow base widening at the top, designed to support overhead power lines. Multiple cables extend from the top of the pylon, splaying out into the sky, creating a visual effect that leads the viewer's eye towards the background.\n\nThe background features a canvas of the sunset sky, painted in deep blue hues gradually transitioning to lighter shades near the horizon where the sun has just set. The silhouette of a mountain range can be seen against the evening sky, breaking the horizon with gentle undulations.\n\nAdding to the photograph's atmospheric quality are lens flares and light artifacts likely caused by the sun's position relative to the camera lens; these elements overlay the image with a slightly surreal, dreamlike effect. A subtle crescent moon is also visible in the sky, enhancing the serene and peaceful ambiance of the scene.","title":"Transmission lines near searchlight","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["544011","543926","544020","549011","548146","543903","553830","544613","547732","547936","553028","543728","544703","542524","544695","544355"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pylon","lens","sunset","overlay","moon","undulation","sun","canva","flare","artifact"]}
