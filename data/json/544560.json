{"path":"544560.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a lush green landscape, primarily comprising dense foliage and trees that dominate the terrain. In this largely verdant environment, there is a notable man-made presence characterized by a road leading through the woods and branching off into a parking area smoothly integrated into the naturally detailed environment. The parking area is expansive, with delineated spaces where several cars are parked, suggesting the area is potentially a recreational or scenic viewing spot.\n\nPositioned adjacent to this parking area, there is a narrow water body that appears man-made given its straight alignment and structured sides. The water body is flanked by a narrow strip of land or walkway, leading to a small developed region that includes several low-rise buildings and other structures, likely facilities or amenities for visitors.\n\nThis site is beautifully juxtaposed with the surrounding greenery, indicating an area where nature and development coexist meticulously, potentially designed for public enjoyment and nature conservation. The overall setting implies a well-maintained park or similar preserve where visitors can explore natural surroundings with certain conveniences at hand.","title":"Aerojet General installation near the Auhinga Trail area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550757","558047","556966","556937","546718","543767","544446","556955","556931","544544","556920","556970","556915","556918","556934","556904"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["parking","visitor","convenience","alignment","amenity","conservation","strip","walkway","enjoyment","spot"]}
