{"path":"544729.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a coastal or lakeside scene captured at dusk or dawn, based on the soft, dim lighting throughout the image. The composition primarily showcases a wet, muddy terrain that stretches along the water's edge, leading into the distance where a calm body of water meets a clear horizon.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by dark, textured mudflats with varying patterns, suggesting recent water movements such as receding tides or waves. Thin layers of water create small reflective pools on the surface of the mud, and these mirror the muted lighting of the sky. These characteristics indicate that this may be a natural salt flat or a similar sediment-rich area. \n\nThe left side of the image shows a short ascent comprising of a rugged hill or bluff lined with dark, sparse vegetation, contributing to the natural, untouched feel of the scene. On the mudflats themselves, two vertical poles can be seen, which might be markers or stakes related to fishing or measurement activities, though their exact purpose isn't clear from the image alone.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a remote, tranquil natural environment, emphasizing textures and subtle interplays of light and shadow across the landscape.","title":"Sewage enters the bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544687","545294","542869","545183","545095","552192","545656","543652","552147","553867","547663","544765","550788","548703","550389","550345"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mudflat","ascent","stake","measurement","salt","tide","marker","characteristic","mud","water"]}
