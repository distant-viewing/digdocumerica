{"path":"553971.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a densely built-up area. The photograph captures a variety of residential and possibly commercial buildings tightly packed into a grid layout of streets. A distinct aspect of the photograph is the intense, reddish-brown color of the soil, which contrasts vividly with the green trees scattered throughout the area.\n\nIn the foreground, larger industrial or commercial buildings with flat, expansive roofs are visible, likely warehouses or similar facilities. As the image moves towards the center and background, the structure sizes reduce, suggesting these areas are primarily residential. The houses generally have small yards and are closely spaced, following a typical suburban pattern.\n\nThe surrounding landscape beyond the immediate urban area blends into patches of agriculture or undeveloped land, indicating the outskirts of a town. The roads within the area are well-defined, curving around the terrain, and there's a clear presence of vehicle traffic visible on one of the main roads forming loopsâ€”a sign of an active, possibly thriving community.\n\nOverall, the aerial perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the town's layout, building density, and land use, surrounded by a natural landscape that indicates a semi-rural or suburban setting.","title":"Kauai, known as the \"garden isle\", grows sugar cane and pineapple","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["553935","553692","556948","546399","558057","545914","558369","552730","558112","550555","553937","552734","553936","549523","553693","553938"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["layout","town","loops","warehous","reduce","overview","land","thrive","outskirt","agriculture"]}
