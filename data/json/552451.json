{"path":"552451.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and slightly somber setting of a graveyard. In the foreground, there are several gravestones; two prominent ones are captured close-up. These gravestones are rectangular and upright, with the nearest having a rounded top and the slightly further one having a more complex structure with a tiered base and a pointed top.\n\nThe background features a small, simple one-story building that could possibly be a chapel or another related structure, given the context of the cemetery. The building is white with a steep gable roof, and a small, muted window is visible. Beside the building, a tall dead tree trunk stands prominently, stripped of most of its branches and bark, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant green grass and the lush, living trees that frame the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photo is quiet and reflective, amplified by the bright daylight casting soft shadows on the grass. The setting suggests a rural or semi-rural environment where nature and man-made structures coexist quietly.","title":"One of the two graveyards of hermon","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["554792","557942","552016","557184","552017","557758","547420","550731","548239","554824","550364","554790","552487","557089","558040","547417"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["gravestone","stripp","amplify","caste","cemetery","liive","coexist","grass","bark","top"]}
