{"path":"548949.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a water management infrastructure. The main feature of the image is a canal and dam system, which appears to be designed for water diversion or control. The canal, filled with water, snakes from the top left to the bottom center of the image. To the right, a large body of water reflects sunlight, suggesting it could be a reservoir or lake.\n\nAt the bottom center, there is a dam or control station, with a small building that likely contains operational controls or equipment. Water flows through this point, and there's a noticeable drop, indicating a change in water levels that creates a small waterfall effect. The shorelines around the water bodies are barren and devoid of vegetation, consisting mainly of dirt and rock which are sculpted in ways that suggest erosion or human alteration for managing water flow.\n\nThere are pathways or roads that run alongside the canal, seemingly providing access to the facility at the center. Small patches of greenery are visible at the bottom of the image near the building, suggesting some landscaping or attempt to stabilize the soil.\n\nThe overall setting is very industrial, with no visible habitation or recreational use. The focus seems entirely on water management and possibly electricity generation, given the infrastructure present. This facility might play a crucial role in local water distribution or hydroelectric power production, essential in arid or semi-arid regions where water resource management is critical.","title":"A diversion dam on the Colorado River.
