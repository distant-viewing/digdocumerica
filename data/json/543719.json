{"path":"543719.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures three young individuals riding bicycles down a rural dirt road. The setting is serene and lush, with mature trees lining the road, their branches starting to fill out with the green of early spring or late fall. The road itself is unpaved, dusty, and appears to be a country lane.\n\nOn the left, there's a teen boy biking closer to the left edge of the road; he’s looking back towards the camera, his expression suggesting he’s engaging with someone either off-camera or towards the rear. He is dressed casually with a dark sweater and light-colored pants. Following him in the center, another teen boy is positioned further along the road; he is closer to the middle, pedaling forward, wearing a striped sweater and darker pants. To the right, a third person is maneuvering a bicycle closer to the road's edge, dressed in a lighter-colored shirt and pants, also making forward progress.\n\nTheir surroundings hint at a rustic setting, possibly a farm or a rural residential area. On the left side of the photograph, a fenced area with sparse grass and a few scattered buildings suggest a farm-like environment, adding a pastoral feel to the scene. The setting is tranquil and wide-open, emblematic of a peaceful, rural lifestyle. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows are soft but elongated, enriching the idyllic quality of the scene.","title":"Bicycling on rural road","placename":"Norwood (Colo.)","location":"Norwood, Colorado","nn1":["543715","551032","546783","552340","547209","550069","545973","544680","550689","555500","551105","549247","543841","555499","554690","548574"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["road","bicycle","sweater","farm","pants","boy","pedal","country","bike","elongate"]}
