{"path":"545907.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and scenic landscape under a dramatic sky. The image is divided into several natural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, there appears to be a bank of a river or lake, where a silhouetted figure stands alone on the edge, possibly observing the water or the scenery. This figure adds a sense of scale and solitude to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by an expansive river reflecting the blue of the sky. The river curves gently and flows between rugged terrains.\n\nOn either side of the river, towering cliffs and rocky outcrops rise steeply. These landforms are detailed with textures that suggest erosion and weathering, indicating their ancient geological history. The cliffs to the right are darker, catching less light, whereas the ones on the left glow slightly under the sunlight, enhancing the contrast between the two sides.\n\nAbove all, the sky takes up a significant portion of the composition and is adorned with a spectacular display of clouds. These clouds vary in density and formation, ranging from fluffy, white, cumulus clouds to streakier, wispy types, all set against a deep, clear blue sky.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful yet awe-inspiring, highlighting the dramatic interaction between earth and sky. The presence of the lone figure emphasizes human smallness in comparison to the vastness of the natural world.","title":"Santa Elena Canyon rises above the Rio GRande River.","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544905","543712","550391","545639","545783","550592","550390","545375","552894","552906","547047","554399","544393","544155","557575","552483"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["river","figure","cliff","cloud","cumulus","comparison","awe","landform","outcrop","weathering"]}
