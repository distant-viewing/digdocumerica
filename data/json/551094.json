{"path":"551094.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of youth baseball players in uniform practicing in a unique urban setting. Four boys dressed in white baseball uniforms with green details and numerals stand in a variety of poses, each attempting to catch a ball. Each uniform also features what appears to be a team or sponsor name, though it's only partially visible (\"CELAN...\" on one uniform).\n\nThe setting is a street with paved roads, possibly in a small town, as depicted by modest commercial and residential buildings in the background. There’s an old, weathered building across the street with a sign that reads \"Deals\" on its side. Next to it, there’s a railway crossing sign and a general store-like building marked by a visible sign, although the name is not fully legible.\n\nIn the background, utility poles and lush green trees are visible, along with a hill that rises prominently, filling the skyline behind the buildings. The backdrop provides a stark contrast to the urban elements foreground, underscoring a blend of natural and human-made environments.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggested by the photograph is one of a tight-knit community engaging in everyday leisure activities, underscored by the casual mingling of a recreational sport with town life. Notably, the scene is framed under a structure, likely a bridge or similar architectural element, adding a framing element to the composition.","title":"Cedar grove little league warms up before the game.
