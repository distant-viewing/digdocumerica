{"path":"547188.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of playful activity at a playground, focusing closely on a child from behind as they climb a jungle gym. The child is hanging from high, curved, metal bars, gripping them with small hands. The wear indicates frequent use of the bars. The child is dressed in a casual outfit suitable for outdoor activities: white pants, a green jacket, and a beige bucket hat. Striped socks peek out above worn brown boots, suggesting an element of childlike fashion or preference.\n\nTo the left, partly out of focus and partially shown, another child can be seen engaged in their climb. This second child appears to be wearing a red-patterned garment, which provides a subtle contrast to the more muted colors worn by the main subject.\n\nIn the background, the environment is slightly blurred, hinting at a spacious public park setting with grassy areas and possibly some trees. There appears to be an overcast sky, contributing to the overall soft lighting of the scene, which focuses the viewer's attention on the children and their energetic activity.\n\nThe composition uses a shallow depth of field to isolate the foreground, emphasizing the action and physical interaction of the children with the playground equipment. This choice conveys a sense of movement and immediacy, capturing the essence of childhood play.","title":"Lincoln park playground","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551725","549674","549274","548965","555931","549666","545867","555901","556290","557410","546562","555928","543791","551720","556166","544354"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","playground","climb","bar","preference","immediacy","sock","grip","garment","choice"]}
