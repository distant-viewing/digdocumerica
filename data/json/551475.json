{"path":"551475.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a pedestrian walkway paved with red bricks. On either side of the walkway, there are large white circular planters filled with bright red and pink flowers. Wooden benches are situated next to these planters, and several people are using these benches. On the left side of the image, there is a bench with two people seated: one person is dressed in blue and the other in yellow. On the right, a bench accommodates four people engaged in a conversation. There is also a woman in white, possibly walking past them. A lone man walks along the walkway on the far right of the image. The background features a narrow street adjacent to the walkway, showing just a hint of the tires of a vehicle and a bit of open space suggesting more of an urban environment. The lighting is bright, suggesting a sunny day, and the composition captures a relaxed, urban outdoor setting, possibly during a lunch break or a casual day out. The presence of the people and the casual demeanor suggest a comfortable, public space meant for rest and social interaction.","title":"Benches and planters outside Northern States Power Company on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["550751","551815","550755","551803","551477","557266","550759","551713","557257","551496","549988","551705","551800","551635","549516","549926"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["walkway","bench","planter","people","lunch","space","break","tire","rest","demeanor"]}
