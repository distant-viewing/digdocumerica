{"path":"543464.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two older adults, a man and a woman, who are engaged in examining or peeking through a door of a historic wooden building. The man, dressed in a light-colored shirt and trousers, gently places his hands on the woman's back as she leans forward to look closer through the door. The woman wears a light blue blouse and white pants. The building features ornate, dark wooden architectural elements, including decorative trim around the door and a textured exterior.\n\nThe structure of the building suggests a blend of rustic and Victorian styles, with a steeply pitched shingle roof and a complex wooden facade. Next to the door, a wooden stair leads up to the threshold, indicative of the building's age and design.\n\nIn the background, another similar wooden structure is partially visible, enhanced by a clear blue sky which suggests a warm, sunny day. The setting appears to be a historical town or heritage site, preserved for educational or touristic purposes. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of curiosity and appreciation for history, as demonstrated by the individuals' interest in the architectural details of the building.","title":"\"ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["557702","548242","556276","554192","551337","548438","543469","555295","544410","553503","558031","546489","547834","542815","557286","558330"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["door","examining","woman","building","wooden","shingle","heritage","appreciation","preserve","stair"]}
