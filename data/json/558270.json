{"path":"558270.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Abrams, Nancy","caption":"In the photograph, a man is depicted in profile view. He is wearing a high-collared, ornately detailed military uniform, including a dark jacket that features a bright colored trim, possibly red, on his collar and along his shoulder seam. This trim is also echoed on his black, broad-brimmed hat, which is adorned with additional detailing suggestive of a military style.\n\nThe focus on the man's facial features is soft, capturing his expression in a serene or contemplative moment. He sports a mustache which covers his upper lip and partially his cheeks. The background is blurred and features a minimalist, natural setting with a gentle gradient of colors from green at the bottom to a pale or possibly fading light at the top, indicating it could be near sunset or sunrise. The overall composition of the photograph feels quiet and introspective, highlighting the silhouette of the man against the soft background in a way that emphasizes his attire and possibly his role or rank within a military context.","title":"A member of the New Ulm Battery, one of the major historical heritages of New Ulm, Minnesota. It was formed in 1863 after the Great Sioux Uprising of 1862 when much of the town was demolished in two Indian attacks. Although the unit never has had to act in defence, it has an active membership that fires cannons for salutes on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. The group uniforms were copied from a resident who was an officer in the Civil War who was home when the uprising occurred.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558278","558280","558271","553710","549730","547338","553115","556285","557035","551300","554857","548226","549703","557032","552872","554858"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["trim","cheek","lip","mustache","collar","detailing","sunrise","man","gradient","role"]}
