{"path":"550870.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene with a prominent factory or plant. The focal point is the large industrial buildings that dominate the right side of the frame. These structures feature various sections, including tall reddish buildings and a series of interconnected lower buildings, all equipped with smokestacks emitting white and dark smoke. In the background, there is a large chimney releasing a significant amount of smoke into the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water, possibly a river, with a speedboat moving quickly across the water, creating a wake behind it. The water adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static industrial setting.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, with large, fluffy white clouds, suggesting fair weather conditions during the time the photo was taken. The overall color tone of the photo is somewhat muted, possibly due to the film used or the time period when the photograph was taken. The scene captures a juxtaposition of industrial activity and recreational boating, providing a contrast between nature and human-made environments.","title":"Charmin Paper Company at Green Bay contributes its share of smoke and sulfite odor to the heavily industrialized bay area.
