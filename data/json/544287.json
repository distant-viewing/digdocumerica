{"path":"544287.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant and colorful scene dominated by a large roadside billboard located in a grassy field. The billboard has two main sections: on the left, there is text that reads \"THIS IS NEW ORLEANS EAST\" followed by \"20 MINUTES TO DOWNTOWN\" and additional information regarding residential, commercial, and industrial possibilities in the area, with a contact phone number. To the right of the text, a large map illustrating a segment of the New Orleans area is displayed, highlighting major routes such as Interstate 10 and U.S. Routes 11 and 90. The map is stylized with various shades of blue and brown, indicating different geographical features or zones.\n\nIn the foreground, a classic car, likely from the late 1960s or early 70s, is captured in motion, driving across the frame. The car, appearing long and sleek, is painted in a faded green color and is positioned on a road parallel to the billboard, emphasizing travel and mobility pertinent to the billboard's message.\n\nThe scene captures a sunny day with clear skies, and there is a notable absence of any other distinguishable buildings or people, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the relationship between the mobile automobile and the static advertisement. The overall composition blends elements of urban and suburban development, highlighted by the travel infrastructure and promotional efforts to attract more inhabitants or businesses to New Orleans East.","title":"Louisiana--New Orleans","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["543874","549113","555910","547021","553017","550135","550105","550143","545618","548674","549014","545622","549017","553473","555584","547369"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["billboard","map","travel","minute","text","possibility","inhabitant","mobility","70","contact"]}
