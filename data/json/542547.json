{"path":"542547.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays a scene of environmental devastation or land alteration. Two men stand on a drastically modified landscape filled with debris, primarily consisting of broken woods, scattered papers, and other refuse. The foreground is dominated by piles of this debris, presenting a scene of destruction or construction, while the surrounding area retains more natural elements.\n\nThe background reveals a more extensive landscape including what appear to be water bodies, possibly ponds or small lakes, behind them. The landscape stretches out extensively with variations in elevation and several other areas that also seem disturbed, marked by bare earth and heaps of soil. These variations suggest mining, industrial work or large-scale earthmoving activities.\n\nA road can be seen adjacent to the nearest body of water, leading towards a bridge in the middle ground of the image. Vegetation is sparse but discernible in areas not directly affected by the industrial activity.\n\nThe two men, likely workers or supervisors judging by their attire which includes work shirts and hats (one in a cowboy hat, the other in a more standard hat), are standing and looking at one of the debris piles, apparently engaging in a discussion or assessment of the site.\n\nThe setting is possibly in an industrial, mining, or large-scale agricultural area, judging by the nature of the visible operations and the infrastructure. The sky is clear, suggesting a dry and possibly hot environment, enhancing the stark, almost desolate nature of the scene. Overall, the image captures a moment reflective of human impact on natural landscapes, highlighting themes of environmental management or mismanagement.","title":"Darrell smith, water quality control board engineer, with clyde kepley, owner of sanitary land fill, along San Joaquin river","placename":"Pinedale (Calif.)","location":"Pinedale, California","nn1":["552169","545657","555563","547982","555852","553611","550350","543757","547661","554804","551611","545258","545661","555812","556322","543648"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["judge","variation","hat","mining","debris","assessment","pile","modify","retain","devastation"]}
