{"path":"556878.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of railway construction or maintenance. You can see a series of large, mechanical machines aligned on railroad tracks, presumably used for laying down or fixing the tracks. Multiple construction workers, wearing hard hats and casual work clothing, are actively engaged in operating the machinery and managing tasks. The machinery varies in size and function, with some appearing to handle the rail ties and others possibly involved in placement or welding tasks.\n\nThe background is somewhat obscured by a haze, likely dust stirred up by the construction activity, but glimpses of foliage suggest a rural or semi-rural setting. The overall mood is industrious, with each individual focused on their specific role within the operation. The photograph provides a clear view of the collaborative and mechanical processes involved in railway track construction.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way work crew, with machinery used to exchange old track for new quarter mile long sections of rail.  Notice the new stacks of railroad ties in the left foreground on a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded tracks per day.  In 1974 southern spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in track maintenance","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556895","556871","556894","556886","556899","556883","556901","556879","556861","556872","556885","556881","556877","556869","556859","556897"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["construction","tasnks","track","railway","stir","machinery","fix","placement","railroad","lay"]}
