{"path":"546464.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts an architectural scene, characterized by a modern-styled building set within a green landscape. The main structure is a low-rise, rectangular building featuring elongated flat roofs supported by square columns. The exterior walls predominantly consist of large glass window panels interspersed with brick columns that lend a rhythmic visual element to the facade. The building spans from the left to the right of the frame, suggesting a substantial footprint.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a path that meanders through the grassy landscape, leading towards the building and continuing beyond to another similar structure in the right background. The path seems well-maintained, surrounded by a lawn that has a natural, slightly untamed look, indicative of early growth perhaps in spring.\n\nOne of the striking features includes a separate, standalone roof structure supported by tall pillars in the right midground. This roof is similar in style to the main building, thus maintaining architectural cohesion and possibly functioning as a walkway cover or a design element.\n\nThe setting is peaceful, with no visible human presence, emphasizing a quiet, academic or corporate environment. The background shows an expansive clear sky and hints at a flat landscape, likely located in a suburban setting. The time of day indicated by the lighting seems to be either morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the softness of the light and the mild shadows.","title":"Parkside elementary school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546543","546473","546702","546531","546456","546481","546460","546470","546539","553744","548866","546506","549360","546448","546463","546542"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["column","roof","path","maintain","building","footprint","softness","support","elongate","pillars"]}
