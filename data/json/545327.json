{"path":"545327.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a sunny day in a street scene with a striking vintage aesthetic. In the foreground, two people, a boy in shorts and a shirt and an older, shirtless man wearing pants and a hat, are walking down a paved street. They appear to be engaged in casual conversation.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a large, single-story building with a faded, peeling light beige or pinkish stucco facade. The building features a series of symmetrical arched windows and a flat roof. Signage on the building advertises \"Ren√©'s Hockey & Variety,\" indicating the building houses a store likely selling sporting goods and a variety of other items.\n\nParked along the curb in front of the building are three cars from the mid-20th century, showcasing a classic American automotive design typical of the 1950s or 1960s. The cars, including a prominent pink and white sedan closest to the viewer, add to the nostalgic feel of the scene.\n\nThe sky is vividly blue and scattered with fluffy, white clouds, adding a sense of clarity and openness to the image. Power lines crisscross faintly in the upper left, providing a subtle indication of urban infrastructure. The overall mood is serene and evocative of a quiet, slower-paced moment in time.","title":"El paso's second ward, a chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["557805","555944","553550","551106","545333","550114","551084","557155","542900","557655","543471","551119","545351","546427","546428","557288"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","stucco","1950","sporting","building","pace","indication","sell","beige","curb"]}
