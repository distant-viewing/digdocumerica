{"path":"548976.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural activity on a vast, open farm field. The focal point of the image is a large, red combine harvester which is positioned in the center of the image, working on the field. The combine harvester is equipped with a large front attachment for cutting crops, and its extension for dispersing harvested grain extends to the right side of the image.\n\nThe field itself appears partially harvested, with clear lines where crops have been cut, separating them from the still-standing crops. These lines create a distinct path that leads the eye towards the horizon. The standing crops adjacent to the path are golden and tall, glowing under the light, suggesting it might be late afternoon.\n\nThe terrain is flat, stretching far into the distance under a vast, clear sky which dominates the upper portion of the photograph. There's a slight gradient in the sky color, darker at the top and getting lighter towards the horizon, indicating a vast open space typical of rural farmlands. The natural light and clear sky indicate fair weather conditions, ideal for farm work.\n\nOverall, this image beautifully captures the essence of farm work during a harvest season, portrayed through the use of a powerful machine within a serene, expansive natural environment.","title":"Cutting barley in the Imperial Valley--near Brawley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548985","548979","548981","548982","547432","548964","547730","554044","549258","548820","555619","549046","544888","554015","549036","548991"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crop","harvest","harvester","farm","field","combine","cut","work","attachment","path"]}
