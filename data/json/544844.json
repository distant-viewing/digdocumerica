{"path":"544844.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment featuring two motorcyclists riding along a rural highway. The setting is dominated by a sprawling landscape with rolling hills in the background that gently rise under a clear, blue sky, hinting at a vast, open space rural region. The hill crests faintly show patches of green, suggesting they are covered in grass or low vegetation.\n\nThe highway itself is a two-lane road marked with a double yellow line, showing signs of wear but predominantly clear. Each motorcyclist is equipped for a long journey; their bikes are fitted with panniers and additional luggage strapped to the rear. Both riders wear protective gear: the closest rider wears a dark jacket, jeans, and a sturdy pair of boots, along with a full-coverage helmet and a large, visible backpack. The second rider, further down the road, is similarly dressed, also wearing a full helmet, and seems to maintain a steady distance behind the first.\n\nThe environment portrays a mix of developed and natural elements. On the right, there are tall utility poles, relatively evenly spaced and parallel to the road, reinforcing the rural infrastructure. On the sides of the road, patches of grass and some areas fenced with simple wire barriers suggest grazing or farmland uses.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with a focus on the forward journey of the motorcyclists set against a vast landscape, evokes a sense of adventure and freedom associated with road travel. The perspective taken from behind one rider, looking towards the other and the open road, invites the viewer into the scene, imagining the calm yet invigorating experience of riding through such tranquil surroundings.","title":"Vacationers on motorcycles","placename":"South Park (Colo. : Flat)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544840","548890","551382","553955","548690","553954","548987","545150","554690","545598","554031","548691","545134","554874","549235","553116"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["rider","road","journey","helmet","highway","luggage","crest","bike","freedom","farmland"]}
