{"path":"542576.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in an interaction beside a small aircraft. The first man, standing outside the aircraft, is dressed in a yellow shirt and dark pants. He is examining a piece of paper that the second man, who is sitting inside the aircraft, is handing to him. The second man, who appears to be the pilot, is wearing a helmet and a vest, and is seated inside the open cockpit of the plane.\n\nThe aircraft is small and white with a stripe pattern that includes red and darker tones, and the number \"235\" is visibly painted in red on the side of the cockpit door. The scene is set against a backdrop of a clear blue sky with very few clouds, suggesting a fair weather day ideal for flying.\n\nThe interaction seems to be focused possibly on a flight plan or a logbook, typical of pre-flight or post-flight procedures in aviation. The setting and attire suggest a casual, possibly private or small regional aviation environment rather than a commercial or military setting. The overall mood captured in the image is one of professionalism and attentiveness to the task at hand.","title":"Deputy agricultural commissioner Conrad Schilling and pilot John Gilbert prepare for flight over barley fields.

The grain will be spread in a particular pattern which will not threaten other animals.","placename":"Fresno County (Calif.)","location":"Fresno County, California","nn1":["542498","542499","542669","552366","542671","552383","546683","542578","555825","552370","548880","546688","542496","546675","557868","545935"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["aircraft","aviation","cockpit","professionalism","pilot","plan","procedure","attentiveness","man","plane"]}
