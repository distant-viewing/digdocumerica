{"path":"546991.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, likely from a parade or a public celebration. At the forefront of the image, there is a vintage convertible car, adorned with flowers, proceeding down a town street. Inside the car, three individuals who appear to be a part of the celebration are seated. They are all dressed in formal, colorful clothes, with one person in the front seat and two in the back. The vehicle seems to attract attention as it passes by.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, a diverse group of spectators lines the sidewalk, watching the parade. The spectators are predominantly elderly and dressed in light, casual attire suitable for an outdoor event. They seem engaged and are perhaps waiting to see more parade participants.\n\nThe setting is an urban street with various commercial buildings including a paint store and other shops with signs visible. The street is marked with basic crosswalk lines and includes both parked and moving cars, indicating this is a controlled but active roadway.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere captured suggests a communal gathering or celebration, typical of local parades or holiday events in a small town or city setting, expressing a sense of community and festivity.","title":"Memorial day parade, held by the black community, draws participants and spectators from the neighboring islands","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["552660","557715","556274","549584","557712","557710","552657","552659","556282","557709","552653","549566","549576","556280","552412","558119"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["parade","celebration","street","spectator","town","express","car","festivity","holiday","event"]}
