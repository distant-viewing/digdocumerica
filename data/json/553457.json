{"path":"553457.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a wooded area filled with a dense collection of pine trees, their slender trunks rising from a ground covered in pine needles and some dried leaves. The light filtering through the canopy creates patches of sunlight and shadow on the forest floor. Prominently in the foreground, there is a tree trunk painted with the word \"SAVE\" in large, red letters. The focus is sharply on this tree, which stands out due to the bold signage against the natural backdrop. The environment appears wild and relatively undisturbed, aside from the intervention on the tree. The overall mood conveys a message of environmental concern or conservation, highlighted by the direct human message imposed on the natural scene.","title":"Injunctions have been filed to halt further development of this filled wetland in W.
