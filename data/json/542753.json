{"path":"542753.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil forest scene. The setting is densely populated with tall, straight trees, primarily conifers, indicating a cooler, possibly mountainous region. Several features distinguish the landscape: a large, moss-covered boulder on the left foreground; fallen branches and a partly decomposed log lie across the forest floor, which is strewn with pine needles and small plants.\n\nThe lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or a canopy thick enough to filter much of the sunlight. The trees, towering and robust, have bark that appears rough and is cloaked in places with green moss, emphasizing the moist, rich environment. No human presence or artificial structures are visible, enhancing the sense of natural solitude and untouched wilderness. The depth of the forest continues into the background, fading into a gentle haze, which adds a sense of mystery and expansiveness to the scene.","title":"Congress Trail Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558082","554958","549234","554965","555028","554976","555116","542791","554990","555051","555114","554425","542745","555120","555118","546947"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","expansiveness","conifer","needle","mystery","boulder","bark","moss","log","haze"]}
