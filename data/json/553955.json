{"path":"553955.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene on a sunny day, focusing on both recreational and leisure activities in a lush, natural setting. The image features a man on a dirt bike, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in jeans and a long-sleeve green shirt, wearing a golden helmet, and appears to be paused or slowly maneuvering the dirt path. The motorcycle is a Yamaha, evident from the visible branding.\n\nThe dirt path, which the motorcyclist is on, winds through rich green vegetation that dominates the landscape. This path is also being utilized by a group of people walking in the opposite direction toward the motorcyclist. These individuals are more distanced and occupy the middle to background on the right side of the frame. The group seems to include adults and at least one child, casually dressed, possibly enjoying a hike or a walk in the scenic area.\n\nIn the background, thick green bushes and trees are noticeable. The area gives a refreshing and tranquil vibe, indicating a rural or semi-rural setting that is ideal for outdoor activities like motorcycling and walking. The composition of the photograph, with its depth and use of natural scenery, highlights a sense of freedom and relaxation associated with outdoor recreation.","title":"On the foot trail to waipahee falls, a scenic area maintained by the state forestry department","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["545598","553954","545150","548690","558232","544844","554876","543723","557777","544840","557990","551382","548691","556418","545134","554874"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["motorcycle","path","dirt","walk","branding","hike","freedom","bike","pause","maneuver"]}
