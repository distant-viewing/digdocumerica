{"path":"543369.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a mesmerizing natural scene. In the foreground, lush green grass and other dense foliage create a rich, textured tapestry. The grass varies in shades from bright green to deeper, shadowed greens, indicating either varying types of plants or the interplay of light and shadow.\n\nThe most prominent feature of this image is a young deer with a velvet-covered antler, standing amidst the tall grass. It appears alert and slightly turned towards the viewer, adding a live, dynamic element to the scene. The deer's coat is a smooth, glossy brown, blending in with some of the darker greens and browns of the grass.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting parts of the grass, giving the image depth and a sense of the time of day. The overall composition, with the deer centered among the tall grass, evokes a serene and somewhat secretive natural environment, showcasing the beauty and tranquility of a wildlife habitat.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["545902","546163","544916","552339","544114","558368","544571","542955","544623","542963","551367","543279","554621","542778","543839","543326"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","grass","green","antler","alert","tapestry","shadowed","live","varies","wildlife"]}
