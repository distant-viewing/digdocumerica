{"path":"544715.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph features a prominent, vivid red stop sign in the foreground positioned on a pole, with slight rust visible at its base. The background is composed of numerous large, black oil barrels stacked in layers. The barrels are cylindrical with a reflective surface, and some light is glinting off the metal, hinting at their smoothness and contour lines. The overall lighting is dynamic, creating a stark contrast between the illuminated sign and the darker, textured backdrop of barrels. The composition juxtaposes the cautionary symbol of the stop sign against the industrial backdrop, possibly suggesting themes of environmental concern or industrial impact. The atmosphere suggests it might be an outdoor setting, possibly in an industrial area or a storage facility. The image uses depth of field effectively, bringing attention to the stop sign while slightly blurring the barrels, adding a sense of dimension and focus.","title":"California--near San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["550200","550196","557881","550187","546004","552883","546000","544227","543806","552884","552248","544681","556324","542494","543762","545388"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["barrel","stop","smoothness","dimension","sign","symbol","oil","concern","rust","contour"]}
