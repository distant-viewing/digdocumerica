{"path":"553054.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph focuses closely on the hands of an elderly person holding a lit cigarette. The hands are prominently wrinkled and aged, with visible veins and slightly dirty fingernails, which suggest that these hands may have been engaged in physical work. The person's left hand grasps the cigarette between the index and middle finger, and smoke can be seen rising gently from the lit end of the cigarette.\n\nThe individual is wearing a blue shirt with rolled-up cuffs, suggesting casual attire, possibly worn during a break or a moment of relaxation. The background is uniformly dark, focusing all attention on the hands and the cigarette.\n\nThis shot, likely taken in a low-light setting, uses the glow from the cigarette to subtly illuminate details of the hands and the textured fabric of the sleeve, creating a poignant and intimate portrayal of a simple, everyday action.","title":"Uranium miner at lunch.
