{"path":"543473.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting, where a group of children is playing in a shallow body of water, possibly a river or a coastal inlet, in front of a steep, sandy cliff. On top of the cliff, there are several modern homes with large windows and outdoor balconies, likely providing a beautiful view over the water.\n\nThe cliff itself is interesting, covered with a variety of vegetation and colorful plants, some of which bloom in pink or purple hues, offering a stark contrast to the sandy textures. There are scattered rocks both at the base of the cliff and in the water where the children are playing.\n\nThe children, three visible in the water, are engaged in different activities: one is standing still looking towards another child, one appears to be walking or running through the water, and the third is further in the background, partially submerged and facing towards the others. The child closest to the foreground is wearing a light green shirt and seems to be a bit apart from the other playful activities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the setting feels peaceful and leisurely, with a bright sunny day casting sharp shadows and enhancing the vivid colors of the natural environment and the children's garments. There's a serene connection between the human elements and the natural landscape.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["547692","551160","543685","543692","544352","544187","552341","551159","553429","544183","544200","553435","557423","550227","543215","553431"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","cliff","inlet","water","garment","balcony","connection","bit","base","home"]}
