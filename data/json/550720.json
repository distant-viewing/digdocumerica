{"path":"550720.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a water treatment or industrial facility setting. It features flowing water or effluent that is channeled through a concrete and metal infrastructure. The water flows from a dark, covered section that appears to be an inlet or channel, supported by a simple metal framework, into a trough made of concrete. On the right side of the trough, there are concrete blocks with spaces, bordered by metal edges, which likely help in directing or managing the flow.\n\nThe setting includes a backdrop of a solid grey concrete or cinder block wall, indicating an enclosed, functional space typical of service or utility areas. A simple wooden stick, possibly a measure or guide stick, is fixed vertically along the left side of the trough, partially submerged in or adjacent to the flowing water.\n\nThe ground is littered with gravel and there are sparse green plants visible in the background, subtly indicating minimal vegetation around the facility. The atmosphere appears utilitarian and focused on function rather than aesthetics.","title":"Flume carrying untreated wastes to clarifier at the international paper company mill at jay on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["549564","544052","544040","542990","543810","547568","542988","548212","543573","543572","557247","546891","553901","543649","549636","548137"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["trough","concrete","flow","stick","channel","block","cinder","metal","fix","inlet"]}
