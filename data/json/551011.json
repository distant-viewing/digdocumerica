{"path":"551011.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant, outdoor scene with several people likely attending an event or gathering in a park-like setting. A group is prominently featured in the foreground, comprising a man in a yellow tank top and a bucket hat, and two women, one in a white tank top with hair tied up, and the other in a patterned sleeveless top with a short afro hairstyle. They appear engaged and focused, possibly watching or listening to something outside the frame. A small child, lying in the lap of the man in the foreground, seems relaxed and possibly tired or asleep, oblivious to the surrounding activity.\n\nIn the more immediate background, various other attendees can be seen in a relaxed, casual posture, some seated on the ground, contributing to the laid-back atmosphere of the scene. The background is lush with greenery, indicating the outdoor, public nature of the space. The setting suggests a communal and informal gathering under an overcast sky, highlighted by expressions of interest and engagement on the faces of the attendees.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 110th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
