{"path":"548712.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody underwater scene. Dominating the frame is a thick cluster of coral, specifically staghorn coral, characterized by its branching structure and finger-like projections. The coral is densely packed and has a pale, almost luminescent appearance, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken in relatively shallow water where light can still penetrate, or possibly illuminated by artificial light, such as a diverâ€™s flashlight.\n\nThe coloration of the coral varies from a whitish-blue to darker shades, contributing to a textured look throughout. Amid these intricate structures, a small fish, likely a damselfish, is visible. It is positioned towards the upper center-left part of the image and appears to be navigating through the coral branches. Its presence adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.\n\nThe background is dark and gradually fades into a deep, almost pitch black, indicating the vast and open nature of the underwater setting. This stark contrast with the foreground accentuates the isolation of this underwater ecosystem, emphasizing its fragile beauty. The overall composition conveys a sense of tranquility and the complexity of marine life forms residing within coral reefs.","title":"One of the many species of coral at john pennekamp coral reef state park, a few miles off key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548711","548710","548682","548678","548719","548717","548722","548677","548679","548721","548723","548676","548713","548681","548716","548718"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","reef","diver","branch","penetrate","finger","coloration","pitch","complexity","navigate"]}
