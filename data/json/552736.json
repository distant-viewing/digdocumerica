{"path":"552736.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a park or a similar public setting. In the center of the image, there is a statue of a man standing on a pedestal. The statue appears to be of a historical figure, dressed in traditional attire with a cloak and hat, suggesting a setting of significance or memorial.\n\nOccupying the base of the statue are multiple individuals, presumably a mix of children and young adults, casually gathered and sitting. The individuals exhibit a range of activities; some are interacting with each other, potentially in conversation, while others are either sitting in contemplation or looking around. Their clothing style suggests a casual, everyday setting, possibly from an earlier decade given the overall ambiance and style shown in the photograph.\n\nThe setting is lush with leafy trees and the light filtering through the foliage creates a dappled effect on the ground and on the people. This suggests it is a sunny day, contributing to the relaxed and leisurely atmosphere. The composition utilizes natural light and the shade offered by the trees, encapsulating a tranquil, community-centered environment typical of a serene park setting. Elements such as the shadows and the natural framing of the trees enhance the depth and aesthetic appeal of the shot.","title":"Independence square: boy scouts gather at statue of commodore john barry","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550046","553158","551823","550302","557985","549676","550067","555947","553065","553769","550074","553281","552718","557258","552036","555599"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["statue","cloak","pedestal","sit","appeal","significance","framing","utilize","decade","park"]}
