{"path":"544724.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This atmospheric photograph captures a scenic view of a sunset over an expansive railway yard. In the foreground, multiple gleaming railway tracks weave and intersect, their silvery lines reflecting the fading light. These tracks are unoccupied, accentuating their intricate patterns against the darkened ground.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a silhouette of an industrial landscape, including cranes and various structures possibly linked to the transportation or shipping industry, adding to the urban feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a large bridge spans across the composition. This structure is reminiscent of classic cantilever designs and is silhouetted against the dramatic hues of the sunset. The bridge's intricate network of girders and beams is visible, standing stark against the sky.\n\nAbove all, the sky itself is a breathtaking element, painted in vibrant stripes of orange, yellow, and deep blues, indicative of the time of day transitioning from evening to night. Clouds near the horizon catch the last light, providing a natural contrast to the industrial and mechanical subjects below. This combination of natural and man-made elements creates a poignant and reflective scene, blending functionality with beauty in the evening light.","title":"Rail yards","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544732","544728","547711","545022","549096","547102","545430","558140","547714","556004","546114","548851","551956","545541","545418","548123"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["railway","sunset","girder","evening","track","bridge","span","shipping","functionality","night"]}
