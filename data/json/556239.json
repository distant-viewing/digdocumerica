{"path":"556239.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment inside a church, where three individuals are engaging with hymnals during a service. From left to right: \n\n1. An elderly man, wearing a gray suit with a blue shirt and glasses. He is focused on reading a book, possibly a hymnal, holding it open with both hands.\n   \n2. Next to him is a middle-aged woman in a red hat and black coat. She is also reading intently from a similar book but is partially obscured behind the man.\n\n3. On the right, a young woman in a beige jacket over a blue top, accessorized with a necklace and a large, patterned scarf, holds a green hymnal titled \"Almighty God\". Alongside her, there is a young girl in red attire, leaning against the woman while she looks down at the book in the woman's hands. The girl's hair is styled with pink bows.\n\nThey are all situated in a church, evident from the architectural features like arched windows and traditional pews visible in the dimly lit background, creating a solemn and reflective mood. The focus on hymnals suggests they are participating in a service, contributing to the atmosphere of communal worship and reflection.","title":"Worshippers at Holy Angel Catholic Church on Chicago's South Side.
