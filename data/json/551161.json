{"path":"551161.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents a striking and somewhat surreal juxtaposition of a tranquil domestic scene against the backdrop of massive industrial structures. In the foreground, there is a vibrant gathering taking place outside a small, modest mobile home. A group of adults and children are seen engaging in various activities typically associated with a yard sale or an outdoor family gathering. Some individuals are browsing through items laid out on tables and hanging from lines, possibly clothes or household goods for sale or display.\n\nThe setting is lush and green with trees and grass around, which contrasts heavily with the looming presence of two large cooling towers in the background. These towers, characteristic of a nuclear power plant, dominate the upper portion of the image. They are gray and conical, tapering towards the top, with one emitting a plume of vapor or smoke.\n\nThe overall composition of this image layers everyday human life and the industrial scale of the power plant, highlighting a stark contrast between the two. The tranquility and normalcy of the family scene in the foreground starkly contrast with the industrial might and potential implications of the power plant structures in the backdrop.","title":"Ladies at a Mobile home in Poca get ready for a \"yard sale.\" Looming up behind are the water cooling towers of the John Amos Power Plant.
