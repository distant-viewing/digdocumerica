{"path":"555296.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene focusing on the peak of a house's roof under a vibrant blue sky with scattered clouds. The roof is covered in dark, textured shingles, and three key elements protrude from it. On the far left, there is a chimney like structure which might be a metal ventilation pipe, relatively slim and straight. \n\nTowards the center, there is a tall, metallic tower that extends upwards beyond the top edge of the photo. This tower is equipped with what look to be weather measurement or communication devices, possibly including antennas or wind measuring equipment. At the very top, a figure appears to be working on or adjusting the equipment. The individual is largely silhouetted against the bright sky, wearing what seems to be casual attire and possibly safety gear.\n\nOn the far right of the roof, a smaller, perpendicular pipe is visible, similar in appearance to the one on the left but shorter, presumably another vent pipe. The overall composition juxtaposes human activity with technology in a very natural, sky-dominated background, evoking themes of connectivity or environmental monitoring. The interplay of light and shadows, together with the rich colors, creates a dynamic and visually engaging image.","title":"An electrical wind generator on the roof of a log house which will use solar heat.
