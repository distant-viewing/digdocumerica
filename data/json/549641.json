{"path":"549641.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an aquatic scene characterized by a tranquil waterway, possibly a river or stream, surrounded by dense vegetation. The immediate foreground shows dark water with smooth, undulating patterns of white and gray pollution or possibly natural oils stretching across the water's surface. These patterns swirl around and create marbled textures on the water.\n\nThe banks on either side of the waterway are densely lined with dry, brownish bushes and reeds that appear to be in a dormant or non-growing state, suggesting this image might have been taken in a cooler season. There are patches of dark earth or mud visible through the thinner areas of vegetation.\n\nIn the water, there are a few visible clumps of tangled branches or plant debris, either floating or partially submerged, contributing to the natural, albeit slightly unkempt, scene. The calmness of the water suggests there is little current or wind disturbing this aquatic ecosystem at the moment of capture.\n\nThe color palette is mostly muted with browns, grays, and dark greens dominating the scene, creating a serene yet somewhat melancholic atmosphere. There are no visible animals or people, emphasizing the stillness and quietude of the environment. Overall, the image conveys a sense of natural tranquility mixed with the impact of environmental factors on a waterway.","title":"Contaminated water from an Elizabeth, LA, paper mill flows into creek.","placename":"Lake Charles (La.)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["553427","551352","550368","542526","550844","554623","545008","550788","555549","550341","550845","554603","550750","558009","544765","550686"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["waterway","factor","tangle","disturb","water","quietude","clump","mute","reed","calmness"]}
