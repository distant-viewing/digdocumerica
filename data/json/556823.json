{"path":"556823.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene, likely taken during the rush hour on a subway platform. It is filled with people of various ages and appearances exiting subway cars and walking along the platform, suggesting a moment of intense activity typical of morning or evening commutes.\n\nSeveral groups and individual commuters are prominently visible. Most are dressed in work attire, which includes suits, ties, dresses, and other formal outfits indicative of a workday scenario. There is a diversity in the demographics, featuring both men and women, possibly hinting at a large, cosmopolitan city.\n\nThe setting is a subway station with features typical of such locations, including overhead signs and the blurred motion of people. Notably, there is an advertisement board in the background with the words \"SEE THE LIGHT\" alongside an image of a figure cycling up a steep hill. It contributes a contrasting note of stillness and suggestion to the otherwise dynamic and somewhat congested environment.\n\nOther details include a clock showing the time, graffiti on the subway car doors, and a metallic structure typical of outdoor subway platforms. The mood conveyed is one of hurry and slight congestion, characterized by the expressions and swift movements of the people captured in the shot.","title":"Passengers leaving the New York City Transit Authority subway system. The system is of crucial importance to the city. In 1970 it carried 2.1 million persons to and from work each day approximately 47 percent of the work force. However, voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover operating costs. The 232-mile system is the longest in the world.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556818","556821","551883","556650","551895","556815","551894","556697","556819","556660","556651","556054","556779","551890","556663","555967"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","platform","suggestion","workday","commute","rush","commuter","congestion","clock","graffiti"]}
