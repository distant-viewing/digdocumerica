{"path":"552947.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a young individual, likely a woman, in an outdoor setting that appears to be a wooded area in a mountainous region during a season where there is still some snow visible in the background on the mountains. The scene captures an environmental cleanup activity, as the person is seen picking litter and placing it into a large black trash bag.\n\nThe ground is scattered with various pieces of trash including scraps of paper, what looks like a broken paper plate, and a pink object that could be part of a plastic bag or cloth. Noticeable near the forefront of the image is a green mitten, alongside other discarded items that blend into the forest floor, which is muddy and covered partially in decayed leaves, suggesting it might be early spring.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a light turtleneck sweater and jeans, equipped with sturdy shoes suitable for the outdoor terrain. Her hair is short, and she is focused on the task at hand. Behind her and the area of immediate activity, the forest is dense with tall deciduous trees and evergreens.\n\nThe overall composition and the presence of snow-clad mountains in the distance along with the littered forest floor indicate that this location is likely accustomed to visitors, perhaps a popular hiking or camping spot, now suffering from pollution which is being addressed by the individual in the photograph.","title":"Roadside trash pick-up (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
