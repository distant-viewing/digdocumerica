{"path":"546518.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a modern architectural building characterized by its elongated structure and pronounced geometrical design. The building is clad in what appears to be gray concrete, with a series of vertical and slightly recessed indentations that create a repetitive linear pattern along its side. This structure exudes a brutalist architectural style with sharp, clean lines and a monolithic appearance.\n\nIn the forefront of the image, set against the large, imposing façade, a woman is standing on a grassy area that borders the building. She is looking towards the building, enhancing the scale and the stark nature of the architecture. She wears a white jacket and dark pants, and her dark hair flows down around her shoulders, contrasting with the light-colored building.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a lightly clouded sky which provides a soft backdrop to the rigid structure of the building. There are no other distinct features in the surrounding environment visible in the photograph, focusing the viewer’s attention on the interaction between the woman and the striking architecture. The overall composition of the photo captures a moment of contemplation or appreciation of the stark architectural beauty.","title":"Southside Junior High School, built in 1969, and designed by Eliot Noyes","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546506","546481","546415","555318","546539","546493","546531","546473","546542","546484","546515","546464","546468","546470","549317","553743"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["building","appreciation","architecture","façade","woman","concrete","contemplation","shoulder","forefront","photo"]}
