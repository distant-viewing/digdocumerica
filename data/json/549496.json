{"path":"549496.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a view of Niagara Falls and its surrounding area. The image features the Horseshoe Falls prominently, characterized by its powerful water flow and the mist rising from where the water crashes down. To the right of the falls, several buildings, possibly hotels or other facilities catering to tourists, are visible, along with tree-lined streets.\n\nThe river below the falls is visibly divided by natural formations into multiple streams creating white water rapids, a testament to the river's powerful current. A bridge spans the river, connecting the two sides, suggesting a link between two countries or different regions of the same country.\n\nAdditionally, to the left side of the image, you can see a highway running parallel to the river, bordered by a green landscape, perhaps parkland or natural reserves, which seems well maintained and designed for recreational use.\n\nFurther in the background, the wider urban landscape spreads out, containing more buildings that stand against a backdrop of a vast flat horizon, indicating the expanse of the city adjacent to this natural wonder. The overall composition and elements in the photo underscore a blend of natural beauty and human development.","title":"Niagara River looking south, with the falls in the background.
