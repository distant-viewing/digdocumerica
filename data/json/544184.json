{"path":"544184.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a desolate scene where the primary focus is a stretch of cracked earth, evidence of dried waterbed or mudflat. The soil is fragmented into myriad shapes and sizes, some large slabs and others smaller, jagged pieces, suggesting severe drying that caused deep grooves and fissures to form.\n\nForeground features include a scattering of dried grass, thin and sparse, that adds to the barren feel of the environment. An elongated pipe, possibly metallic, lies diagonally across the cracked ground, partially submerged in shallow water, reflecting how the area may once have been submerged or used for water transport or drainage.\n\nIn the midground, sections of the cracked surface are partially covered in shallow water, illustrating either a receding water line or a small, ineffective attempt at hydration following a dry spell. Reflections in this water mirror the clear sky above.\n\nThe background includes a thinly vegetated line of trees or shrubs marking the horizon, suggesting some semblance of life surviving beyond the desolate foreground. The horizon is distinct, separating the earth from a clear sky that casts natural light and creates some shadows across the textured ground.\n\nThe overall composition possesses a somber tone, highlighting themes of drought, environmental decline, or the aftermath of water scarcity. The photograph serves as a poignant reminder of natural and possibly human-induced changes in landscapes.","title":"Cracked, dried mud remains after draining of marsh","placename":"Grand Isle (La. : Island)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["544180","549201","544751","544176","542863","544733","557417","552060","549034","550397","554347","546124","552053","543644","545004","552420"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["crack","desolate","submerge","survive","drying","water","mudflat","vegetated","spell","elongated"]}
