{"path":"542540.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a large pyramid-like pile of yellowish material, likely industrial or mineral, in an open outdoor environment under a clear blue sky. The pile dominates the foreground of the image, showing substantial texture with chunks and particles visible. The material appears to be somewhat coarse and loosely aggregated.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial building that features a low, long structure with a flat roof. It appears to be a factory or processing plant. The building is constructed with square and rectangular sections, and has several small windows visible. There is also a shaded area that might serve as a loading or working area, as it is partially open with columns supporting the roof.\n\nThe ground on which the photograph is taken is flat and covered with similar material as the pile, suggesting this might be a storage, mining, or processing site for the material. The shadows indicate strong sunlight coming from one side, accentuating the rugged texture of the material and the geometric architecture of the building in the background.\n\nOverall, the setting seems to be a functional industrial site devoted to the handling or processing of the material shown in the pile.","title":"Sulfur pile at plant","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["543642","543169","548644","544044","550265","557403","551037","544068","554765","552004","555591","554628","550350","554763","542553","543646"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["material","pile","processing","pyramid","chunk","site","particle","loading","roof","handling"]}
