{"path":"543945.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures an active riverside scene featuring both a small sailboat and a motorboat. The sailboat, noticeable for its vibrant red and white striped sail adorned with a black logo and the number \"25026\", is shown inclining slightly due to the wind, with a single sailor visible onboard actively handling the boat. In contrast, a larger, white motorboat is cruising at a higher speed, creating a wake on the water's surface. It appears well-equipped and designed for leisure, possibly with upper deck seating where individuals can enjoy the ride and view. \n\nThe background presents a densely wooded, lush green riverside, suggesting a serene and somewhat secluded setting. The overall composition of the image, with the sailboat positioned in the foreground and slightly to the left and the motorboat to the right, illustrates a dynamic and contrasting use of the river by different types of watercraft. The focus and coloring of the photograph give it a vivid yet slightly dated feel, emphasizing the recreational theme common in natural and picturesque environments.","title":"Participant in the Louisville Sailing Club Spring Regatta","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["548058","543994","549411","543941","544669","548524","550825","546976","547273","549420","544021","547757","546856","549413","551208","550840"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["motorboat","sailboat","riverside","sailor","watercraft","coloring","ride","seating","wake","speed"]}
