{"path":"547518.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic, outdoor scene consisting of stone structures and natural elements. In the foreground, large, flat stones are arranged horizontally, likely functioning as steps or a pathway. These stones lead towards or come from an area with more irregular and jagged stone formations which appear to be remnants of a wall or a small building. This stonework has a haphazard, piled appearance, suggesting age and possible abandonment.\n\nGrasses and dried leaves are scattered around the stones, indicative of a natural, untended environment. Some of the grass is green, suggesting the photo was possibly taken in early spring or late winter. The area between the stones is overgrown, enhancing the feeling of an old, rural setting.\n\nThe background features bare-branched bushes or small trees, adding to the overall sense of a wild, possibly unkempt location. The lighting in the photograph is natural, with sunlight highlighting part of the stone surface and casting some areas into shadow, which adds depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of rural decay and the quiet beauty of aging man-made structures that are being reclaimed by nature.","title":"Stone barn foundation--all that remains of an abandoned farm in Exeter","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["558010","547514","547522","557997","551330","551329","558013","551344","546971","547654","552550","556352","546754","557995","551111","549195"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["stone","age","stonework","reclaim","grass","dry","come","remnant","function","step"]}
