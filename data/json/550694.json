{"path":"550694.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene framed by a natural environment. In the foreground is a large body of water, reflecting a mixture of blue sky and cloud cover. The surface of the water shows signs of pollution, with swirling patterns of water discoloration, possibly oil or other chemical substances, visible across the water's surface.\n\nTo the left of the image, thereâ€™s a dense, forested shoreline. A small island with lush greenery is visible in the middle distance, contrasting with the industrial activity.\n\nOn the opposite shore, a large industrial complex dominates the view. The facility includes several large buildings and an exceptionally tall smokestack emitting a plume of smoke. This plant is situated directly beside the water, suggesting it may be utilizing the waterway for industrial processes.\n\nSurrounding the facility and beyond are hills densely covered with trees, suggesting the industry is set within a valley or a similar geographical formation.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a stark juxtaposition between industry and nature, highlighting themes of environmental impact and the encroachment of human-made structures into natural landscapes.","title":"Polluted Androscoggin River above paper mill at Cascade","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550995","546073","551576","554630","552210","551192","557377","551009","552194","543813","550860","546141","546005","545854","548195","552246"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["industry","discoloration","encroachment","water","facility","substance","island","oil","mixture","cover"]}
