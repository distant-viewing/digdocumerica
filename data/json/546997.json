{"path":"546997.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a small, quaint house standing alone in a rural setting. The house is simple in structure, with white wooden siding and a gabled roof. It features a single red window pane on the visible side, complemented by a white-trimmed doorway. The structure appears modestly aged, with some signs of weathering visible on the wood.\n\nThe house is situated in a grassy field that looks somewhat overgrown, indicating it might be relatively untended. Surrounding the house are several large trees, one of which prominently frames the left side of the image. This tree has thick, dark branches and is draped with Spanish moss, adding a moody, somewhat gothic aura to the scene.\n\nThe sky is overcast with shades of gray, possibly hinting at an imminent rain, which adds to the atmosphere of desolation and serenity surrounding the house. The overall composition evokes a feeling of solitude and a step back in time, highlighting the rustic and natural setting of the location.","title":"A church serving the black community on john's island","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["555632","554822","546989","544353","558110","548295","550704","552494","554788","554787","552464","551091","552455","554084","556962","557640"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","aura","pane","gable","serenity","weathering","drape","doorway","desolation","moss"]}
