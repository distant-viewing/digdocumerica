{"path":"547116.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up and intriguing scene centered around a person looking through a large camera lens. The camera lens dominates the central portion of the image, its cylindrical black body taking up much of the frame. You can see the reflective coating on the lens, indicating that it could possibly be a telephoto lens used for long-distance photography.\n\nThe person holding the camera is not directly visible; however, parts of them can be inferred. They appear to be wearing a hefty jacket or coat with a fur-lined hood surrounding their face, suggesting that the environment could be cold. Their hair is also visible, light in color, and fluffy, peeking out from the hood.\n\nThe background and finer details of the environment are obscured by the close focus on the camera and the person using it. The image does not provide definitive information about the location or specific activity other than the photography itself.\n\nThis photograph creates a sense of intimacy and focus, capturing a moment of concentration and perhaps anticipation as the photographer looks through the lens, ready to capture a scene. The composition of the image, with the camera lens centered and the person enveloped by their hood and the equipment, emphasizes the interaction between the human element and the technical aspect of photography.","title":"Child peers through telescope at the ludington consumer power plant","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["556380","551360","553199","550048","546835","552382","553592","557179","553883","546327","549384","546282","557846","556138","544437","557033"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["lens","hood","photography","camera","person","infer","anticipation","photographer","intimacy","fur"]}
