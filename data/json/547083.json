{"path":"547083.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and moody scene at a beachside setting. A young child with blond hair, dressed in a black jacket and red pants, is in the foreground, energetically throwing a stone toward the sea. The child's posture suggests motion and playfulness, arms spread wide during the activity.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, multi-story building that appears somewhat weathered and aged, located right at the edge of the beach. The structure is boxy, made of dark brick, and looks slightly industrial or residential in nature. The building's proximity to the water, its aged appearance, and the gray and overcast sky create a somewhat somber and dramatic atmosphere.\n\nThe beach itself is not sandy but covered with small pebbles and stones, typical of certain coastal areas. The sea is relatively calm, with gentle waves lapping at the shore, and the sky above is filled with thick clouds, hinting at an overcast or stormy day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the lively action of the child in the foreground contrasted against the solemn, imposing backdrop of the old building and the moody sky, creates a striking visual narrative.","title":"Howard St. beach on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546378","552341","547676","552279","543493","549105","543215","547867","550241","543244","543081","550233","545086","547727","544617","543391"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","beach","playfulness","stone","sea","throw","pebble","lap","impose","proximity"]}
