{"path":"550298.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic urban park scene under bright sunlight. In the foreground, there is a man walking briskly, accompanied by his shadow, across a wide pavement that borders a meticulously maintained rectangular flowerbed. The flowerbed is vibrant with neatly arranged red and yellow flowers, framed by low hedges and interspersed with several dark, rounded shrubbery elements. Beyond this manicured garden, a series of active fountain jets add a dynamic and refreshing element to the scene, shooting water high into the air from circular stone basins.\n\nThe background contrasts natural and architectural elements. There is an abundance of lush green trees partially obscuring the view and providing a natural canopy. Beyond the trees, the skyline is dominated by a large, modern high-rise building with numerous square windows, standing stark against the blue sky.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph balances the calmness of green spaces with the bustling energy of urban life, complemented by the activity of the man and the fountain, and set against the backdrop of a significant architectural structure. The scene is lively yet peaceful, encapsulating a typical moment in an urban park setting.","title":"In the gardens of the Mall--Cleveland's civic center","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557257","546535","557262","547784","550752","544808","550075","551644","549516","557282","551776","550052","557266","553469","550161","550302"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["flowerbed","fountain","hedge","park","abundance","basin","jet","shrubbery","calmness","pavement"]}
