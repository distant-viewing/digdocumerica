{"path":"555031.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of what appears to be a cluster of grass or reeds in a nighttime setting. The plants are predominantly vertically oriented, with slender leaves and several stalks topped with dense, elongated flower spikes.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights the upper parts of the plants, especially the whitish flower spikes that contrast against the dark, almost black, background. The illuminated plants occupy the central and left side of the image, and some dew or moisture is visible on the leaves, reflecting the light and adding a shimmering effect.\n\nThere is no human activity or other objects visible in the photograph; the focus is solely on the natural elements. The background is uniformly dark, emphasizing the isolation and detailed texture of the plants against the void-like backdrop. This simplicity directs the viewer's attention to the natural beauty and delicate details of the flora.","title":"Grasses in a forest edged meadow at Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington.
