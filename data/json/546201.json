{"path":"546201.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a rural industrial setting, predominantly featuring equipment and natural scenery. In the foreground, a dirt path runs through the center of the image, slightly overgrown on either side with a mix of wildflowers and foliage. On the left side of the path, there is a large, old, rusting tank elevated on a metal stand. Beneath this tank are three red oil drums, and next to it is a smaller, red cylindrical tank.\n\nSurrounding these installations are patches of wild vegetation and a few scattered sunflowers, adding a touch of natural vibrancy to the scene. The background is densely populated with tall pine trees under a blue sky with light clouds, suggesting a secluded, forested location.\n\nTo the right, partially visible, is the back of a heavy machinery vehicle, which appears to be a crane or some sort of lifting equipment, hinting at ongoing work or maintenance in this area. The setting and equipment suggest that this could be a site used for storage or minor processing in an industrial or agricultural operation.","title":"Kimball oil field","placename":"Palestine (Tex.)","location":"Palestine, Texas","nn1":["546064","556402","542587","544179","552544","555542","556323","545998","548437","546037","546164","546108","542589","545997","544293","547777"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tank","equipment","path","drum","installation","stand","sort","vibrancy","wildflower","oil"]}
