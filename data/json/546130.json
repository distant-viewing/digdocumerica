{"path":"546130.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene with a prominent contrast between nature and industrial activity. In the background, there are multiple industrial structures, including tall smokestacks from which thick white and grey smoke is billowing into the sky. These smokestacks are part of a larger industrial complex that includes buildings with dark exteriors and visible piping. Beside the structures, there are also electrical pylons and power lines that suggest high-energy consumption or production.\n\nIn the foreground, the setting shifts to a more natural scene. A grassy field dotted with yellow flowers is visible. In this field, there are two horses, one prominently in the center foreground – a brown horse – and another, partially visible, that appears to be black or dark-colored. The presence of the horses and the natural landscape in the immediate foreground of the photo creates a stark contrast to the industrial backdrop. This juxtaposition might evoke themes of environmental impact, rural change, or the coexistence of industrial development with natural settings. The overall atmosphere is sunny and clear, emphasizing the impact of the smoke against the blue sky.","title":"The Atlas Chemical Company belches smoke across pasture land in foreground. The plant is referred to as \"Old Darky\" in the community because black soot from the plant covers everything nearby. One farmer claims he lost several cows due to soot and chemicals from Atlas.","placename":"Marshall (Tex.)","location":"Marshall, Texas","nn1":["545989","543010","543012","543159","546394","543013","544676","545990","553933","553842","546398","544736","550997","543813","549191","546141"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["horse","smokestack","consumption","pylon","smoke","shift","impact","piping","field","coexistence"]}
