{"path":"546319.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up shot of two sets of hands engaging with a collection of small fish, which are scattered across a net. The context appears to be one related to fishing, specifically the process of sorting or examining the day's catch. \n\nThe hands are focused on sorting or handling the fish, which are primarily visible in the lower central part of the image, settled within the confines of the wet, glistening net. This mesh material, likely part of a fishing net, contains and slightly blurs the shape of numerous small, silvery fish that are reflective and somewhat translucent, shimmering under what seems to be natural sunlight.\n\nThe image is rich in texture, from the rough human skin to the delicate, almost fragile appearance of the fish, and the intricate weave of the net. The photograph emphasizes a moment of human interaction with nature, captured in a setting that suggests a bright, sunlit day, possibly outdoors. The perspective is angled such that the viewer feels close to the action, creating a sense of immediacy and involvement in the task being performed.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: EPA personnel seine for fish to be used in bioassays","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542892","546313","546350","553095","545165","545211","546361","552271","545075","546366","545206","550047","552321","545198","545202","554008"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["net","fish","sort","fishing","immediacy","settle","confine","mesh","involvement","shimmer"]}
