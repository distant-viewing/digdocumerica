{"path":"545863.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph portrays a backlit silhouette of a young boy standing against a vividly illuminated background that resembles golden water. The image captures the boy from the rear as he appears to be gazing towards or walking into the shimmering light. The texture of the background looks somewhat liquid or reflective, possibly a body of water illuminated by the sun, creating speckles and bokeh that add to the glistening effect. The boy's outline is distinctly defined, showing his arms slightly away from his torso, giving a casual, slightly energetic stance. He is wearing what looks like a sleeveless top and shorts. The overall mood of the image is tranquil yet poignant, accentuated by the stark contrast and the warm golden hues enveloping the scene.","title":"Boy silhouetted against water of Galveston Bay at sunset","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["549642","550237","550241","545539","552035","550233","544196","550943","544187","553494","543689","553180","543688","549105","544183","554919"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","torso","speckle","stance","rear","outline","short","arm","silhouette","sun"]}
