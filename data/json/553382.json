{"path":"553382.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy construction site set in a rural or semi-urban environment. In the foreground, a large red excavator with \"Koehring\" written on it dominates the scene, its boom extended towards a mound of earth. Near the center, another smaller yellow machine possibly used for grading or moving soil is visible, as well as a few workers wearing hard hats, suggesting active construction work is underway.\n\nIn the middle ground, several other construction vehicles can be spotted, including a cement truck that is either delivering or awaiting to distribute concrete. The construction seems expansive as dirt tracks and unfinished structures are scattered throughout the area.\n\nFurther back, a row of houses and small buildings establish the proximity of a local community. These buildings appear slightly worn, indicating an older town or a less developed area. Above the houses, dense trees on a hill hint at a forested area surrounding the town, presenting a contrast between the natural environment and the industrial activity.\n\nOn the right and slightlyset back in the image stands a tall industrial chimney towering above the trees, emitting no visible smoke, suggesting it might be inactive or itâ€™s simply not captured in operation in this frame.\n\nThe sky is clear and the lighting suggests it is either late morning or early afternoon, emphasizing the vibrancy of the outdoor activity at the site.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction this is an epa-assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553378","544812","553383","553394","552814","543105","545652","543107","545665","553391","557742","557479","544167","550274","545888","549169"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","town","cement","await","deliver","site","excavator","boom","house","distribute"]}
