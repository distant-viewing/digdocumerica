{"path":"548342.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a busy intersection where several vehicles are maneuvering. The area is surrounded by patches of greenery and trees, with a fresh and vibrant look, indicating it could be in a temperate climate during a warm season. The roadway is asphalt, and the immediate area beside the road shows sections of dirt and grass.\n\nIn the frame, there's a formation of fourteen cars, some of which are waiting at what appears to be a stop sign, preparing to join the main road or proceed along their current path. The vehicles exhibit a variety of colors including red, yellow, white, and different shades of blue and gray. The automobile designs suggest an era that might be from the 1970s or 1980s, given their boxy shapes and the prevalent sedan and hatchback models.\n\nNotably, there's no visible signage apart from what seems to be a single road sign, which is too small to be detailed from this height. Lining the road in parts are utility poles, adding to the suburban or rural infrastructure feel. On the right, there appears to be some construction or undeveloped land, marked by bare soil and patches devoid of vegetation, indicating recent or ongoing works.\n\nOverall, the image composition places a central focus on the flow and movement of traffic within a seemingly tranquil and somewhat undeveloped locale.","title":"Entrance to expressway near the Tappan Zee Bridge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546620","546730","547776","546712","546370","546716","549919","556727","556732","553718","542684","556729","552711","545463","548084","546723"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","stop","asphalt","locale","automobile","intersection","roadway","sedan","patch","vehicle"]}
