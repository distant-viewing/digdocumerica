{"path":"548267.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image captures an intimate moment between a couple in a public park setting. The photograph is taken from behind a tree, creating a partially obscured, voyeuristic perspective. The couple is seated on a bench, leaning against a wooden fence that surrounds an area filled with similar benches, suggesting a café or casual dining area outdoors. They are in a close embrace and are kissing.\n\nThe environment features trees and possibly a paved walkway, as indicated by the blurriness of the background which implies a leafy, urban park atmosphere. The lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, adding a moody ambiance to the scene.\n\nThe couple is dressed in cold-weather clothing—both seem to be wearing coats and the woman appears to have a scarf, hinting at a chilly day. The scene communicates a sense of romance and private connection amid a public or semi-public space.","title":"Washington Square in Greenwich Village","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549755","549922","549324","551945","554900","551462","547072","549756","550051","554921","554901","551454","548467","548833","547834","554902"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["couple","bench","café","embrace","dining","scarf","communicate","walkway","park","connection"]}
