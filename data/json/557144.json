{"path":"557144.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a middle-aged man with pronounced facial features, including distinct lines and wrinkles which suggest a life full of expressions. His hair is slicked back and graying, complementing his fair complexion. He has a significant squint, possibly indicative of a bright, sunny day, and his gaze does not directly meet the camera, instead looking slightly off to the side.\n\nHe is dressed in a formal outfit consisting of a dark blazer over a lighter, vertically striped shirt with a pointed collar. His attire suggests a business or formal social setting.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, hinting at a suburban environment. Visible elements include part of a house with a shingled roof and a part of a car, suggesting he might be near a driveway or a parking space. The lighting in the image is natural, likely midday, given the brightness and the shadows visible on his face. The overall mood of the picture seems candid and informal despite the man's formal dress.","title":"Stewart Udall, former Secretary of the Interior and a longtime supporter of a tallgrass prairie national park, was a featured speaker at the second annual Tallgrass Prairie National Park Conference at Elmdale, Kansas, near Emporia in the Flint Hills region.
