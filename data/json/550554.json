{"path":"550554.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view depicting a diverse landscape with both natural and man-made features. In the foreground, there is a dense expanse of forest with deep green trees. Scattered throughout the forest are several clearings and small bodies of water. The midsection of the image features a community with numerous buildings, roads, and a large open area that appears to be an airport, identifiable by its long runways and adjoining taxiways. There are also several large parking lots and vehicles visible near the airport structures.\n\nFurther beyond the community area, there is another large runway parallel to the first, surrounded by more dense vegetation and additional clusters of buildings. The roads appear to interconnect various parts of the community and airport facilities, enhancing accessibility.\n\nThe top of the image provides a panoramic view of a flat landscape that stretches out into the distance where it meets a mountain range under a cloudy sky. The overall composition captures a blend of natural beauty and developed infrastructure, showcasing how the community and the airport are nestled within a vast forested area.","title":"View of Fairbanks, southwest, including the main campus of the university of Alaska, Fairbanks international airport and the tanana river.
