{"path":"553989.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset seascape. The foreground prominently features rocky shores partially submerged by gentle waves reflecting the fading light of the sky above. The water is relatively calm, with small waves breaking over the rocks, creating white foam.\n\nLooking towards the horizon, the sky is painted with hues of deep purple, blue, and patches of orange and yellow near the setting sun. The sun itself is not visible, but its impact on the sky indicates it is close to the horizon to the left outside the frame. A few scattered clouds are visible, subtly lit by the sun's dying light.\n\nThe background shows a coastline that stretches across the image, curving slightly from the centre to the right, suggesting a bay or a cove. The distant landscape is silhouetted against the sky, appearing as a dark, uniform mass that contrasts with the brighter sky above and the reflected light on the water.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the scene is entirely natural and untouched, evoking a feeling of tranquility and solitude. The overall composition and the cool color tones suggest a peaceful evening by the sea, inviting contemplation.","title":"Manele Bay at dusk","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["547483","543064","547479","545000","554074","545030","552335","543144","554075","543025","547638","553852","550296","550288","552294","543091"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","cove","wave","mass","seascape","foam","bay","horizon","contemplation","coastline"]}
