{"path":"542780.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene on a winding mountain road surrounded by dense forest. In the foreground, a logging truck loaded with large logs has tipped onto its side, partially blocking the road. The logs are thick and rough, suggesting they were recently cut from the forest. The rear section of the trailer, which is holding the logs, is resting on the road surface, showing the dark underside and wheels of the trailer.\n\nIn the background, another truck, which appears to be a smaller, older white truck, is stopped on the road due to the obstruction. The environment around the road is rich with tall, mature trees indicating a forested area.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a slightly gloomy light over the scene, and the road itself looks like a typical asphalt rural mountain road, winding and narrow with a dirt border that drops off steeply on the side where the truck has overturned. This presents a scene of a transportation or work-related accident in a remote, wooded location.","title":"Flatbed truck which ran off logging road","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["555154","542858","542855","553629","553628","554416","545930","542854","542609","554420","553627","545272","542856","555221","555094","555142"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["road","log","truck","trailer","underside","accident","overturn","drop","asphalt","mountain"]}
