{"path":"553596.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph appears to capture a scene of forest management or firefighting aftermath. In the foreground, a person wearing a protective suit and a yellow hard hat is using a chainsaw to cut through a large, burnt tree. The bark of the tree is charred black, suggesting it has been exposed to intense fire.\n\nThe worker is slightly bent over, focusing intently on the task. They wear a dark jacket which is also stained or charred, and are equipped with a safety harness or utility belt. Safety features, including a helmet and protective glasses, are noticeable.\n\nThe background shows a burnt forest landscape. There are several other blackened tree trunks standing, and the ground is covered with ash or dirt, reflecting a recent fire. The sky is partially obscured but seems relatively clear, indicating that the photo might have been taken after any smoke from the fire has cleared. The setting seems isolated, emphasizing the severity and impact of the fire in this wooded area.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
