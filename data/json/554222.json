{"path":"554222.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at an outdoor dining setting. Featured prominently are a woman and a man seated next to each other with a sunlit stucco wall behind them, which carries a decorative element resembling a sun or flame motif.\n\nThe woman, to the left, has styled blonde hair and wears a black outfit accessorized with a long necklace. She appears composed and is glancing toward the camera with a neutral or possibly reflective expression. \n\nBeside her, the man has a rugged, seasoned look with a beard and moustache, wearing a jacket with a fur-like collar and sporting a woolly sweater underneath. His expression seems contemplative or mildly discontent as he gazes away from the camera.\n\nIn the foreground, there are various items on the table indicative of a meal that might include beverages in textured glass tumblers, condiments, and utensils laid out. Other guests feature partially in the image, with a glimpse of a person in a distinctive white cap and another in a red-and-white garment, both facing away from the camera.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is casual and appears to be a social gathering, possibly during a cooler season given the attire of the people and the indirect, soft nature of the sunlight.","title":"Skiers enjoy late afternoon sun and a snack","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554268","551271","551834","551846","551460","543511","553167","557664","551277","545984","553186","551272","554895","557030","551848","544990"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["camera","condiment","guest","stucco","utensil","necklace","flame","dining","motif","garment"]}
