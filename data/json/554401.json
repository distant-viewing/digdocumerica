{"path":"554401.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful, rural landscape dominated by layers of natural elements. In the foreground, a small, weathered wooden cabin with a dark roof is slightly off-center, emphasizing a rustic quality. An exposed wooden facade and a prominent chimney give it a homely, rugged character. Around the cabin, a lush, green meadow extends towards a dense line of trees, transitioning from lighter green grass to the darker hues of the forested area. \n\nA lone deciduous tree stands out with its distinct, leafy silhouette against the meadow. Looking beyond, the composition gradually rises into rolling hills and then to a series of serene, blue-tinged mountains that stack against one another, creating depth with their fading colors due to the atmospheric perspective. The sky, though only partially visible at the top, is a soft pale blue, possibly indicating early morning or late evening light that adds a tranquil mood to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of serene isolation and untouched natural beauty, often found in wilderness areas or secluded rural regions. The image is likely intended to evoke a sense of tranquility and the enduring beauty of the natural world.","title":"Old hunting lodge in the high peaks region near Lake Placid","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554633","554721","554084","543763","557674","554562","557519","554767","555537","554438","554722","556985","557691","549249","550604","557025"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["meadow","cabin","endure","fading","intend","transitione","rolling","world","pale","find"]}
