{"path":"554933.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image depicts a vintage scene where a brown car, perhaps from the 1960s, is parked under a carport attached to a quaint stone structure. Above the carport, a sign reads \"Ju.S.E. Rodriquez,‚Äù perhaps denoting the ownership or residence of a person. The carport roof is supported by stone pillars, consistent with the walls of the adjacent building.\n\nThe structure itself is made of rustic stone, featuring various openings, including a door painted in red. The building appears to be a small house or workshop with rough construction, blending naturally into a yard without a defined lawn, primarily dusty ground with sparse grass.\n\nThe surrounding environment shows several leafless trees suggesting that the photograph might have been taken in fall or winter. There's a clear sky, indicating a bright, sunny day. There are no visible modern elements that could allude to a more specific time frame, other than the car's 1960s design, which places the image in or around that decade. The rural atmosphere and simplistic architecture give the photograph a timeless charm, reflecting a serene, lived-in space possibly located in a rural or suburban area. Overall, the scene captures a slice of mid-20th-century life, focused around domestic settings and personal vehicles.","title":"Home of a worker from Mexico who built the structure himself.
