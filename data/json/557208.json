{"path":"557208.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"In the photograph, the central focus is on a group of birds captured in mid-flight against a uniform, overcast sky. The birds, positioned towards the center and right-hand side of the frame, are in various states of flight, indicated by the differing angles of their wings. These birds appear small and silhouetted, suggesting they were captured from a distance.\n\nOverlaying the scene in the foreground are sparse, delicate branches which frame the birds, adding an organic and slightly blurred overlay to the picture. These branches diagonally traverse the photo from the top left corner to the mid-right side, creating a sense of depth and a natural vignette.\n\nThe background is a flat, muted gray sky, devoid of any distinct features or color variation, emphasizing a peaceful yet somber mood. This simplistic and somewhat monochrome palette suggests a cold or wintry day. The overall composition is both serene and contemplative, as the viewer's attention is drawn from the intricate details of the branches to the broader, expansive sky, and finally to the fleeting movement of the birds.","title":"A small flight of lesser sandhill cranes wheel through the early morning sky over the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary at GRand Island, Nebraska. They are among the 250,000 birds of this type that stop here on their migratory route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Yukon Territory and Siberia. The birds are attracted to the shallow and marshy habitat of the Platte River. The area is threatened by a possible project to dredge and dam the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["555013","553875","544605","550382","557204","549772","557123","557203","544834","557628","550888","546759","544609","554646","549101","544547"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["bird","flight","branch","overlay","vignette","wing","variation","uniform","corner","picture"]}
