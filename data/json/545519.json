{"path":"545519.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features a handwritten note that is prominently displayed in the foreground, pinned to a tree. The note reads: \"ATTENTION GAPERS: We have gone to the Bear Creek Scenic Area on Burney's Hill (the big hill west of it & the next right after that—ask for directions if lost). Your Audi will be back by dark. Love, Cameron.\" The note appears slightly weathered with fold marks and staining.\n\nThe background of the photo is deliberately blurred, emphasizing the note but still letting the viewer get a sense of the environment. A lush, dense forest surrounds the area, indicative of an isolated or rural setting. The colors are predominantly shades of green with the natural light filtering through the trees, casting soft shadows and highlights around the area.\n\nTowards the mid-right of the frame in the background, there’s a glimpse of a bright yellow car (possibly a Volkswagen Beetle given its distinctive shape) parked on a muddy path in the woods. A person is barely discernible beside the car, likely engaging in an outdoor activity like hiking or preparing to leave the scene in the car.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the crisp focus on the note and the blur of active life and nature in the background, suggests a moment paused during an adventure, the note serving as a momentary connector between the absent parties and the viewer.","title":"Notice to members of GASP organized weekend at Bankhead National Forest.
