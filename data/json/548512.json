{"path":"548512.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph shows a marine scene with multiple boats. The focus is on a larger cabin cruiser, prominently displaying the name \"WINDY TOO\" on its stern, moored in calm blue waters. The boat is a Trojan brand, evident from the nameplate on its side. This cruiser has a two-level structure: the main deck where a woman in a yellow and white outfit is seated at the stern, appearing to be looking out towards the sea, and an upper deck that includes a helm with possibly some equipment. \n\nThere are two other people visible on the boat: a man sitting to the left below the upper deck who seems to be gazing towards the water, and another person seated behind the helm obscured partly by the structure. \n\nTo the left, nearby, is another, smaller leisure boat with two more individuals; a man wearing shorts and a woman clad in a bikini, both appearing to be engaged in a conversation or looking around.\n\nIn the background, more boats and a faint coastline are visible under a hazy sky, suggesting a busy or popular area for boaters. The overall vibe of the image is leisurely and relaxed, typical of a sunny day out on the water.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["552050","548525","548736","549408","551255","552316","548520","548054","551310","548518","555718","545057","548080","548502","548495","551228"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["cruiser","boat","deck","bikini","brand","woman","cabin","coastline","vibe","name"]}
