{"path":"543006.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures an industrial landscape veiled in a smoky, dusky atmosphere. The focal point consists of three large, conical structures, possibly cooling towers, which are centrally and prominently placed in the composition. These towers rise dramatically against the backdrop of low, densely tree-covered hills silhouetted in the distance. Their surfaces catch faint glimmers of light, adding some detail to their otherwise dark outlines.\n\nDominating the foreground are multiple rows of utility poles, lined neatly along a narrow road that leads towards the towers. These poles are equipped with numerous wires and are indicative of an extensively developed electricity network. The road seems damp, reflecting light and creating a sense of recent rainfall or misty conditions.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in a sepia tone, possibly due to the time of day or the effect of industrial pollution, giving the photograph a somber and foreboding quality. This mood is accentuated by specks and imperfections visible on the photographic surface, suggesting age or deterioration of the physical photograph itself.\n\nThe composition effectively conveys a sensation of desolation and environmental impact, hinting at themes like industrialization's footprint and nature's resilience or submission. It encourages contemplation about the relationship between human activity and the natural landscape.","title":"Wood chip burners in smog","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543007","550183","557220","557374","550982","550168","545239","548850","551030","557375","544958","545912","543668","549190","557299","547539"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["towers","imperfection","forebod","glimmer","encourage","pole","cool","deterioration","electricity","footprint"]}
