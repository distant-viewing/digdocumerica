{"path":"554554.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a mysterious and largely shadowed natural scene that is rich with elements of nature. Dominating the image is a dense thicket of foliage, which includes both leaves and branches, predominantly in dark hues with hints of purple and green. These plants give the impression of being in a lush, possibly damp environment and contribute to a somewhat wild, untamed look. Adding to the intriguing ambiance of the image is what appears to be a layer of moss or algae in vivid green, located centrally towards the bottom of the frame. It covers a rock or possibly a part of the ground, contrasting strikingly with the darker tones of the surrounding plant life.\n\nThe focus is not very sharp throughout the field, suggesting a natural, untouched setting rather than a staged photograph. The composition lacks any human presence or artificial elements, reinforcing the theme of an unaltered natural environment. Light filtering through the foliage highlights parts of the green moss or algae, lending a slightly ethereal quality to the image. The combination of shadow, plant density, and the striking green element might evoke a sense of mystery or the allure of exploring an untouched natural habitat. The overall mood is one of serenity mixed with a hint of the wilderness.","title":"Local inhabitant's test of his septic system with a packet of Pylam dye results in leaching into the lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554961","555058","554976","554985","554980","558082","555054","554993","545285","555183","554991","555026","555008","542958","554998","555043"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["plant","allure","thicket","algae","filtering","foliage","serenity","hint","mystery","moss"]}
