{"path":"546273.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows a series of clear laboratory flasks, each labeled with black text markers. The flasks contain a pinkish-red liquid and are capped with black tops. They are arranged in a row on a shelf and appear identical in size and shape, suggesting a controlled experiment or a scientific process underway. The flasks are filled to various levels, some fit with lines marking measurements or contents possibly for precise experimentation or analysis.\n\nIn the background, there is electronic equipment, possibly part of the laboratory setup. This equipment includes dials and switches, hinting at functionality related to the experiment, such as controlling temperature or other conditions. The wall behind the equipment features a red and white striped pattern.\n\nThe overall setting is typical of a research or academic laboratory where scientific experiments are conducted. The focus on the flasks and the equipment in the background underscores the operational and experimental nature of the environment.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: The microbiology lab.
