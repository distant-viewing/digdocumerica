{"path":"543485.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This picturesque photograph features a scenic coastal landscape with two young children and a small dog enjoying the environment. The setting takes place on a rocky shoreline, under a clear blue sky interspersed with soft, white clouds.\n\nIn the foreground, two children—one boy and one girl—are seen sitting closely on a large, smooth boulder. The boy, dressed in a yellow shirt and with short blond hair, is holding a toy or a piece of food. Beside him is a girl with longer blond hair wearing a white blouse; she is turned slightly away from the camera, looking toward the sea.\n\nAccompanying them is a small, fluffy black and white dog with distinct facial markings that appears to be enjoying the company of the children.\n\nThe background presents a beautiful view of a rugged coastline dotted with large, irregularly shaped rocks and clumps of grass, leading out to a calm ocean. The rocks protrude into the water, creating intricate patterns of tide pools and small waves.\n\nThe vegetation between the rocks is lush and varied, suggesting a rich, natural ecosystem. The scene stretches out to a seemingly distant shoreline under a vast, expansive sky, giving a sense of tranquility and wide-open space.\n\nOverall, the composition wonderfully captures a moment of youthful wonder and relaxation in a stunning natural setting, conveying a sense of peace and companionship.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543327","543395","552341","552279","547676","557423","543390","543310","548695","545218","554497","543473","543072","544302","543372","543389"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","child","girl","rock","boy","shoreline","wonder","toy","companionship","clump"]}
