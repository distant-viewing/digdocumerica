{"path":"547674.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a small boat moving through a vast body of water, which appears to have a brownish hue. The boat is white and streamlined, and it's traveling from the bottom left of the image toward the top right, creating a pronounced wake behind it. This wake forms a V-shape, trailing the boat and spreading outwards as it moves away.\n\nThere are a few visible splashes around the stern of the boat, indicating movement and possibly the speed at which the boat is traveling. The overall composition of the photo isolates the boat within a large expanse of water, emphasizing its small size and the vastness of the surrounding water. The viewpoint is from a considerable height, providing an almost top-down perspective. The water's texture and the minimalistic approach to the composition lend a sense of serenity, despite the movement implied by the boat's wake. The edges of the photograph have a slight dark vignette, possibly due to the age of the photo or the method of its capture.","title":"Small powerboat on potomac river above mt.
