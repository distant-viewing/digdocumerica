{"path":"544108.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of tourists at an open-pit mining site. The environment is arid and the background is dominated by layered earth tones and staggered terraces typical of a large excavation site. The sky is a clear, deep blue, indicating a bright, sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman is the main focal point. She is using a camera with a telephoto lens, focusing intently on something in the distance. She wears a colorful, floral blouse that adds a pop of color to the scene. To her right is a man whose face is partially visible as he too looks in the same direction, standing just slightly behind her.\n\nTo the far right, another man, partially cut off by the edge of the photo, appears to be waiting and watching. He wears sunglasses and has a contemplative expression. In the middle right, an older man stands observing the site, also wearing sunglasses and dressed casually like the others.\n\nThe terrain around the group is rocky and barren, with small stones and sparse vegetation, emphasizing the ruggedness of the setting. There is a noticeable rope or wire running horizontally at about waist level in the photo, which seems to be a safety barrier for the tourists. The overall composition captures the curiosity and interest of the group as they observe the workings of the mine.","title":"The american association for retired persons tours the 300 ft open pit copper mine at the duval corp","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["544103","544418","544095","544054","544093","544111","544085","549242","554768","553964","544100","550568","544785","549167","553965","544112"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["tourist","sunglasse","site","group","observe","terrace","waist","pop","mine","pit"]}
