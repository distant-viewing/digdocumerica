{"path":"542847.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dense, mist-covered forest landscape. Tall pine trees dominate the scene, stretching across the entirety of the image. These trees are densely packed and vary in size and foliage density, suggesting a natural, untamed growth. The background features a slightly lighter, misty atmosphere that bathes the area in a soft, diffuse light, possibly conveying early morning or late afternoon conditions. The mist appears to be suffused with sunlight, creating an ethereal glow that partially obscures the depth of the forest behind the visible trees. The colors are muted and cool, primarily consisting of greens from the trees and whites and grays from the mist, contributing to a serene and somewhat mystical ambiance. No human figures or artificial structures are visible, emphasizing the untouched and secluded nature of this wooded area.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555128","555124","549226","543406","542849","555125","542926","557601","557019","555119","555051","542930","554965","542846","554959","542753"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mist","suffuse","tall","entirety","forest","whites","tree","density","bath","growth"]}
