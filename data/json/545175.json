{"path":"545175.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaging in a crab fishing activity on a boat. The man on the left, wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt, holds a large crab in both hands, examining it closely. He is positioned in profile, looking downwards towards the crab. The second man, on the right, wears a striped, collared, short-sleeved shirt and sunglasses. He looks towards the first man, potentially communicating or observing the crab as well.\n\nThe background shows the open water, shimmering under sunlight, suggesting the photo might be taken on a bright, sunny day. The men are standing close to the edge of the boat, with elements of the boat visible, including the weathered wooden side and what appears to be part of a crab trap.\n\nThe atmosphere seems to be active and focused, with both individuals visibly engaged in the process of handling the catch. The photograph is vividly colored and offers a glimpse into the labor and interaction involved in crab fishing.","title":"Jack Wiegardt and Denis Hickey work their Dungeness crab pots.
