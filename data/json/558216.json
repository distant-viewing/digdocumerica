{"path":"558216.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph captures two young women, possibly teenagers, engaged in artistic activities at a classroom desk. They are both focused intently on their work, which involves painting or drawing.\n\nThe girl on the right has long, straight, light brown hair and wears a white blouse under a red vest. She is using a paintbrush on a large piece of white paper, and there is a box of colored pencils on the table beside her, a few of which are laid out in front of her. \n\nThe girl on the left has darker hair, similarly long and styled with bangs, covered partly by a brown sweater. She is holding a pencil or paintbrush and appears to be working on a darker piece of paper or canvas.\n\nThe setting suggests a well-lit classroom environment with wooden desks. In the background, there's a window showing a metal grille or partial blinds, allowing natural light into the space. Shelves with various items and student artwork visible in the background contribute to the educational scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a moment of creativity and concentration in a school setting.","title":"Art class students at cathedral senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
