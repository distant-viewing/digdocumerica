{"path":"548315.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy industrial scene focused on waste management and disposal activities. It shows an expansive waste processing area, likely at a dumping site or recycling facility.\n\nIn the center of the image, several barges, overloaded with heaps of trash, are floating in a waterway. These barges are densely packed with miscellaneous waste, mostly unidentifiable but including visible patches of colorful refuse which could be plastics, fabrics, or other materials.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, you can see a substantial land area covered in piles of similar waste. This section appears to be actively managed, as indicated by the presence of several large yellow machines, possibly bulldozers or front loaders, moving around and working on the piles of trash.\n\nSmoke and steam are visibly emanating from structures resembling factory pipes, suggesting ongoing industrial processing activities. These emissions hint at possible incineration or other waste processing operations taking place nearby.\n\nThe background shows a clear delineation between the industrial zone and a more natural landscape, possibly a wetland or open field, creating a sharp contrast between the disturbed, polluted industrial area and the cleaner, unpolluted environment in the distance. The skyline is quite overcast, adding a somber tone to the setting which emphasizes the environmental impact of the scene depicted.","title":"Garbage scows bring solid waste, for use as landfill, to fresh kills on Staten Island, just east of carteret, nj","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549808","549801","547062","549799","549817","548366","548357","547611","549936","549818","549780","550248","550880","550882","550960","543828"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","processing","barge","trash","delineation","recycle","loader","pile","emanate","disposal"]}
