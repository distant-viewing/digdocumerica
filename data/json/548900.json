{"path":"548900.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a farm field, showcasing a distinctive pattern of parallel rows of crops. The image captures several workers spaced evenly across the rows, apparently engaged in agricultural activities such as harvesting or planting. Each worker is wearing what looks like white clothing, which makes them stand out against the dark green hues of the crops. The perspective is top-down, providing a clear and structured view of the repetitive lines formed by both the crops and the workers. The field itself is dense with vegetation, indicating a lush, healthy crop. The overall scene combines elements of human labor with natural agriculture, highlighting a large-scale farming operation.","title":"Pickers in field near El Centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["557478","544548","549104","554056","548820","554017","548907","548898","548997","553048","543481","542710","553879","553881","553047","548905"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crop","worker","down","row","planting","harvesting","field","agriculture","farming","farm"]}
