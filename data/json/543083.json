{"path":"543083.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a serene beach scene where two women and two dogs are strolling along the shoreline. The beach features dark sandy terrain, complemented by the gentle waves of a deep blue sea crashing onto the shore. The foreground is marked by large driftwood and a prominent, weathered tree stump, enhancing the natural, rugged feel of the environment.\n\nThe first woman, positioned slightly ahead, is holding what appears to be a leash or a line extending to one of the dogs, suggesting they are engaged in a playful or interactive activity. The second woman walks closely behind, also attentive to the dogs. Both women are dressed in casual, comfortable clothing suitable for a beach setting, with the visible attire suggesting a windy but clear day.\n\nIn the background, the open sea extends far into the horizon, meeting a blue sky lightly scattered with clouds. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the natural elements—the sand, water, and wood—dominantly shaping the scene. The image exudes a sense of calm and leisure, typical of a pleasant day out on a beach.","title":"Men and dog on beach","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543500","548695","543070","548697","543395","548292","545133","543072","543463","549928","557507","543394","543390","555402","546953","550924"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","beach","woman","leash","extending","sha","sea","stroll","crash","driftwood"]}
