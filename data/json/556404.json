{"path":"556404.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial coal mining facility. The main building in the image is a large, turquoise-colored structure with the text \"Virginia Pocahontas Mine No. 1\" displayed prominently on its side. This suggests it is part of the Dorchester Coal Company as indicated by another line of text on the building. The setting appears mountainous, indicative of typical mining regions, with bare trees and a gray, overcast sky in the background, emphasizing the industrial theme.\n\nSurrounding the central building are various industrial elements: large metal silos, conveyor belts, and ductwork. One of the conveyor belts is sloped steeply, transporting materials to or from higher elevations. Visible metallic structures include support beams, towers, and other infrastructure necessary for the operation and transport of coal.\n\nThere is no sign of active human presence in the moment captured, but there are parked vehicles, including a red and white van near the building, suggesting at least a minimal presence or recent activity. The environment is gritty, dominated by shades of metal and the dull green of the building, all elements that underscore the industrial function of the site.","title":"Cleaning plant at Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company mine #1 near Richlands, Virginia.
