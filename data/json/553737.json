{"path":"553737.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a young woman presenting a large bouquet of pink flowers. She wears a white jacket over a pink top, enhancing the vibrancy of the bouquet she holds. On her head, she sports a matching floral crown made of pink flowers, complementing the general theme. Her expression is joyful and focused, seemingly engaged in the action of displaying the flowers, likely to onlookers or a specific audience not visible in the shot.\n\nIn the background, mainly out of focus, several other elements can be discerned. There are blurred figures of people, suggesting a public, possibly outdoor setting. Architectural features like overhangs or extensions from buildings suggest that this scene could be taking place in an urban area, near a pavilion or a similar public structure.\n\nThe composition of the photo places the woman centrally, with her arms extended towards the camera, making the flowers the most striking element of the image. The depth of field is shallow, with the subject clearly in focus against a blurred background, drawing attention primarily to her and the flowers. The image conveys a cheerful, festive atmosphere, likely associated with some form of celebration or public event involving floral displays.","title":"Honolulu International Airport handles almost all of the island's visitors.
