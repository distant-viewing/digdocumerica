{"path":"555609.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene with a mix of natural and man-made elements. The foreground displays two rustic buildings, possibly farm sheds or storage units, with weathered gray and white wooden siding. The roofs of these structures are sloped and appear to be in a state of disrepair, hinting at their likely utility or agricultural purpose.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features an expansive open field, stretching towards a large hill with a barren, almost desolate appearance. The hill's surface is marked by patches of bare earth and minimal vegetation, suggesting it might be a result of excavation or mining activities. This stark, undeveloped terrain contrasts with the greener, more vegetated areas visible around it, possibly indicating different uses or stages of land development.\n\nOverhead, a series of power lines extend across the frame, strung from left to right, with several visible birds perched on the wires, adding a dynamic element of wildlife to the scene. The sky is clear and mostly cloudless, suggesting a bright, sunny day, which bathes the entire scene in natural light.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the signs of human activity and industrial use with natural elements, creating a layered depiction of rural life and land utilization. The photograph has a slight vintage quality, indicated by its color balance and the style of the structures, which may hint at its temporal context, possibly taken a few decades ago.","title":"Birds are the only living things seen at this abandoned farmstead which is surrounded by coal company strip mined land off route #800 near barnsville, Ohio","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["547658","552091","554807","552515","555577","555629","555537","552462","555635","547305","549222","547304","556341","557946","552090","554782"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["vegetated","greener","land","slop","hill","perch","result","bar","hind","shed"]}
