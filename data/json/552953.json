{"path":"552953.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This image depicts a natural river landscape. The photograph is taken from a vantage point close to the riverbank, showing a broad river flowing from left to right. The water appears muddy or silt-laden, typical of many rivers, reflecting a light brown or tan color under a bright sky.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by dense, dark foliage and fallen debris along the sloping riverbank. Various species of plants, including grasses and bushes with vivid green leaves, contribute to the richness of the scene. On the left side, a tree with larger leaves partially veils the view of the river, adding depth to the composition.\n\nThe background reveals a continuation of the river flanked by dense forest on both sides, extending into the distance and bending slightly out of view. The far banks of the river are less distinct, obscured by the natural atmospheric haze. The overall atmosphere is quiet and secluded, capturing a snapshot of a possibly remote riverine environment. No human presence or man-made structures are visible, which emphasizes the untouched, natural aspect of the scene. The sky, mostly excluded from the frame, hints at a clear day, contributing to the overall brightness of the image.","title":"Oil spill on Schuylkill River, July 5, 1972, following Hurricane Agnes, covered greenery on river bank.
