{"path":"548060.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents a strikingly composed view focusing primarily on a sparse field that shows early growth of grass or similar vegetation piercing through cracked and dry soil. The foreground is dominated by green shoots emerging from the earth, hinting at resilience or new life in a harsh environment.\n\nBeyond this initial band of vegetation, the background features a row of houses or farm structures, somewhat blurred, suggesting some distance from the primary subject of the photograph. These buildings have a rural architectural style with visible pitched roofs and are uniformly aligned, contributing to a feel of organized rural or suburban human settlement.\n\nThe sky above is clear and a deep, vibrant blue, which indicates fair weather and contrasts sharply with the barrenness of the ground. This setting could be indicative of a region experiencing drought or seasonal changes that affect the vegetation growth. The choice of focus, where the ground and emerging plants are sharp while the houses and sky are not, draws attention to the struggle and adaptation of nature in a potentially human-altered landscape.","title":"Hayden island condominiums are constructed on sand dunes","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["549034","553698","549132","557530","544519","549134","555618","549156","544184","549181","544523","554780","555641","543658","545724","545040"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["emerge","growth","composed","pitched","pierce","struggle","adaptation","shoot","choice","vegetation"]}
