{"path":"542701.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vividly detailed natural landscape featuring a winding river cutting through a densely forested mountainous region. The river, prominently highlighted by the sunlight, shimmers as it flows through the valley, creating white water rapids in certain areas which suggests a fast current. The surrounding terrain is steep and covered with a thick canopy of trees, conveying a lush and rugged environment.\n\nAlongside the river, there are visible dirt tracks or roads that follow the river's course, perhaps used for maintenance or as hiking trails. The perspective provided by the aerial view emphasizes the isolation and untouched nature of the region, with no immediate signs of urban development.\n\nThe composition of the photograph itself enhances the dramatic contrast between the rocky riverbed, marked by lighter colors of rocks and sand, and the dark green tones of the dense vegetation. The overall scene encapsulates a serene and untouched part of nature, showcasing its beauty from a bird's-eye viewpoint.","title":"This area of the Kings River would be made into a lake if the proposed dam is constructed","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542700","550542","550531","550577","550526","542696","553452","543739","542909","549456","550524","550576","550633","550627","550527","550529"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","rapid","region","riverbed","course","hiking","shimmer","current","viewpoint","trail"]}
