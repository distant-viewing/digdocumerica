{"path":"548828.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and pastoral scene involving a cattle drive. A herd of cattle, consisting of various colors such as brown, white, and black, is being herded along a dusty rural road. Leading and flanking the herd are two cowboys on horseback. The cowboys are wearing traditional ranching attire, including cowboy hats.\n\nThe composition captures the cattle and riders in a central position while the road stretches forth into the distance, fading into a hazy horizon. Visible in the background is sparse vegetation typical of a dry, possibly semi-arid landscape. Overhead, the sky is clear, suggesting a warm, sunny day.\n\nThe image's setting evokes a sense of wide-open spaces and gives an insight into rural life and traditional livestock management practices. The photograph has a somewhat faded, dated quality, indicating it could have been taken several years ago. This lends a nostalgic feel to the scene, underlining its timelessness and the enduring nature of certain rural traditions.","title":"Moving cattle raise dust along the highway--near Calipatria in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548830","548829","548878","549033","543634","552698","548838","553104","543776","554128","553105","552565","553814","553100","548954","543779"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["cattle","herd","cowboy","ranching","drive","horseback","timelessness","insight","tradition","rider"]}
