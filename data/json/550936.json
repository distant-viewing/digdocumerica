{"path":"550936.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene. In the foreground, a young woman walks on the sandy beach; she is wearing a patterned bikini and is holding sandals in her right hand, with her other hand raised near her chin as if she is about to brush hair from her face or adjusting sunglasses. Her expression appears engaged and cheerful as she moves across the frame.\n\nIn the midground, there's a large makeshift shelter with \"THE LANTERN INN\" written across its side. The shelter appears somewhat worn, with the fabric looking sun-bleached and draped over a frame to provide shade. Beneath it, several people are visible, some standing and others seated on beach chairs, apparently engaged in casual beach activities such as chatting or enjoying the shade.\n\nBeyond the shelter, the beach is bustling with people. There are numerous beach-goers seated on lounge chairs, some under personal umbrellas, suggesting a busy, populated beach environment. The crowd consists of individuals and groups, some interacting and others absorbed in personal relaxation.\n\nThe background shows a glimpse of the calm sea and a clear sky that signifies a bright, sunny day typical of a beach setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on recreational beach activities and the interaction of people in a leisurely extract, reflects a lively and relaxed beach atmosphere. The image tells a story of summer days, beach culture, and community gatherings in an informal, sunlit setting.","title":"At Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["548541","547503","547482","547491","546874","547628","547507","546794","550931","553685","553686","543534","550919","550930","550243","550932"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","shelter","chair","bleach","goer","extract","sandal","chin","chat","bikini"]}
