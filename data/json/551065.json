{"path":"551065.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial scene set in a mountainous area. It captures an extensive open-pit mine characterized by steep sloping sides which are covered with different shades of purple and brown earth materials suggesting excavation activities. At the top rim of the pit, there is a large industrial building with multiple levels and a predominantly metallic exterior, likely a facility associated with the mining operation. Adjacent to this structure are some smaller buildings and possibly machinery, which are partly obscured by trees.\n\nThe background is dominated by forest-covered hills, indicating that the location is in a relatively remote or rural area. The variety of green hues in the trees suggests dense vegetation. The lighting in the scene has a twilight or dusk quality, casting a somewhat somber and quiet atmosphere over the image. This contributes to an overall impression of isolation and perhaps the declining activity of the mining site. No human figures are visible in the photograph, emphasizing the scale and industrial focus of the environment.","title":"Slag from the Harewood Mine has eroded this hillside above Smithers.
