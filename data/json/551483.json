{"path":"551483.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged man dressed in a dark blue work uniform, including a short-sleeved shirt and matching pants, wearing a black cap. He is casually leaning against a large, cylindrical public trash bin made of concrete. The manâ€™s eyes are closed, and his facial expression suggests he might be tired or resting.\n\nStrikingly, a large, inflated balloon in the shape of a twisted, tubular object hovers next to him. The balloon is primarily pink with purple designs and wavy lines running along its length, suggesting motion or air currents. The man holds onto several strings or ribbons tied to the narrow end of the balloon, implying he is either selling these balloons or transporting them.\n\nThe scene is set in an urban environment with a blurry background featuring other pedestrians, including a young child in light-colored clothing and a woman. Buildings and what appear to be traffic lights are also visible in the soft-focus background, suggesting a bustling city atmosphere. The image conveys a juxtaposition of a mundane workday scene against the whimsy of a large, playful balloon.","title":"Weary balloon vendor rests against a waste can on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553308","551511","556217","556216","553294","552652","553272","557718","552359","551689","553240","553266","549867","557719","551463","557798"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["balloon","hover","matching","workday","ribbon","bin","string","sell","current","concrete"]}
