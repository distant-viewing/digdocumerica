{"path":"548663.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features the upper portion of a classic Victorian-style house framed by a lush green tree with pinnate leaves, possibly a type of acacia. The house is painted white, enhancing its intricate architectural details against the rich blue sky above. Prominent features of the house include a steeply pitched roof with blue shingles, a turret with a pointed cap, and decorative white trim adding to the elegant, historic feel of the home.\n\nThe window visible in the turret section of the house has multiple panes and is complemented by white wooden shutters on each side. Below the turret, a partial view of a traditional wooden porch banister suggests a spacious and inviting veranda. The craftsmanship of the house includes further detailed woodwork, visible in the form of supports under the overhangs and a decorative vent at the gable peak.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the natural framing provided by the tree branches and leaves at the top of the frame, gives a sense of tranquility and seclusion, focusing the attention on the architectural beauty of the house set against the brilliant sky. This setting might be in a quiet, sunny neighborhood, where the mature landscaping complements the historic residences.","title":"A typical Bahamian-style residence of Key West.
