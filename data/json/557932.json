{"path":"557932.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a pottery demonstration conducted in a rustic, covered outdoor setting. The setting gives off a natural, earthy ambiance with visible soil ground and wooden supports. On the left side of the image, a man is actively engaged in shaping a piece of clay on a pottery wheel, which is positioned atop what appears to be a makeshift wooden table. He is intensely focused on his craft, bending forward over the wheel, both hands working the clay. The potter is dressed casually in a blue shirt and jeans, both splattered with clay, suggesting he has been working for a while.\n\nSpectators, including adults and children, are gathered around watching the potter at work. In the foreground, seated only a few feet away from the potter, two young children and one adult woman are observing attentively. The children and woman are casually dressed, suitable for an outdoor event. The entire group evinces interest and curiosity, watching the potter's skilled hands.\n\nThe background shows more onlookers standing under the shelter, their faces partially visible. The environment is informal and educational, with an emphasis on learning and experiencing the artistry of pottery-making firsthand. The open sides of the shelter allow in natural light and glimpses of green trees and outdoors, connecting the activity to its natural, tranquil setting.","title":"Hale farm and western reserve village potter shows visitors how his work was done in the 19th century","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["553269","549712","550068","550675","551677","553262","544416","551719","543181","551718","551659","557943","544431","555533","551654","557153"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["clay","shelter","child","wheel","watch","adult","artistry","making","work","learn"]}
