{"path":"550819.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and atmospheric twilight scene featuring a body of water, probably a river, reflecting the colors of the sky and elements of the landscape. In the background, there are silhouettes of industrial structures, including a prominent factory with smokestacks emitting dark smoke that blends into the evening sky. To the right, there is a water tower also silhouetted against the sky, which is painted with hues of dark blue, orange, and hints of purple, suggestive of either sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe composition uses the reflection in the water to effectively mirror the sky and the structures, which amplifies the visual impact of the industrial elements against the natural beauty of the twilight. The water is calm, suggesting a peaceful setting despite the industrial activity. The overall mood of the image might evoke contemplation about the contrast between nature and human-made environments, highlighting themes of environmental impact or industrialization.","title":"Nekoosa Paper Company on the Wisconsin River.
