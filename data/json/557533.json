{"path":"557533.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a rugged landscape characterized by a complex array of mountains and valleys. In the center of the image, there's a prominent lake or reservoir, snaking its way around the contours of the surrounding terrain. Surrounding the water body, the land is interspersed with patches of greener vegetation, narrow roads, and small developed areas that likely include homes or small community buildings. The textures and colors of the mountains vary, suggesting different vegetation types or rock materials, and the overall color tone is dominated by earthy browns and dark greens, hinting at either the time of day being near dusk or the natural colors of the terrain. The topography casts shadows, indicating a low sun angle. In the distance, the land meets a hazy horizon where the blue sky gently fades into the view, suggesting the vastness and remote location of the scene. This type of landscape could be indicative of a mountainous region in a less densely populated area, often found in regions known for their natural preserves or national parks.","title":"Aerial of the santa monica mountains looking south, near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553566","555712","548974","543761","555845","544063","550596","555683","555669","552426","550599","550641","555705","550396","550540","550510"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["reservoir","type","region","land","mountain","preserve","topography","know","snake","terrain"]}
