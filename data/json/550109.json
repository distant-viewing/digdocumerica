{"path":"550109.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The image features four young individuals on the porch of a quaint, timeworn wooden house. From left to right, the first individual is a girl with short dark hair, wearing a light red and white sleeveless top. Next to her, another girl with slightly longer dark hair, dressed in a white blouse and a patterned skirt, stands smiling. The third individual is a boy with short dark hair, wearing a dark red or maroon shirt, casually standing with his hands resting on the wooden railing. Lastly, there is another girl with longer dark hair, donning a light blue blouse and leaning on the railing with her chin resting on her crossed hands.\n\nThe house itself has a weathered charm, with faded, peeling paint and visible signs of wear. The porch is spacious and includes decorative elements like turned posts and a railing with simple, geometric patterns. Behind the group, a door leads into the house, next to which a \"House for Sale\" sign is visible, suggesting the property is on the market.\n\nIn the background, another house can be glimpsed, hinting at a residential neighborhood setting. The overall mood appears nostalgic and serene, capturing a moment of youthful companionship against the backdrop of a house with a story to tell.","title":"This old house with its friendly porch needs a fresh coat of paint and repair work.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553498","552959","548312","545509","550137","545436","557641","557677","545397","550117","548441","546209","550120","545522","552958","557360"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["house","girl","railing","hair","blouse","porch","maroon","chin","companionship","individual"]}
