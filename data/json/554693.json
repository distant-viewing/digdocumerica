{"path":"554693.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a rustic setting at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Newcomb Campus, denoted by a substantial wooden sign. The sign is supported by upright wooden beams, giving it a sturdy and prominent appearance. It states \"State University of N.Y. College of Environmental Science and Forestry NEWCOMB CAMPUS\" along with \"Archer & Anna Huntington Wildlife Forest Station\" carved and painted on its surface, along with images of deer and trees, reflecting the forest theme.\n\nSurrounding the sign are dense woods, showcasing a variety of trees in a palette change from deep green to rich autumnal hues of red, orange, and yellow. The trees are tall and appear to be predominantly pine and deciduous types, which are partially shedding leaves, indicating the season is likely early to mid-fall. Natural light filters softly through the trees, adding a bright yet serene quality to the scenery. The forest floor beneath the trees appears lush and is mostly covered with grass and patches of fallen leaves, enhancing the woodland aesthetic.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a natural, peaceful forest setting that highlights the environmentally-focused nature of the campus and serves as a welcoming point or informational marker for visitors or students alike.","title":"Sign at the entrance to the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Newcomb (N.Y.)","location":"Newcomb, New York","nn1":["551962","554718","542789","555216","542568","557822","550603","554715","544913","555116","558012","544239","546090","554738","558033","558088"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["forest","campus","student","denote","tree","deer","sign","welcome","marker","leave"]}
