{"path":"544510.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a suburban development, likely from the mid to late 20th century. The image shows a grid-like layout of residential streets filled with single-story houses, most of which are small and appear to be similarly designed, possibly indicating a period of rapid suburban expansion or a planned community.\n\nThe houses predominantly have flat roofs and vary subtly in color, ranging from shades of beige, gray, and pastel colors. Each home includes a small yard, and some have driveways with cars parked either in the driveway or along the street. The roads are paved and weave through the neighborhood in a somewhat curvilinear pattern, designed to conform to the layout of the lots and the positioning of the buildings.\n\nThe perimeter of the development is bordered by more densely wooded areas, hinting at the development's encroachment into a more rural setting. To one side of the photo, more houses can be seen, suggesting that the community is part of a larger urban or suburban expansion.\n\nThere are no visible signs of commercial activity within the immediate vicinity of the neighborhood; it is purely residential. The absence of people and dynamic activity in the image emphasizes the stillness and uniformity of the subdivision.\n\nThe overall impression is one of orderly, controlled development typical of post-war suburban planning in many parts of the world, aimed at accommodating growing populations and the increasing ownership of automobiles, reflected in the presence of driveways and streets designed for vehicle access.","title":"Florida--South Miami Heights residential area, south of Miami","placename":"South Miami Heights (Fla.)","location":"South Miami Heights, Florida","nn1":["544550","549071","553934","548824","556975","553699","553700","546399","545914","547435","548825","547769","547211","544629","544604","551198"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["driveway","development","expansion","house","layout","neighborhood","street","ownership","population","design"]}
