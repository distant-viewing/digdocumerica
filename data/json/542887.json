{"path":"542887.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a misty, somber beach scene. The foreground prominently displays a large weathered driftwood piece resembling a beached, streamlined creature due to its elongated shape and pointed ends. Its bleached and smoothed surface contrasts sharply with the dark, rugged surfaces of several large rocks strewn across the sandy beach. The rocks, which are covered in dark wet algae or seaweed, vary in size and contribute to the rugged terrain.\n\nThe sand appears smooth and damp, hinting at recent tide activity. In the background, the beach fades into a foggy mist that envelops the trees and blurs the distinction between the shore and the forest edge. This mist adds a layer of mystery and a sense of isolation to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a serene yet slightly melancholic atmosphere, common to foggy coastal regions, enhancing the natural textures and forms found within the landscape.","title":"California--Moonstone beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542886","543078","542889","543075","542884","542888","543081","543069","542890","543054","543091","544989","548051","543244","546970","548184"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","mist","smooth","bleach","seaweed","creature","algae","driftwood","tide","rock"]}
