{"path":"549856.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Morgan, Hank","caption":"This photograph captures a city street scene, presumably from an earlier time given the styles of automobiles and overall quality of the image. The focus is partially on a few cars that appear typical of American models from the 1970s or 1980s, evident from their large, boxy shapes and shiny chrome details. There is a mixture of a station wagon and sedans shown, traveling in the same direction along what seems to be an urban road.\n\nThe backdrop is dominated by a tall, iconic skyscraper shrouded slightly by haze, strongly resembling the Empire State Building in New York City. This gives a clear indication that the setting is urban, possibly within Midtown Manhattan.\n\nBesides the striking architecture in the background, there's an overhead traffic light visible at the top of the frame, displaying a green signal which suggests the flow of traffic is ongoing. There are also leafless trees lining the side of the road, possibly indicating that the scene was captured during colder months.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and the visibility slightly reduced, probably due to atmospheric conditions like fog or smog, contributing to the vintage or historical feel of the photograph. The color palette is muted with greyish tones dominating the scene, interspersed with the metallic and glass reflections off the cars and the prominent architectural feature in the background.","title":"Queens boulevard, just east of the Queens-midtown tunnel","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556709","555782","547651","556718","554297","556724","554310","548331","549882","549310","556681","554314","545432","545498","557230","546626"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["traffic","month","reduce","smog","indication","mute","chrome","wagon","automobile","signal"]}
