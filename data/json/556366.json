{"path":"556366.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be an underground mining environment. It features two miners equipped with safety helmets that include mounted lights, essential for visibility in the dimly lit area.\n\nThe miner on the left is bending over, engaged in some kind of manual labor. This figure is partially obscured, with only their back and the side of their face visible. The lighting highlights the reflective elements of his protective work clothes.\n\nThe miner on the right is positioned closer to the foreground but turned in such a way that only half of his face and profile are visible. His helmet light is directed towards the camera, giving us a clearer view of the helmet's features and the rugged, dust-covered characteristics of the environment.\n\nThe setting is framed by thick, heavy beams overhead and metal structures around, possibly workings of the mine's interior support system. These beams add to a sense of enclosure and the challenging conditions within the mine. The interaction between light and darkness is a dominant feature in the image, creating an atmosphere that underscores the miners' work environment. Tiny droplets or particles reflect light, creating a sparkling effect against the mostly dark backdrop, perhaps indicative of moisture or mineral dust.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, combined with the limited visibility and the miners' focused activities, creates a suggestive narrative of hard work and the intense physical conditions within the subsurface mining industry.","title":"Section of a long wall mine with jacks holding up the ceiling at the right and the mining machine at the left where teeth rake coal onto a conveyor belt which takes the material out of the tunnel for transport out of the mine. Miners are illuminated by the photographer's lighting. Long wall mining is relatively new in the U.S. and is more costly, but allows about twice as much coal to be taken from a mine.
