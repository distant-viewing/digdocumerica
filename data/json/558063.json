{"path":"558063.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a rural community or a small farming settlement. The photograph shows various features of a landscape that is predominantly green, with elements of rural life visible. The main area of the image includes a large grassy field or pasture directly beside which there is a dirt road, perhaps acting as a divider.\n\nSeveral clusters of buildings can be seen dotted throughout the scene. These structures include both residential-style houses and larger barns or storage-type buildings, typical of a farming community. The buildings are variously colored, some with red roofs and others with neutral shades, seemingly well-integrated with the surrounding nature.\n\nThere is a prominent parking lot filled with cars, indicating a gathering or a community center nearby, possibly a church or school due to its seeming centrality and larger structure nearby. Notably, the cars look like models from mid-20th century.\n\nThe landscape is marked by rich foliage including a mix of green and trees that are beginning to show autumn colors. Scatterings of trees are distributed throughout, and the borders of the area are marked by thickets and lines of trees, likely marking property lines or roads.\n\nOverall, the area appears tranquil and secluded, mainly oriented towards agricultural or rural residential use, with natural beauty emphasized by the presence of vivid trees and neatly maintained properties.","title":"Aerial view of the hale farm and western reserve village near bath and Akron, Ohio.
