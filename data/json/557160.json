The cornstalks are dense and predominantly golden-brown in color, indicating they are ready for harvest. There are no visible people or animals within the scene. In the background, beyond the field, there's a gentle rolling hill. At the top of the hill, small portions of trees or bushes can be seen dotting the landscape. The sky above is clear and a light blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day without clouds. The overall composition gives the photo a serene, pastoral feel, emphasizing the expansiveness of agricultural land.","title":"Cornfield that formerly was open tallgrass prairie near White Cloud, Kansas, and Troy in Doniphan County in the northeast corner of the state.
