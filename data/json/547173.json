{"path":"547173.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban coastal scene during a bright day. You can see a series of residential buildings, varying in architecture. The buildings closest have a modern, functional design with predominant brick facades in shades of beige and brown, flat roofs, and numerous visible windows. A few buildings boast terraces or balconies facing toward the camera, providing an elevated view of the surroundings.\n\nIn the distance, beyond these residential structures, stretches a vast body of water, likely a sea or a large lake, meeting a clear sky at the horizon, indicating the photograph is taken during favorable weather with little to no cloud cover.\n\nThe foreground of the image is relatively darker, showing a neighborhood setting with parked cars and patches of greenery, partially shadowed, suggesting either the time of day produces long shadows or the area is shaded by nearby structures or natural elements outside the frame. The overall lighting intensifies from the foreground to the background, with the water reflecting light, enhancing the contrast between the land and the seascape.","title":"Looking towards lake Michigan from rooftops of eastlake terrace","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553919","555756","553679","544638","555757","553790","550134","553672","553931","553745","557454","549501","549480","550014","553678","543423"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["boast","intensify","terrace","closest","seascape","produce","parked","balcony","elevated","shade"]}
