{"path":"551482.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor, sunlit scene where three people are engaged in a focused interaction. An older man, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a cap, appears to be showing or explaining something to two younger women seated on a high ledge. The man's posture is slightly bent forward, possibly highlighting something in his hands that both women are attentively observing.\n\nThe woman in the middle has long dark hair and is dressed in a patterned blouse and a white skirt. The woman on the right has blonde hair, and wears a purple top and jeans, with a white purse by her side. All individuals appear absorbed in the conversation or the item being shown.\n\nThe background is dark, setting a stark contrast to the brightly illuminated subjects, and is punctuated by a few blurry, glowing orbs of light, possibly reflections or lights from a distant source. The overall composition and lighting focus the viewer's attention on the trio and their interaction, giving an intimate feel to the scene. The photograph appears to have a candid, street photography quality, capturing a moment of everyday life.","title":"Enjoying some snapshots on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553167","557175","553154","551433","557856","557909","551470","555966","553122","557038","551812","557031","553166","551436","551337","556525"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","orb","purse","ledge","hair","photography","skirt","interaction","source","blouse"]}
