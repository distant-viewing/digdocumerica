{"path":"551392.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph portrays a rural outdoor scene centered on a water-based activity, possibly fishing. In the foreground, a young boy stands on the edge of a muddy pond, holding a large fishing net with a wooden handle. He is lifting the net from the water, which is causing water to stream and splash as it drains from the net. The boy is dressed in a camouflage jacket and is looking directly at the camera with an expression of focused effort.\n\nBehind the boy, on the steep, muddy bank opposite him, stands an older male figure also involved in the activity. He appears to be using a tool, possibly to assist the boy or manage another part of the net. He is wearing jeans and a dark jacket, with his posture indicating action.\n\nAt the top of the bank, slightly out of focus, are two additional figures standing at a higher elevation on what looks like a flat dirt area. These figures are observing or waiting, less directly involved in the immediate action.\n\nThe setting is characterized by bare, brown earth, suggesting either a late autumn or winter season in a temperate climate, or a region that experiences sparse vegetation. The overcast sky adds to the stark, muddy appearance of the surroundings, emphasizing the rugged outdoor atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
