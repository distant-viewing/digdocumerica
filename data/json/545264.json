{"path":"545264.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive view of a devastated forest landscape. The foreground is cluttered with numerous fallen and splintered tree trunks, branches, and debris strewn across the ground in a chaotic manner. The trees appear to have been violently broken, suggesting the impact of a natural disaster or heavy logging activity. The scene is barren of foliage except for a few small trees and bushes emerging sporadically from the debris, indicating some regrowth or remnants of vegetation that survived the devastation.\n\nIn the background, the landscape continues with similar destruction, but the density of fallen trees decreases slightly. Beyond the immediate devastation, there are patches of standing forest and wooded areas that look intact, providing a stark contrast to the foreground. Further back, the terrain rises gently into rolling hills that are also covered with trees, showing no signs of the disturbance visible in the foreground.\n\nThe sky above is clear and bright blue, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day without clouds, which adds a sense of stillness to the otherwise chaotic and disrupted natural scene. The lighting is harsh, casting distinct shadows and highlighting the rugged textures of the broken wood and disturbed earth.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a powerful message about environmental impact, illustrating the scale and intensity of forest destruction. It prompts reflections on the causes and the long-term effects on the ecosystem and landscape.","title":"A clear-cut and burned-over hillside one mile from the entrance to the hoh rain forest.
