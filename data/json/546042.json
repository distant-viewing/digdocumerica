{"path":"546042.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene at dusk or dawn. The focal point of the image is a large, dark plume of smoke emitting from a tall chimney, stark against a painted sky that shades from a lighter blue at the top to pink and purple hues nearer the horizon. This scene of pollution is framed artistically by the silhouette of leafless tree branches in the foreground, highlighting a contrast between nature and industrial activity.\n\nThe background features multiple layers of industrial infrastructure including several faintly visible silhouetted chimneys, electric poles, and power lines crisscrossing the view. These elements underline the extent of the industrial setup and its pervasive influence on the landscape. The ambient light suggests either early morning or late evening, contributing to the dramatic and somewhat somber mood of the image. The atmospheric conditions coupled with the lighting condition give the smoke a heavy, ominous quality, suggesting environmental degradation caused by industrial emissions.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack with budding tree in foreground","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["551054","552165","544173","545239","557381","545433","552188","545446","550981","544684","545414","550983","550987","544696","551026","545425"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["chimney","smoke","extent","influence","degradation","emission","condition","plume","dawn","setup"]}
