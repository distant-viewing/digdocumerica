{"path":"545367.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a bold and vivid highway scene under a dynamic sky. In the foreground, the focal point is an anomalous square shape, perhaps a drain cover or another man-made object, embedded in the asphalt surface of the roadside. The road stretches into the distance in a compelling perspective, splitting symmetrically about the center and flanked by large, dark hilly/mountainous landforms that define the horizon. These hills draw the eye along the road towards the center.\n\nOn the road, there is moderate vehicle traffic, with cars and trucks in both lanes. Notably, a large truck can be seen in the right lane moving away from the viewer. The contrasting elements - the vast, open road amidst the confining hills under an expansive, partly cloudy sky painted with soft whites and blues - impart a sense of travel, movement, and perhaps a bit of isolation.\n\nOverall, the image is rich in colors with dark tones of the road and hills against the lighter sky, creating a striking visual contrast. The setting might suggest a remote or less urban area, given the open landscape and lack of visible infrastructure beyond the road.","title":"Interstate 25","placename":"Las Cruces (N.M.)","location":"Las Cruces, New Mexico","nn1":["544598","544645","554130","553124","553785","554127","544043","553127","555630","557468","557471","544178","545886","554031","544490","553630"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","lane","hill","truck","embed","confine","impart","landform","split","asphalt"]}
