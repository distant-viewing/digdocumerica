{"path":"544866.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a majestic snowy mountain range under a clear blue sky. The mountain peaks are covered with snow, showing various shades of white and hints of blue reflecting from the sky. The rugged texture of the mountain is visible, indicating steep cliffs and ridges. Below the peaks, there's a layer of dense forest consisting of dark evergreen trees, creating a stark contrast with the bright snow above and adding a lush green belt at the base of the mountains. The trees appear to be in shadow, suggesting that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon. The composition of the image emphasizes the grandeur of the natural landscape, inviting viewers to appreciate the serene and untouched beauty of this mountainous scene.","title":"Colorado--Ophir","placename":"Ophir (Colo.)","location":"Ophir, Colorado","nn1":["555656","555657","552173","544936","550416","552144","555681","550423","550501","548094","543827","550413","552172","542831","553811","555660"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","peak","snow","appreciate","belt","ridge","grandeur","white","cliff","invite"]}
