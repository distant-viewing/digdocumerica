{"path":"549878.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a traffic scene under an expansive steel bridge structure, likely taken from inside a vehicle, as evident from the framed top shadow resembling a car's windshield. We see multiple lanes of cars, mostly from older models suggestive of a photograph taken in the late 20th century. The cars are mostly in idle or slow-moving traffic, lined up along a roadway that curves gently to the right under the bridge.\n\nThe immense bridge overhead dominates the upper portion of the image, its intricate network of steel beams intersecting at various angles creating a geometric pattern against the sky. This structure provides a stark industrial contrast to the more mundane scene of daily traffic below.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is an embankment or riverside with what appears to be a body of water, providing a softer, natural element juxtaposed with the man-made structures. The right side shows a concrete wall, part of the tunnel or underpass structure, adorned with long, horizontal vent slabs.\n\nIn the background, though somewhat obscured by the bridge and gloomy weather, might be hints of a cityscape or further infrastructure that lines the river or coastal area. The photograph has a slightly grainy texture, typical of older film photographs, enhancing the vintage feel of the scene.","title":"On franklin d.
