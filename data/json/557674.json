{"path":"557674.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features a serene rural landscape, primarily dominated by a lush and untamed meadow filled with tall green grass and various wildflowers, including conspicuous white blooms. In the foreground, the wildflowers and grasses rise prominently, some reaching heights that nearly fill the frame.\n\nToward the middle of the image, partially obscured by the dense vegetation, a small white house with a dark roof is nestled among the greenery. Adjacent to the house, slightly to the left, is another red-roofed building that possibly serves as a barn or a second home, adding to the rustic charm of the scene.\n\nThe background consists of dense foliage from assorted trees, offering shades of deep green, and a glimpse of a mountain, contributing to a sense of peaceful seclusion and natural beauty. The sky above is partially cloud-covered, suggesting a bright yet overcast day, which casts an even light across the scene, enhancing the vividness of the natural colors.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a tranquil, almost idyllic rural setting, inviting contemplation and appreciation of nature's unstructured beauty.","title":"This 2 1/2-acre plot between the Chattahoochee River (to left of photo) and Chattahoochee Drive (to the right of photo) was up for sale by owner Andy Adams.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554562","554721","549256","555577","554722","549236","557087","551305","557749","545040","555603","549142","554401","554767","557946","555635"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["wildflower","appreciation","meadow","seclusion","grass","vividness","barn","bloom","charm","contemplation"]}
