{"path":"544279.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows a view of a body of water and industrial structures in the distance, seen through a damaged and corroded metal frame. The frame, which could possibly be part of a ship or a similar structure, features heavy corrosion and holes through which the landscape can be seen. The edges of the frame are irregular and rough, suggesting decay and exposure to harsh conditions. The foreground predominantly shows these rusty and deteriorated metal parts.\n\nIn the background, there is a calm body of water reflecting a light-colored sky. On the opposite shore, visible through the gaps in the metallic frame, industrial facilities can be observed. There appear to be a few cranes and possibly containers, indicating that this might be a port or shipyard area. The distant landscape is relatively flat, and a few industrial structures are spread out along the horizon. The overall color tone of the image is muted, with the rust of the metal adding orange and brown shades against the predominantly gray and blue background of the sky and water.","title":"Louisiana--Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["549307","547581","546864","547579","551984","544527","547582","549300","547622","547575","547572","547958","543364","543320","543257","547577"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["metal","frame","corrosion","shipyard","hole","gap","port","rust","ship","exposure"]}
