{"path":"553439.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural riverside scene, likely taken during summer. The river, surrounded by dense forest, reflects the sunlit patches piercing through tree leaves, creating a shimmering effect on the water. Along the riverbank, you can see a sandy or muddy edge where a few individuals are enjoying recreational activities.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a group of people can be seen. One individual is in the process of diving into the water, captured midair with legs bent and arms reaching forward. This suggests dynamic, playful interaction with the river. Nearby, others are standing and sitting; some are watching the activities unfold or simply soaking up the peaceful environment. Their attire, consisting of swimwear, and the presence of a partially visible floating tire indicate casual swimming and playing.\n\nThe surroundings are lush, with tall trees framing the view and providing shade, contributing to the tranquil ambiance of this outdoor setting. The light filtering through leaves adds a bright, lively quality to the image, enhancing the idyllic summer feel.","title":"This favorite spot for swimming, in the Squannacook River is located near Groton in the town forest preserve.
