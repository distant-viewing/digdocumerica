{"path":"553310.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene where several people are gathered around an information booth labeled \"CSO INFORMATION.\" The booth is set up in an urban plaza with a backdrop of a tall office building and densely leafed trees. The kiosk itself is covered with a gray tarp supported by poles, and several large boards decorated with black and white photographs and images of musical instruments are displayed around it. These boards feature an array of different musicians and instruments such as a guitar, saxophone, and a harp, suggesting the booth is related to a musical event or organization.\n\nTwo men in suits are engaged in conversation with a person stationed inside the booth, who is sitting at a desk cluttered with papers. One man, dressed in a dark suit and white trousers, seems to be making an inquiry or filling out a form, while the other, in a lighter suit, is watching the interaction. There's also a woman partially visible behind the booth, interacting with someone inside the booth. The overall setting and attire of the people suggest a formal, organized event in a professional or civic environment, perhaps related to cultural or musical festivities in the city. The paving stones and the carefully arranged promotional materials convey a well-planned and executed event.","title":"Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra ticket booth during a performance at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553316","551833","557264","553201","549090","551770","553318","550076","551656","553297","551708","549315","553265","551808","551806","553248"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["booth","suit","instrument","board","event","kiosk","inquiry","festivity","guitar","tarp"]}
