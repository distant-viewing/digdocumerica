{"path":"547802.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene in front of a lounge. On the right side of the frame, a vibrant red and beige building is visible, identified as the \"C & L Lounge,\" with a sign that advertises \"Dancing Nightly Beer.\" A man in a pink shirt stands at the entrance, watching something outside or possibly staring into the distance blurrily.\n\nThe main focus of the image is on two young people in the foreground, who are actively engaging with large black plastic bags on the ground. One, a shirtless male, is bending over diligently and appears to be either tying up or searching through the contents of one of the bags. The other, an observably younger male in a white shirt, also concentrates on the bags, possibly helping or gathering something.\n\nThey are situated in a narrow passage leading away from the main street, which adds a slightly enclosed, private feel to their activity. The environment shows signs of urban wear with the visible pavement and a simple architectural style.\n\nThe image triggers curiosity about the nature of the activity with the bags and about the story or situation unfolding at this place.","title":"Looking for a lucky \"find\" in a trash bag","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["545343","549839","545348","548372","543470","551342","552969","552750","555953","552971","548371","545315","551420","545331","556220","558252"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bag","male","lounge","situation","pavement","curiosity","passage","plastic","content","entrance"]}
