{"path":"553122.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"In the photograph, three people are seated against a large, pale wall, possibly outside a building given the presence of a ventilation grid on the left. The surface they are sitting on is not clearly visible, but appears to be a bench or low wall.\n\nThe person on the left is dressed smartly in a blue sweater over a striped shirt, wearing glasses, and has neatly styled hair. He is smiling and looking directly at the camera, conveying a cheerful demeanor. Beside him, in the center, is a person obscured by the camera as if taking a photograph, with their arms extended toward the lens. They wear a dark jacket and jeans, and a watch is visible on their wrist. To the right, a man in a straw hat and light-colored shirt is stretching an arm out expressively, holding a cigarette in his other hand. He exhibits a relaxed posture, sitting with one leg crossed over the other.\n\nNear the individuals, assorted objects are strewn about: there are bottles on the ground alongside a small object that might be a bag. The overall mood is informal and appears to capture a moment of interaction or conversation among the group in a public or semi-public space. The lighting is soft, suggesting either an overcast day or the shade of a large structure nearby. The simplicity of the background focuses attention on the three figures and their expressions, postures, and the dynamic among them.","title":"On a Reno street","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["552972","545984","551433","553167","545358","556485","553166","545330","543511","553169","554852","551482","551028","552973","557353","555991"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["arm","posture","wrist","watch","ventilation","lens","cigarette","wall","dynamic","straw"]}
