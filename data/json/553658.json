{"path":"553658.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an array of cylindrical glass containers set in a mechanized and industrial setup, likely part of a laboratory or a specialized factory setting. Each container is suspended from above by chains and appears to be securely fastened to a sturdy, metallic framework that spans the full width of the image. \n\nThe containers are fitted with various tubes and valves. Black rubber tubes extend from the top section of each cylinder, some curling downwards into adjacent containers or possibly into a drainage system that is not completely visible. These tubes likely function to transfer fluids between containers or to manage the flow and pressure within the setup. \n\nOn the upper right side of the image, there are metal valves especially prominent, contributing to the overall industrial feel. These valves appear robust and are possibly used for controlling the ingress or egress of substances within the setup.\n\nThe foreground features what looks like smaller green-tinted containers or basins, catching or storing fluid from the cylinders above. This arrangement hints at a filtration, distillation, or chemical processing system. \n\nThe background is softly illuminated, slightly out of focus, suggesting the setting is indoors, or in a covered area with natural light possibly coming in from above or the side. The ambient light casts shadows and highlights the transparency and the content level in each container, enhancing the detailed view of the industrial equipment. \n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a precise and carefully arranged technical environment, emphasizing functionality and systematic processing.","title":"Inside the cui-ui hatchery near Sutcliffe on the western shore of Pyramid Lake.
