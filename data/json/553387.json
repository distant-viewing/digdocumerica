{"path":"553387.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an up-close and dynamic view of a man-made waterfall. The waterfall is shown in full flow, with water cascading heavily over a wide, slightly curved ledge. The water plunges with such force that it creates a misty spray around it, suggesting a strong current and volume. The waterfall appears to be constructed from concrete or stone, evidenced by the smooth, structured contours of the ledge from which the water flows.\n\nIn the background, a dark-toned building with a flat roof can be seen. Its facade is partially obscured by the waterfall, indicating that the waterfall is quite large in scale, or at least significantly prominent in the foreground of the shot. The building gives an urban feel to the setting, suggesting that this waterfall could be part of a city park or a decorative urban installation.\n\nThe sunlight shines brightly, illuminating the water and creating a gleam off the wet surfaces, while also casting shadows that give depth to the image. The sky above appears clear and largely cloudless, hinting at a sunny day. The overall composition and lighting highlight the powerful movement of the water and add a dramatic effect to the scene.","title":"Dam on the Whitman River below the Weyerhaeuser paper mill bears a heavy burden of mill wastes.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553386","550697","550736","553354","542699","550738","549557","542594","545874","545882","553340","544344","545839","553349","558087","548021"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","ledge","water","volume","spray","current","installation","force","concrete","contour"]}
