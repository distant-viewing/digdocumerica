{"path":"553463.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat chaotic natural scene where human-made objects and nature intersect. A fast-flowing stream or river runs through the center of the image, with white water rapids indicating a strong current. The river is bordered by large, rugged boulders and some scattered vegetation.\n\nProminently, there are three vehicles parked or abandoned in a haphazard manner on a dirt and rock-laden bank at the upper edge of the river. The terrain on the riverbank where the vehicles are located appears rough and possibly used for dumping or informal parking.\n\nThere is also an out-of-place object in the river—a white foam cooler—caught amongst the rocks in the middle of the river, suggesting it might have been unintentionally left behind or swept away into the water.\n\nThe background suggests a remote or less-maintained area with no visible buildings or infrastructure other than the rough pathway and natural landscape. The overall impression is of a natural environment that has been casually used by people, likely for outdoor activities, but with a lack of attention to environmental preservation or organization.","title":"Ranor, Inc., is constructing its parking lot by dumping tons of fill into this stream.
