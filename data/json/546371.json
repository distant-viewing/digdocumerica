{"path":"546371.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape prominently featuring construction on a large bridge amidst a striking mountainous region. In the foreground, we see the partially completed bridge with several tall, vertical supports standing and horizontal segments being assembled. The construction area is bustling with activity, indicating ongoing work with various materials scattered around such as beams and steel parts.\n\nBeyond the construction site, a densely populated town spreads out into the valley. The town consists of many closely packed houses with different colored roofs, suggesting a vibrant community. There is little visible vegetation in the town, possibly due to the urban density, but surrounding the area are lush green hills that rise steeply above the settlement.\n\nThe background is dominated by a series of rugged mountains that recede into the distance under a blue sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds. Overall, the image captures a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human engineering, evidencing efforts to enhance connectivity in a challenging terrain.","title":"A new toll road is being built between San Juan and Ponce this section is at cayey","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["558048","551186","549469","550274","551195","558049","549547","556951","548097","552052","548009","548401","558051","548945","546588","555861"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["town","construction","bridge","assemble","connectivity","complete","standing","settlement","recede","engineering"]}
