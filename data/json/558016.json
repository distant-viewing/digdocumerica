{"path":"558016.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene alongside a canal, presenting a tranquil and somewhat rustic environment. The image shows a waterway on the left side, bordered by a grassy bank and what seems to be a path that runs parallel to the canal. The path appears to be made of compacted dirt, scattered with leaves and small stones, suggesting a natural setting that's not frequently maintained for aesthetics but is functional and used.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an old-fashioned, rusted device possibly used for controlling water flow or locking the canal. This mechanism extends in a curved metallic structure with a wheel at its end, laying partially on the surrounding grassy surface. The device rests on a concrete base, contributing to the sense that this canal has been in use for quite some time, and the equipment has seen considerable wear and tear.\n\nThe background extends into a lined perspective of the canal, surrounded by greenery and trees on the further banks. The light is soft and somewhat hazy, suggesting either an early morning or a late afternoon setting. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible presence of people or animals, emphasizing a sense of solitude and quietness.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of this scene provide a glimpse into a pastoral life where such canals might serve essential roles in local agriculture or transportation. The photo captures the essence of an undisturbed natural environment coexisting with human-made structures designed for practical tasks.","title":"Eleven mile lock at valley view, Ohio, near Cleveland.
