{"path":"552236.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic view of a broad tidal flat at low tide with stark land and water contrasts. The forefront of the image shows expanses of wet sand and shallow pools of water that sparkle under the light, divided by narrow pathways of dryer sand, creating an intricate, organic pattern. A group of three people is visible in the middle distance, minute in scale compared to the vast environment, emphasizing the breadth and emptiness of the space. They seem to be walking or standing on one of these sandy pathways.\n\nThe background features a dark, dense forest that lines a raised landmass, stretching across the upper portion of the image. The trees appear as a dark silhouette against a lighter sky, which is subtly gradated from a warm tone near the horizon to a cooler, darker hue higher up. The overall mood is serene and somewhat somber, with the natural landscape dominating the scene and the human figures adding a sense of scale and solitude. The image is likely taken during late daylight hours given the soft lighting and the long shadows.","title":"Mudflats of Stillaguamish estuary on Puget Sound at low tide","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555400","545095","545183","552147","545294","544687","547607","542890","544729","551554","551553","547697","547663","548230","546953","546970"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["pathway","sand","minute","flat","emptiness","breadth","landmass","tide","scale","pool"]}
