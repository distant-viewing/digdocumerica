{"path":"553916.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and joyful scene, centered on a woman who appears to be involved in a celebration, potentially a cultural or festive event. The lady is dressed in a bright red attire that contrasts sharply with her dark hair, which is adorned with a large red flower pinned on the left side of her head. Striking about her appearance are the multiple leis made of white and yellow plumeria flowers draped around her neck.\n\nShe is smiling broadly, displaying a sense of joy and merriment. The close-up composition focuses primarily on her, but there is a partial view of another individual in the background—a person wearing a light-colored hat decorated with a pink flower, suggesting an outdoor setting bustling with similarly festively attired people. The natural lighting and shadow on the woman’s face imply outdoor sunshine, accentuating the festive ambiance of the setting. The blurred background keeps the viewer’s attention focused on her radiant expression and the detailed textures of the leis and the flower in her hair.","title":"Hawaiians ready to demonstrate hula dance to Waikiki Beach tourists","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553918","553708","553917","553760","553915","553711","553737","556281","553709","556150","553758","553178","556134","553712","551384","553251"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["flower","sunshine","pin","hair","celebration","neck","joy","strike","drape","woman"]}
