{"path":"548434.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large, intricate urban setting, primarily dominated by expansive parking areas filled with numerous vehicles. The scene is densely packed with cars arranged in orderly rows across several large parking lots, suggesting a high-traffic public or commercial area.\n\nThe setting includes a mix of industrial, commercial, and infrastructural elements. Towards the center and right of the image, there are broad, connecting roads facilitating vehicle movement between different areas. Various buildings, possibly commercial or industrial, line the roadways and are scattered throughout the vicinity.\n\nIn the background, the cityscape extends with clusters of buildings of different sizes and an industrial complex with tall smokestacks, hinting at manufacturing or production activities. A distinctive bridge, likely a significant transportation link, spans a river or another large body of the water in the far background, adding to the urban infrastructure complexity seen in the image.\n\nThe atmosphere appears somewhat hazy, suggesting either pollution, mist, or just a slightly overcast day, but visibility remains largely unobstructed, allowing for a clear view of the entire expansive area. The composition of the photograph itself, taken from a high vantage point, encapsulates a wide perspective of urban development and activity, emphasizing transportation and industrial landscapes.","title":"Logan airport looking northeast from 16th floor observation deck.
