{"path":"549103.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an image of a young girl swimming in a body of water, which appears to be a lake. The water around her sparkles with sunlight, creating a twinkling effect on the surface. The girl is partially submerged, and only her head and shoulders are visible above the water. She has short dark hair and is wearing a blue swimsuit.\n\nHer expression conveys joy and excitement as she seems to be either talking or shouting. The overall ambience is vibrant and lively due to the sparkling water and the natural daylight accentuating the playfulness of the scene.\n\nThe background is out of focus, emphasizing the girl and the water. The color tone of the water is a deep greenish-blue, typical of a freshwater lake, contributing to the calm yet invigorating setting of the photograph.","title":"Swimming in havasu lake","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548844","543468","551160","544196","544189","544339","548835","555649","553430","548584","551165","548113","544347","556295","548842","544200"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["girl","water","playfulness","lake","swimsuit","excitement","sparkle","ambience","talk","joy"]}
