{"path":"546453.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"In this photograph, the setting is outdoors, showcasing a clear and sunny day at what appears to be a school or community center, characterized by modern architectural features. The main building in the background features a large, extended roof providing shade over open glass walls, enabling a view into the building's interior, which seems to be equipped with tables and various items of equipment possibly used for either educational or recreational purposes.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a well-maintained grassy area. There are several children and possibly a few adults. The children are engaged in different activities: two groups are standing and talking, and one group is involved in a playful interaction. A child in blue is throwing a ball while others around them appear ready to catch or dodge it.\n\nThere's a tree situated to the right-hand side of the composition, providing shade and depth to the scene. Its robust structure suggests it is quite mature, and it adds a natural element contrasting against the more structured and human-made background.\n\nThe setting and activities combine to give an overall impression of a lively, social atmosphere typically found in school or community settings during recess or an outdoor class.","title":"Mabel mcdowell elementary school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["553096","554072","546522","546449","557410","551769","556431","552033","545311","556537","557771","553512","544806","556437","551677","555947"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["school","child","enable","recess","class","ball","throw","community","talk","group"]}
