{"path":"547591.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive construction or excavation site, characterized by its rugged and varied terrain. The foreground of the image showcases barren, rocky ground with patches of dirt and small stones, providing a view of the site's raw state. A small, meandering dirt road bisects the area, fading into the distance along the gently curving landscape.\n\nIn the middle distance, a red truck with a full bed is visible, traveling down the road which is lined with heaps of discarded rocks and debris, suggesting recent construction or excavation activities. The area around the road is scattered with similar materials, and the disordered nature of the scene indicates ongoing heavy work.\n\nFurther in the background, the scene opens up to reveal more of the site, which includes larger mounds of earth and rocks, possibly stockpiles or dumping areas for materials extracted from the ground. An industrial structure, possibly a sorting or processing station, is visible amidst these mounds, equipped with conveyor belts and supported by metal framework. \n\nIn the far distance, beyond the immediate scope of the excavation site, one can see a body of water flanking the site and a row of hills or low mountains, which frame the site and add a natural boundary to the landscape. The overall atmosphere suggests an active, large-scale industrial operation, possibly mining or a similar venture, set in a somewhat rural or less developed area. The presence of water and distant mountains provides a stark contrast to the heavily manipulated and barren terrain of the work site.","title":"Sand and gravel operation in Cumberland","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545533","547225","554765","545677","543785","547523","552422","552814","552004","543861","549255","555614","544139","549169","553383","544107"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["site","excavation","mound","road","scope","distance","dirt","construction","mountain","rock"]}
