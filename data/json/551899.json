{"path":"551899.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures two men deeply engrossed in their work at what appears to be a design or drafting office. The foreground prominently features a man leaning forward, focusing intently on a large drawing or blueprint spread out before him on a tilted drafting table. He is dressed in a light-colored, formal long-sleeve shirt and has dark, slicked-back hair.\n\nThe setting includes several drafting tables lined up in a row, each equipped with task lighting and various tools typically used for precision drawing such as rulers and protractors. The lighting in the room casts soft shadows and highlights the concentration and professional environment of the workspace.\n\nBehind the main individual, another man can be seen at a similar drafting table. He also appears focused on his work, suggesting a quiet, industrious atmosphere typical of a design or architectural studio. The background is tastefully decorated with framed pictures or plans, and there is a tranquil, almost studious ambiance that pervades the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a professional, meticulous workspace where attention to detail and concentrated effort are paramount. The decor and setup suggest this may be an architectural firm or a similar technical field where precision and detailed planning are essential.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day controls all traffic lights, receives remote tv inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["552389","556551","552357","552390","555233","546552","557682","552356","551897","555290","542690","552377","552392","546628","557727","551904"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["precision","table","workspace","framed","tilt","decor","concentrate","engross","planning","casts"]}
