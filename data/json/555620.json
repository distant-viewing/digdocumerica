{"path":"555620.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts two men engaged in some form of agricultural labor, specifically involving the transport of bags filled with what appears to be a crop or grass. The scene takes place outdoors, under a clear blue sky. Both men are actively loading heavy burlap sacks that read \"WIZARD BRAND, Recleaned RYE SEED\" and \"HAIFA, IMPORTED GRASS\" into the bed of a rust-colored metal trailer with yellow compartments and a mechanical setup to facilitate filling.\n\nThe man on the left, who appears younger, wears casual working clothes: a hat, a t-shirt, jeans, and gloves. He is bending over to adjust a sack in the metal structure. The second man, who looks older, dons a dark printed t-shirt and cap. He stands partially inside the trailer bed, arranging the filled bags.\n\nIn the background, a wide field can be seen, suggesting the activity might be taking place on a farm. The environment signifies a dry or harvested field, reinforcing the agricultural context. The trailer is parked on a dirt path, indicative of regular vehicle traffic in the area for farming duties.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of physical labor and cooperation, set against the backdrop of a rural farming landscape.","title":"Sweet clover and orchard grass seed are poured into a bulldozer-pulled seeder which will spread it 450 pounds to the acre.
