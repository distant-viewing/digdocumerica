{"path":"549080.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a close-up portrait of a man who is partially smiling and looking towards the camera. He is wearing a bandana fashioned into a head covering, which is mostly pink with detailed paisley and geometric patterns in black and white. Underneath the bandana, his dark hair is visible. He has a light beard and mustache which enhance his cheerful expression.\n\nThe man is wearing a dark, possibly navy tank top that reveals his shoulders and upper chest, both of which are sun-kissed and showing signs of being outdoors. The natural light casts soft shadows on his face, highlighting his facial features and giving a warm tone to his skin.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus but hints at a natural, outdoor setting, potentially a desert or a sparse field given the broad light and hints of greenery at the bottom and pale blue sky at the top.\n\nThe overall mood is casual and portrays a sense of adventure or outdoor activity, suggested by his attire and the ambient environment. The photograph has a vibrant yet serene quality, capturing a moment that feels both candid and intimate.","title":"Mexican farm worker in the Imperial Valley.
