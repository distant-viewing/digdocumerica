{"path":"550452.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural landscape, likely in a mountainous or rocky terrain. The foreground and part of the middle ground are dominated by a Dall sheep, recognizable by its creamy white coat and curved horns. The sheep is positioned on the right side, bending down, possibly grazing or sniffing the ground.\n\nThe terrain is rugged with large boulders and smaller rocks scattered throughout the scene. The flora in the area includes low-lying shrubs and plants, exhibiting a colorful array of foliage predominantly in shades of red, green, and hints of yellow, indicative of autumnal seasonal change. The ground appears somewhat mossy and damp, interspersed with patches of grass and these red-leaved plants, adding vibrant contrast to the scene.\n\nThe background, while mostly obscured by the central activity of the sheep and the density of the flora, hints at a similarly rocky and wild environment, possibly part of a larger mountainous or hilly ecosystem. The lighting in the photo suggests overcast weather, contributing to the overall moody and naturalistic setting of the image. No human activity or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the untouched and wild nature of the setting.","title":"Butt where it itches; this young ram scratches his itching horns on a dwarf alder (about 4 miles east of the designated pipeline crossing in the atigun gorge)","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550453","550449","550451","550450","550448","550445","550446","543269","554928","544933","555820","552556","554779","550456","544384","550494"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","flora","horn","mossy","graze","ground","boulder","plant","density","terrain"]}
