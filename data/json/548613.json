{"path":"548613.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image portrays an older woman sitting on a folding chair outside a small shop, deeply engrossed in reading a newspaper. The woman is dressed in a patterned dress and wears sandals. Her expression is focused and absorbed in the content of the paper.\n\nThe shop behind her, labeled \"Granny's Sundries,\" advertises various offerings on a hanging sign, including \"Used Books,\" \"Letter Writing,\" and \"Refreshments.\" The storefront has additional signage and posters that add to the quaint and somewhat cluttered appeal, with one mentioning \"Bomb Pops\" and another advertising greeting cards and various services including air mail and special delivery. The wall's paint is slightly worn, suggesting a layer of history and regular use.\n\nThe setting appears to be a small town or neighborhood, evidenced by the old and textured appearance of the building and the casual setup on the sidewalk. The mood conveys a slow-paced, perhaps leisurely day where activities like reading the newspaper outdoors are a common sight.","title":"Shopkeeper outside small store which caters to the older citizens of the neighborhood.
