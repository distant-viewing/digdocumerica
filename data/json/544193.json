{"path":"544193.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features the side of a rusted, largely orange-colored bus. The bus has white hand-written text over its surface that includes quantitative information about products in various units (ounces and dozens), along with prices. A specific phrase, \"THE BIGEST CABIN THE LAKE\" is written near the middle. The windows of the bus show faint, somewhat obscured images possibly due to reflections or the items inside the bus.\n\nThe background introduces an industrial or rural setting with a variety of objects that appear somewhat disordered. Tall cylindrical structures possibly made of metal or wire mesh, which may be storage tanks or enclosures, dominate the mid-background. In front of these structures, thereâ€™s a cluttered collection of what might be fishnets or similar trapping equipment, hinting at an aquatic or fishing-related activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the shot, centering on the bus with its cryptic, casually applied text, against a backdrop of storage and capture gear, conveys a sense of neglect or rustic functionality, contributing to a narrative about rural or industrial life cycle or business operations, potentially linked to fishing or agriculture. This setting is informal and utilitarian, focused more on function than form.","title":"Crab fishermen's base at Goose Point, on Lake Pontchartrain.
