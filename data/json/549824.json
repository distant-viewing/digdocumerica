{"path":"549824.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph shows a large heap of garbage on a river barge, with the New York City skyline and a bridge in the background. The garbage is piled high and consists of various items including bags, cardboard, bottles, and general refuse. The barge is in a river, likely the East River, given the view of the bridge in the background, which appears to be the Queensboro Bridge, connecting Manhattan to Queens.\n\nThe skyline features a mix of residential and commercial buildings of varying heights, some with detailed architecture visible on their exteriors. Most buildings are high-rise and tightly packed, indicating a densely populated urban area. The bridge in the background is a prominent steel truss structure, visible across the entire width of the photo and adding an industrial element to the cityscape. The clear blue sky and bright sunlight suggest the photo was taken on a clear day. The overall scene contrasts the natural beauty and urban development with the harsh reality of waste management in a major city.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York City produces each day.
