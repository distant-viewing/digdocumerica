{"path":"545185.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a commercial fishing operation. It captures a fisherman working on a boat, focusing on a raised fishing net that is dripping with water, suggesting that it has just been pulled from the sea. The setting is likely at sea or a large body of water, given the visible water surface and horizon.\n\nThe fisherman, a middle-aged man wearing a dark jacket and cap, stands on the deck of the boat. He appears to be overseeing or controlling the lowering or lifting of the fishing net, which hangs from a pulley system attached to a robust metal framework.\n\nThe boat itself has wooden sides and a large open space filled with a bin that seems to be either carrying the caught fish or equipment. The back portion of the boat, partially visible in the image, features the cabin, painted in blue, adding a hint of color against the predominantly muted tones of the sea and sky.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photo is slightly overcast, with soft natural light diffusing through a cloud-covered sky, creating a serene backdrop. The sea appears calm, with gentle ripples, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The composition effectively conveys a moment in the life of a fisherman, centered on his interaction with the marine environment through the tools of his trade.","title":"Harvesting oysters by dredging","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545306","552298","546301","547563","547552","543033","544256","545178","552273","547551","554200","552807","545093","545189","547562","547559"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","sea","boat","fishing","net","pulley","lifting","trade","bin","cabin"]}
