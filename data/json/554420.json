{"path":"554420.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a large, vintage-looking logging truck loaded with massive logs. The truck is driving along a dirt road that is surrounded by lush greenery, likely in a forested area. The truck, which is painted a dark color (probably black or dark blue), has the name \"ASHLINE TRUCKING CO.\" painted in white on its door, along with the location \"Keeseville N.Y.\" The truck is of the Mack brand, as indicated by the logo visible on its front.\n\nThe cargo bed of the truck is structured with sturdy red uprights and crossbars, which secure the load of round, thick logs. These logs appear freshly cut as indicated by their bright, exposed wood. The logs are neatly stacked and fill almost the entire truck bed. The truck is equipped with large, rugged tyres, suitable for off-road conditions.\n\nIn terms of the background, the truck appears to be the primary focus with a nondescript road and nature setting. There are leafy green trees visible around the edges of the frame, which are blurred, possibly due to the movement of the truck or the focus settings of the camera. The overall scene captures a typical logging operation in a wooded, rural area.","title":"Log truck on litchfield paper company lands loaded with four-foot lengths for pulpwood","placename":"Tupper Lake (N.Y.)","location":"Tupper Lake, New York","nn1":["542854","542855","555154","550707","542856","545930","554416","542616","552202","542858","542780","552583","545046","542790","544767","553629"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["truck","logging","bed","log","load","logs","road","upright","paint","secure"]}
