{"path":"544827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a daytime scene in what appears to be a park or recreational area, characterized by a cluster of large transparent plastic bags overflowing with red and white beverage cans. Several children are actively involved in gathering and possibly sorting these cans.\n\nIn the image, the group of children, comprising both boys and girls, is focused on the task with visible enthusiasm. They are situated outdoors next to a black metal fence, beyond which one can notice a go-kart track, hinting that this location might be near a recreational sports area. The background showcases a clear blue sky, and a grassy area that backs onto a road lined with poles and distant buildings.\n\nThe childrenâ€™s clothing suggests a casual, outdoor setting, typical of a warm, sunny day. Several cans are in mid-air, indicating that they have been tossed or are being transferred by the children. The scene is lively, reflecting a community or school-related activity centered around collecting or recycling cans.","title":"Students from Peoria Elementary School with packages of used milk cartons.
