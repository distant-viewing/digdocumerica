{"path":"550805.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a discarded beverage can, partly submerged in a watery environment, possibly a puddle or a shallow stream. The can is silver with a design that includes some text and a symbol, but the details and brand are not discernible due to the perspective and lighting. The can appears bent and damaged, emphasizing its discarded and neglected state.\n\nThe background and surroundings are dark and shadowy, focusing the viewer's attention on the can. The lighting is soft and natural, with a hint of reflection on the waterâ€™s surface, which adds a slightly glossy texture to the scene. Natural elements like small leaves and possibly algae are visible around the can, mingling with the dark, wet surface. The overall mood of the photo is somber, highlighting themes of pollution and environmental impact. The composition uses the can as the central point of interest amidst a natural yet degraded setting, invoking a reflection on human impact on natural sites.","title":"Deer can in the lily pads--unwelcome memento of a Fourth of July celebration at a county park along the Wisconsin River.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550806","550807","555257","543616","550812","555149","551246","546920","550811","543877","552126","542978","543302","542809","544647","547506"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["can","reflection","algae","impact","beverage","brand","puddle","silver","symbol","stream"]}
