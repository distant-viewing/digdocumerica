{"path":"556735.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene likely from the 1970s or 1980s, showing a line of parked cars along a curbside. The cars, showcasing a variety of models and colors including brown, red, white, and blue, appear to be typical of the automotive styles of the mid-20th century, including sedans and station wagons, many with distinct, retro features like chrome bumpers and rounded body shapes.\n\nDespite a clearly visible \"NO PARKING ANYTIME\" sign posted on a pole next to the street, the cars are all parked along the roadside, implying either a disregard for the parking restriction or a temporary allowance. The environment includes a grassy hill with several trees on the right side of the image and a bridge or elevated roadway structure in the distant background, contributing to an urban or suburban feel. Overall, the image captures a relaxed, everyday moment in a setting where the regulations are either temporarily overlooked or habitually ignored, underlined by an array of vintage vehicles that suggest a past era of automotive design.","title":"\"no parking\" zones, traffic \"islands\", bus lanes, sidewalks and lawns were among the spaces appropriated by motorists during a bus strike in Washington, district of Columbia, in may, 1974.  Some 250,000 persons who normally rode the buses were forced to find alternate forms of transportation, usually their car.  Drivers soon learned there were more autos than places to park legally usually the metro bus system has 1,800 vehicles on the streets during both rush hours","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556707","556709","556718","557877","556736","556724","551913","554551","557692","547954","558254","556753","556713","556773","556723","556717"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","disregard","distinct","restriction","regulation","bumper","round","underlin","street","chrome"]}
