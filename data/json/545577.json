{"path":"545577.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of seven people at an arch formation in a desert landscape under a clear blue sky. The arch, crafted from reddish-brown rock, frames the view and provides a natural window to the desert vista beyond. Most of the individuals appear to be engaged in various activities such as climbing, sitting, and standing on the rugged terrain of the arch. They are dressed in casual outdoor attire suitable for a hike or exploration, including shorts, t-shirts, and sneakers.\n\nThe perspective is taken from within the shadowed underside of the arch, looking outward, which contrasts the bright, sunlit desert and deep blue sky. The terrain outside the arch is a mix of flat desert ground dotted with vegetation and additional rock formations in the distance.\n\nThe scene conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural rock formations against the expansive desert backdrop. The atmosphere is vibrant and active, showing a moment of leisure and interaction with nature.","title":"Double Arch in Windows section of Arches National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545585","545580","545581","545563","545565","545555","545693","544939","545702","545782","545572","545584","545566","545578","545568","545689"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["desert","arch","formation","exploration","rock","underside","climbing","hike","sneaker","t"]}
