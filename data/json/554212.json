{"path":"554212.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive field cluttered with various discarded or unused agricultural machinery and equipment. The scene is inundated with a wide range of farm tools and vehicles, including tractors, cultivators, and parts of harvesters. These machines are primarily in shades of rust and faded paint, indicating age and weathering. The equipment is scattered unevenly across the grassy landscape, some partially overgrown with vegetation, suggesting they have been out of use for some time.\n\nThe terrain is flat and open, stretching into the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The clouds are fluffy and voluminous, adding a dynamic texture to the sky, which contrasts with the earthy tones of the machinery. In the background, there is a hint of a treeline, probably marking the end of the field or the beginning of another property. There are no visible human figures in the photograph, emphasizing the abandonment and quietness of the area. This scene is likely set in a rural area given the amount of space and the type of equipment present.","title":"Junkyard for worn-out agricultural implements at Karlstad","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["554211","554783","557701","543354","553985","547297","547777","554044","555619","552673","548985","554202","545893","554046","548296","555874"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["equipment","harvester","beginning","quietness","machinery","treeline","tractor","field","weathering","property"]}
