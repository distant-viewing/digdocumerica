{"path":"545735.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural landscape interspersed with signs of human impact. In the foreground, there is a smoldering garbage dump, emitting smoke and contributing to air pollution. Surrounding the dump are rugged, arid terrains with dramatic geological formations, likely sandstone, forming steep cliffs and narrow canyons, suggesting a desert-like environment.\n\nIn the background, dominating the horizon, are majestic, snow-capped mountains under a dusky sky, suggesting either early morning or late evening light which casts a soft glow over the scene. The stark contrast between the natural beauty of the mountains and cliffs and the harsh reality of the garbage dump highlights environmental concerns and the impact of human waste on natural sites. The overall composition of the photograph, blending natural majesty with environmental degradation, evokes a poignant reflection on human-environment interactions.","title":"Open burning is still used at the Moab city dump, and despite haze and smoke visible in the town below, the local government still has no plan to end the practice.
