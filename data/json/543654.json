{"path":"543654.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image captures a picturesque rugged landscape, likely in a mountainous region. In the foreground, a sweep of vibrant green grassland is segmented by a rustic wooden fence that runs diagonally from the lower right corner toward the center of the frame, hinting at a pastoral use of the land. Scattered patches of snow lie on the ground, suggesting a springtime setting shortly after winter's thaw.\n\nA dirt path meanders through the grass and disappears into the distance, evoking a sense of remote rural life. Several small, indistinct pinkish shrubs can be spotted near the center of the image, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted early spring palette.\n\nDominating the background of the photograph are majestic snow-capped mountain peaks under a cloud-filled sky. The mountains, stark and imposing, feature sharp ridges and are illuminated by a mix of sunlight and shadow, creating a dramatic backdrop. The overall composition balances the serene pastoral foreground with the powerful presence of the mountains, providing a scene that is both tranquil and awe-inspiring. The atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet solitude and the grandeur of nature.","title":"This area will be developed into a resort for skiing and vacation housing.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543660","553073","544936","543763","543569","544857","550516","554722","543376","550415","555681","543720","543662","549155","550441","544940"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountain","snow","awe","grassland","ridge","grandeur","center","winter","spring","peak"]}
