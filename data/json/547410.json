{"path":"547410.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate moment between an elderly man and a young boy, seemingly grandfather and grandson, standing outdoors near a white house with black shutters. The man, facing left and slightly turned towards the boy, wears a light grey fedora hat, and a grey suit with a light blue shirt underneath. He holds a small, dark object in his hand, possibly a wallet or a book, gesturing as though he is about to hand it to the boy or show him something inside.\n\nThe boy stands on the right, facing the man with a gentle, interested smile. He is dressed in a dark blazer with a plaid pattern, a white shirt, and a dark tie. His blonde hair is neatly styled, and he looks directly at the man with an expression of fondness and curiosity.\n\nThe background features the corner of a traditional house, predominantly white with visible shutters on the windows, suggesting a peaceful, residential setting. The atmosphere is calm and portrays a warm, familial interaction.","title":"After Sunday morning service at the Immanuel Lutheran Church near Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557355","556527","551948","558186","543849","553521","557369","543866","547391","553519","547398","547411","553520","558330","543693","553094"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","shutter","man","house","blazer","curiosity","book","smile","tie","plaid"]}
