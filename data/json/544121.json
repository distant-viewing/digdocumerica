{"path":"544121.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This image depicts a serene and remote desert setting where a man and a woman are sitting under a large, striped umbrella. The umbrella, featuring broad stripes in shades of blue and white, provides shade for the two individuals who are seated in low, foldable beach chairs. The man is wearing a hat and sunglasses, and appears to be reading a book, while the woman, also in sunglasses, seems engaged in a casual activity, possibly also reading.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is a vast expanse of reddish-brown sand with a rugged texture, punctuated by small bushes in the mid-ground and rocky hills in the distance under a clear blue sky. The setting conveys a feeling of isolation and tranquility, emphasizing the vastness and barren beauty of the desert environment. The composition highlights the contrast between the man-made elements of leisure, represented by the umbrella and chairs, against the natural, rugged terrain of the desert.","title":"Beach at Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["549037","545767","543477","554160","548833","550928","545199","544404","545696","545698","545196","545575","545784","551827","545300","548672"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["umbrella","desert","sunglass","chair","read","punctuate","woman","book","shade","man"]}
