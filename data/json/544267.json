{"path":"544267.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil and somber scene of a cemetery. Several graves, each marked distinctively with white crosses, are aligned orderly in rows on what appears to be sandy ground with sparse vegetation. Most graves are elevated slightly above ground level, bordered by concrete edges, suggesting individual plots.\n\nAmong these memorial markers, one striking feature is a statue of the Virgin Mary, shown in mid to full scale, painted in a serene blue robe with white details, positioned prominently in the center of the image. This religious icon adds a spiritual dimension to the setting, suggesting that the cemetery is likely of Christian, possibly Catholic, significance.\n\nDecorative elements such as artificial flower arrangements in various colors are placed on and around the graves, contributing splashes of red, pink, and white which contrast vividly against the sandy terrain. Some graves also feature pots and other personal memorabilia, perhaps indicating continuing care and remembrance by loved ones.\n\nThe background subtly fades into a naturally lit sky, hinting at an open, possibly rural locale. There's minimal shadow in the scene, indicating either an overcast day or that the sun is positioned directly above. Overall, the composition conveys a sense of peaceful finality and religious reverence.","title":"Cemetery off fish hatchery road","placename":"Lacombe (La.)","location":"Lacombe, Louisiana","nn1":["545322","550365","550364","554792","557184","544427","552683","557942","554790","547801","544423","546147","550731","557089","552016","552451"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","cemetery","love","remembrance","reverence","robe","pot","dimension","statue","marker"]}
