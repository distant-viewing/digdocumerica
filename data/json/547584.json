{"path":"547584.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a dilapidated and partially submerged wooden dock extending into a body of water, which reflects the clear blue sky. The dock appears old and weather-beaten, with several logs and planks missing, leaving gaps and uneven surfaces. Rusted metal elements and old ropes are visible, hinting at its former use for mooring boats or ships.\n\nIn the background, large industrial storage tanks painted in a faded green color loom over the scene, implying the presence of a nearby industrial facility. The surrounding area is cluttered with debris, including chunks of wood, metal pieces, and other detritus suggesting neglect or disuse.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somewhat eerie and melancholic, emphasizing themes of decay and the passage of time within an industrial setting. The contrast between the natural water's beauty and the man-made decay enhances the sense of abandonment. The lighting is natural, with a sharp contrast between the shadowed areas of the dock and the brightly lit background, highlighting the textures and materials within the scene.","title":"Texaco storage tanks","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547594","547581","547582","548105","547572","547622","551978","551985","551984","547579","547626","549306","545005","547575","550201","549300"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["dock","decay","detritus","mooring","chunk","disuse","gap","metal","passage","rope"]}
