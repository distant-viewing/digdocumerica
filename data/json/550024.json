{"path":"550024.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a city street scene showcasing a diverse array of architectural styles. On the left side of the image, there is a prominent red brick building with multiple stories, featuring white trimmed bay windows and two central doors, presumably entrances to separate units. This building has elements typical of late 19th to early 20th-century urban residential design.\n\nAdjacent to the red building is a lighter colored structure with gothic and classical revival architectural elements, such as ornamental lintels over the windows and a central projecting bay topped with a dome-like structure, which might be a cupola.\n\nOn the right side, beyond these older buildings, stands a starkly contrasting modern skyscraper, characterized by its plain, dark glass fa√ßade and rectangular form, offering a distinct backdrop that signifies the city's evolving skyline.\n\nVisible on the street are classic cars from around the mid-20th century, parked and driving, that provide temporal context likely indicating the period in which the photo was taken. The road appears quiet with no visible pedestrians, emphasizing the architectural features rather than the bustle of city life.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, indicating good weather conditions, which brightly illuminates the scene, casting shadows that give additional depth to the architectural detailing of the buildings.","title":"Shawmut avenue in roxbury section, looking toward copley square.
