{"path":"554097.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up and intimate moment between two elderly men, focusing on one who is pictured in profile. The image portrays the man from the side, allowing us to see details such as his glasses, the contours of his face, and his closely-cropped hair. The lighting accentuates his facial features and the texture of his skin, showcasing the signs of age.\n\nThe man in focus is wearing glasses with a thin frame and a dark, high-collared jacket over what appears to be a lighter shirt. His expression is contemplative, directed downwards in thought or perhaps in the midst of conversation.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, is another elderly man facing towards the right side of the frame, creating a sense that he is engaging with the man in the foreground. His facial features and attire suggest a similar age.\n\nThe setting is ambiguous, softly blurred, but has the appearance of being indoors with a warm light that contributes to a calm and serene atmosphere. The background is dimly lit, emphasizing the subjects over the environment, and drawing more attention to their expressions and interaction.","title":"Customers looking over the day's assortment at the Hilo fish auction, a daily event","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["557033","545970","548218","556452","553519","553202","552859","551337","552871","543849","548616","557035","543701","556443","557907","553055"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["man","age","indoor","glass","collar","midst","expression","skin","thought","face"]}
