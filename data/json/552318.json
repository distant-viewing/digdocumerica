{"path":"552318.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents a tranquil landscape scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and rich color tones in the sky. The focal point of the image is a wide, calm river that flows from the foreground into the middle of the composition, surrounded by lush vegetation on either side. The riverbanks are densely lined with trees and shrubs, primarily evergreens, adding a richness of dark green colors to the scene.\n\nIn the background, a panoramic view of distant mountains can be seen under a slightly clouded sky with light purple and blue hues reflecting the time of day. The mountains have patches of snow on their peaks, indicating a high altitude or a cooler season.\n\nOn the left side of the river, further in the distance, there are what seem to be a few small buildings or houses, suggesting a rural or lightly populated area. The buildings appear modest and spaced apart, hinting at a tranquil, perhaps agricultural or residential community.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes natural elements and a serene setting to convey a sense of peace and natural beauty. The color palette is cool, dominated by blues, greens, and purples, emphasizing the calm and serene atmosphere of the landscape.","title":"North fork of the skagit river and the skagit valley, with the cascade mountains in the background","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550680","550656","542653","552597","552599","550691","554762","557106","557239","550560","557095","554629","550782","550845","550700","550839"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["evergreen","richness","peace","mountain","river","utilize","altitude","purple","riverbank","dawn"]}
