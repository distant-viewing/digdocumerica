{"path":"544591.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of dramatic aftermath, likely from a tornado or similar natural disaster. The focus is on the large, fragmented pieces of a small airplane that have crashed into a residential backyard. The airplane, substantially damaged, is entangled among the heavy branches of trees, with parts of its structure scattered throughout the area.\n\nThe foremost section of the airplane, potentially the cockpit, is wedged against a large leafy tree, with its body twisted and parts of the metallic skin peeled away or crumpled. Part of what appears to be the undercarriage and the propeller can be seen near the center, deeply embedded into the ground and partially obscured by grass and other debris.\n\nIn the background, a man stands observing the damage in the yard of a tan brick house with a prominent, small front porch. The house itself seems intact despite the proximity of the airplane wreckage. The yard is lush with green grass, and there are a few other small trees and flowering plants around, which add a touch of normalcy to the otherwise chaotic scene.\n\nAdditionally, various small debris, possibly from the airplane or damaged trees, litter the grass, and a garden hose can be seen on the ground. The sky is clear with very few clouds, suggesting that the weather event has passed, leaving behind sunny, calm weather. The ambiance is quiet and somber, as the focus of the individual appears entirely on assessing the wreckage and dealing with the aftermath.","title":"River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["545685","547079","545966","545670","544461","544464","545681","544463","544797","554437","544583","544467","544472","544466","547888","548484"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","wreckage","aftermath","yard","grass","propeller","cockpit","backyard","house","disaster"]}
