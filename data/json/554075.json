{"path":"554075.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic sunset view by the ocean. The composition is bathed in the golden hues typical of sunset lighting. The foreground features a slightly rugged coastline with the shore in shadows, consisting of wet sand and some smaller rocks, reflecting the sunlight in a shimmering pattern.\n\nTowards the middle ground, the sea appears restless, with visible waves and frothy water, which adds a dynamic texture to the scene. The water surface gleams under the sunlight, highlighting ripples and small waves.\n\nIn the background, the silhouette of a small landmass or headland is visible, accented by the outlines of numerous palm trees against the sky, suggesting a tropical location. This part of the image is darkened into silhouettes due to the strong backlighting from the setting sun. Above this, the sky transitions from a richer, darker color at the top to a lighter, warmer tone towards the horizon.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a peaceful evening at a tropical beach, with an emphasis on the interplay of light and shadow, and a strong silhouette element contributing to its tranquil and picturesque quality.","title":"Late afternoon surf at Maliko Bay","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554074","543064","547479","545030","553989","543144","542890","552335","550288","542808","545019","543137","545238","544985","545000","557447"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["silhouette","sunset","wave","gleam","backlighting","landmass","darken","palm","sunlight","accent"]}
