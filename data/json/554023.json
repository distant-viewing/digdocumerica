{"path":"554023.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rugged coastal landscape. The coastline features pristine sandy beaches adjacent to deep blue ocean waters. The waves are gently crashing on the shore, creating white foam. The terrain inland is largely flat and appears arid with sparse, scrubby vegetation, indicating a possibly dry climate. No significant human activity or structures are directly visible, suggesting the area might be relatively undeveloped or preserved. The sky above is relatively clear with a few clouds, suggesting good weather conditions. The color saturation and quality convey a somewhat vintage or dated feel, possibly indicating that the photo is not recent. Overall, the image captures the tranquil and natural beauty of an undisturbed coastal environment.","title":"Aerial view of the western shores of Molokai Island.
