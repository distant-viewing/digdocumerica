{"path":"544481.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene predominantly featuring an expansive field of tall green crops under a vast blue sky with scattered clouds. In the mid-ground, there's a farmstead consisting of several structures. To the left, there are two large white barns with slanted roofs; one appears metallic and reflective. Adjacent to the barns is a collection of smaller buildings, including a house with visible chimneys. This cluster of farm buildings is tucked into a landscape that suggests an agricultural or farming community.\n\nThe foreground is densely filled with crops that seem lush and well-tended, indicating perhaps a peak growing season. The horizon is flat, revealing the characteristic openness of a rural or agricultural area, which emphasizes the vastness and the sparse population of the location. The photographic composition uses a wide angle to encompass the breadth of the farmland and place emphasis on the cultivation and the farm structures as nestled within this broad expanse. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of tranquility and isolation in nature.","title":"Sugar mill near lake okeechobee","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["547291","547303","549222","557946","549237","557183","547304","547288","547321","552466","547305","549256","554819","549141","549252","551305"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","population","breadth","encompass","ten","farmland","tuck","cultivation","consiste","openness"]}
