{"path":"554418.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of logging activity within a forest setting. A man wearing a gray long-sleeve shirt, jeans, boots, and a yellow hard hat is standing among large, freshly cut logs that are piled up on the ground. The logs display a variety of sizes and bark textures, suggesting recent cutting and sorting activities.\n\nDominating the scene is a large, red logging machine, specifically a grapple skidder, which is equipped with a grappling hook mechanism used to lift and transport logs. The arm of the skidder, painted in red and rust, is extended and positioned over the pile of logs, poised to grab or release a log. The machine appears sturdy and worn, indicating frequent use in heavy logging operations.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a dense green forest with a variety of trees, some of which are tall and straight, indicating a healthy forest environment. Despite the industrial activity, the surrounding forest appears largely undisturbed beyond the immediate area of logging.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image with the mechanical, man-made elements contrasting against the natural backdrop highlights the interplay between industrial logging activities and the forest environment.","title":"Loader at work beside lumberjack on International Paper Company land near Big Moose.
