{"path":"552909.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a group of American White Pelicans in the process of taking off from a body of water. The pelicans, mostly white with black flight feathers visible on their wings, are captured in various stages of flight, some just lifting off and others already airborne with wings fully extended. The birds are located in the foreground against the backdrop of a tranquil, expansive lake.\n\nThe background features a large mountainous landscape, the mountains in the distance showing a bluish tint likely due to atmospheric perspective, adding a sense of depth to the scene. These mountains are rugged and barren with no visible vegetation, suggesting a harsh, possibly arid environment. The sky is not visible in the frame, focusing all attention on the pelicans and the mountains.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes a juxtaposition between the motion of the birds and the stillness of the mountainous landscape, creating a dynamic yet harmonious natural scene. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly late afternoon sunlight, enhancing the serene yet vibrant setting of this wildlife tableau.","title":"Pelicans in flight over the feeding ground on Pyramid Lake at the mouth of the Truckee River.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552911","552912","555554","550903","544500","544834","545302","545187","552238","548728","557121","553347","544611","552913","552910","553875"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pelican","wing","flight","bird","mountain","feather","tableau","tint","lift","stillness"]}
