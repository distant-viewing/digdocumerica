{"path":"543329.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene maritime scene. In the foreground, there are jagged, dark rocks clustered together at the edge of the water. These rocks appear rugged and uneven, covered with small areas of moss or algae, giving them a slightly greenish hue in some spots. Perched upon these rocks, there are multiple seabirds, possibly seagulls, seen as white specks typically resting or observing their surroundings.\n\nThe middle ground of the image features a sailboat on calm blue waters, cruising gently. It has a single white sail hoisted and is angled slightly away from the viewpoint, suggesting movement through the water. A few individuals can be seen onboard, engaged in maneuvering or possibly enjoying the sail. The sail displays a numerical identifier at its top.\n\nIn the background, there is a pale blue sky with a few faint clouds and a distant shoreline that stretches across the horizon. The distant land appears somewhat hazy but is identifiable as a long, narrow strip, likely a beach or a barrier island, which looks sandy or lightly vegetated.\n\nOverall, the composition beautifully captures a contrast between the rough, textured rocks in the foreground and the smooth, peaceful ocean scene unfolding behind. The scene conveys a sense of quiet adventure and natural beauty typical of coastal environments.","title":"Photograph of Monterey Bay area","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543402","548733","545277","545900","543046","542903","545057","548247","543059","544383","549380","544667","555694","545120","542877","545122"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sail","rock","seagull","algae","speck","island","sailboat","strip","moss","viewpoint"]}
