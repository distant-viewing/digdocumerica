{"path":"550330.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a landscape where natural and industrial elements intersect. The scene captures a large body of water bordered by lush green forests. The water has several branches, forming multiple bays or inlets surrounded by dense trees which suggest a relatively secluded area, possibly in a rural or semi-rural region.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a significant presence of industrial facilities. Several large buildings, storage tanks, and structured piles of materials, possibly logs or coal, are visible. These facilities are situated close to the water's edge, indicating that they might utilize the waterway for transportation or industrial processes. Notably, there are masses of material that appear to be logs floating in the water, arranged in clusters around the bay area, likely for logging or paper manufacturing purposes.\n\nThere are no visible humans or moving vehicles in the picture, giving the image a static yet detailed look. The water reflects a tranquil surface, while the environmental impact of the industrial activities is suggested by the proximity of these facilities to the natural landscape.\n\nThe overall perspective offered by this aerial view emphasizes the coexistence and contrast between the industrial and natural environments within this region.","title":"Georgia pacific paper plant in woodland on the st.
