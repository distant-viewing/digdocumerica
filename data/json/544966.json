{"path":"544966.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial setting with two large structures prominently featured. On the left, there is an enormous cone-shaped cooling tower made of what appears to be wooden slats, from which thick, white steam is billowing out, filling the top left portion of the image with a dense cloud. Adjacent to this, on the right, is a taller, more rectangular, and seemingly metallic structure also emitting a smaller amount of white smoke from its top. \n\nIn the foreground, some other less-distinguishable industrial machinery and infrastructure can be seen. There is what might be a small white vehicle visible near the center of the image, hinting at the scale of these structures.\n\nThe background reveals a range of mountains under a cloudy sky, suggesting the industrial site could be located in a valley. The sky is variably clouded, with darker clouds at the top which might suggest an overcast or stormy day.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image is somewhat muted, with earthy tones dominating amidst the gray industrial equipment and the darker sky, giving the scene a somewhat bleak or dreary aesthetic.","title":"\"Teepee\" burner incinerates lumber mill's waste","placename":"Panguitch (Utah)","location":"Panguitch, Utah","nn1":["544958","553829","548157","557374","551184","546760","551155","544777","551026","550672","551060","544736","557220","551175","551053","542521"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["slat","cone","cloud","top","amount","steam","tone","valley","aesthetic","range"]}
