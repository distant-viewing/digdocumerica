{"path":"551944.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a dilapidated, possibly abandoned, building made of brown brick or stone. The structure’s condition is notably poor, with visible damage and parts of its facade missing. The building has two symmetrical parts connected by a central entrance. Each side has three visible levels, including a basement.\n\nOn the ground floor of both sides, there are entryways that lead into what appear to be small enclosed porches. Above each entryway, there are remnants of windows. The glass is gone, and the frames are damaged. The building’s middle section and both upper levels have empty window frames suggesting a former presence of larger windows which are now completely missing.\n\nA central concrete pathway leads to the main entrance, which is positioned in the middle and flanked by large, symmetrical staircases leading down. The grass on either side of the path looks dry and patchy.\n\nThe building presents a sense of abandonment and decay, highlighted by the stark sunlight casting deep shadows, further emphasizing the architectural details and the rough state of the facade. Large antennas are visible on the rooftop, adding to the outdated look of the structure. The overall mood is one of neglect and desolation.","title":"Old row house with peeling paint","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["550129","550023","557139","557348","553548","557344","547985","554785","553478","555952","551330","543344","553555","551586","554707","557346"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["entryway","damage","entrance","lead","facade","level","window","porche","antenna","staircase"]}
