{"path":"553634.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a young man looking upwards, with his face expressive and tilted back. He is wearing a yellow hard hat that appears worn, with several scratches and marks, signifying that it has been well-used in possibly industrial, construction, or field settings. He also has on safety glasses with clear lenses, resting over his ears and nose.\n\nHis attire suggests he might be involved in a manual or labor-intensive job. The background is blurred, primarily comprising dark and green hues, indicating that he might be outdoors with trees and perhaps dense foliage nearby.\n\nThe lighting in the photo seems natural, possibly filtered through the leaves of trees, highlighting the side of his face and the rim of his hard hat. The focus on his face against the blur of the natural background emphasizes his expression and gaze, suggesting a moment of contemplation, assessment, or perhaps a break from physical work.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly.
