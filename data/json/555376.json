{"path":"555376.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene centered around a river and a small, sandy riverbank. The river appears wide and swift-flowing, with murky water that suggests it might be carrying a lot of sediment. Small waves and ripples on the river surface indicate a strong current.\n\nOn the riverbank, two young people are visible. They are both wearing short pants and appear to be barefoot, suggesting a warm climate or season. The person on the left has short hair and possibly a sun hat, while the person on the right has mid-length hair. They both appear to be engaged in exploring or walking along the bank, with a relaxed demeanor.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes lush greenery. Along the bank, there are young trees and shrubs, and beyond the river, more dense foliage can be seen, suggesting a forest or dense bush area. The ground itself looks dry and rocky in places, with patches of grass and sand.\n\nThe overall composition captures a moment of leisure and exploration in a nature-rich setting, with the focus on the young individuals and their interaction with this environment. The photograph also communicates a sense of isolation and tranquility, emphasizing the vastness and wildness of the natural environment surrounding the river.","title":"Two boys and a dog along the Gila River","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["551538","553413","550238","553439","542558","551525","546803","557743","551415","550235","552976","543530","550208","548868","549030","553414"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["river","riverbank","bank","wildness","hair","current","person","sediment","demeanor","length"]}
