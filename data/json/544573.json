{"path":"544573.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph provides a high-angle aerial view of what appears to be an industrial facility located next to a large body of water. The setting hints at a remote or less populated area, given the vast open land surrounding the industrial site.\n\nKey features of the facility include several tall, cylindrical structures—likely silos or storage tanks—accompanied by other buildings with flat roofs. There is a prominent tall chimney emitting no visible emissions at the moment. The infrastructure suggests that the facility could be involved in manufacturing or processing, possibly of chemicals or materials.\n\nThe adjacent body of water exhibits a teal or turquoise color, likely indicating some form of mineral presence or perhaps influenced by processes at the plant. A jetty extends into the water, equipped with what seems to be a conveyor belt or loading mechanism, suggesting that materials might be transported by barge or ships. A crane is visible at the end of this structure, further supporting the idea of loading or unloading goods.\n\nThe broader landscape around the facility is flat and appears semi-arid, with patches of greenery but largely dominated by bare earth or sparse vegetation. A long, straight road cutting through the landscape to the facility underscores the isolated location of the plant.\n\nThere are visible parked cars and small structures that could be for administration or worker facilities, clustered near the main buildings of the plant. This industrial scene is set against a backdrop of a clear sky, emphasizing the isolation and extensive scale of the facility in its environment.","title":"Florida Portland cement factory near the boundaries of the everglades","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544569","546103","543872","551994","545833","551998","544788","545841","549960","545837","549726","549727","544179","549526","555776","549507"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["facility","plant","idea","teal","jetty","unload","loading","mechanism","material","barge"]}
