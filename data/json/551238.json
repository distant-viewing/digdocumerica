{"path":"551238.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene on Bagnell Dam. The image depicts a line of cars traveling across the dam, likely from the early 1980s based on the models of the vehicles visible. The cars vary in style and color, featuring predominantly sedans of the era in hues of blue, white, and brown. In the foreground, a prominent vehicle with a distinctive grill and headlights directly faces the viewer. \n\nOn the right side of the image, a series of gantries rise above the road, carrying signs that add functional and commercial detail to the setting. One sign reads “BAGNELL DAM UNISOPH UNION ELECTRIC,” indicating the name of the dam and possibly a reference to the managing utility or entity. Another sign warns of “DANGER” in bright letters, further down the road.\n\nA motorcycle and its rider, with a helmet, can be seen on the right side, leaning slightly, perhaps entering or exiting the lane of traffic. The road itself is bounded by a high guardrail or barrier, giving a sense of narrowness to the space through which the vehicles are passing.\n\nBeyond the immediate roadway, the background features a busy parking lot packed with cars, which blends into a general scene of commercial activity with various billboards and signs advertising local businesses or attractions. The overall atmosphere is one of a busy, functional infrastructure point likely serving both local and through traffic in a commercial region. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, which accentuates the everyday, utilitarian nature of the scene.","title":"Memorial Day traffic crossing Bagnell Dam. \"The Strip,\" an amusement area, is in background.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551287","551211","543978","551212","549879","549497","557230","549861","549878","549857","553828","547811","546738","545463","555437","548084"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["dam","sign","entity","traffic","road","car","reference","vehicle","danger","grill"]}
