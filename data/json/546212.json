{"path":"546212.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape, vividly detailing the infrastructure associated with heavy industry and manufacturing. In the foreground, we see a wide road lined with telephone poles, stretching straight into the distance toward a densely positioned array of industrial facilities. The road is busy with a mix of vehicles including cars, trucks, and heavy machinery, suggesting the area's active industrial operations.\n\nOn either side of the road are large industrial buildings, storage tanks, and warehouses. Various construction and utility vehicles are visible, which could indicate ongoing construction or maintenance activities. A crane, several large structures, and palm trees sporadically dot the landscape, adding a touch of natural elements to the otherwise industrial setting.\n\nThe background is dominated by a sprawling industrial complex with multiple smokestacks, some of which are emitting smoke or steam. This area is densely packed with metallic towers, tanks, and piping, characteristic of chemical or petroleum processing plants.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of robust industrial activity, highlighted by the complex's extensive scope and the clear, busy nature of the area. The image could be highlighting issues related to industrial growth, environmental impact, or the economic activities of a heavily industrialized zone.","title":"Industrialized port area","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["555761","555774","551057","550278","549710","550982","555778","546085","546055","550168","546107","546122","549727","557225","552014","548377"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["complex","tank","road","scope","telephone","construction","piping","palm","chemical","warehouse"]}
