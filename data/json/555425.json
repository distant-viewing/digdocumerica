Lights from numerous buildings, streetlights, and vehicles create a vivid panorama of urban life after dark.\n\nIn the foreground, some prominent features include well-lit streets and highways, where the movement of traffic is captured as streaks of light â€“ red taillights and white headlights blur, indicating the busy traffic flow. Different roads intersect, and some curves of the highway are visible, suggesting a complex roadway network.\n\nTowards the center of the photograph rises a tall building, significantly more illuminated and taller than its surroundings, likely a central commercial or office tower. Its multiple stories flicker with lights, indicating activity even at this nighttime hour.\n\nThe city behind extends into the distance turned into a sea of tiny lights, showing densely packed buildings. Each lit window hints at life going on within each unit. The city is surrounded by hills, further back, shaping the horizon under a dark sky without visible stars, emphasizing the glow emitted from the urban area.\n\nOverall, the photo captures the dynamic and lively essence of city life at night through the concentration of lights and activity.","title":"Looking into the downtown core area of Portland, from the west hills, the 43-story first national bank building shows lights on only a few floors at 8 p.m.  During the state's energy crisis in the fall of 1973","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555418","555406","547051","546575","547429","546586","545913","549543","546684","548392","555446","555426","546707","548417","546739","546591"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","city","light","panorama","traffic","streetlight","life","star","headlight","streak"]}
