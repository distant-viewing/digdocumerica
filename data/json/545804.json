{"path":"545804.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph presents a rugged natural landscape likely in a desert environment. The foreground is dominated by a large, smooth, and sloping rock formation with interesting textures reminiscent of wave patterns eroded into the stone. This rock surface appears relatively barren, with only a few hardy shrubs or bushes managing to grow.\n\nIn the middle of the composition, the terrain continues to gently rise, leading towards further rocky landscapes in the distance. The coloration of the rock varies from light tan to deep oranges and reds, suggesting different mineral compositions or the influence of sunlight. \n\nThe background features several distinctive rock formations or buttes, standing prominently amidst vast stretches of flatter land. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting this photograph was taken on a sunny day. The clear blue sky contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the rock formations, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of this desert scene. This type of environment is typical of the American Southwest, where erosion has sculpted sandstone into various striking formations.","title":"Looking north over crossbedded Navajo sandstone toward the Windows section of Arches National Park, where many of the natural arches are located.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544401","545696","545789","544745","544397","545754","544376","545791","545800","544429","544950","545771","545797","552444","544027","552445"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["formation","rock","desert","butte","sandstone","influence","coloration","stretch","mineral","erosion"]}
