{"path":"551680.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and peaceful boating scene in a lush park setting. In the foreground, there are two metal rowboats gently floating on a calm body of water. One boat carries two individuals who appear to be rowing and enjoying a leisurely outing, while the other boat carries a person who appears to be relaxing, sitting at the end of the boat.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by dense greenery, including large rocks on the far side and flowering bushes that add a touch of white to the green landscape. Trees with thick foliage dominate the far bank, enhancing the feel of a secluded and tranquil location.\n\nOn the right edge of the image, a blooming bush with white flowers partially obscures the view, adding depth and a rich texture to the photograph. Moreover, a metal fence at the water's edge suggests the boundaries of a managed park area.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene and idyllic, suggesting an escape into nature within an urban or suburban setting. The lighting, presumably natural, enhances the colors of the greenery and the reflective qualities of the water.","title":"Boating in central park lake","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551679","546070","550835","550769","549417","550780","553411","550000","550054","552982","544195","550975","557563","557972","546856","551350"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","bush","carry","flower","rowboat","escape","boating","relax","outing","greenery"]}
