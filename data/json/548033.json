{"path":"548033.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"In the photograph, you can see two men in a snowy environment, likely involved in a field activity related to snow or ice research. Both men are dressed in heavy, checkerboard patterned winter jackets and wear hats, suggesting cold weather conditions. The man on the left is turned slightly away from the camera and appears to be manipulating a large, cylindrical instrument made of metal, which is held vertically in the snow. The man on the right, facing toward the camera, attentively observes the instrument, which seems to be some sort of measuring device, potentially for collecting snow or ice samples.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, amidst heavily snow-covered trees that suggest a forested or mountainous area. The snow is thick on the ground, indicating recent snowfall or a generally heavy winter season. The equipment and the attire of the individuals suggest scientific activity, possibly related to meteorology, glaciology, or environmental science. The general atmosphere is one of focused work in a wintry natural landscape.","title":"Members of the Crag Rats climbing club make winter snow surveys for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service at Tilly Jane Camp Ground on Mt.
