{"path":"553432.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large agricultural field with an irrigation system in action. The irrigation sprays water in multiple high, arching streams across the field, creating a series of wide, semi-transparent water arcs. The water droplets are visible, sparkling due to either sunlight or another light source, adding vibrant and dynamic elements to the scene.\n\nThe soil appears to be mainly composed of small stones or rough gravel, suggesting a possibly arid environment or an area prepared for specific types of crops that require such soil conditions. There are no visible plants or crops growing in the field at this time, which implies that it might either be in a preparative stage for planting or resting.\n\nIn the background, a line of lush green trees borders the field, providing a natural contrast to the stony ground. These trees look dense and undisturbed, indicating that the field is likely on the edge of a larger wooded area or forest.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image focuses on the interaction between human agricultural activity represented by the irrigation system and the natural environment indicated by the wooded background and the field's condition. The scene might be captured during early morning or late evening, given the subdued lighting and the apparent dampness visible in the environment.","title":"Fitchburg's old and inadequate sewage treatment plant soon to be replaced by a new one under construction on the whitman river with epa assistance","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["543650","548953","548875","546949","546825","554014","548869","548877","548991","548950","549178","543777","553652","546829","546404","548901"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","field","system","dampness","sparkl","resting","soil","arc","planting","subdued"]}
