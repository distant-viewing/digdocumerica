{"path":"546604.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a vintage scene where a group of passengers are boarding a charter bus. The bus, prominently shown in the image with the number 6579, is marked as \"Air Conditioned\" indicating comfort and modern amenities for its era. The bus design is sleek and somewhat futuristic, with a distinctive front window and extended round headlights.\n\nThe group of passengers appears to be diverse, comprised of men and women, most dressed in coats, suggesting it might be a cool weather day. They are positioned in a line leading to the bus door, indicating an organized boarding process. The men predominantly wear suits or formal attire, while the women are dressed in long coats. This attire suggests a formal occasion or possibly a business-related trip.\n\nIn the background, there is an open parking lot with several cars parked, some of which are visible in the foreground. These cars have a classic design, typical of the mid-20th century automotive style. The setting of the image doesn't reveal much urban development, invoking a sense of an open, perhaps suburban area. Additionally, there's a faint glimpse of an overpass or a highway structure in the extreme background, providing a hint of the photograph being taken near a major road or transportation hub.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of travel likely related to work or a special event, depicted within a setting that combines elements of transportation and mid-20th century design, reflecting a period-specific snapshot of traveling conveniences and societal norms.","title":"7:25 am express bus from Maryland suburb to Washington, DC","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546605","546655","553796","556748","556795","549921","555978","552793","547814","545385","553957","549891","556050","556742","554264","556797"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","passenger","travel","coat","boarding","convenience","transportation","design","amenity","century"]}
