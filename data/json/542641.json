{"path":"542641.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a vast field filled with blooming yellow flowers under a clear sky. The flowers, appearing vibrant and densely packed, dominate the foreground and midground of the image, contributing a uniform burst of yellow color across the scene. These blooms vary slightly in shade and are of a round, fluffy variety, suggesting they might be a type of ranunculus or similar species.\n\nIn the background, the landscape transitions to a mix of different fields where various shades of green and brown are visible, indicating different types of crops or fallow land. Sparse, small buildings or farm structures can be glimpsed in the distance, emphasizing the rural setting. The horizon is level, and the sky above is a soft, overcast blue, adding a quiet and serene mood to the landscape.\n\nThe setting suggests a well-maintained agricultural area, likely dedicated to flower cultivation, given the extensive planting and the organized nature of the field. The overall composition, with its depth shown through the field stretching into the distance, conveys a sense of expansiveness and the beauty of agricultural landscapes.","title":"Commercial fields of ranunculus","placename":"Escondido (Calif.)","location":"Escondido, California","nn1":["552503","542645","542642","542704","549158","544574","550781","549250","544443","544938","553076","552538","549229","554111","544439","545723"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["field","flower","bloom","planting","expansiveness","type","burst","cultivation","dedicate","specie"]}
