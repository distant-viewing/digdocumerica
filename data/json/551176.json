{"path":"551176.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape where both natural and urban elements coexist. The primary focus appears to be a large, darkly colored body of water surrounded by irregular, textured formations that could either be mud or pollution. The murky water demonstrates swirls and patterns, indicating possible chemical or sedimentary disturbances. \n\nAdjacent to the water, a residential area is visible, with small houses closely spaced along tree-lined streets. A highway runs parallel to the expanse, separated from the water by only a narrow strip of land, suggesting an immediate proximity of human habitation to the water body. Cars can be seen on the highway, indicating active traffic.\n\nFurthermore, the division between land and waterbody is visibly stark. The land area is structured with clear demarcations for roads, whereas the water area shows natural, unstructured patterns. The colors are vivid, with the blue of the water contrasting against the darker muddy patterns and the green-grassed areas near the houses.\n\nOverall, the scene captures contrasting interactions between human habitation and a potentially compromised natural water body, highlighting elements of environmental, residential, and infrastructural importance. The overhead perspective allows for a comprehensive view of these interactions and the scale of the impact on the environment.","title":"Effluent from one of the many chemical plants on the Kanawha River discolors waters of inlet.","placename":"Charleston (W.
