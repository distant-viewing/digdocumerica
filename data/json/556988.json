{"path":"556988.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a rural or semi-rural road scene under a clear, blue sky. This road has two lanes, demarcated by a dashed yellow line in the center and a solid white line along the edges. There is a bicycle lane on the right side, painted with a faded green line. A metal guardrail runs along the right side of the road, separating the road from a dry, grassy area that fills the foreground right down to a lower level, where another roadway or access road appears parallel to the main road.\n\nOn the main road in the distance, we can see a car, capturing a moment of normal traffic flow. There are no visible people or animals in the scene. The area beyond the road is wooded, with pine or similar types of trees dominating, suggesting a landscape that might be typical of regions with cooler climates. The sky is bright and cloudless, contributing to the overall serene and unbusy nature of the scene. The lighting and shadow indicate either early morning or late afternoon light, giving the foliage and surfaces a rich, colorful appearance. There is no visible signage or buildings, reinforcing the natural, undeveloped character of the area.","title":"Schold road paralleling state highway #3, which parallels old highway #3, north of silverdale.
