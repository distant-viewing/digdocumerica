{"path":"558398.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Hanson, Art","caption":"The photograph depicts a solemn religious scene inside a church. A priest, dressed in a green vestment, is standing at an altar, elevating a host (communion wafer), which is a common practice in Christian liturgies symbolizing the offering of the bread. His expression is serious and focused.\n\nThe altar is simple and modern in design, covered with a white cloth. On it, there is an open book, likely a liturgical text, and to the left, there is a vase with a single red rose accompanied by some greenery. On either side of the priest, tall candles are placed; they are lit, enhancing the sanctity and solemnity of the setting. In the foreground, out of focus, we can see bunches of white and pink flowers, potentially decorating the base of the altar for a special occasion or season.\n\nThe background is fairly dark, subtly directing focus towards the brightly lit central figure of the priest and the altar. This setting suggests a moment of significant ritual importance within a Christian service, likely a mass, characterized by contemplation and reverence.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The largest group of churchgoers are Roman Catholics. A priest is shown distributing communion at a service at St. Marys, one of two Catholic churches in town. The parish had met in their church school auditorium for more than 30 years until enough money was raised for the modern church they desired.
