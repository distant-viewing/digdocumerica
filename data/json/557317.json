{"path":"557317.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In the photograph, we see a man seated at a desk inside what appears to be an industrial or scientific setting, possibly a control room of some sort. The man, featuring a full beard and long hair secured behind his ears, is wearing a dark shirt and is turned slightly to look at the camera, capturing a candid moment while he sits by a notepad, poised with a pen in hand as if about to write.\n\nThe environment around the man is filled with technical equipment. Directly adjacent to him on the left is a large panel housing multiple meters and gauges, suggesting monitoring or measurement functionality, which is typical in scientific experiments or manufacturing processes. Some of these meters are encased in a steel gray rack which matches the aesthetic of professional and industrial equipment.\n\nTo the right, additional equipment in racks includes communication or recording devices, likely used for data acquisition, storage, or perhaps even remote communication. The style and arrangement suggest an era possibly in the 1970s or 1980s based on the design and apparent age of the technology.\n\nThe walls and floors are utilitarianâ€”unfinished concrete surfaces that emphasize the functional nature of the space. There are notices, papers, and what might be schematics or instructions attached to both a board and the machinery, indicating a highly technical and regulated environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that blends human presence with the complex and often impersonal world of high-tech industrial or scientific work. The inclusion of personal touch, like the seated pose of the man and his direct gaze, juxtaposes nicely with the surrounding mechanical and somewhat cold equipment.","title":"Graduate research assistant at the solar energy applications laboratory.
