{"path":"542890.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features a coastal scene captured during what appears to be late afternoon or sunset, given the golden hue near the horizon and the long shadows cast. The foreground is dominated by numerous dark silhouettes of large, tangled driftwood and rocks, creating a rugged texture. This area is under exposed, making details hard to discern and emphasizing the rough, organic shapes of the wood and stones.\n\nTowards the middle ground, the beach opens up to reveal a wide expanse of wet sand that reflects the remaining sunlight, leading to an ocean that merges with the sky at the horizon. The brightness of the beach contrasts starkly with the dark foreground.\n\nOn the beach, there are silhouettes of people involved in various activities. Some appear to be walking along the shore, possibly collecting items or simply enjoying a walk, while a few might be standing and observing the ocean.\n\nIn the background, the coastline continues with more rock formations rising above the sea level, contributing to a sense of rugged natural beauty. The sky above is relatively clear, softly transitioning from a lighter shade near the horizon to a darker blue overhead, suggesting the time of day is just before the sunset completes.\n\nOverall, the composition uses strong contrasts between light and dark areas to draw the viewer's eye across the scene from the shadowed, detailed foreground to the luminous, open space of the sea and sky. The mood is serene and somewhat pensive, underscored by the natural beauty and quiet activity of the figures on the beach.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["544985","543069","543054","543052","557509","547492","543081","551554","543252","547483","543493","543078","548221","543091","545081","547607"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sunset","ocean","horizon","sea","tangle","silhouette","driftwood","walk","complete"]}
