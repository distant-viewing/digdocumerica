{"path":"549654.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents an interesting urban scene, viewed from inside a subway or metro station exit. In the foreground, a woman with shoulder-length hair, dressed in a white t-shirt paired with dark trousers and carrying a shoulder bag, is captured mid-step as she exits the station using an escalator. She appears to be in motion, descending towards the street level.\n\nBeyond the confines of the station, the background commands attention with its picturesque cityscape. Prominently, two gothic spires of a large cathedral rise sharply into the sky, defining much of the urban skyline. The architecture of the cathedral is intricate, suggesting a historical and possibly significant landmark.\n\nIn the streets, a trio of compact cars, including two that are beetle-shaped—iconic of mid-20th century automotive design—traverse the roadway, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The presence of overhead wires and a clear, blue sky adds further dimension and texture to the setting.\n\nThe overall composition mixes elements of daily life with notable architecture, contrasting the mundane flow of city traffic and the routine of a commuter with the grandeur of historic architectural achievements. The photo captures a moment of transition, both literally as the woman moves between two environments, and metaphorically in the intersection of movement and permanence within a city landscape.","title":"Entrance to the underground pedestrian passage-way at schottenring with votiv cathedral in background.
