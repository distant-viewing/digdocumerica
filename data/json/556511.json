{"path":"556511.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a coal mine. The setting is dimly lit and offers a glimpse into the underground work environment of miners. The photograph is dominated by two miners at work; they are both wearing safety helmets with head-mounted lights. \n\nOne miner is seated and operating a large, orange and rust-colored continuous mining machine with several articulated sections, probably engaged in extracting coal from the coal face. This miner is focused on the machine, adjusting or controlling it with his hands. The machine is bulky and industrial, showing signs of heavy use.\n\nThe other miner is kneeling nearby, holding what appears to be a red metal box, possibly a toolbox or a piece of equipment essential for the mining operation. This miner is also intently focused on his task, suggesting that his work is critical to the mining operation.\n\nThe background features the rough, dark hewn surfaces of the mine's interior. The floor is scattered with coal chunks, and there are visible cables or tubing stretching across the scene, implying the presence of machinery or utilities support.\n\nThe ambient lighting, although minimal, highlights the miners and the main pieces of machinery, creating a stark contrast with the dark, rugged environment of the coal mine. The photograph offers a poignant snapshot of the challenging conditions and the gritty reality faced by workers in the mining industry.","title":"Alvin Elledge, left, on the coal loader in a Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company mine near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The loader picks up the coal but does not cut it. Note that he sits on a canvas seat that pulls him along the ground. At the right is foreman Jerry Layne who is about to check the roof ahead of the loader prior to placing a four to five foot roof bolt in the ceiling as a brace. This is dangerous work because the roof could cave in before being braced.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556397","556365","556363","556359","556360","556517","556366","556396","556510","556358","556357","556364","543775","556319","543743","556367"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["miner","coal","mine","mining","machine","work","tubing","chunk","machinery","piece"]}
