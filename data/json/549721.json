{"path":"549721.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial setting, likely a factory or a maintenance workshop focused on aircraft components. In the foreground, there are two prominent black mechanical parts placed on the ground, positioned in a slightly staggered manner. These components appear to be aircraft engines or parts of undercarriage systems due to their complex assembly and metallic sheen.\n\nUpturned, possibly for maintenance or assembly, these components reveal a plethora of tubes, casings, and mechanical intricacies which gleam under the workshop lighting. One part is more to the left while the other extends towards the right; the latter shows a conical ending suggesting a part of a propulsion or exhaust system.\n\nIn the background, a worker is visible; he is dressed in a striped, short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, standing with his back turned and looking attentively at another piece of equipment or possibly another part of an aircraft. He seems engaged in his task, perhaps adjusting or inspecting the component.\n\nThe worker is surrounded by typical industrial workshop elements: metallic frames, hanging chains, various parts positioned on racks, and numerous tools. The setting is lit by overhead lights that cast reflections on the metallic surfaces, enhancing their details.\n\nThe overall ambiance is that of a busy, functional space filled with purpose-specific tools and components. The environment reveals the complexity and scale of mechanical and maintenance work involved in aircraft operations. The focus and placement of objects create a dynamic yet organized snapshot of industrial life.","title":"On the Cadillac assembly line--engines and fuel tanks suspended on wires float through the plant, en route to being fitted to the car Bodies.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["555954","553330","549723","545935","553329","556314","544026","544826","544822","549684","544818","556388","543158","547964","558371","544022"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["aircraft","component","workshop","assembly","maintenance","part","system","tool","worker","intricacy"]}
