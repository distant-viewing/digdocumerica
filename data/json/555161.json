{"path":"555161.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of an active volcanic eruption at night. The primary focus of the image is a vibrant, glowing lava flow. The lava appears in molten states, with bright orange and yellow colors indicating extremely high temperatures. The surface of the lava is uneven and rugged, showcasing the dynamic, flowing nature of molten rock as it pushes forward.\n\nSurrounding the lava are dark, solidified rocks that provide a stark contrast to the bright, fluid lava. These rocks are jagged and appear rugged, possibly representing earlier phases of the eruption where the lava has cooled and solidified.\n\nAdding to the dynamic nature of the scene, there are numerous sparks and particles that can be seen in the air above the lava flow. These are likely caused by gases escaping violently from the lava, carrying fine particles of rock and other materials into the air. This results in a chaotic, fiery swirl of sparks that enhances the intensity of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is dark, emphasizing the glow from the lava and highlighting the natural power and energy of a volcanic eruption. The composition of the photograph with its focus on glowing lava and dark surroundings effectively captures the awe-inspiring and potentially dangerous beauty of volcanic activity.","title":"Buffer strip burning in a slash burn in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543707","555227","554142","543929","554141","554138","553037","544694","555158","554140","555160","557578","557577","555156","543900","543020"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["lava","spark","particle","glow","rock","flow","air","phase","temperature","escape"]}
