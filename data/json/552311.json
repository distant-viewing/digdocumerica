{"path":"552311.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene at a lakeside or seafront. In the foreground, a wooden dock extends into the calm water, with a solitary figure on it, appearing to be engaged in fishing or perhaps adjusting something on the dock. A small rowboat is moored nearby, adding to the tranquil, leisurely atmosphere.\n\nBeyond the dock, the water serves as a reflecting surface for the scene, enhancing the tranquility and depth of the view. A tugboat is anchored further in the background, positioned left of the center, illuminated by lights that punctuate the encroaching evening darkness. \n\nThe background features an expansive view of a distant shoreline and a cityscape subtly lit, suggesting either early morning or late evening hours. This urban spread lies at the foot of majestic mountains, which rise dramatically against the sky, their peaks just visible in the fading light. The mountains are partly enshrouded by mist or low clouds, adding a layer of mystery and natural beauty to the setting.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in a blue hue, typical of the moments of dusk or dawn, which adds a cool, calm tone to the picture, evoking a sense of peace and stillness. This picturesque setting is likely capturing the essence of a tranquil moment in a scenic location, where the elements of water, human activity, and the natural landscape come together harmoniously.","title":"Salmon fishermen at sunrise in the strait of juan de fuca","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545911","552225","551280","543119","543143","547052","543553","545149","543618","546392","545096","551214","552263","543613","547230","547027"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dock","evening","rowboat","encroach","tugboat","peace","mountain","anchor","lakeside","mystery"]}
