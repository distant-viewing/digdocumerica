{"path":"555348.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a technical or experimental setup outdoors, possibly related to solar energy research. In the foreground, there's a large apparatus resembling a solar concentrator. This device includes several cylindrical metallic tubes, possibly mirrors or part of a lens system designed to focus sunlight, mounted on a structural frame made from metal with perforations. The frame appears adjustable and is equipped with various mechanical and possibly optical components.\n\nA person in a white shirt and dark pants stands behind the apparatus, intently observing or controlling the device. They appear focused on their work, possibly calibrating or studying the equipment's performance.\n\nIn the background, there is a nondescript building with a single visible door and minimal windows, suggesting that the setting might be more utilitarian, possibly an industrial or research facility area. The ground is covered in what looks like typical outdoor paving, and there is a notable shadow cast across the scene, indicating bright sunlight which complements the possible solar research theme.\n\nOverall, the composition is informative, illustrating an experimental or practical application possibly related to renewable energy technologies.","title":"Prototype of a linear parabolic reflector used to gather the sun's energy and heat fluid in the center pipe to several hundred degrees F. \"Solar farms\" with banks of such reflectors covering many square miles could drive large turbines and generators and provide almost half the country's electrical energy needs according to the designers.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555349","555347","555333","555327","555309","555331","557338","555343","553907","557328","555323","555328","557312","557332","557319","555375"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["research","apparatus","device","energy","application","paving","lens","tube","performance","mirror"]}
