{"path":"555938.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a view of a city skyline from a moving vehicle on a highway, taken during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, judging by the lighting. The skyline is filled with numerous buildings of varying heights, including some prominent skyscrapers that punctuate the city's silhouette against a partly cloudy sky. The sky itself shows a gradient of blue near the top fading into lighter hues towards the horizon, accented with scattered, fluffy clouds that are highlighted by the sun.\n\nIn the foreground, part of the highway barrier can be seen running across the bottom of the frame, slightly blurred perhaps due to the speed of the vehicle from which the photo was taken. Additionally, the reflections on the window through which this photo was likely taken are visible, including a subtle reflection of what seems to be the photographer's hand holding the camera. The blurred forms of other vehicles traveling on the highway, captured in motion, contribute to the sense of movement and dynamic activity on the road. These elements frame the urban landscape and add a layer of immediacy and personal perspective to the image.","title":"Midtown skyline of New York City seen from Queens. This project is a portrait of the inner city environment showing people in their various pursuits and the architecture in which they live. Some of the best American architecture survives in her \"worst\" neighborhoods, only because it hasn't been demolished.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545467","556193","547755","553016","548392","546707","553721","553838","545432","550178","549846","552394","552363","545499","553723","549478"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["highway","skyline","immediacy","vehicle","reflection","photographer","city","speed","skyscraper","gradient"]}
