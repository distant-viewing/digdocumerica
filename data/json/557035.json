{"path":"557035.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is a close-up portrait of a mature man, focusing on his face and upper body. The man appears to be middle-aged, with short, dark hair and distinctive features, including deep-set eyes and a contemplative expression. His left hand is partially covering his face as if he is in deep thought or concern, touching his forehead and cheek. He is dressed in a casual light-beige or cream shirt with a collar, partially unbuttoned at the neck.\n\nThe lighting of the photo casts dramatic shadows and highlights on his face, contributing to the moodiness of the scene. The background is blurred and indistinct, mostly in dark tones, which makes it difficult to discern any specific details except some hints of lighter areas suggesting a possibly indoor environment or dimly lit space.\n\nThe overall tone of the photograph is introspective and carries a somewhat melancholic or reflective mood, accentuated by the man's pose and expression. The image has a film-like texture, visible in its grain and color saturation, adding an element of timelessness and an artistic quality to the photograph.","title":"Concerned about Trident board member David Sive, New York attorney, attends a board meeting at Kitsap Country House, at Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, Washington.
