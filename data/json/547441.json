{"path":"547441.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the scene of a crowded event, likely a sports game or a public gathering. The focus is on a man situated in the foreground. He is wearing a vibrant red cowboy hat with a prominent white \"N\" on the front, suggesting a possible connection to the University of Nebraska, whose sports teams are called the Cornhuskers and use a similar emblem and colors. The man is also wearing a red shirt, sunglasses, and he appears to be engaged in watching the event or perhaps in conversation, as his mouth is slightly open.\n\nThe background is darker and filled with multiple other spectators, which creates a contrast that highlights the man in the red hat. The crowd appears diverse, with individuals wearing various colors of clothing. Some of the visible details include a person in a striped red and white shirt and another wearing a solid dark blue shirt. The overall ambiance suggests an active, possibly noisy environment typical of a sporting event or concert. The lighting is subdued, contributing to a focused atmosphere with the main subject sharply dressed in themes of red.","title":"Big sports event of the year is the spring football game at the university of Nebraska, an intra-mural event.
