{"path":"555716.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene cityscape viewed across a large body of water. The sky, taking up the top half of the frame, is adorned with soft, sprawling clouds tinted with shades of pink and blue, suggesting that the photo might have been taken during early morning or late evening. Below the sky, the tranquil sea stretches across the foreground with gentle ripples, reflecting the subdued light of the sky.\n\nIn the distance, a horizon line clearly separates the water from the sky. A series of high-rise buildings dominate the view, forming a continuous urban skyline. These buildings vary in height but generally have a modern architectural style, typical of mid-to-late 20th century urban developments. The city appears quiet and there are no visible signs of active movement or life from this distance.\n\nThe photo has an overall vintage look, likely due to the color saturation and quality typical of older film photography. The edges of the photo are slightly darkened, giving it a vignette effect which focuses the viewerâ€™s attention towards the center where the skyline is located. The atmosphere conveyed is peaceful and somewhat nostalgic, encapsulating a moment of calm and simplicity against the backdrop of urban growth.","title":"Smog on the bight off the Long Island coast.
