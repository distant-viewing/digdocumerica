{"path":"549512.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image is an aerial view showing a coastal scene. Most of the image captures the expanse of dark blue sea which has a subtle, gentle wave pattern, suggesting calm waters. In the middle of the water, to the right, there is a red buoy slightly away from the shore.\n\nCloser to the bottom of the image, along the shoreline, are several structures that appear to be small, dark-roofed buildings. They are spread out and look to be constructed primarily from wood, typical of beach or nautical-related buildings. The land around the buildings is light colored, possibly sandy or covered with small vegetation, indicating a coastal environment.\n\nThere is also some wave action visible near the shore, creating white foam lines as waves break near the land. This suggests some interaction between the tidal movements and the shoreline structures. This might be an area used for small-scale fishing or recreational activities given its layout and proximity to water. The overall scene portrays a quiet, possibly industrial or functional section of a coastline with minimal human activity visible at the time the photo was taken.","title":"Traces of pollution on the niagara river are caused by discharge of wastes just two miles upstream from the falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["557466","556982","543298","547636","549501","552167","554057","547633","543427","542870","543362","547644","550314","552192","543088","543426"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["wave","shoreline","shore","closer","buoy","land","foam","coastline","colored","buildings"]}
