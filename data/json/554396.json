{"path":"554396.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning sunset scene. The colors in the sky range from deep reds to softer pink tones, with various gradients and hues illuminating the sky. The clouds have sharp, distinct lines and seem to stretch horizontally across the frame, creating a layered appearance.\n\nBeneath the vivid sky, you can discern the silhouette of a distant horizon, likely formed by low hills or a similar landscape feature, stretching across the entire width of the image. The horizon separates the dramatic sky from the darker, less defined foreground, emphasizing the deep, almost black colors at the base of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition presents a strong contrast between the vividness of the sky and the subdued earthy elements at the bottom, contributing to the serene and somewhat moody atmosphere of the scene. The sunset serves as the central focus of the image, dominating the viewerâ€™s attention with its rich, captivating colors and compelling cloud formations.","title":"Sunset seen from the top of Algonquin Peak, in the High Peaks region west of Lake Champlain","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["546100","552896","552335","542680","555070","552337","552895","557560","542678","547719","557497","548123","544944","552338","547352","549847"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["sunset","width","cloud","vividness","horizon","gradient","sky","base","red","bottom"]}
