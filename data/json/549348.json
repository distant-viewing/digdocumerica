{"path":"549348.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in a scientific or research activity on a boat. The setting is an expansive body of water, which can be observed in the background, enhancing the sense of being in an open ocean or sea.\n\nThe person on the left, who appears to be a young man, is actively lowering a white circular disk attached to a rope into the water. This disk is likely a Secchi disk, commonly used to measure water transparency or turbidity. He has curly hair, is shirtless, and wears a wristwatch.\n\nThe person on the right is a young woman concentrating on handling scientific apparatus that seems to be a tray with glass slides or samples, possibly for examining water samples or plankton. She wears a white t-shirt and black pants, and her hair is also dark and pulled back.\n\nBoth individuals are focused on their tasks, suggesting a serious engagement with their work. The boat's edge is visible with various other equipment and portions of other individuals visible, indicating a collaborative effort. The overall composition and activity suggest a scientific research expedition focused on marine or environmental studies.","title":"Scientific work in progress on the Adriatic Sea aboard the hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II.
