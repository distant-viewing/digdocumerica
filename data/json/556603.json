{"path":"556603.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image features an adult man standing in the foreground of a residential setting during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, judging by the soft lighting and the hint of a sunset in the background. The man is directly facing the camera, with a neutral expression and his hands slightly apart from his sides.\n\nHe is dressed in outdoors attire, specifically a dark, heavy jacket with visible button closures and what looks to be a folded collar. His hair is neatly combed, and he has a clean-shaven look, typical of the personal grooming style often seen in mid-20th century photographs.\n\nBehind him is a single-story house. The house has a brick facade at its base, with white siding or panels above the brick. A small section of snow is visible on the ground, indicating the season could be late winter or early spring. There are windows outfitted with thin white frames and a flat roof extending over a porch that spans the length visible in the image. The porch features what could be pillars or vertical supports, also finished in white, enhancing the house's tidy, suburban aesthetic.\n\nA tall, slender tree stands to the left side of the house, in line with the corner. The surrounding yard lacks lush vegetation, suggesting it could be off-season for growing, consistent with the presence of some snow. The background also hints at other residential structures or perhaps open land, but details are too minimal for a precise description. Soft, natural light bathes the scene, casting gentle shadows and giving a serene ambiance to the setting.","title":"Wayne gipson, 39, lives in this house he and his wife built near Gruetli, Tennessee, in grundy county, near Chattanooga.
