{"path":"549742.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid and dynamic moment, predominantly featuring a flock of birds in flight against a hazy, distant urban background. On the left side of the image, there is a large, heavily loaded dump truck tilting to dispense what appears to be refuse or debris onto a sprawling landfill. From the mass of rubbish, numerous birds—most likely seagulls—are rising into the air, creating a chaotic swirl of wings and motion.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly to the right, stands an individual who appears to be a male figure. He is observing or interacting with the birds, with one arm extended, perhaps gesturing or throwing something. The scene is set in an open, possibly cold environment, indicated by the bare trees and the dull winter lighting, enhancing the stark contrast between human activity and the flurry of natural life.\n\nThe skyline features indistinct buildings, possibly high rises or factory structures, shrouded in a haze that adds a slightly somber tone to the scene. This setup emphasizes themes of nature intersecting with urban expansion and human waste management, hinting at ecological considerations and the adaptability of wildlife to human-altered landscapes.","title":"Hackensack dump is feeding ground for gulls.
