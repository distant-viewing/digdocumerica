{"path":"551729.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph features a scene on the stoop and sidewalk of what appears to be an urban brownstone. Three children are seen engaged in different activities, suggesting a casual, everyday moment. \n\nOn the left side of the photo, two girls sit on the brownstone steps. The girl closest to the camera is wearing a striped pink and white T-shirt with flared jeans, and she seems to be looking thoughtfully at something out of frame. Next to her, another girl in a blue shirt and jeans sits holding a doll, providing a serene, domestic atmosphere. \n\nThe most dynamic part of the image is the girl in the center, who is standing on the sidewalk in front of the steps. She's wearing a plaid red and white jacket, flared jeans, and is dribbling a basketball, adding a sense of movement and playfulness to the scene.\n\nThe setting is marked by the rich details of the brownstone architecture, including carved stonework and the black wrought-iron fences. The stoop is adorned with a small, tidy garden and flowering plants sitting in planters on the ledge next to the stairs, contributing to the homey feel of the scene. A jacket hangs on the fence, suggesting a cool day.\n\nThis slice of life captures a tranquil and ordinary day in an urban setting, highlighting the casual and carefree moments of childhood.","title":"Small, well-cared-for gardens with wrought-iron fences adorn these houses on 3rd street near prospect park, Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552742","552761","552755","552743","556166","551130","550137","553498","553096","556175","551726","546537","545509","553497","548441","555905"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["girl","stoop","jean","sit","step","sidewalk","basketball","fence","playfulness","stonework"]}
