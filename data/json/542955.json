The deer are in the center and right of the frame, amid a landscape dotted with wildflowers and various shrubs. The one on the right appears to be moving, while the one on the left stands still and looks towards the camera. Behind them, several large evergreen trees rise prominently, contributing to a dense, richly green backdrop that suggests a forested area. The sky above is overcast, giving the lighting a soft, diffuse quality. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and natural, highlighting wildlife and their habitat.","title":"Wild deer still graze near route 101","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544114","545902","546232","553808","542963","543326","544571","549219","558368","543369","544914","545898","542959","546088","544916","543279"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","one","wildflower","habitat","wildlife","shrub","dot","move","rise","quality"]}
