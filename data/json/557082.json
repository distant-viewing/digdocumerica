{"path":"557082.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts the side view of a building, possibly a church, constructed with distinctive rough-textured stone walls. The building features tall corners made from different colored brick or stone, which are highlighted with a lighter shade, possibly to emphasize architectural elements like buttresses or ledges. A large arched window structure, which does not contain glass, is visible, suggesting elements of Gothic architecture.\n\nThe image is taken from a low angle, looking up against a clear blue sky, providing a feeling of height and majesty to the building. There are trees with green leaves overhanging slightly from the top of the frame, casting shadows on the stone facade and adding a natural element to the composition. The contrast of natural green hues against the earthy colors of the building along with the shadow play from both the trees and the building's texture enhances the image's depth.\n\nThe photograph is tinted in a way that gives a somewhat vintage or ethereal atmosphere, further accentuating the historical or time-honored feel of the architecture. The overall composition successfully conveys a perspective of reverence and tranquility, often associated with religious buildings.","title":"Exterior details of trinity episcopal church in Atchison Kansas.
