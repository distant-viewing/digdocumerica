{"path":"557959.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a large, majestic arched bridge spanning across a calm river. The bridge features double arches: one large central arch and multiple smaller arches seamlessly extending from the larger central one, creating an elegant and sophisticated design. The structure is supported by piers and the railings along the top of the bridge have round pillars, enhancing its classical appeal.\n\nBeneath the bridge, on the left side of the image, a steam locomotive is visible, emitting a plume of white and grey smoke as it perhaps prepares to cross the bridge or move alongside the riverbank. The river itself reflects the bridge and the surrounding greenery, adding a serene and picturesque quality to the scene.\n\nThe surrounding area is lush with green trees and dense foliage, indicative of a rich, natural landscape. The sky is partly cloudy with some small, fluffy clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph beautifully balances the human-made structure of the bridge with the natural elements of the river and the surrounding flora, capturing a serene and historically resonant moment.","title":"Graceful arches of the Ohio Highway 82 bridge span the Cuyahoga River as seen from Station Road near Cleveland. A steam engine powered weekend excursion train is seen at the left in the background at a point called Pinery Narrows. It gives passengers a view of the Cuyahoga Valley and part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which comprises 30,000 acres between Cleveland and Akron. The valley is the last major undeveloped land remaining between the two metropolitan areas.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548064","557096","552598","557962","557090","548087","546810","552052","549469","557969","542734","549547","543313","552064","545227","549068"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","arch","river","locomotive","pillar","appeal","flora","one","pier","plume"]}
