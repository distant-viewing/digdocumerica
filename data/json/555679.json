{"path":"555679.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a mountainous road flanked by dramatically steep cliffs. A single orange car is driving on the road, which is curving slightly to the left and is bordered by yellow center lines, enhancing the road's visibility amidst the rugged landscape.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the cliff is lush with green foliage, and parts of the rock face are exposed, showing light-colored streaks that contrast with the dense vegetation. On the right, the cliff shows more of the bare, dark rock surface, and appears almost vertical, forming a striking natural wall that shadows part of the road.\n\nAbove the scene, the sky is a clear blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, and the overall quality of light in the photograph adds to the vividness of the natural colorsâ€”greens of the vegetation and grays and whites of the rocks. There are no visible people or other vehicles besides the orange car, which draws the eye due to its bright color in contrast to the natural tones surrounding it. The presence of a white sign or marker, visible just at the curve where the car is headed, suggests attention to road safety and navigation in this potentially hazardous, though scenic, driving environment.","title":"Inside keystone canyon, looking south along the richardson highway.
