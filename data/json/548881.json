{"path":"548881.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene, primarily dominated by a powerful visual contrast between an airplane and a person on the ground. The airplane, a biplane painted in vivid red and displaying the text \"PENNZOIL\" along with \"SUPER STOKER\" on its lower wing, is captured in mid-flight against a clear blue sky. It is performing a stunt, as indicated by the thick white smoke trailing behind it which creates a dramatic effect against the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a person stands with his back to the camera, appearing in silhouette against the bright background. He holds a large flag, implying his role as a coordinator or a signaler for the flying activity. The flag, captured in motion and slightly tattered, adds a sense of urgency or festivity to the scene. The person is wearing a cap, which seems to feature some logo or text and casual attire suitable for an outdoor, possibly recreational setting.\n\nThe setting appears to be a wide-open field, minimalistic in detail, emphasizing the vastness and the open space necessary for such aerial stunts. The lower horizon line suggests a flat terrain, possibly an airfield or a similar designated area for aviation-related activities.\n\nThis composition adeptly balances human interest with action, using the positioning of the airplane and the person to guide the viewer's eye through the frame. The relatively simple elements are combined to convey a moment of suspense and excitement in what might be an air show or a practice session for aerial acrobatics.","title":"Crop duster plane and \"flag man\" near Calipatria in the Imperial Valley.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548841","542499","548883","542496","542577","542500","548485","544491","542498","542501","553873","548884","549072","544606","547247","542793"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["airplane","person","flag","biplane","text","aviation","festivity","session","urgency","excitement"]}
