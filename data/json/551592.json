{"path":"551592.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"In the photograph, there is a small transparent fish specimen illuminated against a bright, evenly lit backdrop. The fish is oriented in a horizontal position, facing to the left of the frame. Its features are clearly visible, including the eyes, fins, and internal structure, indicating it might be used for scientific or educational purposes. A human hand holding a red pen points at the fish, possibly used for scale or to indicate specific parts of the fish. The penâ€™s tip is close to the tail of the fish, drawing attention to that area. The overall composition focuses on the detail and anatomy of the fish, highlighting its translucence and delicate structure. The background is completely plain which ensures that all attention is directed toward the specimen and the pen.","title":"National water quality laboratory: severely deformed spine of the jordanella fish is result of methyl mercury in the water.
