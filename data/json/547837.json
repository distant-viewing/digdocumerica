{"path":"547837.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This is a vintage color photograph portraying a newly developed residential area. The setting features a series of identical two-story brick townhouses arranged in a neat row extending into the distance. Each townhouse has a small, patchy front lawn and a sidewalk leading to the entrance. The facades of the houses are marked by prominent brickwork, several windows, and individual doors.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a bold advertising sign standing on two wooden posts. The sign is predominantly red and yellow, emphasizing the advertisement for a \"HUGE 2 FAMILY\" residence named \"The Windsor.\" The sign offers specifics such as the presence of 8Â½ rooms, 4 bedrooms, 3 baths, a full basement, a garage, and an oversized plot. It also mentions that the residences are \"Custom Built by Master Builders\" at \"Jefferson City Estates.\"\n\nThe sky in the background is overcast, indicating either an early morning or an overcast day, which casts a soft, diffuse light over the scene, and there are no visible people, suggesting either an early stage of development or a quiet day. Overall, this photograph depicts a typical mid-20th century suburban development in America, aimed at attracting middle-class families with promises of spacious and modern living accommodations.","title":"New housing on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547945","553941","547859","552762","556601","557405","544510","547931","547433","555912","558157","553700","546035","556395","555920","557455"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["townhouse","residence","family","accommodation","specific","development","brickwork","class","sign","attract"]}
