{"path":"547004.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, picturesque scene by a waterfront, likely taken during late afternoon or early evening based on the gentle lighting. The setting sun gleams off the water’s surface, creating a sparkling effect. To the left, the silhouette of a tree drapes over the scene, framing it naturally with dangling leaves slightly obscuring the view.\n\nIn the center and right part of the image, a sturdy, weathered dock extends into the water, drawing the eye towards several fishing boats moored along its length. These boats are of various sizes and appear to be typical fishing vessels with equipment and rigging suited for commercial use.\n\nOn the right side of the dock, four children are visible; their figures backlit and reduced to silhouettes by the brilliance of the sunlight reflecting off the water. These kids, likely local to this area, are engaged in leisurely activities near the water. One child is walking on the dock, while the others are either close to the water’s edge or standing shallowly in it, suggesting playful exploration or perhaps a routine end-of-day gathering.\n\nThe ambience of this photograph is calm and somewhat nostalgic, evoking a sense of timeless community interaction with natural surroundings. Given the moored boats and presence of kids at play, the image captures both the livelihood and the lifestyle intrinsic to a fishing town or village, underscoring a close connection between the residents and their environment.","title":"Shrimp fleet belongs to a black-owned cooperative on hilton head","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["546998","550240","550776","548247","547549","543143","542872","543956","545911","547555","547556","552235","552311","544266","545055","551572"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["kid","fishing","dock","gleam","silhouette","reduce","village","rig","child","backlit"]}
