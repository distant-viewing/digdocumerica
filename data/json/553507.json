{"path":"553507.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of childlike curiosity and interaction. Four children are seen engaged together in what appears to be a playful activity on a wet street, perhaps following a rain. The children, comprising three girls and one boy, are kneeling and bending over a patch of wet leaves and small puddles along the roadside curb.\n\nThe eldest girl, with long dark hair and wearing a short-sleeve collared shirt and pants, is attentively observing something in her hand, possibly showing it to the youngest girl beside her, who seems curious and focused. Beside them, another girl in a yellow dress is also looking attentively in the same direction. The boy, standing to the right, is lightly bent forward, wearing only black shorts and appears to be speaking or interacting closely with the others.\n\nThe background includes lush greenery from overhanging trees and a residential street featuring parked cars, suggesting a quiet, suburban environment. The atmosphere conveys a tranquil yet engaging setting, emphasizing childhood exploration and interaction.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its focus on the children and a softly blurred background, draws attention to the actions and expressions of the children, underscoring the innocence and concentration in their engagement. The natural light and shadows suggest that this moment is either in the late afternoon or during a cloudy day, contributing to the overall ambiance of a peaceful, everyday childhood scene.","title":"Mulky Square area children playing in roadside trash within five blocks of the area are a park and recreation area provided by the city.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["557409","556437","551766","553510","552591","545311","552702","556287","543466","547692","555941","551857","544354","544187","556136","548488"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["girl","child","childhood","boy","innocence","puddle","curb","street","curiosity","interaction"]}
