{"path":"555037.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid close-up of natural foliage consisting primarily of green leaves and white flowers. The majority of the image features clusters of broad, dark green leaves with a slightly glossy texture that belong to a plant species known as the bunchberry (Cornus canadensis). Interspersed among the dark green leaves are delicate white flowers with four large, petal-like bracts surrounding a central cluster of smaller, brownish-purple flowers.\n\nThe image composition subtly shifts from dense foliage to a more variegated arrangement towards the right side. In this area, there are fern-like plants with thin, segmented leaves and a more varied color palette, including shades of green and some brown, hinting at decay or the natural lifecycle of the plants.\n\nDespite the rich detail and variety in plant types, there are no visible signs of human activity or man-made objects, giving the photograph a serene, untouched quality. The background is uniformly natural and dark, which accentuates the vibrancy of the leaves and the purity of the white flowers. The overall effect is a lush and tranquil snapshot of a forest floor, showcasing the beauty and complexity of the natural environment.","title":"Bunchberry growing on an ocean strip in the Pacific Coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555040","554993","554575","555093","554743","555192","553368","543615","555019","554991","555191","550459","553074","551356","554587","549230"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["leave","flower","plant","lifecycle","cluster","shift","fern","majority","foliage","petal"]}
