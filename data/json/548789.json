{"path":"548789.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a stacked array of wooden lobster traps situated on a dock. In the foreground and throughout most of the frame, you see aged, wooden traps, some appearing newer with a natural wood color, whilst others are painted white but are visibly weathered and worn. These traps are predominantly rectangular, featuring slatted construction that allows for visibility and water flow when submerged.\n\nIn addition to the detailed view of the traps, the background offers a scenic view of the ocean and a distant shoreline. Slightly off-center in the background, a clear blue sky overlooks a calm sea, leading to a coastal strip with buildings and light vegetation. The scene might be in a coastal town, judging by the small buildings and presence of a boat visible on the ocean. This photograph not only shares a glimpse of fishing equipment (specifically lobster traps) but also subtly showcases a serene maritime environment, likely indicating the economic and cultural significance of lobster fishing in the area.","title":"Traps of the lobster fishermen of tiny Conch Key are stored all over the island.
