{"path":"547142.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil sunset scene over a body of water, possibly a lake or river. The sky is dramatic and textured, filled with patchy clouds that reflect various shades of blues and purples, suggesting the time is either during twilight or dawn. The horizon shows distant silhouetted landforms—likely hills or low-lying mountains—that create a layered appearance against the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large, apparently stationary barge moored at the water's edge. The barge is dark and occupies a considerable portion of the lower right quadrant of the image, contrasting starkly with the lighter hues of the sky and water. There are no visible signs of activity on the barge, adding to the overall calmness of the scene.\n\nThe water is smooth, mirroring the sky's colors and the silhouette of the distant hills, while soft ripples suggest a gentle movement. Along the left edge and part of the center, slender, dark vegetation, likely reeds or bushes, partially obscure the view of the water, adding texture and depth to the composition.\n\nThis serene environment depicted in the photo conveys a sense of stillness and the natural beauty of a quiet evening by the water.","title":"Bass lake: year-round and vacation homes surround this small, scenic lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547110","543143","557447","552263","543613","554404","547731","552038","554759","550299","545030","552294","551215","543956","557497","543119"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["barge","patchy","water","quadrant","landform","hill","reed","calmness","low","moo"]}
