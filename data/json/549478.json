{"path":"549478.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a bustling urban cityscape, likely taken during the day given the clear visibility and lighting. The city is densely packed with numerous high-rise buildings, some of which are very modern in design, indicating it might be a financial or business district. Prominent in the foreground is a complex interchange with multiple layers of highways, showing smooth curves and ramps facilitating traffic flow. The roads are moderately busy with vehicles.\n\nSurrounding this central cluster of high rises and the highway network are more urban areas with smaller scale buildings, possibly residential or mixed-use in nature, stretching toward the outer edges of the photo. The background features a large body of water, enhancing the scenic beauty of the cityscape. On the far left, the water leads to a more sparsely populated area which might be either a suburban section or a different part of the city, containing smaller and more dispersed buildings.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph centers on the contrast between the highly developed downtown area with its skyscrapers and the intricate highway system against the more tranquil backdrop of the surrounding water and less congested parts of the city. The perspective provides a holistic view of the urban layout, emphasizing the city's infrastructure and development.","title":"Downtown Buffalo looking northeast","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["553838","546574","549476","547764","553001","547765","553559","547755","555743","553016","546678","549477","552233","546707","548392","555781"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","city","cityscape","congested","interchange","ramp","centers","rise","downtown","district"]}
