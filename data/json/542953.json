{"path":"542953.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This is a dynamic photograph capturing a motion-blurred red semi-truck towing a loaded flatbed trailer filled with large stacks of lumber. The truck is in profile view, and the photograph conveys a sense of motion, with the truck moving from the left side to the right side of the frame. The lumber on the trailer is neatly stacked and secured, extending vertically nearly as high as the top of the truck's cab.\n\nIn the foreground, positioned directly on the asphalt road, lies a large, dead fish, contrasting starkly with the urban or industrial setting. The road itself is marked with white dividing stripes, suggesting this scene might be near or at a dock or near the coast, as indicated by the presence of the fish and lumber (which might suggest nearby logging or fishing industries).\n\nThe background is blurred but appears to be an overcast sky, typical of a coastal or maritime climate. No people are visible in this photograph, focusing the viewer's attention on the juxtaposition of the moving truck and the still, unexpected presence of the dead fish on the pavement. This provides a poignant comment on industrial activity and natural elements coinciding or clashing in a shared space.","title":"Heavy trucks move lumber south to the mills.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545930","542858","542855","542854","544767","545466","555154","542780","542856","543173","547666","553628","555875","556429","544720","552077"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["lumber","truck","fish","trailer","motion","flatbed","cab","coast","asphalt","pavement"]}
