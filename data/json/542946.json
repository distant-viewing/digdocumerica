{"path":"542946.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a logging operation situated near a forest and a river. Several key elements can be observed:\n\n1. **Logs and Water**: The central feature of the image is a large, dark body of water surrounded by clusters of floating logs. These are likely organized for transport or processing.\n\n2. **Logging Infrastructure**: Adjacent to the watery log storage, there are neatly organized piles of logs on land, showcasing the scale of the logging operation. The area is well-equipped with paths that appear to allow vehicles to move around the site efficiently.\n\n3. **Vehicles and Equipment**: Various vehicles, possibly logging trucks or machinery, are parked around the site. Their presence indicates ongoing work or transportation activities.\n\n4. **Buildings and Structures**: To the right side of the photograph, there are a few buildings, possibly used for storage or as operational headquarters for the logging activity. There is also a distinctive large conical structure, which could be a burner used for disposing of wood waste.\n\n5. **Natural Surroundings**: The logging area is enveloped by dense forested hills, highlighting the proximity of the operation to natural resources. A road snakes along the edge of the forest, providing access to the site.\n\n6. **River and Farmland**: Beyond the immediate area of the logging operation, the river continues alongside patches of what seems to be farmland with several visible structures, possibly residential or farm buildings.\n\nThe composition of the photograph underscores the interaction between natural landscapes and industrial activities, showing the impact of human operations on natural resources.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542941","542921","542940","552162","545011","552198","552170","542933","550330","542944","545266","551194","552199","542945","552140","552163"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","logging","operation","resource","site","organize","burner","storage","farmland","forest"]}
