{"path":"546736.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image presents an elevated view of a bustling urban scene featuring a marina, a multi-lane roadway, and several parked cars. On the left side of the photograph, there is a marina where various boats are docked in an orderly manner. The boats vary in size and are stored both in the water and on racks. Adjacent to the marina is a paved area with several parked cars and patches of grass.\n\nDirectly in front of the marina, a road curves elegantly around it. This road is busy with multiple lanes occupied by cars in motion. The cars appear to be from the late 20th century, suggesting a vintage setting. There appear to be no traffic signals, but there are some road markings that include a pedestrian crossing. Various types of vehicles, including sedans, are visible in different colors.\n\nIn the foreground and along the sides of the roads, there are patches of grass and some trees, providing a touch of greenery to the cityscape. It's a day with clear visibility, and the overall impression is of a vibrant, active area juxtaposed with a leisurely marina setting. The point of view suggests the image was taken from a high vantage point, likely a building or a bridge overlooking this scene.","title":"Minor accident on Maine Avenue","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546853","546578","542871","548078","557450","546937","547233","548075","545128","552027","552028","545155","546877","542912","546573","557462"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["marina","road","car","crossing","rack","boat","signal","grass","marking","overlook"]}
