{"path":"544005.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene at twilight under hazy or smoggy conditions, which gives the image a subdued and almost eerie atmosphere. In the foreground, we see vehicle traffic on a multi-lane road. The image is taken from what appears to be the driverâ€™s perspective of the back of a van and other vehicles ahead, all with their headlights turned on, illuminating the road in the fading light.\n\nThe sides of the street are lined with palm trees that fade into the hazy background, adding a distinctly Southern Californian feel to the scene. Alongside the road, various commercial signs and storefronts are visible, including glowing neon signs which break through the haziness. Notably, there is a prominent retro-style signage that reads \"Pizza\" and another large sign featuring what seems to be a car dealership.\n\nThe overall feel of the photograph is somewhat ghostly due to the haze, with the lights creating small halos and the palm trees dimly silhouetted against the sky. The environment evokes a mood that suggests the time of evening when businesses are still open but traffic has thinned out, capturing a typical urban setting experiencing air pollution or fog.","title":"Dust storm after 153-day drought","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544009","544013","553021","555381","556983","552379","542682","547051","545451","550175","545352","555446","553894","546744","551239","553020"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["palm","dealership","road","halo","traffic","fake","sign","neon","retro","storefront"]}
