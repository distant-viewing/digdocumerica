{"path":"558100.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene contrasted with an element of modern infrastructure. In the foreground, there is a lush green field dotted with small, white grazing sheep. The grass appears well-kept and spreads out widely across the image. This pastoral setting is framed on the left by the dark silhouette of a large barn, which adds a rustic touch typical of rural landscapes.\n\nAdding a contrasting element to this rural idyll, in the background, a multi-tiered freeway stretches across the image. The overpasses have vehicles visible on them, including a prominent white truck or bus on the top tier, suggesting the integration of urban elements into the countryside.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears overcast, with a heavy, grey sky suggesting either early morning or approaching inclement weather. The trees surrounding the field and alongside the freeway are dense and lush, indicating a location that likely receives ample rainfall.\n\nThis scene effectively juxtaposes the serene, timeless quality of the rural farmland with the bustling, transient nature of modern vehicular movement, encapsulating a moment of coexistence between the natural and the man-made environments.","title":"Interstate highway 271 and the Ohio turnpike bridge the cuyahoga valley and river beyond horses grazing on a farm.
