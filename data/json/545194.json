{"path":"545194.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate and peaceful moment shared by two people walking along a beach at what appears to be sunset. The beach has a distinctive surface texture that features patterns of ridges and shallow pools of water, reflecting the warm glow of the evening sky. The sand around these features is dark, suggesting it may be wet and possibly of a volcanic nature.\n\nThe two individuals are closely engaged with one another, walking side by side and appearing to be in mid-conversation. They are dressed in dark, casual outdoor attire, suitable for a cool beach environment, with one of them wearing shorts and the other in trousers. Their attire and the serene setting suggest a moment of leisure after a day likely filled with outdoor activities.\n\nThe background adds a rustic charm to the scene with rocky outcrops and formations that line the edge of the beach, further enclosing this peaceful space. The sky, visible above the beach, adds to the serene and tranquil mood, painted with the colors of sunset which beautifully contrasts with the darker earth tones of the beach.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its emphasis on the parallel patterns in the sand and the inclusion of the human element, evokes a sense of companionship and the simple pleasures found in nature.","title":"Maradel and Dick Gale, environmentalists, stroll along the estuary of the Siuslaw River.
