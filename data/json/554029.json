{"path":"554029.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays an expansive agricultural landscape featuring meticulously arranged crop fields. In the foreground, there are multiple rectangular plots aligned in a grid-like pattern marked out by red dirt pathways. The crops, appearing lush and possibly in early stages of growth, cover the fields extensively, hinting at a professional, large-scale farming operation.\n\nThe color palette predominantly features shades of green from the crops, contrasting with the reddish-brown hue of the dirt paths. This orderly pattern speaks to a well-planned agricultural management system.\n\nBeyond the fields, the landscape gradually transforms into a more undulating terrain covered with patches of greenery and scattered buildings, possibly farmhouses or storage structures. The background of the image gently fades into a hilly area under a clear sky with hints of further vegetation and small structures that dot the horizon, suggesting a rural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a perspective that captures both the large-scale agriculture in the foreground and the natural, more rugged terrain in the distance, offering a comprehensive view of this farming region.","title":"Pineapple fields.
