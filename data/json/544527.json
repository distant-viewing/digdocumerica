{"path":"544527.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene by a body of water. In the foreground, there is a jagged shoreline composed of rocky, uneven terrain that appears to be made of white stone or salt accumulations. This rocky landmass extends out into the shallow water, forming a series of small inlets or coves.\n\nThe water is relatively calm, reflecting the partly cloudy sky above. The color of the water is a dull green, suggesting it might be somewhat polluted or affected by the industrial activities nearby.\n\nIn the background, the industrial setting is evident with several large structures, including a prominent building which looks like a factory or processing plant. It has a flat, box-like appearance and spans a significant area horizontally. Additional infrastructure is visible in the far background, including multiple utility poles and presumably power lines stretching across the area.\n\nThe skyline is dominated by a vast, open sky with scattered clouds, which gives a sense of expansiveness and contrasts the industrial activity below. The overall atmosphere seems desolate and largely devoid of vibrant life, focusing instead on the human-made environment and its intrusion into the natural landscape.","title":"Florida International University on U.S. 41, TaMiami Trail","placename":"Dade County (Fla.)","location":"Dade County, Florida","nn1":["546083","545854","546080","546007","551576","551998","552427","555769","548070","551559","544294","550694","552194","551959","546864","544328"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["cove","expansiveness","inlet","intrusion","landmass","salt","accumulation","water","box","factory"]}
