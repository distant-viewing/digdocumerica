{"path":"542659.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, two men are situated in what appears to be a control room filled with various technical equipment. The room has a wooden interior, accentuating a vintage or dated feel. One man, seated inside the room, is operating an array of machinery that includes dials, switches, and recording devices. He is middle-aged, with dark hair and wearing a light-colored shirt, absorbed in adjusting or monitoring the equipment.\n\nOutside, visible through a large window fitted with a metal frame, another man can be seen. He is similarly dressed and appears to be engaging with an experiment or observation which requires him to handle or adjust apparatus on the outside. This suggests a controlled environmental experiment or observation that necessitates both indoor monitoring and outdoor manipulation.\n\nThe equipment surrounding the indoor man displays various labels such as \"TEMPERATURE,\" highlighting that temperature control or monitoring is an element of the task at hand. There's also a chart recorder with a paper printout, hinting that data is being continuously monitored and recorded. The general setup suggests this photograph captures a moment in a scientific or technical research setting, possibly related to environmental sciences or engineering fields. The equipment's age and design indicate that the photograph could be from the mid to late 20th century.","title":"Research associate, Erv Mateer, in monitoring station recording results of burning tower fire.","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["549610","542765","555334","545952","549378","551900","549367","551595","552377","552356","547720","549627","552386","557317","548855","542668"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["temperature","room","experiment","control","monitoring","equipment","monitor","observation","adjust","recording"]}
