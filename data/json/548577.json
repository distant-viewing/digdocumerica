{"path":"548577.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image focuses primarily on a flag protruding from a vertical pole, set against a blurred background that suggests a street or outdoor setting. The flag is textured and slightly worn, suggesting it has been exposed to the elements. The design on the flag features simplified, black silhouetted figures of two individuals ostensibly wearing helmets, which might suggest they are engaged in some form of manual or construction work. The characters and a few abstract shapes (like rectangles or squares) are set against the flagâ€™s pale, possibly faded background.\n\nAt the top of the pole, just above the flag, is a round, red object that seems to be securely attached. This red sphere adds a spot of vivid color in contrast to the more muted tones of the flag below.\n\nThe background is out of focus, with hints of what might be parts of vehicles or other structures, painted in dull, neutral colors. This shallow depth of field emphasizes the flag in the foreground, making it the clear subject of the photograph. The overall mood is somber or muted, with a strong focus on the flag, suggesting it might have symbolical significance related to the figures depicted on it.","title":"Pennant of square-dance club flies from auto aerial at the Century Village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["545047","548225","542581","554361","557244","553175","553280","552589","556334","545881","557707","544423","557873","546817","548841","558115"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["flag","sphere","pole","figure","square","significance","helmet","character","spot","subject"]}
