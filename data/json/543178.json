{"path":"543178.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful and educational outdoor moment involving a group of people, primarily children, centered around an interactive learning experience with a marine creature. The setting appears to be outside a building with large windows, likely a school or similar institution.\n\nIn the foreground, a man with a mustache and wearing a white polo shirt is showing a large starfish to two young boys wearing scout uniforms. The boys, adorned with badges and patches indicating their scout group—number 135—are visibly excited and engaged. The boy on the left reaches out to gently touch the starfish, looking curious and cautious, while the boy on the right looks on with a smile, expressing delight and intrigue.\n\nSurrounding this central scene are several other children and likely teachers or caregivers. A boy, standing next to the scout in focus, looks over excitedly. Another woman, standing behind the man, seems to be explaining or observing the interaction. Other children in the background contribute to the scene's bustling, curious atmosphere, with some blurred in motion.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph illustrates a hands-on nature educational experience, fostering interest and excitement about marine life among young learners, set in a communal, likely educational environment.","title":"Open house at Hopkins Marine Institute (Stanford).
