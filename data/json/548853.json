{"path":"548853.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, open field with an ongoing controlled burn or wildfire. Thick white and gray smoke is billowing and spreading across the scene, obscuring parts of the landscape. The ground is covered with dry, yellowish grass, and in the area closest to the viewer, the grass appears charred and burnt, showing that the fire has passed over this section. There is visible soil and several tire tracks imprinted into the earth, indicating recent vehicle activity, perhaps by firefighters or land managers. In the background, the horizon meets a clear blue sky, creating a stark contrast between the natural blue and the unsettling smoke from the fire. The overall atmosphere suggests a controlled or natural fire management scenario rather than a chaotic emergency, as there are no visible firefighting efforts or personnel in the immediate view.","title":"Burning the straw clears the field in 25 minutes, and enables the farmer to plant another crop.
