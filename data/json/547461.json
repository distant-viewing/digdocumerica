{"path":"547461.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and powerful scene of a sailing boat navigating through rough waters. The boat, tilted at a dramatic angle due to strong winds and high waves, is predominantly visible on the right side of the frame.\n\nThe hull of the boat is dark-colored, possibly a deep navy or black, which contrasts strikingly against the white of the sails and the churning blue-gray sea. The sails are fully unfurled and billowing, indicating a strong wind, and the boat cuts through the water creating large sprays and splashes, some of which reach back as far as the stern.\n\nThe American flag is visible at the stern, fluttering vigorously in the breeze, adding a vivid splash of red, white, and blue to the scene.\n\nThere appears to be at least two crew members visible on deck, though they are partially obscured by the boat's structure and the sprays of water. They seem to be actively managing the boat's navigation, likely adjusting rigging or handling other sailing equipment to maintain control amidst the challenging conditions.\n\nThe background is a blurred hint of the horizon, barely distinguishable through the mist and spray, emphasizing the isolation of the boat in the vast, turbulent sea. The overall mood conveyed is dynamic and somewhat tense, highlighting the skill and bravery required to sail under such conditions.","title":"On Chesapeake Bay, a stiff breeze and choppy waters give crews plenty of","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549394","547463","549404","547456","549405","549388","549426","544667","549421","549433","547449","549434","547457","549392","547448","549435"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","spray","sailing","sail","splash","wind","sea","navy","skill","rigging"]}
