{"path":"549920.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph appears to capture a busy urban scene, possibly taken in the 1970s or 1980s judging by the styles of the vehicles visible. It's an overhead view of a plaza leading into what seems to be an entrance to an underground parking or possibly a tunnel, flanked by buildings on all sides.\n\nDirectly in the center is a large rectangular building with no visible windows, presenting a plain, unadorned façade which suggests it could be a utility structure or part of the transportation infrastructure. Beneath this building is the entrance to the dark opening which is the focal point for the vehicles.\n\nThe plaza is paved with bricks and organized with a series of orange traffic cones forming a lane that directs the vehicles towards the tunnel entrance. There are various types of vehicles in view, including sedans, station wagons, and a lighter colored convertible. The majority of the vehicles are in a queued formation, appearing to wait their turn to enter the tunnel, while a few are positioned as if they've just exited.\n\nThe surrounding architecture hints at a mix of old and new, with older, ornate buildings visible to the left side of the frame, featuring arched windows and detailed façades, contrasting with the plain style of the central structure.\n\nThe sky overhead is slightly overcast, diffusing the daylight evenly, which casts soft shadows and suggests an early morning or late afternoon timeframe. There are no visible people, focusing the entire scene on urban infrastructure and vehicle movement. \n\nThis photograph provides a snapshot of city life, focused on transportation and architectural elements, capturing a moment of everyday routine within an urban landscape.","title":"Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546743","555782","556195","556681","553893","549310","549919","556194","543961","556709","548318","547651","546716","553721","542682","553019"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["tunnel","vehicle","entrance","plaza","façade","transportation","timeframe","judging","cone","infrastructure"]}
