{"path":"550735.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene lake scene captured in a dusky or overcast lighting that contributes to a muted, purple-blue color palette. The water surface is calm and vast, speckled with small patches of what appear to be water lilies or some other type of floating vegetation. These natural elements are spread sparsely across the water, adding texture and focal points to the expansive water body.\n\nIn the distance, a tree-lined shore is visible, creating a hazy silhouette against the lighter sky. The outlines of the trees and the landscape are soft and indistinct, suggesting a considerable distance or perhaps a foggy condition. Above the shoreline, the sky takes on a gradient, transitioning from a dark, bluish hue near the horizon to a lighter tone at the top of the frame.\n\nThe overall mood of the picture is peaceful and somewhat melancholic, evoked by the gentle distribution of natural elements and the soft, subdued colors. This tranquil scene likely conveys the quiet beauty of a twilight or an overcast day at a secluded lake.","title":"Sludge floats on the Androscoggin River above Gulf Island Dam at Lewiston, Maine's chief textile center.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["554405","550745","554752","550493","552319","557572","543577","557570","550746","550775","543611","557021","552336","551207","550389","547127"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","lake","distribution","water","gradient","twilight","distance","subdue","float","outline"]}
