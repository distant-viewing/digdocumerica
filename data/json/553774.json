{"path":"553774.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph showcases a picturesque coastal landscape. The scene captures a winding road that traces its way along a rugged coastline, characterized by dramatic cliffs and rock formations. The rock appears dark and layered, shaped by erosion, suggesting a volcanic geology typical of oceanic islands. The coastal road curves gently along the contour of the terrain, with cars visible along the road, illustrating its use as a scenic route.\n\nThe deep blue ocean spans the right hand of the image, contrasting sharply with the stark, dark rocky coastline. The waves are breaking against the cliffs, creating white foam, suggesting a strong ocean current or wind in this area. Farther off in the horizon, the ocean meets a mostly clear sky, with a few light clouds near the horizon line, indicating fair weather.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the interaction between human infrastructure, represented by the road and vehicles, and the natural, rugged beauty of the coastline. The photograph evokes a sense of isolation and the raw natural beauty found in such untouched environments.","title":"Part of a conservation zone along Highway 72.
