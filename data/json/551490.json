{"path":"551490.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph is set in an urban environment, capturing a scene of a man watering plants. He is focused on tending to a large, round concrete planter which is filled with lush, pink geraniums. The man appears to be in his middle years and is dressed in a light striped short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers, suggesting a casual or working attire.\n\nThe planter is positioned on a sidewalk, and behind it, a series of granite bollards connected by black metal chains lines the edge of the walkway, defining a boundary between the pedestrian area and the street. The background shows elements typical of a city street, including architectural facades of buildings with arched entryways, street signs, and other pedestrians in the distance.\n\nLighting in the photo suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, providing a soft illumination to the scene which enhances the serene activity of watering plants amidst the urban setting. The overall composition of the photograph brings attention to the contrast between the natural beauty of the flowers and the hard urban environment.","title":"The city of Minneapolis Dept. of Public Works has a maintenance crew who work exclusively on Nicollet Mall.
