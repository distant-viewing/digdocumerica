{"path":"553822.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene, likely a busy street setting. The image is characterized by its vibrant yet blurred movement, conveying the hustle and energy of the location.\n\nIn the foreground, two people are prominent, though their features are blurred due to motion. One individual is dressed in a bright yellow head covering and a red, patterned top, while the other is wearing a grayish coat. The blurred effect on these figures suggests rapid movement, as if they are quickly passing by the camera.\n\nThe background is crowded with numerous other individuals, all appearing to be pedestrians. The crowd varies in terms of clothing style, suggesting a diverse set of people. Some individuals in the background can be seen more clearly, wearing coats and various styles of attire, which hints at a cool weather setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is somewhat dim, emphasizing the colors and lights from the urban surroundings, like street lights or reflections from windows. Buildings that line the street are seen in the upper part of the photograph, suggesting a downtown area filled with commercial or business establishments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its central focus on the moving figures and a bustling background, vividly portrays the dynamic flow and the somewhat chaotic but lively pulse of an urban environment.","title":"In front of Macy's department store in Midtown Manhattan (from the sites exhibition.
