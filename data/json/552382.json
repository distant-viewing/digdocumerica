{"path":"552382.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene focused primarily from an interior point of view, likely from within a vehicle or a compartment that appears to be technical in nature, given the presence of various equipment and wiring.\n\nIn the foreground and taking up a central position in the image is a male figure who is somewhat out of focus but prominently features the lower half of his face and glasses. His expression seems contemplative or focused. This man appears to be interacting with or adjusting equipment or machinery that includes wiring and possibly controls or instruments, as suggested by the presence of metallic structures and dials.\n\nThe man's hand is in focus, positioned at the very forefront of the image, manipulating a component or perhaps in the motion of pointing or touching part of the machinery.\n\nTo the man's left (the viewer's right) and slightly out of focus is another individual, whose face is partially visible as he looks on towards the action or the central male figure. This secondary person adds a layer of depth, indicating either cooperation or supervision.\n\nBeyond these figures and viewed through what looks to be a window or glass partition, there is another male figure standing outdoors, distant yet visible against a backdrop that seems open and sprawling, possibly a tarmac or outdoor clearing, suggesting an industrial or experimental setup. This outdoor figure wears a cap and has a serious demeanor, contributing to the overall industrious and potentially experimental atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe interior is illuminated with a soft, natural light filtering through the window, highlighting the details of the interior space and contributing to a somewhat ethereal or reflective quality to the image. The composition cleverly uses depth of field to emphasize the foreground actions while still integrating the background characters and setting into the narrative frame of the photograph.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549364","542765","555332","549367","557851","547720","549627","555334","549684","556771","557859","556557","551463","557867","557855","546036"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["figure","action","partition","tarmac","cooperation","face","pointing","machinery","glass","dial"]}
