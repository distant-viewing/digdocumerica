{"path":"554218.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively outdoor setting at a ski resort, likely taken during a lunch break given the presence of food and beverage on the tables. Several individuals, possibly skiers or snowboarders, are gathered around wooden picnic tables. They are bundled up in winter sports attire including jackets, hats, and goggles, suggesting a cold environment. The tables are scattered with remnants of a meal; there are disposable cups, plates with leftover food, and various personal items such as gloves and sunglasses.\n\nIn the background, there is a snowy landscape with trees and a bright blue sky indicating a clear day. A prominent red snowcat vehicle is visible behind the gathering, which is typically used for grooming snow on ski slopes. The people are engaged in conversations, adding a social and relaxed atmosphere to the setting. Most individuals seem to be adults enjoying their time, contributing to an overall casual and friendly mood in the scene.","title":"Outdoor lunch, halfway up snowmass mountain, at about 10,000 feet","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554273","554269","554277","554237","554221","554265","554276","554228","554235","554262","554216","550017","554238","554234","554267","554242"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["table","food","goggles","gather","lunch","bundle","skier","beverage","resort","meal"]}
