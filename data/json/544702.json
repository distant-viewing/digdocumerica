{"path":"544702.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, possibly a mining or extraction site. There are significant industrial structures in the background, including a long, elevated conveyor belt system supported by metal trusses, seemingly used for transporting materials. Adjacent to this is a silo-like structure and various other industrial facilities which contribute to a busy industrial skyline.\n\nThe foreground features a canal or ditch filled with water that reflects the striking red and white hues, indicative of possible chemical runoff or pollution. The banks of the canal are lined with what appears to be salt or mineral deposits in white and pink, highlighting environmental impact. The vegetation on the banks, mostly tall grasses, is sparse and dry, suggesting the area might be suffering from the industrial activities.\n\nThe photograph captures the sharp contrast between the natural environment and human industrialization, possibly aiming to emphasize the environmental side effects of industrial processes. The overall composition uses leading linesâ€”the canal draws the eye through the scene, from the foreground to the industrial structures in the back, creating a visual narrative about cause and effect. The lighting suggests it was taken during late afternoon, as the long shadows and golden hue suggest a setting sun, adding a serene yet somewhat foreboding atmosphere to the setting.","title":"Industry has changed the face of the San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["543642","544036","552427","546055","544037","554763","554764","549168","545996","544044","555591","545992","551612","549965","543169","543815"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["canal","bank","ditch","runoff","effect","truss","industrialization","salt","deposit","extraction"]}
