{"path":"552750.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a gritty urban scene, likely depicting a lower-income neighborhood. It shows a street and vacant lot strewn with debris and disarray. The setting is dense with aged and tightly packed residential brick buildings, some adorned with graffiti. The vacant lot is particularly cluttered with rubbish, overgrown vegetation, and appears unkempt, with an old car abandoned amidst the trash.\n\nTo the right side of the image, two individuals, both bending over, are either searching through items on the ground or moving them. It's unclear whether they are scavenging, cleaning, or perhaps involved in some other activity. The foreground of the image shows three wooden desks or stands aligned in a row on the pavement, contributing to the sense of disorder and abandonment in the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat somber and bleak, highlighted by the overcast sky and shadows, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. This environment reflects themes of neglect, urban decay, and the socio-economic challenges that are often present in such settings.","title":"Abandoned car in trash-strewn lot","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550264","549785","557345","549786","550253","547775","552757","552969","550246","549784","552102","556640","549958","557350","547921","546854"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["lot","income","disorder","cleaning","disarray","desk","challenge","pavement","trash","neighborhood"]}
