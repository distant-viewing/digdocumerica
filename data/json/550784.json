{"path":"550784.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of a sunlit pond surrounded by lush forest. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as the light is soft and diffused, with a low sun that creates shimmering reflections on the water.\n\nForeground Detail:\nIn the foreground, tall grasses and aquatic plants are silhouetted against the water. Their dark outlines create a textured border at the bottom edge of the image, enhancing its naturalistic feel.\n\nWater:\nThe pond itself is mostly covered with what appears to be a layer of lily pads or a similar type of floating foliage, which adds texture and variation in shape across the surface. Sunlight reflects off parts of the water, creating a pattern of light and dark patches that suggest the gentle movement of the water's surface.\n\nBackground:\nThe background shows dense trees that form a consistent dark line under a bright sky, hinting at a thick forest surrounding the pond. The trees are silhouetted against the sky, emphasizing the isolation and tranquility of this natural setting.\n\nOverall Composition:\nThe composition uses the contrast between light and shadow effectively, drawing attention to the reflective quality of the water and the intricate details of the plants. It evokes a sense of peace and stillness, typical of a secluded natural landscape. The use of natural light and shadow plays a significant role in creating the mood and atmosphere of the scene.","title":"From the confluence of swamps like this, and many lakes, the Wisconsin river rises in the northeastern part of the state","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550389","543561","546963","554753","554591","550775","547536","543611","554603","554623","551352","550750","554776","555229","553465","553410"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pond","silhouet","pads","water","forest","create","peace","sunlit","plant","shimmer"]}
