{"path":"553137.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a river dam and its surroundings in vivid detail. The main subject is a concrete dam structure with several wide, rectangular spillways through which frothy white water is gushing. The dam platform is reinforced by substantial concrete buttresses and is equipped with a metal railing on its right edge, and supports a road or pathway that runs along the top.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the descending water is creating a turbulent flow that transitions into a smoother, rapid stream as it moves right across the photograph. Rocky outcrops and debris can be seen near the water on the left, which might suggest recent high water levels or rough water conditions.\n\nThe background offers a picturesque landscape of tree-covered banks opposite the dam which eventually give way to a more barren, rolling hillside. The color palette of the distant hills shifts from the lush greens of the riverbank to muted earth tones, dominated by shades of brown and hints of sparse vegetation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is structured to lead the viewer's eye along the journey of the water from the dam spillways across to the natural terrain beyond, illustrating a stark contrast between the human-made structure and the natural environment. The photograph has a sense of tranquility despite the dynamic movement of water, framed by the stability of the concrete dam and the serene, natural landscape.","title":"Derby Dam on the Truckee River is one of the facilities in the Newlands Irrigation Project.","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["550654","549486","553349","544166","548003","553372","548016","553136","548150","550701","549004","553654","548007","548940","549497","553828"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","spillway","water","stability","outcrop","journey","descend","shift","hillside","stream"]}
