{"path":"548950.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a rural agricultural scene focused on modern farming activities. In the foreground, there is a lush green field, filled with what appears to be crops in early stages of growth, possibly small leafy plants. This field is sprinkled with water droplets indicative of recent irrigation.\n\nIn the middle of the scene, there's a red farm implement towed by a blue tractor, operating on the field. The tractor is moving away from the viewpoint, partially shown, with only its rear and part of the side visible. The driver on the tractor is dressed in typical farming attire and seems focused on their task.\n\nBehind the tractor, a large irrigation system is actively watering the field, creating an impressive arc of water spray that splendidly catches the light. This irrigation equipment seems to be on wheels, allowing it to be moved across the field efficiently.\n\nThe background exhibits a contrast between the greenery of the fields and the stark, barren rolling hills. No vegetation is visible on these distant hills, highlighting the agricultural development in the foreground. The scene suggests it is a sunny day with clear blue skies, supporting the activities depicted.\n\nOverall, this image effectively showcases agricultural practices involving irrigation and crop cultivation in a rural setting, emphasizing the technology and equipment used in modern farming.","title":"Irrigating an alfalfa field on an experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548869","548991","548877","548875","543650","546825","548820","545893","546949","553432","557521","548898","553652","554204","544888","554202"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","tractor","field","farming","crop","arc","cultivation","droplet","equipment","spray"]}
