{"path":"543366.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring a group of horseback riders in a natural setting. There are three riders visible, each mounted on a horse. From left to right: the first horse is a dark color, ridden by someone wearing blue attire; the middle horse is a lighter (possibly gray or white) color, ridden by someone in brown and black clothing; the last horse, partially visible, appears to be a chestnut or similar warm tone, with a rider in a red jacket.\n\nThe riders are traversing a meadow-like area filled with tall grass and vibrant wildflowers, mostly yellow in color, which add a vivid contrast to the lush greenery. The backdrop is densely packed with rich, dark green trees, which contributes to a sense of depth and seclusion in a forested area. The lighting suggests it could be late morning or early afternoon, as the sunlight filters through the canopy, casting mottled shadows and illuminating parts of the riders and the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of this photograph, with its focus on the casual and leisurely activity of horseback riding through a verdant, sunlit meadow, evokes a peaceful and idyllic rural setting. The image uses natural light effectively to highlight the beauty of both the environment and the moment.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["557992","554690","557988","543841","557781","553102","544414","544308","552501","548987","554885","553116","544362","543726","542622","551229"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["rider","horse","horseback","ride","meadow","traverse","seclusion","wildflower","gray","canopy"]}
