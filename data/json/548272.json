{"path":"548272.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph presents a dynamic street scene captured from the inside of a vehicle, possibly a bus or larger transport, looking out onto a busy urban environment which recalls the bustling, crowded streets of an American city like New York in the 1970s.\n\nThe focal point of the image is the interior cab area of the vehicle, where a man sits at the driver's seat, shown in profile. He has a short, dark hairstyle and is smiling mildly, looking slightly off to the side. In his hands, he holds onto the steering wheel covered with what appears to be a lighter colored steering wheel cover. The dashboard in front of him features a few visible dials and indicators. \n\nTo the right of the driver, through the vehicle's front windshield and side windows, one can see a vibrant street scene that includes a variety of vehicles. A prominent yellow car, evocative of the iconic New York City taxis, is visible. There are also other vehicles, including a white van and a delivery truck with \"BARGA\" written on its side, indicating it could possibly be used for transporting goods or services. The architecture of high-rise buildings serves as a backdrop to this street-level commotion, typical of a dense urban setting. \n\nThe image also depicts several pedestrians and a crosswalk, suggesting a busy intersection. Visible signs, like \"GIMBELS\" on a building in the background, hint at the commercial nature of the neighborhood, pointing to retail and possibly department store settings typical of mid-century American cityscapes.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its mix of movement, urban architecture, and the momentary glance of the driver, captures an ordinary yet compelling moment of city life, highlighting the hustle and bustle and the varied elements that define urban living.","title":"A frustrated driver sits through a traffic jam in herald square","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","546652","549848","549869","549859","555782","548410","556802","549882","556803","548331","554314","549849","556752","554329","549853"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["driver","steering","vehicle","street","wheel","transport","indicator","glance","inside","dashboard"]}
