{"path":"549797.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a large bulldozer operating on top of a massive heap of garbage. The setting appears to be a landfill or waste management facility. The bulldozer, which is positioned at the upper center part of the image, is partially obscured by the uneven, jagged pile of trash it is moving. It is colored a dark, dull hue, blending slightly with its surroundings while still being distinctly mechanical against the chaotic organic waste.\n\nThe landfill itself is composed of mixed debris, with various elements like plastic bags, metal pieces, and unidentifiable refuse contributing to a multicolored yet predominantly dark mound. There is a visible emission of dust or smoke around the area where the bulldozer is working, suggesting the movement of the bulldozer is stirring up the waste and potentially releasing gases or fine particles into the air.\n\nThe background is relatively indistinct due to the haze and dust, but it enhances the sense of isolation of the scene to just the activity occurring at the landfill. The lighting in the photograph creates high contrast, emphasizing the rugged texture of the trash heap and the grim atmosphere of the environment.","title":"At Staten Island landfill.
