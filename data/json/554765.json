{"path":"554765.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a large-scale industrial mining area. The scenery is expansive, showing numerous piles of excavated earth with varying shades of yellow, orange, and grey, forming a rough, textured terrain. A winding dirt road cuts through the landscape, enhancing the sense of depth and scale.\n\nIn the center and lower parts of the image, there are several trucks and industrial vehicles, some possibly for transportation and others likely involved in excavation activities. The presence of these vehicles suggests ongoing operations within the site.\n\nTowards the right-center, there is an excavator with its arm extended, indicating it's either in the process of digging or is paused between actions. Surrounding this machinery are larger mounds of earth, likely recently moved or about to be processed.\n\nThe background features a sparse tree line, relatively bare, suggesting either a seasonal view or the environmental impact of the mining operation. Beyond the immediate industrial scene, the landscape gently rises into low hills, where a few distant buildings and structures can be seen, possibly related to this industrial operation or nearby residential areas.\n\nThe sky is mostly clear, save for a few thin clouds, casting natural light that highlights the contours and hollows created by the mining activity, enhancing the ruggedness of the terrain. This setting communicates a robust industrial activity, likely centered around resource extraction, set in a rural or semi-rural locale where such operations might dominate the local landscape and economy.","title":"Mile after mile of land has been stripped of vegetation and eaten away by gigantic coal shovels.
