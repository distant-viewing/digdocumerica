{"path":"550518.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic natural landscape dominated by rugged mountains. The scene is captured from a high vantage point, looking down on a complex terrain. The mountains, which occupy the upper two-thirds of the frame, have steep, jagged ridges and are partially covered with snow that highlights their contours. A significant amount of the mountains and slopes is also covered with dense greenery, suggesting these are forested areas.\n\nIn the foreground, a winding, silty river cuts through the valley, creating a striking contrast with the dense forest around it. The river appears to be swollen, possibly due to melting snow from the mountains, and has multiple channels that merge and diverge, creating a braided pattern on the landscape. Its color is a mix of gray and light brown, indicating high sediment content.\n\nThe photograph conveys a sense of rugged wilderness and untouched natural beauty, typical of remote mountainous regions. The overall lighting in the image is soft, likely due to overcast weather, which casts gentle shadows and enhances the textural details of both the forest and the snow-covered mountain peaks. The composition draws the viewer's eye from the twisting river in the foreground up through the tree-covered slopes to the rocky, snow-tipped peaks in the distance.","title":"Peak 6050 stands above the Dietrich River.
