{"path":"554043.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a male figure who is seated on a high platform, typically indicative of a heavy-duty operational setting possibly in construction or similar fieldwork. The man is donned in protective gear, consisting of a hard-shell headgear with a full-face visor, suggestive of a safety measure against potential hazards. This headgear resembles a helmet that might be used in motorsport or other high-risk activities, which is quite detailed and covers the entire face and neck.\n\nThe individual also wears a distinctive armor-like vest, which is bulky and padded, providing further safety against injuries. His attire is completed by a pair of dark pants and rugged shoes, emphasizing readiness for a physically demanding environment.\n\nHe is surrounded by industrial components: there are visible hydraulic or mechanical parts near him, including what appears to be hoses and steel frameworks, which are a part of the machinery or the structure on which he is seated. An interesting detail in the image is a cache of numerous white tubes or rods bundled and standing upright next to him, hinting at the materials involved in his work process.\n\nThe background of the photograph is minimal and blurred, focusing attention on the man and his immediate environment. The overall setting, combined with the man's outfit and the industrial elements, suggests a scene from a specialized operation requiring significant precautions and specialized equipment.","title":"Heavy equipment used in planting sugarcane, Maui's chief agricultural product.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["546041","546032","544171","556391","553610","544835","555263","554953","556320","556867","556447","556866","553618","547163","556315","542497"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["headgear","safety","precaution","hazard","bundle","fieldwork","readiness","don","shell","tube"]}
