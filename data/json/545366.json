{"path":"545366.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a relatively old, ornately designed church during what seems to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, dim lighting and the visible sky colors behind the structure. The church features two symmetrical pointed towers, each topped with a simple cross and housing arched, louvered bell openings. The central section between the towers has a triangular pediment topped with another cross.\n\nThe facade of the church is finished in a muted, earthy tone, possibly adobe, enhancing its rustic appearance. The main entrance has a prominent, yet simple double door painted in a light blue, which stands out against the building's subdued color. Above the door, a small circular window adds a decorative element to the otherwise stark facade.\n\nThe ground in front of the church is barren and appears to be a dirt surface, devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the possibly arid location of the church. No people are visible in the image, focusing all attention on the architectural features and the serene, somewhat solemn atmosphere created by the lighting and setting of the photograph.","title":"Our Lady of Sorrows Church, which dates from 1853.
