{"path":"550172.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial setting dominated by large structures and significant pollution. A prominent feature in the image is a tall smokestack emitting a dense, voluminous plume of white smoke that billows into the sky, contrasting starkly against a grimy atmosphere. The background reveals a series of additional smokestacks and industrial buildings, some obscured by the smoke.\n\nForeground elements include multiple electrical and telegraph poles, crisscrossed with an array of wires that span across the view, adding a sense of depth and complexity to the composition. A structured, possibly metallic, bridge is seen at the front, likely serving either as a railway or support structure, which further enhances the industrial theme.\n\nThe overall color tone is muted with a bluish-grey cast, typical of overcast light conditions or pollution. The atmosphere is gritty, clearly implying a heavy industrial zone possibly engaged in manufacturing or energy production. The silhouette and outlines of the structures are softened by the haze of emissions and mist, reflecting environmental impact concerns.","title":"Republic Steel's smoking chimney leads all the rest.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550181","550981","550176","550982","550185","546884","545447","550983","557218","550168","551054","550177","548376","548321","550998","551026"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","pollution","smoke","mute","soften","crisscross","production","emission","concern","billow"]}
