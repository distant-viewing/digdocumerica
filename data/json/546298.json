{"path":"546298.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of a man in a natural, outdoor setting. The man is standing thigh-deep in a body of clear, calm water that reflects the blue sky. He is focused on an activity involving a yellow bucket that he holds in his right hand, and his posture suggests he is either collecting something from the water or examining its contents.\n\nHe is dressed in a vertically striped, short-sleeve shirt that is unbuttoned at the top, and his outfit includes clashing swim shorts with a checked pattern. The man wears a white hat, which appears functional for sun protection, styled similarly to a cap but with a fuller brim.\n\nThe background features a clear sky with a few scattered clouds and a blur of low, dense vegetation, likely a type of marshland, which lines the distant horizon. This natural scenery suggests a serene and relatively isolated location, conducive to the contemplative activity depicted. His reflection is visible in the water, adding a symmetrical aesthetic element to the composition.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory biologist on a field trip to a salt marsh area.
