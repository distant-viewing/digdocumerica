{"path":"553534.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a young woman seated on the step of a doorway inside a building. The setting gives off a moody and dim ambiance. The woman is dressed in a dark jacket and lighter colored pants, sitting with one leg crossed over the other. She sports dark boots and has her hands placed lightly on her knee.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears aged and weathered. The walls are textured and painted in a faded, dark color, contributing to the overall somber tonality of the image. On the right side, there’s a partially visible window that illuminates the scene with natural light, showing a glimpse of the exterior, possibly some greenery or trees.\n\nThe woman looks contemplatively to her right, towards unseen elements outside of the frame, giving an impression of deep thought or introspection. The photograph uses natural lighting which creates shadows and highlights that enhance the thoughtful atmosphere. The overall composition utilizes the doorway to frame the subject, leading the viewer’s eye directly to her, emphasizing her expression and pose within the isolated environment.","title":"Billy Watkins, one of nine children in a biscuit worker's family, broods on the stairs of their Mulky Square house.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553503","553501","551448","553156","553532","546558","548232","545373","546474","546564","546479","544437","557842","549290","547175","546667"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["doorway","woman","introspection","knee","highlight","thought","boot","step","leg","exterior"]}
