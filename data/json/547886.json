{"path":"547886.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features an American flag prominently positioned in the upper right corner, fluttering against a vivid blue sky with a small cloud visible in the background. The flag is captured in such a way that some of the stars and stripes are clearly visible, creating a strong patriotic feel.\n\nBeneath the flag, the image shows the front of a shop named \"Bernie's Bait and Tackle,\" which specializes in sporting goods, as evident from the signage. There are multiple signs, one large sign on the left and one on the building itself. The large sign is painted with big, bold letters announcing \"Bernie's Bait and Tackle,\" and below that, smaller text states \"Sporting Goods.\" Adjacent, another sign indicates that the shop offers \"Fishing Tackle & Custom Rods.\" The style of the signs suggests a somewhat rustic and traditional business, potentially appealing to fishing enthusiasts and outdoor sports aficionados.\n\nThe shop appears to be a small, one-story structure with an extension that contains more signage. The front fa√ßade of the shop has a rugged look, possibly due to weathering or the chosen aesthetic to suit the nature of the business. The area looks quiet without any visible pedestrians or street activity, focusing the viewer's attention on the shop and the flag. The overall composition tells a story of local commerce and American culture, centered on traditional outdoor activities like fishing.","title":"Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551079","542581","542812","552589","545047","554361","544373","554184","557873","546778","550114","548225","545154","552513","552654","548577"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["shop","flag","sign","signage","business","fishing","choose","announce","specialize","story"]}
