{"path":"548492.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a park or recreational area. An individual is standing on a ladder leaning against a tree, apparently engaged in maintenance or inspecting the tree. The person is dressed casually with a blue jacket, maroon pants, and appears to be focused on the task at hand. This setting seems to include typical park amenities such as open fields and possibly play equipment, suggested by the partial view of what may be a slide and a bucket placed on the ground nearby holding either tools or materials.\n\nIn the background, there's a wide-open space fenced off, likely for sports or as a safety measure for a construction site, hinting that this might be a multi-use public area. Beyond the fence, residential buildings and industrial structures can be observed, suggesting that this park is situated in an urban or suburban setting. The setting is further underscored by the presence of factory-like buildings with visible chimneys, contributing to a feeling of an area that blends residential, recreational, and industrial uses. The overall atmosphere is serene and busy, with clear skies, suggesting it might be a pleasant day for outdoor activities.","title":"Child looks over construction of airlines food services building from top of slide.
