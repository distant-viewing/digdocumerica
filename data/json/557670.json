{"path":"557670.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph presents a pastoral scene featuring a variety of elements suggestive of rural or country life. In the foreground, there is a small, lush green lawn with a noticeable young tree centrally located, possibly a small fruit tree. The middle ground is dominated by a dark-colored vintage car, likely dating from the 1940s or 1950s, parked on the grass. \n\nBehind the car is a quaint wooden house with a hexagon-shaped roof and a large covered porch, adorned with what appears to be outdoor furniture. To the right of this house, there is a large, white propane tank adjacent to the structure, indicating reliance on propane for heating or cooking. Beyond the main house, partially hidden by foliage, there is a mobile home or trailer, suggesting additional living space or storage capability on the property.\n\nOn the far right, a second, older vehicle, possibly a truck, is barely visible through the trees. It adds to the sense of an active, utilitarian residence where vehicles and equipment are essential parts of daily life.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes mature trees which frame the scene and a slightly hilly terrain that extends into the background, along with a clear sky overhead hinting at good weather. This setting creates a serene and functional environment, characteristic of a rural homestead.","title":"Home on river street, half a block south of main street shops in helen, Georgia, near robertstown.
