{"path":"546419.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene featuring a well-dressed man walking along a sidewalk. The architectural surroundings suggest an older building style; the facade visible in the image has classical detailing. There are several ornate columns supporting an intricate entablature that adorns the doorway of the building, featuring decorative motifs and carved figures. The columns are fluted with Corinthian capitals, adding to the classical aesthetic of the architecture.\n\nThe building itself is constructed of red bricks, with the doorway highlighted by a bright, contrasting paint around its frame. It appears to be an entrance to a significant or formal building, possibly a bank, municipal building, or a similar establishment, given the grandeur of the entryway.\n\nThe man in the photograph is dressed in a dark suit and is captured mid-stride, which suggests motion. His attire and briefcase indicate he could be a professional or businessman going about his daily routine. The sunlight casts his long shadow on the sidewalk, also lighting up the building and enhancing the textures of the architectural elements.\n\nThe street is relatively devoid of other people, focusing the viewer's attention on the single pedestrian and the architectural details. The time period could be mid-20th century judging by the style of the clothing and the overall color quality and composition of the photograph.","title":"Formerly the old irwin bank (1881), this structure was Renovated and is now an office building","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546423","550130","550118","547816","556733","550136","547820","543037","553537","546495","547280","557635","546493","550114","551778","546506"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["doorway","column","sidewalk","building","briefcase","capital","entryway","bright","motif","go"]}
