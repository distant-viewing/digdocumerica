{"path":"544937.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a view through a rectangular opening barred with irregular wooden rods, creating a window effect inside a cave-like structure. The perspective from which the image is taken provides a sense of looking out from darkness into a naturally lit space. \n\nThe cave's rugged interior walls appear to be composed of layered sedimentary rock with a warm color palette ranging from beige to deep red. Light from the exterior filters into the cavern, highlighting the texture of the rocks and a section of wall that has been smoothed and decorated with geometric patterns in white and black paint, adding an element of historical or cultural significance to the space.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on natural elements, textured rock surfaces, and evidence of human modification or habitation, suggests an environment that is both ancient and isolated. The wooden bars on the window blend primitive architecture with function, adding a hint of containment or protection within this serene yet austere setting.","title":"Cliff palace - first major indian ruins discovered in the mesa verde","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["543756","545567","544945","545554","551359","551358","545584","544919","555047","556521","545550","545825","556398","544952","545305","550481"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["cave","rock","austere","containment","deep","modification","wall","protection","bar","opening"]}
