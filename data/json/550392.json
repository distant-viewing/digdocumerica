{"path":"550392.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a landscape featuring a sinuous river cutting through primarily flat terrain. The river dominates the central portion of the image, its dark waters clearly discernible against the surrounding land. The shores of the river display various shades of brown, suggesting either mud or sandbanks that contrast with the darker aquatic color.\n\nAdjacent to the river, on both sides, the terrain is a patchwork of various shades of brown and green, possibly indicating different types of vegetation or land use. The patchwork pattern suggests agricultural activity with varying crop types or stages of growth, as evidenced by the irregular shapes and sizes of the plots.\n\nThe upper right of the image, beyond the landscape intercepted by the river, shows what appears to be a larger body of water, hinting that this river could be a tributary. Throughout the image, there are faint traces of smaller paths or roads crisscrossing the area, connecting plots and providing access to the water.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, taken from a significant altitude, offers a broad perspective on this geographic area, highlighting the interaction between waterways and human land use, as well as the natural shaping of the landscape by the river dynamics.","title":"Patterned ground shows ice polygons (lattice outlines) and typical summer arctic tundra.
