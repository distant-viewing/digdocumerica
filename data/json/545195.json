{"path":"545195.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a lone figure walking on a beach at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the low angle and warm glow of the sunlight. The person, possibly a woman based on the silhouette, is moving leftward across the frame, leaving a trail of footprints behind on the beach's smooth, sandy surface. She is carrying what looks like a bag slung over her right shoulder. Her shadow stretches long and pronounced across the sand, indicating that the sun is low in the sky.\n\nBehind the figure, the beach transitions into a rugged terrain with what seems to be sand dunes, partially shaded, creating a pattern of light and shadow that adds texture to the scene. The background is heavily forested with dense, dark trees filling up the sky line, striking a stark contrast against the brightly lit beach and the silhouetted figure.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is serene and somewhat solitary, evoking a sense of peaceful isolation. The natural light and composition emphasize the quiet moment being experienced by the figure in a beautiful, natural setting.","title":"On the sand dunes","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["546953","547600","557509","547943","547607","543293","543078","542890","548051","546970","548280","543252","548088","554159","545194","543493"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["beach","figure","sand","footprint","dune","trail","shoulder","transition","dawn","bag"]}
