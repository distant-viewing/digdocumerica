{"path":"543275.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a sea lion resting on a rocky surface. The sea lion is positioned in the left half of the image, with its body mostly obscured in shadow, highlighting its smooth, glossy fur in shades of dark brown. Its head is turned toward the camera, mouth open wide to reveal its teeth and pink mouth, possibly yawning or vocalizing. Its whiskers are prominently displayed, and its eyes are closed or squinting slightly.\n\nThe surrounding environment consists of large, rugged, gray rocks that fill the frame. The texture of the rocks is smooth in some areas and jagged in others, particularly where the rocks meet at sharp edges, suggesting a natural rocky terrain possibly by the sea or in a coastal area. The lighting emphasizes the textures and natural color variations of the rocks, enhancing the contrast between the dark, smooth fur of the sea lion and the rough, hard surfaces of its resting place. The overall composition conveys a sense of peace and natural settings, characteristic of wildlife photography.","title":"Seal yawning in sunshine","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543272","543274","543280","543268","553768","543276","543311","545564","542629","545173","543901","549353","551366","550446","550449","543183"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sea","fur","rock","mouth","resting","tooth","squint","peace","half","photography"]}
