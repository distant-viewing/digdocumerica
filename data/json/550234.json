{"path":"550234.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene along a natural shoreline, likely of a river or lake. In the image, two people are walking close to the waterâ€™s edge. The person on the left, a man, is wearing shorts, a light-colored shirt, and seemingly holding a pair of shoes in his hand as he walks barefoot. The person on the right, likely a woman, is dressed in a tank top and shorts, also walking barefoot and carrying what appears to be a shoe in one hand.\n\nThe setting is natural and partly rugged, bordered by dense green foliage on one side and varying debris along the shore, including driftwood and possible litter. The water reflection suggests a calm but slightly rippled surface, indicating a gentle movement in the water. The light conditions imply it could be an overcast day, considering the soft shadows and muted colors in the image.\n\nThe composition of the photo places the two individuals off-center to the left, walking along a path that appears to run parallel to the water. The photograph conveys a peaceful yet somewhat solitary mood, emphasizing a connection to nature and the simplicity of a quiet stroll by the water. There are no man-made structures visible; the focus is purely on the interaction of the two individuals with their natural surroundings.","title":"Strolling along ceaselessly eroding strip of Huntington Beach on lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550238","545194","544337","543203","550826","549756","550235","555376","553396","552295","547180","545031","548696","549471","543248","548700"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["walk","shoe","short","stroll","water","consider","driftwood","person","hand","connection"]}
