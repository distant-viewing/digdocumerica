{"path":"546994.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a domestic scene on the front porch of a house. The house appears to be constructed from cinder blocks and features a covered porch with a boarded-up window, to which a sign is affixed that reads \"Jesus Saves\" above the name \"Bessie Jones.\" The number \"6146\" is also written above the name.\n\nOn the porch, two wooden chairs are positioned nearby a foldable lawn chair. There appears to be a cluttered, weathered look around the porch, with a bag on one of the chairs, and a collection of potted plants with some flowers by the steps.\n\nA woman, dressed in a polka-dot dress and an apron, interacts with two children; all three are African-American. One child, a boy wearing a T-shirt and shorts, stands near her by a small stool, while a younger girl in a pink dress approaches the porch while looking up towards the woman. There is also a medium-sized dog near the woman, mid-movement around the porch.\n\nThe scene conveys a casual, everyday moment featuring interaction likely between family members. The background suggests a residential area with a tempered atmosphere of lived-in coziness and simplicity. The mood is calm and appears to capture a candid everyday life moment.","title":"At home on st.
