{"path":"553776.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and picturesque scene at sunset. The image is bathed in warm, golden and orange hues, suggesting it was taken during the golden hour. The silhouette of a bird is perched prominently in the left side of the frame, sitting atop a sparse branch. The bird is facing to the right, adding a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nBelow the bird, there's an array of foliage which forms a delicate and somewhat irregular horizon line across the lower third of the picture. This vegetation is also silhouetted, enhancing the contrast with the bright background.\n\nThe background itself is a rich tapestry of colors and textures. The upper two-thirds of the image shows an intense gradient of yellow to deep orange. Interestingly, the texture here appears mottled with circular patterns, possibly a bokeh effect created by the interaction of light and the camera lens, or perhaps reflections in water.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a serene and somewhat mystical atmosphere, inviting viewers to pause and reflect on the natural beauty of the scene. It represents a perfect melding of wildlife and the enchanting effects of light at the end of the day.","title":"Bird in a Hawaiian bush","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["544601","548832","544597","547318","543063","551378","557495","542992","551379","544609","544612","554731","553875","547726","550388","557447"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","third","effect","silhouette","tapestry","lens","pause","perch","hour","gradient"]}
