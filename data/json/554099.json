{"path":"554099.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a peaceful outdoor scene rich in natural beauty and tranquility. The central feature of the image is a large, sprawling tree with a thick, sturdy trunk and a complex network of branches extending outward, creating a dense canopy of leaves. The leaves and branches are well-defined, and the sunlight filtering through creates dappled patterns of light and shade, adding texture and depth to the scene.\n\nBeneath the tree, a gentle, grass-covered slope provides a serene setting. Positioned on this hill, there is a small human figure. This person appears to be seated, possibly resting or enjoying the quietude of the surroundings. Their presence adds a sense of scale, highlighting the grandeur and magnitude of the tree.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate setting of the tree and the figure, there seems to be a hint of a scenic view, potentially a body of water or a distant horizon, but details are obscured, giving the backdrop an airy and open feel. This element helps emphasize the feeling of being enveloped in nature.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on the natural elements and the inclusion of a solitary human figure, hints at themes of solitude and the relationship between humans and nature. The overall atmosphere is calm and contemplative.","title":"In liliuokalani gardens","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543448","549248","556473","548687","551365","554668","548756","543446","551378","542958","543452","548709","543488","545278","543445","547546"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["figure","magnitude","branch","inclusion","relationship","quietude","leave","sprawl","tree","envelop"]}
