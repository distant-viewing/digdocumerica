{"path":"548281.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a monarch butterfly lying on a surface covered in fine, loosely compacted snow. The butterfly is positioned towards the center and slightly to the right of the frame, showing a partial side view with its wings partially closed. The predominance of its wings displays the familiar pattern of black, white, and deep orange that monarch butterflies are known for.\n\nThe butterfly appears to be in a vulnerable or possibly lifeless state since it is unusual for such creatures to be on cold snow. The arrangement of the butterfly, coupled with its delicate structure contrasted against the harsh coldness of the snow, evokes a sense of fragility and somber beauty. The background is blurry, focusing the attention entirely on the monarch butterfly. It highlights the vivid colors and intricate patterns of the wings against the stark, textured whiteness of the snow.","title":"Injured butterfly on the beach at Destin, on the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548284","551381","548283","544566","544618","544619","544479","544553","544514","544614","544517","543603","547818","544603","557198","554839"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","snow","creature","pattern","arrangement","orange","state","attention","center"]}
