{"path":"550625.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of a winding river flowing through a densely forested landscape. The river, appearing in a noticeable S-curve, meanders through the scene from the bottom left corner and stretches towards the horizon in the upper right area. The water is a silvery-blue color, contrasting sharply against the dark green hues of the surrounding forest.\n\nThe terrain is largely covered by thick stands of trees, with minor variations in density and color suggesting different types of vegetation or possibly different stages of growth. The forest appears mostly undisturbed, with only a few visible areas of clearing.\n\nIn the background, the landscape gradually flattens out, and distant hills or low mountains can be faintly seen under a hazy sky. The overall lighting in the photograph is dim, possibly indicating that the image was taken either during early morning or late evening, casting soft shadows and contributing to the serene atmosphere of the wilderness scene.\n\nNo human activity, structures, or animals are discernible; the focus is purely on the natural landscape and the sinuous river carving its path through the forest. The perspective afforded by the aerial view emphasizes the vastness and tranquility of the natural environment.","title":"Klutina River, west of the pipeline crossing, looking east toward Copper Center","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550527","550622","550576","550571","557002","550559","550616","550621","550620","550542","553452","550531","555075","542909","550700","550581"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forest","river","flatten","carve","clearing","variation","meander","density","stage","growth"]}
