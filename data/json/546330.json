{"path":"546330.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where two individuals are engaged in an activity involving a large fishing net in a body of water. On the left, a young person with short hair and sunglasses is wearing a white T-shirt and is partially submerged in the water, holding up the net with both hands. The net, filled with visible floats or buoys, is stretched out to the right where another person, who is shirtless and also wearing sunglasses, assists in holding it up. This second individual is more deeply submerged in the water, and only their upper body is visible.\n\nThe backdrop shows a clear sky and a calm sea extending to the horizon. A few boats and what appears to be a white vehicle are also visible in the distance, parked beyond the shore. The scene conveys an atmosphere of leisurely, perhaps recreational, fishing or exploration, in what appears to be a serene coastal environment. The sunlight and shadows suggest it's either morning or afternoon. The expression and posture of the individuals, focused and engaged, add a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting. The overall vintage look of the photograph, possibly from the color and grain, gives it a timeless, nostalgic essence.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Biologists are seining for fish to be used in bioassays.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554008","546222","545178","546340","552321","546972","552302","548738","544274","551393","543077","546290","545208","552324","552116","553081"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","sunglass","fishing","float","buoy","individual","grain","person","essence","exploration"]}
