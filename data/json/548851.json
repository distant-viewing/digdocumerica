{"path":"548851.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant industrial sunset scene. The primary focus is a silhouette of an industrial complex outlined against a reddish-orange sky, underlined by the setting sun. The sun, a vivid and nearly spherical bright element, is positioned slightly off-center to the right and appears partially obscured by the tallest structures of the industrial facility.\n\nThe facility itself is composed of multiple industrial structures, including tall towers, stacks, and possibly storage tanks. These structures are complex, with various pipes and appendages, characteristic of chemical plants or oil refineries. Some of the towers have visible emissions or steam exiting from the top, which blend into the dusky sky.\n\nIn the background, faint outlines of a mountain range can be discerned, further enhancing the depth and layers of the composition. The sky transitions from a bright burnt orange near the sun to darker shades of purple and blue as it stretches away from the light source.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somber and thought-provoking, highlighting the stark contrast between natural beauty and industrial activity. The setting sun not only illuminates the sky but also casts these man-made structures in silhouette, emphasizing their outlines against the fading light. This scene may invoke themes related to industry, environment, and the passage of time.","title":"Fertilizer plant near El Centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545418","545438","548886","544708","558140","545421","544684","546384","552156","545430","545414","544688","545446","545425","547090","551956"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["sun","outline","orange","tower","refinery","silhouette","facility","oil","structure","thought"]}
