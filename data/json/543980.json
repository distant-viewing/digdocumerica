{"path":"543980.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large industrial area with extensive surface mining operations. The scene is situated amidst rugged terrain and mountainous landscapes. Various open pits and terraced layers, characteristic of mining operations, dominate the landscape with various shades of brown and red earth contrasted against darker areas that may indicate vegetation or water bodies.\n\nToward the right side of the image, a network of roads and a more developed area can be seen adjacent to the mining operations. This area includes buildings and structured layouts, which contribute to a more urban appearance when contrasted with the predominant natural and industrial zones.\n\nProminently, the photograph captures a significant amount of smoke or steam emanating from multiple points, predominantly from the right side of the image. This white smoke spreads across the skies, merging with the clouds above, suggesting either ongoing industrial activity or controlled burns related to the mining operations.\n\nThe background fades into a hazy vista of mountains and clouds, indicating either the transition into a different environment or atmospheric conditions affecting visibility. The distant mountains create a layered appearance due to the atmospheric perspective, enhancing the depth and vastness of the landscape.","title":"Aerial view of mining operations","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544055","544781","544059","544067","543758","544792","545354","544058","549174","544785","544062","554836","544788","543857","543729","544789"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","operation","atmospheric","smoke","terrace","burn","vista","emanat","pit","appearance"]}
