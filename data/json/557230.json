{"path":"557230.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of busy highway traffic. Cars, mostly vintage by modern standards and varying in model and design, fill the lanes of the highway as they move in both directions. Some cars are hardtops while others are convertibles, and their colors range from lighter shades to darker hues.\n\nIn the background, there are large industrial structures which include towering silos and frameworks that dominate the skyline, suggesting the proximity to an industrial area or a factory zone. These structures have a heavy, robust appearance typical of mid-20th-century industrial architecture.\n\nThe road itself is bordered by a concrete barrier on the left side and a metal railing on the right, separating the highway from the industrial backdrop and a river that runs parallel but is not visible in the image. Streetlights line the right side of the highway, stretching into the distance.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a bright, clear day, as the visibility is high and shadows cast by the cars are sharp and distinct. This setting not only reflects the era's automotive and industrial culture but also captures the mood of bustling activity in an urban or suburban environment during what appears to be a midday timeframe.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic on Parkway East at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545463","549857","545884","555437","547811","544723","553019","545455","549919","545432","550089","549890","542764","546370","547569","548084"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["highway","timeframe","car","streetlight","culture","silo","midday","lane","vintage","proximity"]}
