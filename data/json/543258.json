{"path":"543258.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely from a derelict or aging facility. In the foreground, there is a large, rusted metal structure, possibly a part of old machinery or a support column. This rust-covered cylinder towers upwards, and has a darkened metal crossbeam near its base. Atop this column, there appears to be some kind of platform or possibly a control station, which is also encased in rust and shows significant wear.\n\nIn the background, an extensive industrial building or factory can be seen. It has multiple levels and sections, constructed with what looks like weathered wood and metal siding, indicative of considerable aging and exposure to elements. The factory has several visible features such as towers, staircases, and walkways, constructing a complex network. \n\nThe scene is set under a sky with scattered clouds, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light casting a warm hue over the image. The presence of such industry in a state of decay or transition could be reflective of economic changes or technological advancements leading to its obsolescence.\n\nThe photograph itself has a gritty, textured quality, enhancing the industrial and abandoned feel of the scenery. The composition utilizes perspective effectively, using the vertical line of the corroded column to draw the eye upwards towards the sky, contrasting the man-made structures with the natural element above.","title":"California--Monterey Peninsula","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["556351","546757","547969","542545","542975","545978","545992","545982","543154","547579","542591","542705","552190","546122","557390","547470"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["column","rust","factory","advancement","obsolescence","construct","metal","encase","cylinder","tower"]}
