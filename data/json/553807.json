{"path":"553807.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a moderately desolate landscape where a lone shepherd, clad in vibrant red and pink attire with a red headscarf, is engaged in herding. The shepherd walks briskly, leading a modest flock of sheep and goats across a terrain marked by scrubby, sparse vegetation and sandy soil. The background prominently features a series of large, barren mounds, possibly piles of earth or minerals, under a clear sky. The setting suggests a dry, possibly arid environment, given the dusty ground and the lack of lush greenery. The image communicates a sense of solitary labor and the expansive, somewhat rugged natural environment in which the shepherd operates.","title":"Navajo sheepherder in southern Utah.
