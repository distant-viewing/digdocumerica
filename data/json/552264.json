{"path":"552264.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a city skyline during sunset or twilight, viewed across a large body of water. The skyline features a variety of buildings including high-rises, a prominent tower under construction, and architectural structures with distinct silhouettes against the colorful sky. The sky itself transitions from a rich orange near the horizon, blending into deep shades of blue and purple higher up, suggesting the photo was taken at either dusk or dawn.\n\nThe water in the foreground shows gentle ripples and reflections of the fading light, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The overall mood of the image is serene and somewhat contemplative, with the natural beauty of the sunset juxtaposing the urban skyline. The various shades of orange and purple in the sky suggest a calm and peaceful end of the day. The absence of any foreground activity or objects, aside from the water, focuses attention solely on the stark outlines of the buildings against the sky.","title":"Elliott Bay at sunrise.
