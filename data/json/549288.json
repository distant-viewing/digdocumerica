{"path":"549288.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor scene where two men are involved in installing or repairing a ceiling. One man stands on a ladder, his body reaching upward toward a partly opened drop ceiling panel; he appears focused on his task. He is young, with long hair under a cap, wearing a basic white t-shirt and greenish pants that look lightly dusted with debris from the work. The other man, appearing middle-aged and dressed in a light green shirt and darker pants, stands on the floor leaning back slightly as he looks up towards the ceiling and the other man at work, with his hands on his hips.\n\nThe backdrop reveals a typical indoor work environment likely undergoing some form of renovation. To the left, there is part of a doorway, and straight ahead a carpeted hallway with another door visible in the background. Construction tools and materials, like a hammer and what could be blueprint drawings, are scattered on the floor, further indicating ongoing construction or maintenance.\n\nThe lighting in the room is soft, diffused from ceiling lights and possibly daylight streaming faintly from adjacent spaces. The roomâ€™s decor, visible in objects like the framed entrance and the patterns in the visible carpet, suggest a setting that could be either commercial or residential, possibly an office building.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a moment of interaction and cooperation in a manual labor setting, with attention clearly directed at the task of ceiling installation or repair.","title":"Community leader and high school teacher Anthony Bruno (left) with former student, remodelling the first floor apartment of the Brunos' Neptune Road house.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551503","546837","553471","548455","546628","546036","546929","552369","553802","542497","551899","556335","544053","551512","544828","543594"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["ceiling","work","room","floor","drawing","cooperation","drop","renovation","task","hip"]}
