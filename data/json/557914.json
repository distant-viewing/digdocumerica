{"path":"557914.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph shows a young man engaging in mechanical work on an engine that is within a compartment of a vehicle. The setting appears to be outdoors during daylight, suggested by the lighting and shadows visible in the image.\n\nThe man, wearing a gray sleeveless t-shirt and glasses, is kneeling next to an open front trunk of what appears to be a rear-engine vehicle. He is leaned forward into the trunk space, working on the engine with a tool in his hand, possibly a wrench. This indicates he might be repairing or maintaining the vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle itself has a white body, and the open trunk lid is also white on its exterior while the interior is a darker shade, showing signs of wear like scuff marks and dirt. The engine is complex, with various visible components like belts and metal parts, typical of car engines.\n\nThe imageâ€™s focus is on the act of maintenance being performed by the man, highlighting a moment of concentration and effort in automotive repair, captured in a personal and informal setting. The overall composition of the photograph, combining the person and the car, portrays a practical and perhaps educational scenario, possibly reflecting a hobby or professional interest in mechanics.","title":"This driver is adjusting the carburetor of his van at a service station after his vehicle failed the carbon monoxide test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. He was determined to pass so he could leave for school out of state. City employees in the safety lane told him what was wrong and instructed him how to adjust it. After two tries the vehicle passed and received an inspection sticker.
