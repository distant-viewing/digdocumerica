The foreground features a female on the right side and a male on the left, both wearing shorts and appearing casual, with their backs partially facing the camera as they step into the water. The woman has blonde hair pulled back, while the man is shirtless, showcasing a relaxed, outdoor recreational scene.\n\nThe background shows a picturesque riverside setting, with a large, split trunk tree on the left bank, and a dense pile of smooth, white river rocks accumulated around its base, suggesting a dynamic natural environment shaped by water flow. Along the riverbanks, dense green foliage and a few taller trees complete a serene, natural landscape. The overall composition creates a sense of peaceful exploration in a secluded natural setting.","title":"Teenage girls wading the frio canyon river near Leakey Texas, while on an outing with friends near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["550238","555376","546320","552117","550242","550234","543530","550235","546338","546336","553439","552976","544339","551408","552975","550227"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["female","wad","accumulate","complete","split","riverside","river","pull","male","step"]}
