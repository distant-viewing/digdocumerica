The water is calm, reflecting the image of the surrounding environment like a mirror. On the far side of the lake, you can see a red-roofed building complex scattered among the lush green trees, likely a resort or facility nestled in the valley. The landscape is a rich tapestry of dense forest ascending up the mountainsides, dominated by dark green hues.
