{"path":"547755.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph provides a high-altitude, expansive aerial view of a cityscape under bright daylight conditions. The image captures a complex network of elevated highways prominently winding through the frame, converging and diverging in dense interchanges filled with cars, displaying the busy traffic typical of urban environments. These large roads act as arteries, guiding the viewer's eye towards the urban center marked by a cluster of high-rise buildings clustered together, creating a distinct skyline.\n\nThe tallest buildings in the dense downtown area show a variety of modern architectural styles and are bathed in sunlight that enhances their glass and metal facades. Below these towering structures, numerous smaller buildings, warehouses, and parking areas fill the space, hinting at a bustling city life.\n\nThe area is vast, as the city extends towards the horizon where the sky meets a faintly visible landscape. The image's perspective, possibly shot from an aircraft, gives a slightly fisheye, panoramic effect, slightly bowing the horizon, encapsulating a vast area that showcases both the urban architecture and the transportation infrastructure critical to the city's functionality.\n\nA few scattered clouds subtly dot an otherwise clear sky, casting gentle shadows over some parts of the city and the highways, adding a slight contrast to the otherwise brilliantly lit scene. Overall, the photograph delivers a vivid impression of a dynamic, densely populated urban area, thriving and vibrant with activity.\n","title":"Downtown Dallas and expressways","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553001","553838","547765","547764","553016","549478","549476","548392","555743","546707","553559","546678","551510","553015","546574","549477"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["city","highway","interchange","downtown","aircraft","functionality","horizon","warehouse","altitude","network"]}
