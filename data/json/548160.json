{"path":"548160.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene on a body of water where two men are engaged in fishing activities. They are aboard a small boat with the registration \"OR 86 DY\" on its side, indicating it might be registered in Oregon.\n\nOne man, wearing a blue jacket and a red baseball cap, is standing and appears to be netting a fish with a landing net. He is holding the net in one hand and appears to be managing the fishing rod with the other, focusing intensely on his task. The second man, who is seated and partially obscured, wears dark clothing and a camouflage hat, and seems to be handling another fishing rod or watching the first man's actions.\n\nThe background of the image shows a water barrier or dam with water cascading down, creating a white, foamy appearance as it hits the river. The environment suggests a cool, possibly misty day, typical of a fishing expedition in a more temperate or Pacific Northwest-like region.\n\nOverall, the image delivers a dynamic snapshot of recreational fishing, capturing the concentration and effort involved in the sport, set against a backdrop that underscores a connection with nature and water-based activities.","title":"Landing a chinook salmon on the willamette river near Oregon city","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552282","552324","548132","551394","552326","552323","552320","548738","548499","557741","551410","552317","546079","544256","553081","552325"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","net","rod","register","deliver","expedition","cascad","registration","camouflage","man"]}
