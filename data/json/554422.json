{"path":"554422.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor, wooded setting where a man is engaged in an activity involving tree branches. The man, who is dressed in a red and black plaid shirt, dark trousers, and a white hard hat, is pushing a large fallen tree branch. The scene is thick with various other branches and foliage, creating a somewhat tangled appearance. The ground is covered with smaller twigs and leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. The background shows dense, untrimmed vegetation indicating that the area might be a forest or woodlot used for resource gathering or similar activities. The man's pose conveys effort and interaction with the natural elements around him. The overall impression is one of active human involvement in woodland management or cleanup.","title":"Loading area for logs on Litchfield Paper Company land near Tupper Lake.

New pulp wood markets and better usage, however, are helping to eliminate waste.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["542716","542772","542787","542788","542771","545269","553602","542770","542786","553608","553604","542781","553614","542773","542769","545060"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["branch","cleanup","twig","involvement","resource","pose","man","plaid","effort","trouser"]}
