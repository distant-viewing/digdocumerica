{"path":"553878.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dense swarm of small fish underwater, presenting a seemingly chaotic yet natural pattern. The fish, which are numerous and packed tightly together, appear to be small with slender, elongated bodies predominantly reflecting a silver hue interspersed with nuances of blue likely influenced by the waterâ€™s color and the light filtering through it. The fish are oriented in different directions which gives a dynamic, almost frenzied texture to the image. There is no visible background or other objects to distract from the fish; the entirety of the frame is filled with these creatures, emphasizing their density and the vastness of their numbers. The overall effect is a captivating display of wildlife in their natural aquatic habitat, documented in a way that highlights the collective behavior of the fish. There are light reflections visible on many of the fish, adding a shimmering effect to the photograph.","title":"Coho salmon in Columbia River fish hatchery. (From the Sites exhibition.
