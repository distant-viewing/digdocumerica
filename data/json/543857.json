{"path":"543857.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a large-scale mining operation. The scene is dominated by the dark, rugged textures of exposed earth and rock formations typical of a strip mining site. The upper part of the image features a landscape of heavily terraced hills, creating a series of geometric patterns. These terraces are likely the result of systematic excavation.\n\nA prominent dirt road snakes through the center of the image, connecting various parts of the mining site. Along the road, several white vehicles and structures, possibly equipment or temporary buildings used in the mining operations, are visible. These provide a sense of scale, indicating the large area the operation covers.\n\nThe background fades into a more verdant area with patches of greenery and what appears to be a community or residential area at the very top of the image. This transition from the stark, disturbed land of the mining site to the undisturbed landscape underscores the environmental impact of such activities.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a vivid contrast between industrial activity and natural landscapes, highlighting the extent and method of land alteration involved in mining processes. This image not only documents the physical scope of mining but also subtly hints at the broader environmental and possibly social implications.\n","title":"Strip mining at peabody coal co","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["549174","543674","544785","549173","543758","549177","544100","554768","549171","544064","549167","549172","544111","554836","543861","544112"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","terrace","site","operation","implication","scope","extent","method","alteration","scale"]}
