{"path":"550054.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene. The body of water is relatively large, and its surface is shimmering with reflections of sunlight, creating a peaceful ambiance. On the lake, there are three rowing boats, each manned by multiple rowers in active motion, suggesting a practice session or a casual rowing activity. In the foreground, on the grassy bank of the lake, two people are seated close to the waterâ€™s edge. They appear to be enjoying the scenic view and possibly observing the rowing activities.\n\nThe background features striking, architecturally unique buildings that have large, dome-like roofs which are tented, potentially indicating a sports or events facility. Numerous trees can be seen around the buildings and along the bank, enhancing the calm, green environment. The setting seems to be a public park or a recreational area, conducive to both sports and relaxation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on both human activity and tranquil nature, presents a lively yet peaceful setting where people engage in physical activities and enjoy leisure time in a beautiful outdoor environment.","title":"Rowing crews on the charles river, harvard university area cambridge","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551679","546070","552982","551680","544266","553404","550324","549416","543579","548555","546856","553401","553403","552283","558093","553400"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rowing","bank","sport","session","enjoy","lake","strik","lakeside","practice","shimmer"]}
