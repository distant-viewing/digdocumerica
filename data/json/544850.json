{"path":"544850.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene at a shallow body of water, possibly a lake or a coastal lagoon. The image is dominated by numerous flamingos scattered across the frame. In the foreground, five flamingos are clearly visible, standing in the water. These birds are positioned at various angles to the viewer, some facing towards the camera, while others are turned sideways, providing a good view of their distinctive pink and white plumage and long, thin legs. The reflections of these closest flamingos are faintly visible in the calm water.\n\nIn the background, the water is densely populated with many more flamingos that appear smaller due to the perspective. These birds are less distinct but contribute to an overall impression of a large flock inhabiting this area. The background also shows a hint of green vegetation at the far edge of the water, suggesting the presence of a shoreline.\n\nThe sky above is a clear blue, indicating fair weather and adding a tranquil mood to the setting. The composition of the photograph, with its expansive view of the habitat and the large number of birds, highlights the natural beauty and peacefulness of this wildlife scene.","title":"Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area on east shore of Great Salt Lake.
