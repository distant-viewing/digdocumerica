{"path":"544877.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of two blooming cacti with vibrant pink flowers. Each cactus is covered in numerous long, thin, white spines that project outward, protecting the delicate blooms. The flowers themselves have a rich, soft pink hue with slightly ruffled petals, encircling a dense cluster of bright yellow stamens in the center, which adds a contrast of colors.\n\nThe cacti are situated in a natural desert setting, indicated by the sandy red soil that surrounds them. There are also some sparse, green vegetation and other smaller, non-flowering cacti visible in the immediate vicinity, hinting at the resilience of life in arid conditions.\n\nThe background is softly focused, emphasizing the sharp detail of the cacti and their flowers in the foreground. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of stark beauty and solitude, typical of a desert landscape.","title":"Orange mallow, showy desert flower","placename":"Green River (Utah)","location":"Green River, Utah","nn1":["545712","544885","545709","544582","545722","544891","545727","545309","554844","555370","544934","544890","544875","544879","557540","543205"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cacto","flower","desert","spine","ruffle","stamen","blooming","encircle","petal","bloom"]}
