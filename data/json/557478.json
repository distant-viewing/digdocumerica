{"path":"557478.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural activity in an expansive field. The field is segmented into numerous long, straight rows that appear to be lush with green crops. Multiple workers are present in the field, essentially scattered throughout these rows. They are engaged in what appears to be the manual labor of tending to or harvesting the crops. Each worker is bent or crouched over, focusing intently on the plants.\n\nThe workers are dressed in casual, functional attire suitable for farm work, with several wearing hats to shield themselves from the sun. There appears to be a mix of men and women, all absorbed in their tasks.\n\nIn the background, a rural or suburban landscape is visible, characterized by a succession of low buildings, possibly residential homes or farm buildings. These are interspersed with patches of other vegetation and bordered by utility poles and wires, suggesting this farm is located near a populated area.\n\nThe overall setting is outdoors under clear skies with full daylight illuminating the scene, casting soft shadows and enhancing the rich colors of the vegetation and earth. The composition of the photo, with its parallel lines of crops leading towards the built-up area at the edge of the farm, creates a structured and harmonious tableau that emphasizes the organized nature of agricultural work.","title":"Farm workers in one of the few remaining fields near the ocean in fast-growing Orange County, California, south of Los Angeles. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, resulting in increased land use pressures. Since November 1972, regulatory commissions have been charged with determining development within 1,000 yards of the coast. The commissions must submit a report to the legislature by January 1976, recommending a plan for future coastal development.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["548900","546964","543481","553879","543858","553659","543862","554017","543845","544548","554056","548997","543157","557696","544552","548296"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farm","crop","worker","field","row","tableau","work","wire","labor","daylight"]}
