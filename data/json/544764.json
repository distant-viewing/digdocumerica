{"path":"544764.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph presents a unique aerial view of a landscape that is characterized by a series of circular and irregularly shaped patches of dense vegetation intermingled with bare, perhaps salty, ground. The image features a distinct contrast in color and texture between areas covered with greenery and those with lighter hues, which might be salt flats or arid land. To the left side of the photograph, there runs a straight road or pathway, sharply marked out from the natural patterns by its linear form and darker surface, likely tarmac or similar material. Another road, faint and less distinct, is visible on the right side and appears to be partly covered by the landscape it traverses. \n\nThe background of the image fades into a light, hazy horizon where the ground meets the sky, and distant mountains, slightly obscured by atmospheric haze, form a faint backdrop. The overall impression is of a flat, expansive area, bordered in the far distance by these mountains, suggesting this might be a valley or basin of some sorts. The dappled pattern might be indicative of a wetland or marsh area, where water accumulates seasonally in depressions, supporting the growth of vegetation and influencing the soil composition contrasted around them. This creates an almost patchwork-like appearance when seen from above.","title":"The Union Pacific Railroad's causeway across the Great Salt Lake threatens the ecological balance of the lake.","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["555863","555865","544778","555873","543644","555845","555844","550397","548703","554164","550598","555029","552981","544768","555864","555553"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["flat","depression","tarmac","intermingle","traverse","accumulate","patchwork","basin","salt","mountain"]}
