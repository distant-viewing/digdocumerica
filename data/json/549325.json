{"path":"549325.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph captures a solemn and reflective moment featuring an older man walking by a large memorial wall engraved with numerous names. The man is dressed casually in a buttoned shirt, dark pants, a belt, and a straw hat. He carries a small, possibly leather, handbag and seems to be walking slowly, his eyes possibly grazing over the names on the wall.\n\nThe setting is outdoor, with the memorial wall appearing as a significant structural element, probably made of granite, occupying the majority of the background. The names are neatly organized in columns, suggesting that it is a war memorial or a tribute to individuals who have passed away under significant circumstances. The wall's appearance is slightly weathered, hinting that it has been standing for some time.\n\nThe floor on which the man walks is plain and complements the somber mood set by the memorial wall. The scene is depicted in vibrant hues due to the photograph being taken on what appears to be slide film, giving it a vintage and saturated look. Light and shadows play subtly across the scene, adding depth to the man's solitary figure against the vast, storied backdrop of the wall. His posture and stride suggest a reflective or melancholic state as he moves along the path beside the memorial.","title":"In Battery Park, at the tip of Lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547816","550739","547820","551940","546495","543037","551346","548476","547310","553176","558330","545520","543345","554857","552871","552971"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["wall","name","slide","handbag","man","leather","stride","majority","straw","film"]}
