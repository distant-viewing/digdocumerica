{"path":"554215.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a street vendor, presumably selling beverages or food, during what appears to be an outdoor event. The vendor is a man sporting a mustache and wearing a brown cap and a red turtleneck. He is partially illuminated by strong sunlight casting deep shadows, emphasizing his features and the texture of his attire.\n\nHe wears a makeshift cardboard sign around his neck, humorously labeled \"BEER 15Â¢\" on one side and \"Y OLDE WATER BUCKET\" on the other, each adorned with a simple smiley face drawing. This creative presentation, along with the vintage look of his cap and attire, suggests a jovial, informal atmosphere, possibly at a festival or fair.\n\nIn front of him are stainless steel containers, likely used for storing and serving drinks, connected by a metal frame possibly for easy transport. Nearby on the counter, there are various cups and containers that seem to be part of his vending setup. His hands are busy at work, suggesting he is in the process of serving a customer or preparing his stall.\n\nThe background is dark, drawing focus primarily to the vendor and his immediate surroundings, spotlighting his facial expression and the details of the objects he is handling. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the vendor set against a shadowed backdrop, highlights the character and environment of this entrepreneurial moment.","title":"Hawking beer to skiers outside the Timber Line restaurant and bar at Snowmass Mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["556210","551832","557174","554945","551840","545501","545457","549867","547381","556260","551485","551513","554217","553053","558287","547856"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["vendor","container","vending","cap","turtleneck","beer","presentation","festival","stall","customer"]}
