{"path":"558011.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a natural scene featuring an old, concrete-lined canal or waterway, partially filled with water. It is surrounded by vegetation, indicating a possibly abandoned or seldom-used area. The canal walls are tall and covered in places with moss or a similar growth, exhibiting signs of wear and age. The water is clear enough to reflect some of the light but also shows accumulation of fallen leaves, hinting at the autumn season.\n\nOverhanging branches from nearby trees cast shadows and speckles of light on the walls and water surface, adding a dappled effect. The surrounding vegetation includes a variety of trees and shrubs, some extending their branches over and into the canal, contributing to a sense of seclusion and tranquility. The ground alongside the canal is likewise covered in a carpet of fallen leaves, blending with the natural debris filling the waterway. The setting suggests a location that is quiet and relatively undisturbed by human activity, creating a peaceful, if somewhat melancholic, atmosphere.","title":"Stumpy basin lock on the Ohio-erie canal where the boats turned around, northeast of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland along the cuyahoga river.  The canal carried heavy commerce between the great lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business.  The valley is now a part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area located in a 20-mile stretch between Cleveland and Akron","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["558016","545927","557997","558002","552733","558008","549641","553428","558014","558009","549032","550844","547965","552255","542631","553427"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["canal","waterway","undistur","fall","dappled","abandoned","branch","peaceful","carpet","seclusion"]}
