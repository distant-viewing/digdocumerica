{"path":"543639.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial mining scene within a rugged, mountainous landscape. In the foreground, there is a large piece of mining equipment that includes an elongated boom with cables descending into a pit. This machine is primarily yellow and is situated on a rough, rocky terrain. Attached to the boom, a red bucket or scoop appears to be used for extracting materials.\n\nIn the background, the expansive view features rolling hills and valleys with lush green vegetation, emphasizing the contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity. Power lines are also visible, stretching across the middle ground, which suggests the presence of infrastructure supporting the mining operation.\n\nThe sky is overcast, resulting in muted lighting which casts an even tone over the entire scene. A single worker in dark clothing can be observed near the bottom right of the frame, providing a sense of scale and human element to the industrial operation. The general atmosphere is one of solitude and the profound impact of human activity on a natural setting.","title":"Strip mining operation of peabody coal company","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["554826","552416","552418","544139","544165","555606","545831","554812","554772","543729","554828","549124","554765","549245","549148","552686"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","boom","scoop","descende","pit","operation","result","cable","bucket","machine"]}
