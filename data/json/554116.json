{"path":"554116.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up of a vibrant red hibiscus flower. The focus is primarily on the central part of the flower, specifically highlighting the prominent yellow stamen and pollen grains, which stand out against the deep red petals. The petals display a rich, saturated color and have a delicate texture that is slightly visible in the image.\n\nThe background is blurred, contributing to the emphasis on the flower itself, creating a shallow depth of field that isolates the hibiscus and softens the surroundings. This effect enhances the visual impact of the flower's vivid color and detailed central structure. The lighting appears natural, possibly sunlight, which enhances the vividness of the red and the contrast with the yellow of the stamen.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its tight focus and blurred background, serves to draw the viewerâ€™s attention directly to the intricate details and striking color contrast within the hibiscus flower.","title":"Hibiscus","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["553949","553948","554117","554840","543623","550464","544891","545699","557545","555035","551380","544875","557586","554587","547815","554574"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","stamen","petal","grain","close","vividness","emphasis","up","yellow","red"]}
