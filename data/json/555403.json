{"path":"555403.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape at what appears to be a wide river or lake with low water levels, exposing multiple sandbars. Three individuals are walking across the expansive sandy areas, which are segmented by narrow strips of water, reflecting shimmering sunlight. Off in the distance, a small boat (possibly a motorboat) cruises through deeper water, creating a subtle wake behind it.\n\nIn the background, the shore is lined with dense, lush green vegetation, possibly indicating a forested region. The shore curves outward, forming a peninsula that juts into the river. Sand deposits are visible near the peninsula, contributing to the dynamic landscape. The sky is clear with very few clouds. This peaceful, outdoor setting suggests an expansive, natural environment that promotes tranquility and perhaps leisure activities like walking or boating.","title":"People walk a beach uncovered during a record low flow of the Columbia River at Rooster Rock State Park 18 miles east of Portland.
