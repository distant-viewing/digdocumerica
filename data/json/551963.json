{"path":"551963.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic coastal scene, where nature and human construction intersect. On the left side of the image, there's a barren tree leaning due to the coastal wind. The central focus is a two-story house with a flat roof, located precariously close to the edge of a steep, eroded cliff. The building appears to be constructed of dark materials with large windows that might offer expansive views of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe terrain of the cliff is rugged and sharply declines towards the shoreline, which is littered with debris including wooden planks and boulders, possibly remnants of erosion or a previous structure. The cliff itself shows signs of severe erosion, with exposed earth and deep gullies carved by natural forces, indicating instability.\n\nAt the far right, a figure in dark clothing stands on the cliff, adding a human element to the scene and providing a sense of scale to the environment. The background features a grey, overcast sky and a calm sea that meets the horizon in a quiet meld of water and air, suggesting a cool, damp climate. The scene exudes a sense of isolation and vulnerability, portraying a stark beauty where human habitation meets the powerful forces of nature.","title":"Aftermath of severe lake storm at beverly shores.
