{"path":"556819.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a subway station. The image shows several people involved in different activities, such as walking and passing through turnstiles. There are about seven visible individuals in the scene, dressed in styles suggesting the photo could be several decades old, possibly from the 1960s or 70s.\n\nIn the foreground, there are rows of turnstiles labeled \"OUT,\" indicating exits. People are moving through and around these turnstiles. Two men near the left of the image appear to be entering or waiting to enter through a door marked with a sign \"NO ENTRANCE.\" The other individuals include a woman checking a large wall-mounted map, another woman walking towards the right, a man in a suit also walking in the same direction, and a few more people further back, seemingly engaged in similar commuting activities or just passing by.\n\nThe station itself has a somewhat grim and worn appearance, with tiled walls that look dirty and dimly lit ceilings with visible pipes. The image also shows some blur and grain, suggesting motion and the low-light conditions typically found in subway stations. Overall, the photograph documents a typical moment of urban transit from a past era, characterized by the attire of the people and the older infrastructure of the subway station.","title":"Passengers passing turnstiles to and from New York city transit authority subway trains at gRand central station","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551890","551886","551893","556682","556815","556818","556779","556821","556823","556697","551883","556774","556810","556814","556812","556651"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","station","enter","pass","walk","commuting","70","map","past","wall"]}
