{"path":"545457.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This is a vivid and busy photograph depicting a snack bar scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, given the fashion and decor styles visible. The scene captures three individuals interacting across a snack bar counter, possibly at a fair or community event.\n\nOn the left, a woman stands alone facing the camera, aligned with the snack bar counter. She has short dark hair, styled in a typical fashion of the era, and wears a light-colored long-sleeve jacket over a high-neck shirt. She seems to be holding a small cup, potentially of coffee or tea, and appears attentive or waiting for service.\n\nIn the middle, we see a vendor behind the counter, smiling and possibly handing over or showing a cup similar to the one the woman holds. He is a middle-aged man with a darker complexion, sporting a full beard and mustache, and wearing casual work attire which includes a blue shirt with a name tag.\n\nNext to him, on the right, stands another vendor, also behind the counter, who is interacting with the first vendor or possibly engaging with the woman. This man is slightly older, with graying hair, and dressed in a light brown or khaki shirt, suggesting a uniform or similar work attire.\n\nThe background reveals more of the bustling setting with additional people walking or standing, and signs hanging from the ceiling advertising prices of drinks like \"FROZEN 25Â¢\", hinting that this scene might be from a location where snacks and refreshments are sold in a casual, lively environment. The lighting is dim yet warm, enhancing the evening or night-time atmosphere of the social gathering.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["554187","557686","556816","554866","548233","551485","546216","551459","554495","557763","556676","551888","551342","549909","551840","549090"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["snack","counter","vendor","bar","cup","fashion","interact","woman","refreshment","complexion"]}
