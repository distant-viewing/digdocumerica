{"path":"554879.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural or country setting bathed in natural light, most likely captured during daylight. Several older model vehicles are parked amidst a natural landscape dominated by oak trees which scatter partial shadows across the ground. The vehicles vary in type and color, including a teal station wagon, a red pick-up truck, and others that are white and beige.\n\nThe ground is predominantly dirt, scattered with grass patches, suggesting a well-used or undeveloped area. To the right of the image, there's a structure that appears to be a shed or workshop. The building is simple and utilitarian, with visible tools and equipment around its perimeter, hinting at agricultural or mechanical usage.\n\nIn the background, more densely wooded areas can be seen along with traditional wooden fencing, adding to the rustic, outdoor feel of the environment. There is no human presence evident in the photo. The setting evokes a sense of a working rural landscape, possibly a farm or ranch area where vehicles are used for practical purposes.","title":"Driveway of a sheep ranch in the Leakey, Texas, area near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["557701","557670","544641","554920","553662","551100","544767","554561","551021","544061","552673","543166","556355","558254","550005","553008"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["vehicle","teal","ranch","fencing","perimeter","country","pick","rural","usage","workshop"]}
