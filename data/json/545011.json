{"path":"545011.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph appears to capture an aerial view of a logging operation nestled in a vast expanse of forest. The predominant scene is thick, dark green forest as far as the eye can see, suggesting a remote location possibly dedicated to forestry or logging activities.\n\nCentral to the image is a clearing with several industrial structures, likely for processing or storing timber. These buildings are relatively large and constructed with flat, metallic roofs, reflecting an industrial style typical for such operations. There is significant activity around these structures, including several vehicles that appear to be heavy machinery, most likely used for moving and processing logs. Stacks of logs can be seen both in neat piles and scattered more randomly in open areas, indicative of ongoing work.\n\nSmoke or steam is emanating from one particular point, likely a smokestack or a controlled burning area, and dispersing into the air above the site, creating a noticeable contrast with the surrounding greenery. This detail points to the operation possibly involving some form of wood processing or waste disposal through burning.\n\nThe background features a consistent, uninterrupted view of dense trees, underscoring the location's seclusion and the industry's impact on the landscape. Around the operation, the trees are noticeably sparser, suggesting clearing activities to accommodate the logging and processing sites.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a vivid glimpse into the scale and nature of a forestry operation from a bird's-eye perspective, highlighting both the industrial activity and its environmental context.","title":"Small lumber operation","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542945","542941","542942","542940","542515","552162","552198","543749","542944","550563","545256","556922","552163","550349","546236","552140"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["processing","operation","forestry","clearing","log","burning","site","eye","forest","disposal"]}
