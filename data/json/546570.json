{"path":"546570.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a bustling urban landscape, likely captured in a major city. Prominently, towards the bottom of the image, there are multiple lanes of traffic filled with numerous cars, indicating a busy time possibly during rush hour. The roads curve elegantly as they border a green area with trees and neatly trimmed grass.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there's a significant, white, dome-shaped building surrounded by well-manicured lawns and pathways, giving it a distinguished and important appearance. This structure is reminiscent of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C.\n\nBeyond the roads and green spaces, the photograph opens up to a broader cityscape that includes a large body of water, possibly a river, lined with more greenery and intertwined with bridges and more roadway infrastructure. The other side of the river hosts a dense arrangement of buildings that vary in architecture, suggesting government or significant commercial buildings.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo uses natural lighting that suggests it was taken during the day under cloudy skies, casting a soft and even light across the scene, enhancing the colors and details of both the natural and built environments.","title":"Jefferson memorial and heavily travelled 14th street bridge which crosses the potomac to Virginia","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546585","546679","546741","546693","546624","547267","546692","546674","547228","547226","546745","546574","546577","547253","553559","546704"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["roads","manicured","government","rush","host","river","open","hour","lane","lawn"]}
