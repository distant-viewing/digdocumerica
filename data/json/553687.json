The person is backlit, creating a silhouette effect emphasized by the bright glare and reflective sparkles from the water surface. This individual has curly hair and wears a tank top, visually conveying a sense of exhilaration or satisfaction possibly after surfing or in preparation to surf. The hues in the image are primarily deep blues and purples indicative of either early morning or late afternoon light. Water droplets are visible on the surfboard, adding texture and detail to the surface which catches the light brilliantly. The background comprises primarily softly focused water, creating a serene atmosphere around the figure. The overall tone of the photograph is one of lively activity mixed with the tranquility of the setting.","title":"Surfer at Waikiki Beach","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["543876","543393","544964","543073","543397","550237","554066","557424","552354","548844","553449","548291","553690","550292","557481","543215"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["surfboard","surf","glare","sparkle","droplet","person","preparation","lift","water","comprise"]}
