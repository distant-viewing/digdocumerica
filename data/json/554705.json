{"path":"554705.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a group of three people hiking through a lush, dense forest. They are walking along a narrow, earthen trail that appears slightly muddy and is sprinkled with leaves. The surrounding forest is densely packed with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, some of which are showing signs of autumnal color changes, particularly noticeable in the splashes of yellow and orange in the background.\n\nThe first person (on the left) is dressed in a light-colored hooded jacket, dark pants, and is carrying a backpack, suggesting preparedness for an extended hike. The second person (in the middle) wears a grey sweater, beige pants, and also carries a backpack. The third person, partially obscured and following behind, is dressed in a dark jacket.\n\nThe woods around them are vibrant with varying shades of green, yellow, and brown, reflecting the rich biodiversity of the area. The ground is covered with fallen leaves and small plants, and the path they follow looks well-trodden but narrow, reinforcing the sense of being deep in nature. The canopy above provides a filtered light that softens the scene, and there is a reflection of light on a small puddle or stream by the trail, adding a hint of moisture to the environment.\n\nOverall, the scene captures the peacefulness of a forest hike, underscored by the serene and somewhat rugged natural setting.","title":"Mud holes and exposed tree roots indicate heavy use of a trail to Brothers Mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554663","554662","545512","554502","554558","543331","554501","554664","553357","553373","557005","543388","553364","543233","554557","553464"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["hike","backpack","trail","forest","person","preparedness","biodiversity","leave","jacket","pant"]}
