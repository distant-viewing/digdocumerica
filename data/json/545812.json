{"path":"545812.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a dry, rugged desert landscape. In the foreground, there is a dead horse lying on the sandy and rocky ground. The horse, appearing brown in color with white patches, is on its side with its limbs stretched out and eyes closed, suggesting it has been dead for some time.\n\nTo the left of the horse, squatting close to it, is a person who appears to be a woman. She is taking a photograph of the horse with a camera. She is wearing a black T-shirt, blue shorts, and is barefoot, indicating a casual or spontaneous moment during rough terrain exploration.\n\nThe background shows a sparse desert environment with shrubs and small bushes scattered throughout. The terrain is uneven and covered with stones and small rocks. The overall environment looks arid, with clear skies and no visible water sources or lush vegetation, emphasizing the harshness of the landscape where the scene is taking place.","title":"Dead livestock dropped near Moab city dump.
