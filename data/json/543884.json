{"path":"543884.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals standing at the edge of a body of water, possibly a lake or a wide river. One person is wearing a black bikini and has their hair tied back in a bun, while the other person is dressed in a white bottom and a lighter colored top or swimsuit, with long blonde hair hanging down their back. Both are facing away from the camera, looking towards a boat that is speeding across the water, creating a wake behind it.\n\nThe setting appears to be a sunny day with clear skies, judging by the lighting and shadows visible in the scene. The water is relatively tranquil apart from the disturbance created by the moving boat. The foreground shows a sandy beach leading into the water where the two people are standing. The overall mood is serene and leisurely, suggesting a moment of relaxation or a peaceful day out near the water.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["551310","550242","553800","546356","543951","546352","544189","548527","546190","547688","554611","543460","546976","549345","550920","544339"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["bun","bikini","water","swimsuit","boat","hair","wake","disturbance","person","speed"]}
