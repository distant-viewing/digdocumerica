{"path":"543133.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene by the water. The foreground is dominated by the dark, silhouetted branches of a tree, possibly pine or another type with needle-like leaves, extending into the frame. This gives a strong contrast to the softer colors of the sunset. In the middle of the frame, the calm water reflects the colors of the sky and is dotted with several small boats anchored for the evening. The horizon shows a silhouette of a distant landmass against the fading light of the sky, which is rich with hues of deep blue at the top, blending into oranges and pinks near the horizon. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and pastoral, typical of a tranquil evening by the shore.","title":"California--waterfront, Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["552335","552038","554404","543143","552293","550303","543119","552294","552277","551215","543880","543613","550296","554760","550299","551206"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sunset","evening","landmass","needle","pink","horizon","orange","frame","shore","middle"]}
