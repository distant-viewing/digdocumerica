{"path":"545058.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a small, motorized fishing boat named \"THRASHER II,\" captured while it is moving over water. The boat's exterior is predominantly white, with a red stripe running along its side and part of the stern. The name \"THRASHER II\" and the home port \"GILHAMET\" are prominently displayed on the transom in black lettering.\n\nThe boat is equipped with various marine accessories, including two upright poles possibly used for fishing, a black cylindrical object near the stern that may be a small storage or waste container, and several white fenders hanging off the sides to protect the boat's hull. The cockpit area is somewhat visible and shows a steering wheel and possibly some navigation equipment.\n\nOn the stern, there is a lifebuoy attached for safety, and the boat's engine exhaust is situated at the back. The boat rides through choppy blue-gray waters, indicating some movement and speed. The weather appears overcast with no direct sunlight, casting a soft and natural light over the scene. The horizon and distant landforms are slightly visible in the background, suggesting an expansive body of water.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of daily activity for the boat, likely involved in a routine fishing or pleasure outing, emphasizing functionality and mobility.","title":"Gill net fishing on the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["542879","546049","545158","548525","546317","551307","545156","548520","545188","546939","549622","544190","544249","542873","547685","544186"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","fender","stern","mobility","exhaust","accessory","pleasure","landform","steering"]}
