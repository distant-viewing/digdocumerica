{"path":"550265.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting, possibly a waste management facility or recycling center. In the foreground, there is a pile of scattered, crushed metallic and non-metallic materials that look like refuse or recycled debris, possibly including metal pieces and fragments of building materials. A concrete slab forms the base where the materials are piled.\n\nA centerpiece of the pile appears to be a large, conical-shaped object, possibly a filter or some other type of industrial component, surrounded by this scattered debris. The material displays various colors, predominately greys and whites, with some reflective metallic surfaces.\n\nIn the middle ground, the area is an open space that is paved, with long planter boxes that are also constructed of concrete. These boxes are vacant, without any visible plants. The scene includes an expansive shed or garage with an open bay area. Inside, there appear to be vehicles and possibly other machinery.\n\nIn the background, there are more industrial buildings visible. The architectural style is utilitarian, typical for industrial or commercial premises. The distant scenery reveals a few trees and utility poles, suggesting the outskirts of a town or a city's industrial district. The sky is lightly overcast, which complements the industrial ambiance of the setup.\n\nThis scene is depicted in broad daylight which casts clear shadows and highlights the textures of the various surfaced materials in the photograph. There are no people visible in the immediate vicinity, lending the area a quiet, possibly abandoned atmosphere.","title":"Sorting table outside recycling plant in franklin","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547611","547901","557308","554301","546256","550880","546255","545059","554318","547610","547625","550882","554300","549637","548147","549795"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["material","pile","box","centerpiece","shaped","slab","concrete","planter","recycl","crush"]}
