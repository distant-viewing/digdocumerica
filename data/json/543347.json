{"path":"543347.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features an aged, wooden rocking chair positioned on a porch composed of weathered wooden planks. The chair is crafted with a spindle back and flattened arms, indicating a traditional style, and it appears worn, suggestive of regular use over a long period. The richness of textures is evident in the wood's grain and the slight peeling, giving it a rustic charm.\n\nTo the right of the rocking chair is a portion of a wooden building, possibly the exterior wall of a house or cabin, with a large window featuring a four-pane, clear glass design bordered by wood. The wood on the building shows signs of aging similar to the porch, with a rich, dark brown color that contrasts with the lighter wood of the porch floor.\n\nThe window provides a reflective surface where the sky is partially visible, suggesting a sunny, clear day. No particular movement or activity is shown in the photograph; it evokes a still, peaceful moment typically found in secluded or rural settings. The composition of the photograph focuses attention on the textures of wood and the interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the nostalgic and serene mood of the scene.","title":"Southern California -- Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["556484","552489","557646","557633","552450","554697","556489","552497","547340","555580","544219","556488","557672","543314","555581","547808"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["wood","chair","porch","flatten","richness","pane","rock","grain","aging","craft"]}
