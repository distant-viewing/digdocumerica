{"path":"544010.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural field filled primarily with harvested remnants and soil. The scene is dominated by brown earth scattered with many cut stems, roots, and clumps of onions left after harvest. Some onions appear partially buried in the soil, with exposed bulbs and roots scattered around.\n\nA noticeable feature in the image is a bright red flag on a thin metal pole planted in the ground. This flag stands out starkly against the natural tones of the field and the clear blue sky in the background. It may serve a marking purpose, possibly indicating a particular area of interest or boundary within the field.\n\nThe background shows a wide, open sky with minimal cloud coverage, suggesting a sunny day. The horizon line is low, with distant elements not distinctly visible, thereby focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the field and the harvest remnants.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the post-harvest condition of an agricultural field with emphasis on the organic debris and the distinctive red flag, set against a clear and expansive sky background.","title":"Onion field near Bethany Home Road","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554046","553698","548979","548296","547297","547303","552541","546924","554055","544552","548997","549049","554202","548820","555541","555618"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["harvest","field","flag","root","remnant","soil","bulb","clump","coverage","cut"]}
