{"path":"554560.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural setting, likely a farm. Several cows are in the foreground, looking curiously towards the camera. They are enclosed by a rustic wooden fence strewn sporadically with grass and wildflowers. The cows are of different breeds, indicated by their varied colors and markings, ranging from black and white to brown and white.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is dominated by a lush green mountain partially enshrouded by mist or low clouds, suggesting an early morning or rainy weather condition. The mountain's dense vegetation hints at its wild, untamed nature.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there are two structures that appear to be farm buildings, possibly a barn and a shed. They are constructed from wood and have a somewhat weathered appearance, blending naturally with the rural environment. The structures are surrounded by open fields, populated with smaller shrubs and grasses, extending towards a wooden post-and-rail fence visible in the middle ground.\n\nThe entire scene exudes a tranquil, pastoral charm, highlighted by the natural beauty of the landscape and a glimpse into farm life. The ambient lighting is soft, likely due to overcast skies, which enhances the vibrant greens of the grass and trees, creating a calm, muted palette throughout the photograph.","title":"Infertile, rocky mountain land near Elizabethtown, New York, makes for poor dairy farmland, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545153","542627","557749","542960","551305","554071","542628","557012","552566","550833","542626","546102","548065","548984","542652","549256"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["farm","cow","grass","fence","breed","mountain","shed","wildflower","marking","barn"]}
