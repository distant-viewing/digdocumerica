{"path":"542644.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, outdoor landscape featuring a large hill or mountain slope. The slope dominates the background with its extensive, undulating surface. Its color palette blends warm tones of burnt orange and rusty browns, suggesting it might be covered in dense, low vegetation or grass which could be changing colors in response to seasonal changes.\n\nIn the foreground, vibrant green trees with thin, delicate branches are contrasted against the hill. These trees are backlit by sunlight, highlighting their leafy branches in a bright, almost yellowish-green hue. The leaves are dense, creating a lush canopy that partially obstructs, but also frames the hill behind it.\n\nThe quality and angle of light, with shadows playing across the hillside and the luminescent glow around the leaves, suggest early morning or late afternoonâ€”times when the sun is low and the light is golden and soft. The overall composition of the image is a juxtaposition of textures: the smooth, large-scale gradient of the hill against the intricate, detailed latticework of the tree branches and leaves. This setup not only captures a tranquil natural scene but also subtly plays with color contrasts and natural lighting, enhancing the depth and the perception of the landscape.","title":"Poppies (California state flower) along Interstate 5.","placename":"Gorman (Calif.)","location":"Gorman, California","nn1":["555589","550437","556473","549249","557519","550602","555536","554402","542924","557537","543582","554596","552553","555131","556587","548025"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["hill","branch","leave","slope","response","hillside","gradient","change","glow","canopy"]}
