{"path":"557084.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a tall historical building, likely a courthouse or a municipal building, with a prominent clock tower rising against a clear sky. The architecture is of a Romanesque style, characterized by strong, heavy forms and rounded arches over the windows and at the tower’s apex.\n\nThe building is constructed of textured stone, giving it a sturdy and impressive appearance. The clock tower prominently features a clock face on each side, set within intricate stone work that includes arches and decorative moldings. Above the clock, the tower narrows slightly and includes narrow, vertical windows which might serve as openings to the bell level. The roof of the tower is steep and pointed, topped off with a weathervane.\n\nThe photograph’s angle captures the tower from a slightly tilted upward perspective, emphasizing its height and grandeur. Light and shadow play across the facade, highlighting the depth of the architectural details, and the blue sky in the background helps to accentuate the cream-colored stone. Surrounding trees suggest the building is situated in a landscaped or a green urban area.","title":"Atchison County courthouse and clock tower in the county seat of Atchison, Kansas.
