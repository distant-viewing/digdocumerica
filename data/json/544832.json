{"path":"544832.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure in the midst of a somewhat industrial or construction activity, surrounded by a gritty urban scene. The person, who appears to be a worker, is standing on what looks like a flatbed of a vehicle or a raised platform. The worker is holding a large, thick hose that curves downwards, possibly engaged in spraying or cleaning as suggested by the posture and grip on the hose.\n\nThe worker's attire includes a hood and full-length clothing, which covers the body completely, indicative of the need for protection or due to the cold setting, discernible by the slightly foggy or dusty atmosphere. The surrounding area is bathed in a hazy sunlight, enhancing the silhouette effect of the worker against a brighter background.\n\nIn the background, the environment is blurred but it is possible to discern vehicles, possibly traffic on a road, indicating that this scene is situated near a busy area. The setting is very urban, with elements like road signs barely visible through the haze, and the general atmosphere is permeated by a sense of coldness and industrial activity. More distinctly, there are hints of debris or scattered materials on the platform, adding to the industrial or construction vibe of the scene. The overall mood is somewhat bleak and monochromatic, conveying a raw, unpolished urban life.","title":"Repairing 5th street south","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["553616","545074","547094","556447","554042","555561","556391","554827","556185","546023","546032","551925","547218","544161","553623","557388"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["worker","hose","platform","permeate","cleaning","flatbed","grip","construction","protection","need"]}
