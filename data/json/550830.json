{"path":"550830.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a youthful and carefree moment in a serene natural setting. The main focal point is a young boy hanging from a thick rope swing that is suspended from a gnarled and sturdy tree branch overhanging a river. He is in mid-swing with his back to the camera, appearing to be joyfully swinging toward the river. The boy is wearing black shorts, and his bare back highlights his youthful energy and the uninhibited nature of childhood play. His posture suggests he is fully engaged in the thrill of the moment, perhaps preparing to let go and plunge into the water.\n\nIn the foreground of the river, another individual, only partially visible, is swimming. This person's head and shoulders are shown above the water line, facing toward the swinging boyâ€”possibly watching him or waiting their turn for the swing.\n\nThe setting is quite picturesque, typical of a peaceful, natural riverside environment. The river itself is calm, reflecting the lush greenery of the overhanging trees. The background reveals dense, green foliage, contributing to a sense of seclusion and a retreat into nature.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rich colors and dynamic action, evokes a nostalgic sense of summer days spent enjoying the outdoors and the simple pleasures of childhood.","title":"Enjoying the old swimming hole in the Dells area of the Wisconsin River.
