{"path":"545521.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph portrays a highly textured composition consisting of natural elements arranged on a scratched and worn wooden surface. The wooden backdrop is dark brownish-red and exhibits numerous scratches and scribbles, adding a rustic and distressed appearance to the image.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there are three thin, straight twigs aligned horizontally across the frame. They are spaced in parallel with one another, creating a simple yet graceful linear pattern.\n\nAdditionally, on the lower right hand corner, there is a single grass-like plant with thin leaves fanning out from a central stem. Its delicate structure contrasts with the ruggedness of the wooden background and the stark straight lines formed by the twigs.\n\nThe overall composition has an organic feel, accentuating the interplay between nature and a man-made or altered surface. The arrangement might evoke a sense of calm or contemplation about the coexistence of natural elements with human impacts. The photograph is simple yet evocative, drawing attention to textures and forms in a subtle display of natural beauty.","title":"Weeds outlined against a bridge abutment","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["546156","555052","555063","555194","555185","551355","555059","545288","557583","557620","555188","555183","555016","555082","557169","543549"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["twig","scratch","parallel","stem","ruggedness","coexistence","calm","contemplation","display","arrangement"]}
