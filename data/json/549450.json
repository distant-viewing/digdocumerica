{"path":"549450.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene camping scene by a river, surrounded by rugged hills. In the foreground, a small red-and-white tent is prominently pitched on a patch of dry grass, suggesting an outdoor adventure. Beyond the tent, toward the river's edge, several inflatable rafts lie on the shore, indicating water-based activities are part of the campers' experience.\n\nThe river itself is calm, reflecting the surrounding hills and sparse vegetation on its surface, enhancing the peacefulness of the setting. Several people are gathered in the middle distance, near a group of trees that provide some shade in an otherwise exposed environment. They appear to be engaged in typical camping activities, possibly organizing equipment or preparing a meal, as suggested by what looks like a cooler and other supplies around them.\n\nThe background is dominated by steep hills, which curve around the river, creating a secluded and intimate atmosphere for the campsite. The hills are mostly barren with some low brush, emphasizing the rugged and remote location of the camp. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on recreational and leisure activities in a natural setting, conveys a sense of escape and adventure.","title":"Morning at campsite on snake river in hells canyon.
