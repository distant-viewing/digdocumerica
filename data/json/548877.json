{"path":"548877.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an agricultural setting, showing a large irrigation system in operation, watering a grassy field. In the foreground, a tractor is visible, with a person inside operating or driving it. The tractor is towing some equipment, perhaps related to the irrigation system itself.\n\nThe middle of the image is dominated by a long irrigation system, possibly a center pivot or linear move irrigation system, with sprinklers that are actively spraying water across the field. This creates an effect of mist and water droplets dispersed in the air under the sunlight.\n\nThe background features a range of mountains, which appear slightly blurred possibly due to the atmospheric conditions or the camera focus being on the foreground. The overall scene is set under a clear or slightly hazy sky, suggesting a sunny day, conducive for farm operations.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the contrast between the technological elements (tractor and irrigation system) and the natural landscape (the grassy field and mountains). This juxtaposition highlights the interaction between human agricultural activity and the natural environment.","title":"Farming in the parker valley area","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548875","548869","548950","548991","549178","546825","543650","553432","546949","553652","552577","544888","548953","547436","554014","555874"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","system","tractor","field","tow","spraie","conducive","operation","droplet","disperse"]}
