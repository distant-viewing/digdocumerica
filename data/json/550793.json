{"path":"550793.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph focuses on a cluster of pinkish-purple flowers, which appear to be a wild variety, perhaps Joe-Pye weed, characterized by their fluffy, dense clusters of tiny flowers atop sturdy, reddish-green stems surrounded by lush green leaves. The depth of field is shallow, focusing primarily on the flowers in the foreground and rendering the background softly blurred. The background hints at a natural, serene setting with muted tones of greens and browns suggesting a woodland or a meadow. The lighting suggests this image was taken on a bright day, contributing to the vividness of the plant colors and the overall fresh, lively feel of the scene. There are no people or human-made objects in the frame; the entire composition celebrates the beauty and complexity of natural flora.","title":"Wild flowers","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["557190","554595","547613","542970","555024","545291","550781","545707","557167","554574","549230","544875","547642","557098","553366","550462"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","celebrate","cluster","render","weed","meadow","woodland","stem","vividness","flora"]}
