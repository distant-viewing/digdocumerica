{"path":"554938.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph displays three men standing in a dimly lit, rustic setting that appears to be a workshop or shed. Each man is wearing a cowboy hat, which lends a rural or Western feel to the image.\n\nThe man on the left is wearing a bright yellow shirt with the top buttons undone and a neckerchief loosely tied around his neck. His jeans are fitted, and he is leaning slightly against the corrugated metal wall with a serious expression.\n\nThe middle man stands upright with his hands in the pockets of his light blue jeans. He is dressed in a green jacket with white and yellow trim on the cuffs and collar, layered over a darker shirt. His hat is tilted back slightly on his head, and he has a relaxed posture.\n\nOn the right, the third man is standing in a doorway, where he is partly obscured by shadows, creating a mysterious aura. He wears a vivid green shirt and darker pants. His belt is visible, and he stands with his legs slightly apart, projecting confidence.\n\nThe environment is quite textured and has a handmade quality. The metal walls and pillars, the rough wooden surfaces, and the visible tools contribute to an atmosphere of a working area. The dim, natural lighting filters in from outside, casting deep shadows and highlighting areas of the interior. The mood is serious and subdued, with a focus on the rugged individualism of the characters portrayed.","title":"Workers from Mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557145","546072","557856","545984","553516","554860","557042","557907","556440","552752","551300","557867","547344","557043","549199","549120"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["man","jean","cuff","outside","aura","shirt","hat","pocket","wall","filter"]}
