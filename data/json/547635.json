{"path":"547635.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene primarily composed of lush green foliage interspersed with clusters of small white flowers. The plants, which have broad, ovate leaves and are likely a type of ground cover, seem to be flourishing around and over a large stone or boulder. The rock itself is a significant presence in the image, exhibiting a rough texture with patches of moss or lichen in various shades of green and gray, hinting at long exposure to the elements.\n\nThe organic spread of the leaves and flowers across the rock creates a dynamic yet harmonious interplay between the flora and the rugged stone surface. This interplay is further emphasized by the soft, natural lighting that illuminates the scene, likely suggesting an overcast or shaded environment typically found in wooded or forested areas. This setting evokes a sense of tranquility and the simplicity of nature undisturbed by human activity.","title":"Canada mayflower","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554596","554572","555040","558086","544435","558083","553358","543185","555212","545703","551331","547646","543549","554991","554554","550536"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["interplay","flourish","stone","flower","lichen","rock","leave","boulder","flora","moss"]}
