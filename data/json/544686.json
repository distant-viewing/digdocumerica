{"path":"544686.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, most likely of a salt pond or a similar water body used for mineral extraction. The image features two distinct bodies of water separated by a narrow land bridge, under which a conduit or small bridge allows the passage of water. The foreground water appears bright red, suggesting the presence of microorganisms that thrive in high-salinity environments or due to chemical additives.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the land includes a platform containing electrical or mechanical equipment, hinting at some industrial activity connected with either the management or monitoring of the water conditions. In the background, spanning the width of the photograph, are high-voltage power lines supported by tall metal towers, emphasizing the industrial nature of the setting.\n\nThe sky is clear, suggesting a sunny, calm day, which enhances the reflection of light on the water's colored surfaces. The photograph has an eerie tranquility, with its vivid colors and industrial fixtures standing stark against the natural landscape. The lack of human presence, vegetation, or wildlife gives the scene a somewhat desolate ambiance, emphasizing the modification and usage of the natural environment by human activity.","title":"Leslie salt ponds at sunset. \"Water stinks,\" writes the photographer about this scene.","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544692","548600","544702","552427","544527","545627","544675","555860","544782","544569","544289","548774","544695","550753","546208","548602"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["water","bridge","voltage","modification","conduit","salt","land","width","thrive","monitoring"]}
