{"path":"548857.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an electronic workshop scene from presumably the late 20th century, based on the style of the equipment and the overall ambiance. Two men are seen deeply engaged in work amid a cluttered and equipment-filled environment.\n\nThe older man on the left, balding with dark hair on the sides, is wearing a light beige, short-sleeve shirt and is seen scribbling something on a piece of paper. He appears to be in conversation with the younger man, who is bent over an open electronic device that he is working on with a screwdriver. The younger man has dark brown hair and is wearing a blue shirt.\n\nThe room is densely packed with various electronic testing and assembly equipment. On the table and shelves around them, there is a multitude of tools, parts, open manuals, scattered papers, and multiple pieces of electronic test equipment like oscilloscopes, signal generators, and power supplies. There are several pieces of equipment that are disassembled, suggesting they are possibly being repaired or modified.\n\nOverall, the setting is busy, somewhat disorganized, and reflective of an active electronics workshop where hardware maintenance or innovation is underway.\n","title":"Laboratory at EPA's National Research Center at Las Vegas environmental gamma radiation monitors are checked before shipment.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549367","556557","552380","555334","542765","545952","549378","556314","542659","548855","546628","552356","558356","549627","549684","552377"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["equipment","workshop","piece","paper","hardware","test","man","signal","testing","assembly"]}
