{"path":"543451.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a serene natural setting focusing on a cluster of eye-catching red flowers set against a subdued backdrop of dark evergreen trees. The flowers, vibrant and towering, appear to be a species of wildflower with slender stalks topped with elongated, conical blooms. These flowers stand prominently in a patch of tall, dark green grass.\n\nIn the background, the dense coniferous trees lend a deep green tone to the scene, enhancing the rich contrast with the bright red of the flowers. These trees, of varying heights, create a textured and layered appearance, suggesting a wild or natural forest environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph provides a sense of isolation for the red flowers, emphasizing their vivid color and distinctive shape amidst a more monochromatic and darker background. The lighting appears to be natural, likely overcast, contributing to the saturated colors and somber mood of the setting. The focus and shallow depth of field further isolate the flowers, making them the clear focal point of the image.","title":"California -- big basin, redwoods state park","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California","nn1":["542615","553074","550536","550459","544875","549230","553588","545723","545703","544574","545847","555186","547642","550479","545718","542610"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stalk","wildflower","specie","isolate","bloom","lend","height","catch","red"]}
