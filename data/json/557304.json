{"path":"557304.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial plant with multiple structures dedicated to manufacturing or processing functions. In the foreground, there are large cylindrical storage tanks and structures covered with metallic surfaces, noticeably aged and weathered, showing signs of rust and usage. Some of these tanks have external staircases winding around them, likely for maintenance access.\n\nA towering smokestack extends into the sky, emitting a thick stream of smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. Adjacent to these structures are intricate networks of pipes and conduits, connecting various sections of the facility, indicative of a complex manufacturing process.\n\nThe composition is set against a clear blue sky, which creates a stark contrast with the industrial foreground. This highlights the industrial might against a seemingly serene environmental backdrop. The image captures both the robust infrastructure of the industrial age and the environmental impact of such facilities.","title":"Wet scrubbers (center of photo) were installed in a $42 million environment improvement project at the Phillips Power Station owned by the Duquesne Light Company and located on the Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh. Some corrosion difficulties were experienced with the scrubbers during the shakedown phase.","placename":"Beaver County (Pa.)","location":"Beaver County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546143","544691","549960","552003","548195","546005","545236","549713","550184","548376","550328","545920","557302","544495","550344","552689"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["manufacturing","tank","might","conduit","facility","staircase","dedicate","usage","rust","function"]}
