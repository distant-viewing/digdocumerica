{"path":"546964.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural activity within a lush, green field. Several individuals, approximately eight, are busy at work harvesting crops under the daylight. Each worker is bending over or crouching among rows of dense, leafy plants, which might be vegetables or a similar type of crop. The workers are equipped with baskets that are used for collecting the harvested produce.\n\nIn the background, there is a traditional house partially obscured by the dense foliage, hinting at a rural setting. The house is flanked by tall, mature trees which add to the pastoral ambiance of the scene. Additionally, a couple of parked cars next to the house suggest the proximity of a road or driveway, further establishing the location as accessible yet secluded.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vibrant greenery and focus on agricultural labor, evokes a sense of serene rural life, punctuated by the hard work associated with farming and harvest. The photograph appears to be taken from a distance, possibly from the edge of the field, and uses natural light which enhances the vivid colors of the plants and the outdoor environment.","title":"Picking beans on John's Island","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557478","543481","549050","553879","543845","553659","557696","548900","544548","554108","557520","554054","543454","543858","543157","543324"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crop","house","worker","produce","harvest","vegetable","driveway","basket","field","work"]}
