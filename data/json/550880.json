{"path":"550880.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph features a stark, industrial scene showing a large accumulation of compacted waste or scrap materials. The materials are bundled into dense, square bales, stacked into towering piles that dominate the composition. The bales are wrapped in what appears to be a flimsy, white plastic material, many of which are torn, exposing the contents. The scene is set in a muddy and seemingly derelict area, evidenced by the rough and uneven ground scattered with debris and small bodies of standing water reflecting a grey sky.\n\nIn the center of the image, between the two massive stacks of baled material, you can see what looks like a simple, shed-like structure with a dark, open entrance leading to a conveyor belt. This suggests some sort of processing or sorting operation is ongoing, possibly related to the management or recycling of these materials.\n\nThe photograph's background offers minimal detail, mostly a flat, overcast sky and indistinct features that suggest an industrial or outskirts setting. The overall mood is somewhat bleak and utilitarian, emphasizing themes of waste management, recycling, and environmental impact associated with industrial processes.","title":"Bales of stock at the Fort Howard Paper Company form paper pyramids on the banks of Green Bay","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554358","550882","550881","547611","545059","554301","547062","557308","550265","547899","549750","547971","547610","548315","554318","546256"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["bale","material","recycling","waste","management","scrap","accumulation","outskirt","sort","shed"]}
