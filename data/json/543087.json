{"path":"543087.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a serene landscape predominantly characterized by water and a striking bridge. The bridge, perhaps made of wood and supported by numerous columns, extends linearly across the image from the bottom left corner towards the right. Its shadow, elongated and defined, casts a striking dark line parallel to the bridge itself, suggesting the time of day is either early morning or late afternoon when shadows are longer due to the low angle of the sun.\n\nThe body of water is calm, reflecting a moody, dusky light that infuses the scene with a bluish hue, perhaps indicative of twilight or a cloudy day. On the left side of the bridge, the water transitions into a shore or sandbar, which is textured and curved, creating gentle, abstract patterns that contrast with the smoothness of the open water. These sand patterns are interspersed with areas of water, suggesting a dynamic landscape possibly influenced by tides or river flows. The overall tonality of the image is dark, enhancing the mysterious and tranquil nature of the scene. The absence of any human activity or additional objects lends a timeless and quiet solitude to the atmosphere captured in this photograph.","title":"Morning flight.
