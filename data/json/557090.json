{"path":"557090.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The image features a well-preserved historic white building, elaborately detailed, possibly a railway station, positioned in the foreground adjacent to some railway tracks. Its architecture includes a pitched roof, ornate trimmings around the windows and eaves, and a front porch area. This building exudes a classic, perhaps Victorian, charm.\n\nBehind and above this building, a large truss bridge, constructed of metal and employing an intricate network of triangular bracings, stretches across the frame. The bridge is presumably used for trains, evidenced by its robust and utilitarian design, which contrasts with the delicate features of the building.\n\nIn the background, beyond the bridge, there is a calm body of water, possibly a river, lined with dense green foliage that hints at a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is clear and appears to be either in the late afternoon or early evening light, providing a calm and tranquil atmosphere.\n\nThe combination of architectural and engineering elements alongside the natural backdrop gives this photograph a layered and historical feel, capturing a scene that blends human-made structures harmoniously with their natural environment.","title":"Gatekeeper's house located near a bridge across the Missouri River near Atchison, Kansas.
