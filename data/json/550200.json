{"path":"550200.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a striking juxtaposition between urban life and industrial activity. In the foreground, dominating the frame, is a large, vivid red stop sign. The focus on the sign blurs the background slightly, creating a depth effect.\n\nBehind the sign, the middle ground shows residential houses, typical of an older, densely built neighborhood. These homes have steeply pitched roofs and are closely spaced, suggesting a tight-knit community layout typical of many older urban areas.\n\nIn the contrastive background, the scene shifts dramatically to industrial elements. A large structure with an intricate framework, possibly part of a factory or an industrial complex, dominates the background landscape. Beside it, a massive cooling tower releases a thick plume of smoke or steam into the air, highlighting the industrial activity.\n\nThe overall composition uses the stop sign as a powerful visual element that might symbolize a message or a warning, drawing a stark line between the residential area and the industrial backdrop. The scene is set against a clear sky which helps in emphasizing the subjects in the photograph.","title":"\"Stop\" might be the plea of Lesher Avenue residents to the Republic Steel chimney that belches smoke over their neighborhoods.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550196","550187","545388","544715","557881","551075","550203","551151","552037","552014","551146","551152","551074","551072","551145","552156"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["stop","sign","warning","message","plume","framework","steam","layout","neighborhood","complex"]}
