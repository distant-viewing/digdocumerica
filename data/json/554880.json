{"path":"554880.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene involving a group of people and livestock, likely taking place on a farm or ranch. In the foreground, a man wearing a light-colored hat and shirt stands facing away from the camera looking towards the center of the action. He stands at the entrance of a muddy livestock pen made from rough, wooden poles and logs, giving a rustic appearance to the enclosure.\n\nInside the pen, a large group of sheep crowds together, contained within the makeshift fencing. To the right, a red metal gate—brighter and more modern compared to the wooden logs—seems to be another entryway into the pen.\n\nScattered around and in the pen, several individuals wear cowboy hats, indicating their roles as ranchers or farmers. They seem engaged in managing or observing the sheep, with some standing within the pen and others just outside it.\n\nThe scene is set in a rural area with large trees in the background and an open grassy area beyond the confines of the pen. The overall environment suggests a working farm or ranch setting, focused on livestock management. The cloudy sky adds to a temperate and somewhat overcast atmosphere, typical of a busy day outdoors in rural agricultural life.","title":"Sheep being herded toward loading pens on a ranch in the Leakey, Texas, area near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554886","554894","554883","554881","547396","544391","554882","552573","543690","547326","552569","554887","552568","554885","548959","554928"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["pen","livestock","ranch","sheep","farm","log","confine","farmer","entryway","fencing"]}
