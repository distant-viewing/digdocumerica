{"path":"547277.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an older man standing on a gravel road, directly facing the camera. He is dressed in a work attire that includes a pair of dark blue denim overalls worn over a dark button-up shirt, which is left partially unbuttoned at the top. His attire is complemented by an emblematic cap on his head.\n\nThis man has a rugged appearance, highlighted by his stubbled face and stern expression. The cap he wears features a red, triangular emblem. The overalls are functional with visible straps and metal clasps. His hands are tucked casually into his overalls, suggesting a pose of relaxed readiness or a short break from work.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears to be a small-town or rural setting, characterized by a wide, unbusy street. A vintage blue car is parked on the side of the street, and a few scattered buildings, possibly commercial, can be seen in the far distance under a clear sky. The general ambiance is calm and quiet, typical of a less urban locale.","title":"Charlie Gross, man of many trades, faces the camera on Grafton's main street.
