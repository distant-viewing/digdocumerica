{"path":"553163.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a dynamic and contrasting scene set in an outdoor urban environment. On the left, a large bronze statue of a reclining figure is prominently displayed. The statue appears classic in style, depicting a muscular figure lounging with one arm resting on its head and legs bent in a relaxed pose. Its surface is glossy, showing variations in color due to light reflection and patination.\n\nIn the foreground, a young man is walking from right to left. He is dressed in a business-casual manner with a blue blazer and red pants. His attire is neat, and he is carrying what seems like a bag over his right shoulder, indicating he might be headed to work or a similar engagement. His gaze is directed straight ahead, and his expression is serious.\n\nIn the background, another figure can be seen walking away from the scene. This person is wearing a light-colored hat and darker clothes, adding a sense of depth and movement to the composition.\n\nThe background is relatively dark and nondescript, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the statue and the people in the scene. The contrast between the soft, flowing lines of the statue and the crisp, modern clothing of the young man creates a juxtaposition between classical art and contemporary life. The lighting in the photo enhances this effect, highlighting the figures against the darker background.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553281","546512","553769","549676","546520","552736","549370","551856","551830","553270","546508","552971","547821","551646","548288","558269"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["statue","figure","bronze","head","lounge","blazer","walk","art","manner","variation"]}
