{"path":"549431.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph features an elegant, traditional sailing ship cruising on a body of water, presumably the sea or a large lake, given the expanse of the water visible. The ship is substantial in size and has a classic design, equipped with several large sails that appear fully billowed, suggesting a strong wind. The sails are set on two main masts that tower over the deck. \n\nThe hull of the ship is dark-colored and robust, indicating that it might be a vintage or historically styled vessel. The ship flies a flag from its rear pole, displaying vivid colors, though specific details of the flag are hard to discern due to the angle and distance.\n\nThe sea looks choppy, with moderate waves, and the sky is overcast, casting a gloomy and dramatic tone to the scene. The lack of bright sunlight enhances the mood, focusing attention on the texture and form of the billowing sails and the sturdy build of the ship. In the distant background, vague landforms and other smaller sailing crafts can be seen, suggesting this photograph may have been taken in a populated or navigated area.\n\nThe composition of the photograph shows the ship captured from a side angle, which allows a full view of its sails and the curve of its structure as it leans slightly due to the wind's force. The perspective gives the viewer a sense of both the motion through the water and the strength of the nautical elements at play.","title":"Schooner on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547467","547459","549395","544667","549396","549403","549394","548498","547461","547452","544234","549405","549413","549432","547463","555721"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ship","sail","sailing","billow","flag","wind","angle","sea","strength","cruise"]}
