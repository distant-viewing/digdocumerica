{"path":"544346.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural scene centered around a beautiful waterfall cascading into a clear, turquoise pool. The waterfall, framed by rugged, stony cliffs partially covered with green vegetation, falls dramatically from a considerable height. Below, the waterfall feeds into a serene pool which appears to be a popular spot for relaxation and recreation.\n\nIn the foreground, various cacti and dry earth suggest a somewhat arid climate. A leafless tree also stands near the water's edge, adding to the natural, untouched feel of the landscape. The shoreline around the pool is sandy and scattered with towels, bags, and a few people enjoying the setting. Some individuals are visible in the water, appearing to be swimming or wading near the waterfall's base.\n\nOverall, the composition and the vivid colors captured in the image — the deep blues of the water, the earthy tones of the cliffs and the sandy shore, along with the greenery clinging to the rocks — create a picturesque and inviting scene, suggesting an idyllic spot for nature lovers.","title":"Bathers enjoy the Havasu Falls.
