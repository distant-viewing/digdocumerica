{"path":"545001.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic landscape viewed from a high vantage point. The foreground is framed by dense greenery, consisting mainly of coniferous trees and some broadleaf shrubs. Through the gaps between the foliage, a vast panoramic view opens up.\n\nIn the middle ground, the landscape extends into a broad valley or coastal plain, which appears partly cultivated or developed, with areas that could be either fields or patches of cleared land. Several buildings or industrial structures are vaguely visible amidst the panorama, though details are not very clear due to the distance and possibly haze.\n\nThe view extends to a body of water which meets the horizon, suggesting this might be a coastal area. The sky, mostly clear, shows gentle gradations of blue, indicating a serene, possibly sunny day. A distant mountain range on the other side of the water body faintly outlines the horizon, adding a sense of depth and scale to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and natural framing by the trees in the foreground evoke a feeling of viewing a secluded, possibly remote landscape from a hidden or less-accessible spot. The photograph captures a tranquil moment, emphasizing the expansive beauty of the natural environment and its contrast with human developments seen from afar.","title":"Pulp mill air pollution","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548025","557003","557107","556906","556937","556907","550604","549150","550541","550356","554695","554647","552143","556931","553778","557531"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["panorama","gradation","cultivate","cleared","gap","view","plain","framing","extend","horizon"]}
