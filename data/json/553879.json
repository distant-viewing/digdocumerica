{"path":"553879.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a group of agricultural workers in a field activity. There are seven individuals visible, actively engaged in hoeing a crop field. The field boasts well-spaced rows of short, leafy green plants under a bright blue sky, suggesting good weather conditions.\n\nEach worker is equipped with a long-handled hoe, and they are dressed appropriately for fieldwork; their outfits include wide-brimmed hats and light-colored clothing, likely to protect them from the sun. Their faces are mostly obscured, either by their hats or by protective cloths wrapped around their heads, emphasizing their focus on protecting themselves from sun exposure.\n\nThe workers exhibit a range of motions, as some are captured mid-step and others are bent over, working the soil around the plants. This dynamic scene conveys a sense of active, physical labor.\n\nIn the background, the field extends towards a flat horizon, where a small structure can be spotted, likely related to the farm's operations. The overall atmosphere of the image portrays a tough, hands-on agricultural endeavor carried out under clear and open sky conditions, highlighting a day of productive labor in what appears to be a vast and well-maintained farm landscape.","title":"Weeding sugar beets near Fort Collins.
