{"path":"545398.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a street scene likely captured in an industrial or working-class neighborhood. In the background are tall factory stacks, which dominate the skyline, suggesting proximity to industrial facilities, possibly a steel mill or similar type of factory. These stacks are not emitting smoke in the image, indicating they might be inactive at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe foreground shows a rugged street lined with modest, single-story wooden houses. The houses have front porches, and their sidings show signs of wear, indicating age and exposure to harsh environmental conditions, likely from the nearby industrial activity. This setting hints at economic challenges faced by the residents.\n\nOn the street, there are several people, appearing to involve children engaged in play and adults in conversation or leisure activities. Specifically, three children are in the middle of the street: one is running across, and the other two appear to be watching or waiting. Their casual clothing and activities suggest a spontaneous, everyday moment among neighborhood kids.\n\nAn adult stands on the left side of the frame, partially obscured in shadow, seeming to watch over the children or simply observing the street. Another person is visible near the center-right, standing beside a white car parked outside one of the houses. This person is engaging with others who are not fully visible in the frame.\n\nThe image is set in the early evening or late afternoon hours, indicated by the long shadows and soft, fading light, which contributes to the atmosphere of a quiet, possibly weekend day in a close-knit community setting.","title":"Housing adjacent to u.s.
