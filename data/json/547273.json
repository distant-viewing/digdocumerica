{"path":"547273.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a quiet and tranquil scene focused on a small sailboat on a body of water. Two people are visible in the boat; they appear to be seated and perhaps navigating or controlling the boat as it sails. The sail of the boat is mostly white, with the sailcloth looking a bit aged and slightly crumpled, possibly indicating gentle winds or the sail not being fully taut.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, lush green grassy area, sloping up gently from the edge of the water. The gradient of the land suggests a peaceful, rural, or park-like setting, possibly a riverbank or lake edge. The topography behind the sailboat features what might be a sand bank or mudflat, and it separates the green grassy area from the water, adding a natural textural contrast to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the image places the sailboat off-center, enhancing the calm and laid-back nature of the scene. The lighting appears natural and soft, possibly indicative of a mild, sunny day. The image evokes a sense of leisure and the simple pleasure of a day spent sailing.","title":"Saturday sail in Holmes Park","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["544224","552345","548521","551539","548118","544669","547757","547754","549411","552039","557416","549417","544667","547781","548733","552343"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","boat","mudflat","pleasure","topography","sailing","edge","calm","gradient"]}
