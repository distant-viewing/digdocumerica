{"path":"556846.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station. One main subject is a train, likely a passenger train, that is composed of multiple cars, stopped along a platform. The particular car in the foreground has a visible stairs and a closed door, and is painted with vibrant stripes, possibly red and blue, down its side, adding a decorative and possibly functional element (such as indicating a specific train line or service).\n\nA man stands by the train, near the stairs, wearing a dark uniform that suggests he could either be a train conductor or a railway worker. He appears to be in the act of reaching or holding onto a handle on the door of the train, perhaps preparing to open it or ensuring it is secure.\n\nThe setting includes overhead railway lines and supported by tall structures, indicating a well-used and possibly urban train station. The platform is paved with cobblestones, adding a textural detail to the scene. In the background, there are additional infrastructure elements visible like other railway tracks, more trains in the distance, and industrial bridges or overpasses, suggesting the larger scale of the railway system and adding a somewhat gritty, industrial feel to the location. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, and contributing to a slightly subdued mood in the image.","title":"Amtrak train backs up to hook up with passenger cars at harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

There it splits into sections for the nation's capital and New York city.  The train has a history of late arrivals.
