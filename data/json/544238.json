{"path":"544238.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene at sunset. The image features two large vessels on the water; the one in the foreground appears to be a dredger, dispersing large quantities of sand into the sea, creating a mound that partially submerges the vessel. The other, a barge-like boat, is equipped with a cabin and visible deck lights, possibly serving a support function or transporting goods or personnel.\n\nIn the foreground, seen from behind aboard another boat, are two individuals observing the scene. Both individuals are dressed casually, one wearing a striped shirt and the other in a dark top, suggesting a relaxed or informal setting. The observer on the right seems to be holding onto the boat's railing, likely for stability or as a relaxed posture while watching.\n\nThe water is choppy, indicating some movement or activity in the water, enhancing the dynamic feel of the image. The sky displays a gradient of purple and blue hues, denoting the time as either dawn or dusk, which adds a serene yet industrious tone to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of industrial activity with a calm, picturesque natural backdrop, creating a striking contrast between human intervention and the natural environment.","title":"Louisiana--Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544251","543411","544234","547561","544655","544247","543956","547110","545170","545015","545055","550941","547559","543143","547553","547549"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","vessel","stability","personnel","quantity","denote","observer","disperse","intervention","barge"]}
