{"path":"544551.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and natural waterway scene, possibly in the Everglades, marked by a large advertisement sign. The image is slightly faded, suggesting it may be a bit old or taken on film.\n\nAt the center is a prominent sign that reads \"4 TIGER'S BOAT AIR RIDES\" in large white letters on a green background. Below, the sign continues with \"VISIT INDIAN CAMP DEEP IN EVERGLADES.\" The sign is presumably advertising airboat rides that offer tours deep into the Everglades, possibly focusing on visiting native camps.\n\nThe sign is positioned amid lush, dense greenery typical of wetland environments. Various types of vegetation, including tall grasses and dense shrubs or small trees, surround the sign, providing a natural frame. Below the sign is the calm, reflective surface of the water, mirroring the sign and some of the surrounding foliage, enhancing the serene and untouched feel of the scene.\n\nNo people are visible in the image; the focus is strictly on nature and the advertisement sign. The sky above is partly cloudy with soft, fluffy clouds scattered across, suggesting good weather, likely contributing to the peaceful ambiance of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a blend of human advertisement within a vast natural landscape, highlighting the contrast between human activity (tourism) and the natural world.","title":"Housing development in South Miami Heights","placename":"Miami (Fla.)","location":"Miami, Florida","nn1":["544288","553085","544533","544532","545008","554169","552108","546339","550660","548670","546061","547865","557972","551216","548730","550834"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","advertisement","visit","tourism","tour","advertise","world","film","wetland","continue"]}
