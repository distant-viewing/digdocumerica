{"path":"554685.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor setting that seems to be a temporary campsite. There are three men in the scene, each dressed differently, suggesting a casual, possibly work-related gathering in a rural area. \n\nStarting from the left, there's a large makeshift shelter made with a tarp, supported by wooden poles. Underneath it, various items like clothes and possibly camping gear are hung up. Right in front of this shelter, one man stands with a broad grin, dressed in bright red coveralls and a red hat, looking directly at the camera. He seems relaxed and possibly joking as indicated by his cheerful pose and facial expression. \n\nCentrally in the photo, a small campfire burns on the ground. Another man, also in red attire but wearing a jacket, stands further back. He has a more restrained smile and his hands tucked in his jacket pockets.\n\nTowards the right, there's a row of vehicles parked on a grassy area. The predominant one is a red pickup truck, with its tailgate open, showing a neatly arranged portable stove or grill set-up for cooking. A man in a dark jacket and jeans stands by the back of this truck, appearing quite serious and less engaged with the camera than the other two. \n\nThe background is lined with tall pine trees and a trailer, suggesting that this location could be a field or a forest clearing meant for temporary stays, possibly for work like logging or a scientific field study. The ground is muddy, indicating recent rain or a generally damp locale.\n\nOverall, the photograph seems to depict a moment of light-hearted reprieve in an outdoor, possibly work-related setting, with a focus on camaraderie and outdoor living conditions.","title":"Hunters waiting for warm coffee at a Stillwater Road public campsite in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
