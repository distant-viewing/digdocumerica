{"path":"547718.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of scientific fieldwork beside a river. The setting is a bright, sunny day with clear skies. Two men are featured prominently in the image, engaged in water monitoring activities.\n\nThe man in the foreground is focused on a small, boxy instrument, possibly a data logger or measurement device, that he is holding in his hands. He wears a dark shirt and eyeglasses, and his attention is concentrated on the device.\n\nThe man in the background is squatting near the water's edge. He is wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants, possibly jeans. He appears to be collecting a water sample or possibly adjusting equipment in the water, as he reaches toward the surface.\n\nThe background shows a dense tree line on the opposite bank of the river, suggesting a remote or natural location. The river itself is calm with some small ripples on the surface, reflecting the sunlight. Rocks and boulders are visible at the waterâ€™s edge where the men are working, adding a rugged texture to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a focused, professional environmental study or sampling effort, highlighting the men's active engagement in environmental science or river ecology.","title":"California fish and game biologists take water samples from the Colorado river at \"goose flats\" in the Palo Verde Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549059","552110","546307","546331","546334","546300","546343","549628","556991","548882","548956","551416","554848","548310","550962","549052"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["river","device","man","sampling","science","eyeglass","fieldwork","datum","squat","measurement"]}
