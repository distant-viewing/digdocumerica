{"path":"548738.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in a fishing activity at sea. The foremost man, slightly turned to the left, is wearing sunglasses, a white cap, and a light-colored short-sleeve shirt. He holds a fishing rod in his right hand, gripping it tightly near the reel. His posture and grip suggest that he is in the process of fishing, possibly waiting for a catch or reeling one in. \n\nThe man behind him also wears a white cap and glasses, with a short beard and mustache, dressed in a similar light-colored, possibly white shirt. He appears to be looking towards the horizon or the water, possibly watching for fish or observing the surrounding sea conditions. His expression and body language indicate attentiveness to the fishing activity.\n\nThe background is predominantly blue, indicative of a large body of water, possibly the ocean, under a clear or slightly overcast sky. The focus on the individuals suggests a calm maritime setting, suitable for fishing. The overall tone of the image is serene, highlighting a leisure activity that requires patience and concentration.","title":"Two native floridians fishing at spanish harbor key.
