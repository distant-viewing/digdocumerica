{"path":"557185.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, rural landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the soft lighting and purple hues in the sky. The scene is dominated by rolling hills in the background that create a soothing, undulating horizon. These hills are partly covered in shadows, emphasizing the gentle contours of the terrain. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a rustic setting that includes a small graveyard. The focus is on a central gravestone, which is clearly marked and stands out due to its dark, polished surface contrasted against the natural tones of the setting. Surrounding the gravestone are other less visible markers and possibly memorials, scattered among the neatly kept grass of the cemetery.\n\nOn the far left, a barren tree devoid of leaves draws attention, suggesting a change in season or the harsh conditions often faced in rural environments. Adjacent to it, a wire fence running parallel to the scene helps frame the cemetery and separates it from the open landscape. \n\nIn terms of flora, the area around the fence is overgrown with tall, wild grass, which sways slightly in what one can imagine to be a gentle breeze. This grassy area adds a natural, untamed quality to the foreground, contrasting with the well-maintained grave site.\n\nThe sky above is dramatic, with scattered clouds tinged with purple and pink, reflecting the light of the sun which is below the horizon. The overall effect is peaceful and somewhat solemn, with a strong sense of solitude and the passage of time.","title":"A prairie cemetery with tall grass growing along the fence in Wabaunsee County, Kansas, near Manhattan, in the heart of the Flint Hills region. Cemeteries are very good places to find the original plants of the tallgrass prairie. The county is one of the sites under consideration for a tallgrass prairie national park. There is a bill in Congress for such a park, but it faces opposition and has not been reported from committee.","placename":"Manhattan (Kan.)","location":"Manhattan, Kansas","nn1":["557184","554790","554824","557089","553809","550731","554801","557013","557182","558040","552683","554792","557519","547337","557023","545322"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["gravestone","cemetery","fence","sway","tinge","marker","breeze","hill","grass","undulate"]}
