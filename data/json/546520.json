{"path":"546520.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy standing next to a large, vertical abstract sculpture in an outdoor setting. The sculpture, which dominates the left side of the image, appears to be weathered and made of a rough material, possibly stone or concrete. It has a curvaceous, elongated form that tapers towards the top.\n\nThe boy, positioned on the right side of the frame, is leaning casually against the sculpture, his body facing towards the right. He wears a long-sleeved, dark red or maroon sweater and dark pants. His hair is short and light-colored, and he wears light-colored sneakers. His facial expression is not clearly visible, but he seems to be looking out towards something off-camera.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred and features a paved area, possibly a plaza, with hints of greenery and parts of a building or structure visible in the far distance. The lighting suggests it might be midday, contributing to the shadows and the overall mood of casual, everyday life captured in the moment. The composition blends elements of human interaction with art and urban environment, creating a scene that feels both contemplative and spontaneous.","title":"Henry Moore's sculpture \"Large Arch,\" which was installed in the library plaza in 1971.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546512","551693","553281","551476","553163","553494","546516","553278","551662","546504","553192","543476","553553","549674","553769","553254"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sculpture","boy","taper","sneaker","plaza","art","midday","concrete","sweater","lean"]}
