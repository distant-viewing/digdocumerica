{"path":"546228.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a lakeside scene featuring three children and an adult engaged in leisure activities. The foreground shows shallow lake water, where a young child is standing submerged up to his waist. Further out on the water, another child floats on a colorful striped inflatable mat, while a woman in a striped top tends to a third child on a red inflatable raft. The woman is adjusting or holding the raft, ensuring its stability.\n\nIn the background, across the lake, a large industrial skyline is visible under a hazy sky. This industrial landscape includes tall gray silos, a metal structure, and a distant water tower, all suggesting the presence of a manufacturing or processing facility, giving a contrast between the recreational foreground and the industrial backdrop. The overall ambiance conveyed by the fog or haze indicates a humid or hot day. The composition of the photograph through the use of vibrant recreational inflatables in the forefront juxtaposes the muted, industrial structures in the distance, emphasizing the blend of natural and industrial elements within the scene.","title":"Chemical plants near swimming area","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546227","546145","546220","544278","550937","546219","553445","554499","551959","553442","553446","553431","544712","558233","550827","543881"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["child","raft","mat","stability","lake","waist","silo","woman","manufacturing","forefront"]}
