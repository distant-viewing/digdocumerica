{"path":"543809.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic outdoor landscape, primarily characterized by a large, serene body of water surrounded by rugged terrain. In the foreground, there's an uneven shoreline made of rocks and sparse vegetation, including some small trees and dried bushes. A partially snow-covered corrugated pipe leads into the water, creating a striking contrast with the natural environment.\n\nThe body of water appears calm, reflecting the surrounding hills and the cloudy blue sky above. On the left, the landscape ascends steeply forming a rocky hillside with patches of snow and some coniferous trees scattered around. This hillside slopes upward to an elevation where a facility or large building is positioned. The structure is outfitted with numerous windows and appears industrial or commercial, possibly a ski resort or processing plant, given the cold, mountainous environment.\n\nA road cuts through the landscape, curving around the water body and hill, leading up to and beneath the facility. The road adds a man-made element to the otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe background reveals more mountainous terrain and a sky dominated by large, fluffy clouds suggesting cool, possibly early spring weather conditions. Overall, the photo depicts a balance of natural beauty and human intrusion, typical of recreational or industrial areas in mountainous regions.","title":"Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. feldspar mine in Monarch Pass","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543818","543717","543761","552243","542882","554546","543652","543547","555388","551519","550641","543670","555696","543816","556928","555704"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["hillside","snow","intrusion","ski","resort","facility","body","hill","balance","water"]}
