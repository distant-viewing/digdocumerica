{"path":"553272.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph portrays a vibrant and bustling urban scene, likely during a special event or celebration. The central focus is a large number of colorful balloons being released into the sky; these balloons are in various colors including red, blue, yellow, and white, adding a festive and joyful atmosphere to the scene.\n\nOn the ground, there is a dense crowd of people surrounding several vehicles, including a yellow convertible Volkswagen Beetle from which some of the balloons appear to be released. The crowd is diverse, with men and women of various ages, some casually dressed while others are in more formal attire, suggesting the event might be significant or ceremonial.\n\nIn the background, dominating the scene are tall, modern skyscrapers with a dark, almost monolithic appearance. The buildings provide a stark, vertical contrast to the playful disorder of the floating balloons.\n\nThe event is taking place in an open, possibly pedestrianized area flanked by these high-rise buildings, hinting at a downtown or central business district location. The lighting in the photograph suggests it is a bright, sunny day, which casts shadows and adds to the contrast between the shaded areas and those illuminated by direct sunlight.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a moment of celebration and public gathering in an urban setting, underscored by a blend of architecture, community, and festivity.","title":"Fountain Square is downtown Cincinnati's popular public plaza.
