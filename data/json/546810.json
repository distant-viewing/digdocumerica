{"path":"546810.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic view of a large suspension bridge, an impressive feat of engineering spanning over a body of water, most likely a bay or a river. The bridge features two prominent towers from which cables extend to support the road deck. The bridge is quite large and extends across the frame horizontally, connecting one land area to another not visible in the image.\n\nThe design includes a distinct red-brown color for the main structure of the bridge, with the cables appearing a silvery white. Under the main span rests a smaller boat, suggesting the bridge's impressive scale and providing a sense of activity in the otherwise serene environment.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with a gentle blue hue, implying a clear or slightly overcast day. The conditions are calm, as evidenced by the smooth surface of the water, enhancing the quiet majesty of the bridge's appearance.\n\nThis composition frames human achievement in engineering harmoniously integrated into a natural setting, characterized by open skies and tranquil waters. The vintage quality of the photo, noticeable in its slight graininess and color saturation, also adds a historical or nostalgic feel to the scene.","title":"Chesapeake Bay bridges","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547669","546870","543313","552846","549547","547828","547703","557096","557959","548207","544722","552598","549068","543050","544542","549469"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","engineering","cable","graininess","achievement","suspension","span","majesty","saturation","bay"]}
