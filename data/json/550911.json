{"path":"550911.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, most likely a refinery or chemical processing facility. The foreground features large storage tanks, with some colored in vivid red and labeled \"National Molasses Company - Namolco Terminal.\" These cylindrical tanks have rounded tops, some equipped with visible piping and walkways. Behind these foreground tanks, the scene extends into an array of additional storage containers and more complex processing structures, imbued with a network of pipes, towers, and possibly distillation columns.\n\nIn the background, a multitude of similar industrial structures can be seen, characterized by their vertical design, which suggests distillation processes typical to the oil and gas industry. The skyline is filled with numerous other towers and smokestacks, emitting white steam or smoke against a clear sky. This suggests ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThe photograph is taken during daylight, with good illumination highlighting the details and metallic surfaces of the industrial equipment. The complexity of the facility suggests it is a significant operation, possibly involving the processing or storage of various chemical products. The overall composition of the photograph is dense, filled with engineered structures that emphasize the industrial theme.","title":"Storage tanks of the National Molasses Company on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550917","549960","555775","549959","555777","546221","544179","555778","551987","551982","549978","552003","545837","552131","542705","549713"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["distillation","processing","tank","storage","chemical","tower","refinery","multitude","piping","facility"]}
