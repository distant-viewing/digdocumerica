{"path":"554915.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of an older man. The man has a weathered complexion and wears a black cap and a denim shirt. He has a serious, contemplative expression on his face and is looking slightly away from the camera to the left.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but shows a rustic outdoor setting. Visible are leafless trees suggesting cooler weather or a seasonal change, possibly in a rural area. Some structures that seem to be worn or aged, potentially farm buildings or similar constructions, are partially visible in the background, adding to the rural, rustic ambiance of the scene. The soft, natural light suggests it could be during the late afternoon.","title":"Farmer who raises gamecocks near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["552103","553605","542613","547179","553091","554926","548218","543701","554846","557173","556563","544409","556443","552872","557032","552871"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["complexion","portrait","denim","close","change","up","cap","man","construction","have"]}
