{"path":"549464.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures a dynamic and exciting moment of a group of people white-water rafting. The photo shows a raft navigating through turbulent, foamy water. The raft is large, inflatable and predominantly red and white in color, with the word \"TRIUMPH\" visibly printed along its side in uppercase letters.\n\nThere are seven individuals on the raft wearing life jackets, which suggests a safety-conscious approach to this adventurous activity. Most are engaged actively with paddles in their hands, trying to steer and stabilize the raft amidst the rushing waters. Their expressions, where visible, show a mix of concentration and thrill.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene consists of rocky formations, possibly canyon walls, and these rugged features add to the dramatic setting of the rafting experience. The colors in the photograph are vivid, with the contrasting reds of the raft and equipment standing out against the natural gray and green hues of the river and its surroundings. This scene encapsulates a moment of adrenaline and teamwork in a breathtaking natural environment.","title":"Shooting Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River in Hells Canyon.
