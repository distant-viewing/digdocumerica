{"path":"545945.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental pollution along a riverbank. A large accumulation of debris, including driftwood, branches, and various types of trash such as Styrofoam pieces, plastic bottles, and other unidentifiable refuse, is gathered at a bend in the river. The water appears muddy and slightly turbid, reflecting a state of disturbance, possibly due to recent heavy rainfall or flooding which typically causes such accumulations on riverbanks.\n\nIn the background, the river extends into the distance, bordered by lush greenery on the opposite bank. Trees with dense foliage are visible, contributing to a natural yet unkempt landscape. The sky appears overcast, suggesting a somber, gloomy atmosphere which enhances the feeling of neglect and environmental degradation displayed in the scene.\n\nThis setting highlights critical environmental issues such as water pollution and the impacts of human waste on natural ecosystems. The presence of this debris not only disrupts the aesthetic value of the natural environment but also poses significant threats to wildlife and the ecological balance of the river.","title":"Garbage and trash along bank of Chattahoochee River","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["552082","550352","556419","550950","552098","551531","552100","550946","547524","544810","552811","550205","552127","552046","552080","548308"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["accumulation","riverbank","pollution","river","value","bend","refuse","driftwood","flooding","debris"]}
