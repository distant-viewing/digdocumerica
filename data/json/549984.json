{"path":"549984.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where four individuals are sitting and standing near a waterfall feature. The composition focuses on their backs, creating a peaceful and serene ambiance. In the foreground, there is a woman seated to the right, wearing a sleeveless red dress with a detailed, intricate pattern. Next to her on the left are two children, both sitting. The child closer to the woman wears a striped multi-colored top, while the other child's outfit is not entirely visible, showing only the top section which appears to have red and yellow stripes.\n\nA fourth individual, a small child, is standing beside the seated woman and appears to be looking at the waterfall. The backs of the children and the woman are mainly visible, suggesting a moment of contemplation or enjoyment of the water feature.\n\nThe background is dominated by the waterfall, with water cascading down in multiple streams, which are clearly visible against a dark backdrop. The water streams add a dynamic element to the scene, contrasting with the stillness of the figures. The environment around them is obscured, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the interaction of the figures with the soothing presence of water. Overall, the image conveys a moment of leisure and familial bonding in an outdoor setting.","title":"Cooling off beside fountain at Philadelphia museum of art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553397","550080","544335","549552","550979","549534","544352","543467","544342","549629","552737","550213","549467","544101","543530","549985"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["child","waterfall","woman","stream","bonding","back","sit","figure","cascade","water"]}
