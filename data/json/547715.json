{"path":"547715.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, a man is captured riding a bicycle down the center of a tree-lined street that recedes into the distance. The man is dressed in business attire, featuring a brown patterned suit and tie, and he is looking straight ahead, seemingly focused as he pedals. \n\nThe street itself is characterized by its cobblestone paving and bordered by neatly parked cars of various styles, indicating the era might be from the mid-20th century. The sidewalks are flanked by lush green trees and lampposts, contributing to a serene suburban atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, the street is bustling with more cars and some signs of commercial activity, possibly indicating this scene is set in a small townâ€™s main street or a similar urban area. An overcast sky suggests a soft light over the scene, enhancing the colors and the mid-century feel of the environment. In the far background, traffic signs and a converging perspective draw the eye toward the center where the road meets the horizon.","title":"Associate County Court Judge Fred Bruns on his daily bike ride to the Seward County Courthouse.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547389","556733","550073","548388","556708","551849","557805","543497","548399","551125","551504","556225","551443","550689","556710","543030"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","cobblestone","paving","lamppost","century","bicycle","tie","car","center","suit"]}
