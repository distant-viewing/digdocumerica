{"path":"545711.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a uniquely framed view through a natural rocky archway. The foreground inside the arch features several prominent objects: two tall, spiked plants bearing elongated clusters of soft, creamy yellow blooms, possibly yucca plants in bloom. These plants are set against a dusty red soil scattered with smaller rocks and loose stones, typical of arid or semi-arid regions.\n\nThe arch itself is composed of rough red rock, which subtly contrasts with the brighter and varied tones of the landscape beyond. Through the portal, the middle ground reveals a layered rock formation, showcasing horizontal sedimentary layers primarily in red and brown hues. These rock formations are characteristic of canyon or desert plateaus and give a textured and rugged appearance to the landscape.\n\nIn the distance, under a blue sky peppered with soft, white clouds, the horizon stretches wide, further emphasizing the vastness and open space of the area. The light and shadow play across the scene suggest a bright, clear day, ideal for highlighting the natural beauty and grandeur of this type of landscape. The entire composition effectively blends the immediate details of the native flora with the expansive geologic backdrop, offering a glimpse into a serene and enduring natural environment.","title":"Narrow leaf yucca and peekaboo arch","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545562","545578","544939","545584","545566","545563","545568","544887","545797","545555","544935","545570","549228","553077","544397","545719"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["bloom","arch","rock","plant","formation","plateaus","pepper","archway","layer","endure"]}
