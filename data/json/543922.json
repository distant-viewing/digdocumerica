{"path":"543922.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat dramatic moment in nature, showing a bird, possibly a type of heron, in flight just above a body of water. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden hue, suggesting that it might be either sunrise or sunset, which enhances the tranquil yet vibrant mood of the image.\n\nThe bird is captured in a dynamic posture, with its wings fully extended and its long legs trailing behind it. The surface of the water is slightly disrupted, rippled by the bird's flight, and reflecting the light in a play of shadow and brightness that adds texture to the scene.\n\nThe background is abstract and difficult to discern, contributing to a focus on the flight of the bird and the impression of its interaction with the water. This choice in composition pulls the viewer's attention toward the action and grace of the bird, while the muted, warm tones of the photograph elicit a calm, almost contemplative response.","title":"Marsh land","placename":"Galveston Bay (Tex.)","location":"Galveston Bay, Texas","nn1":["545142","547593","543063","557495","548832","551379","550388","544539","557448","547322","544543","543918","544605","543923","553777","557204"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","flight","grace","heron","response","disrupt","choice","wing","discern","trail"]}
