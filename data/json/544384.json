{"path":"544384.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene centered around a group of young, white lambs in a rural setting. The lambs are scattered across a dirt path, surrounded by an environment that suggests a farm or countryside area. The ground appears to be dry and slightly uneven, and the vegetation sparse, contributing to an arid landscape feel.\n\nOn either side of the path, there are makeshift fences constructed from irregular, vertical wooden sticks, many of which are leaning or broken. The fences create a somewhat enclosed space, potentially used to corral the lambs. Large, gnarled trees with sprawling branches stand prominently in the area, adding a rugged natural element to the scene. These trees are leafless, which may suggest this image was taken in a cooler season or in a region where such trees are prevalent.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but shows a hint of mountains or large hills in the distance, reinforcing the rural or remote setting of the photograph. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, which accentuates the tranquility and simplicity of the rural life captured in the image. No humans are visible, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the lambs and the landscape.","title":"Herd of sheep","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["554928","555820","554779","554887","544933","557747","543269","543682","544391","552556","547326","552555","550452","550450","552557","550453"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["fence","path","countryside","stick","simplicity","farm","season","tree","human","branch"]}
