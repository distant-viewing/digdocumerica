{"path":"557614.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a bird, specifically a Steller's Jay, in a vibrant and dynamic pose. The bird, predominantly dark in color with shades of blue on its wings and tail, is actively vocalizing or calling, as indicated by its wide-open beak. Its crest is prominently raised, adding to the intensity of the moment captured.\n\nThe setting includes some green leaves in the foreground, providing a natural and calm environment. This contrasts with the vivid action of the bird, giving the image a lively focal point. The background is softly blurred, predominantly in shades of green and gray, which highlights the bird as the main subject without any distracting elements.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing a moment of natural behavior in wildlife, emphasizing the bird's expression and the lushness of its habitat. The photograph achieves a sense of immediacy and intimacy by focusing closely on the bird and using a shallow depth of field to isolate it from the surroundings.","title":"Immature Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), bird of the year screeching his characteristically raucous call at something below him in the private forest preserve on Green Mountain, Washington.
