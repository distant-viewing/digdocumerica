{"path":"549075.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a striking and serene sunset with a bluish-purple and orange color palette. The image captures a dark, horizontal silhouette of scattered foliage or marshy vegetation mirrored almost perfectly in the still water below, creating a symmetrical composition. In the lower portion of the mirrored vegetation, there is the silhouette of a small airplane flying from right to left, slightly above the lowest horizon line and distinct against the orange backdrop. The overall effect is calm and somewhat enigmatic, emphasizing themes of nature and tranquility juxtaposed with human technology represented by the airplane. The use of color and the minimalistic nature of the composition highlight the isolation and small scale of the airplane within the vast natural landscape.","title":"Fisherman on Topock Marsh of Colorado River, at sunset","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543062","547731","553832","557497","552335","554404","557447","549847","552338","544707","554759","557957","546100","545019","550646","544711"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["airplane","silhouette","technology","orange","sunset","vegetation","nature","portion","palette","isolation"]}
