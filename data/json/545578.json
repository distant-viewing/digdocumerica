{"path":"545578.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a rugged desert landscape through a natural rock formation that creates a framing effect. The dominant foreground consists of a dark silhouette of a stone arch, through which the middle and background are visible. The arch’s shadow casts interesting, organic shapes on the rock ground beneath it.\n\nThrough the archway, the viewer observes a desert vista with several prominent geological features including a combination of tall, vertical rock formations and balanced rocks that protrude from a sandy desert floor. These formations appear in shades of red and brown, typical of sandstone rock layers found in desert environments.\n\nThe sky above is vividly blue, contributing to a stark contrast against the rich, earthy tones of the rocks. The landscape beneath the sky is sparsely vegetated with small desert shrubs and scattered patches of sand and rock. The expansive view conveys a sense of the vast open space typical of desert regions.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the unique beauty of desert geology, highlighted through the creative use of natural framing to draw the viewer’s eye across the landscape.","title":"Double arch in Window section of Arches National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545563","544939","545584","545711","545566","545568","545555","544397","545789","545570","544935","553077","545554","545754","545797","545804"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","rock","formation","framing","arch","geology","sandstone","archway","vista","viewer"]}
