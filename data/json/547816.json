{"path":"547816.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man walking along a sidewalk beside a building. The scene is captured in a daylight setting with strong lighting that casts the man's shadow prominently beside him.\n\nThe man appears aged, dressed in a brown overcoat, a flat cap, and likely an older style of shoes. He carries a bag by his side and seems to be in mid-stride. His attire and posture suggest a quiet moment in his day, potentially carrying on with regular errands or a usual walk.\n\nThe building beside him has a stark, plain facade. Painted white, it features an address number \"215\" above a door, which is partially visible on the left side of the frame. The door has a barred security gate. Adjacent to the door, there's a large, blank billboard-like frame mounted on the wall. The wall's paint is slightly worn and dirty, adding age and texture to the scene. On the far right, a portion of a window or another opening is visible, framed similarly in bars and set high on the wall.\n\nA part of a car, possibly from the 1970s judging by its design and color, can be seen parked on the left side, just entering the frame with its bright yellow color stark against the muted tones of the building and street.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a solitary moment on a seemingly quiet street, focusing on the man's movement and the textures of his urban surroundings. The image may evoke themes of daily routine, aging, and the socio-economic environment.","title":"In the old mexican market area just west of downtown San Antonio.
