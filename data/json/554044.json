{"path":"554044.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial agricultural machine during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the low light and deep blue tones in the sky. The machine, possibly a harvester, spans across most of the image and is composed of several parts including a main body, a cabin where an operator might sit, and various mechanical appendages which might be used for cutting or processing crops.\n\nThe machine is situated in an open field with scattered debris, which could be remnants of harvested crops, around it. The background features a relatively clear sky with a few clouds, hinting at an expansive rural setting. The lighting conditions provide a dramatic and somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene. The operator's cabin is visible, but details such as the operator or specific controls inside are not clearly discernible due to the silhouette effect caused by the backlighting of the sky.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of isolation and the scale of agricultural machinery in relation to the vastness of the landscape in which it operates.","title":"Heavy equipment used in planting sugarcane, Maui's chief agricultural product.
