{"path":"544513.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view focused primarily on a bird’s nest, which is intricately constructed using a variety of small sticks and twigs. In the nest, there are two pale blue eggs situated adjacent to a newly hatched, featherless bird. The bird appears very young, with sparse, fluffy down and its head is turned slightly upwards as if eagerly anticipating feeding or the return of a parent.\n\nThe backdrop of the nest scene is softly blurred which suggests the use of a shallow depth of field. Through this dissolve of focus, one can discern green leaves and patches of a white bright sky in the distance, highlighting that the nest is likely positioned among branches high up in a tree. The overall atmosphere, captured through the natural light filtering through foliage, gives a sense of serene natural environment—a safe and secluded spot for nesting. The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky or a shaded location, ideal for the protective ambiance of nestlings.","title":"Baby pelican and eggs in nest","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553876","544505","549231","544501","548505","548490","548497","548493","557628","544547","555010","554601","550471","544489","548885","543595"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","parent","twig","filtering","stick","ideal","spot","head","branch","leave"]}
