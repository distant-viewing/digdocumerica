{"path":"555623.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures the rugged landscape of a large excavation site or quarry. The central focus is a deep pit filled partially with water. The body of water is brown, suggesting sediment or contamination, and is surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs. On the left side of the image, the cliff is topped with a small patch of forest, featuring several tall, slender trees against a clear blue sky. The cliff faces show strata layers, indicating geological processes and material extraction. The entire scene conveys a sense of raw, natural alteration, with stark contrasts in color and texture between the water, rock faces, and vegetation. The background is dominated by a bright, vast sky, enhancing the isolation and scale of the quarry site.","title":"Buttes, mesas and canyons are created after coal companies strip mine land in southeastern Ohio.
