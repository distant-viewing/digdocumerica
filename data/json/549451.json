{"path":"549451.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an outdoor cooking activity in a rugged, natural setting. A man stands in the foreground tending to several pieces of bacon sizzling on a grill. He is dressed in outdoor attire, including a wide-brimmed hat, denim jacket, and jeans, suggesting a casual and functional approach to his environment.\n\nThe background features a sandy beach adjacent to a river, nestled within a narrow valley characterized by steep, rocky hills. The colors are somewhat muted, giving an early morning or late afternoon feel, with soft lighting casting gentle shadows.\n\nVarious camping gears are scattered around. To the left of the man, there is a large rectangular object that could be a cooler or storage box, and behind him, there are several other containers and cooking utensils, indicating a well-equipped campsite.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of wilderness adventure with the homely activity of cooking, set in a peaceful yet rugged landscape. The image evokes a sense of outdoor living and the enjoyment of nature.","title":"Breakfast at campsite on the snake river in hells canyon with the growing popularity of river trips, overuse of scarce campgrounds is becoming a problem.
