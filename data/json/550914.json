{"path":"550914.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and shimmering waterscape, possibly at sunset or sunrise given the low lighting. The surface of the water is textured with highlights created by the reflections of the sun, lending it a glittering effect. In the midst of this expansive, shimmering body of water, there is a small, silhouetted boat which appears to be a tugboat or a small fishing vessel, judging from its structure.\n\nThe overall atmosphere created by the play of light on the water suggests tranquility and the quiet movement of the boat hints at a slow, steady pace, a contrast to the vastness and stillness of the water around it. The view is focused primarily on capturing the interaction between the natural light and the water, with the small boat adding a point of interest and scale. The picture evokes a sense of isolation and the vastness of nature.","title":"In wake of a great barge, towboat manoeuvre into position on the Houston Ship Channel.","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543888","551222","552310","557255","543411","549374","551214","548247","547556","543143","551215","547234","547276","547230","551313","551220"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","vastness","waterscape","pace","water","tugboat","midst","sunrise","highlight","stillness"]}
