{"path":"547377.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a group of seven elderly women in mid-action, focused on displaying a beautiful, handmade quilt. The setting appears to be a room with minimalistic decor and a simple, dark background that subtly highlights the participants and the quilt.\n\nThe women are arrayed in a semi-circle, and their attire varies, including dresses and blouses, primarily in darker hues, which contrasts with the bright colors of the quilt. Their expressions are joyful and proud as they hold up the quilt for viewing, suggesting a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie among them.\n\nThe quilt itself is large and elaborately designed with a multitude of colorful fabric pieces arranged into floral patterns. These patterns are symmetrically placed across the quilt's surface, each consisting of multiple \"petal\" shapes around a circular center, creating an aesthetically pleasing mosaic of traditional quilt design.\n\nThe natural lighting in the photograph enhances the textures of both the quilt and the facial features of the women, giving a vivid impression of this moment of shared creativity and heritage. The details, such as glasses worn by some of the women and their individual hairstyles, add to the authenticity and personal identity within the communal activity.","title":"Members of the fairmont golden circle club display quilt they have made.
