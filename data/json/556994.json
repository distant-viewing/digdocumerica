{"path":"556994.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a serene, rural landscape that seems to be situated near a body of water. The scene is dominated by a large, calm lake or river on the right, reflecting the sky above it. Adjacent to the water is a mix of densely wooded areas and open fields.\n\nThe central portion of the image depicts a small community or a cluster of farmhouses and other buildings. These structures vary in size and are scattered among patches of cleared land probably used for agriculture or pastures. There's a clear presence of human settlement with roads meandering through the properties, connecting the houses and buildings. \n\nThe roads are flanked by trees and the houses have light-colored roofs, which contrast with the green surroundings. Some areas of the open fields are different shades of brown, green, and gold, indicating different types of vegetation or crops.\n\nAround this nucleus of buildings, the landscape transitions back into dense forests that extend toward the horizon, emphasizing the rural and secluded nature of the area. The upper left portion of the image shows an expansive forest stretching into the distance, suggesting that this community is nestled within a larger natural setting.\n\nThe viewpoint is high enough to offer a comprehensive overview, yet close enough to expose the peaceful coexistence of human activity and nature. The overall impression is one of quiet and isolation, far removed from the bustle of urban environments.","title":"Aerial view of the community of Bangor. It is on the Hood Canal adjacent to the Bangor Annex southern boundary. This community and others like it will be affected by population growth when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is complete.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556972","556993","556971","558061","556968","556997","556915","556964","556967","556969","558063","556937","557748","556981","553817","556973"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["portion","pasture","farmhouse","bustle","overview","house","community","gold","forest","field"]}
