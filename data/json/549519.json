{"path":"549519.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of an industrial area situated alongside a body of water, which appears significantly colored or polluted, likely due to industrial discharge. The area is densely populated with various industrial buildings, tanks, and infrastructure, indicative of a heavy industrial zone possibly involved in manufacturing or processing operations.\n\nOn the left, you can observe a cluster of manufacturing buildings and some rounded storage tanks, potentially for oil or chemicals. These structures are interconnected with various paved roads. A parking area filled with numerous cars is visible adjacent to the industrial complex, indicating a significant workforce or potential shift change scenario.\n\nIn the center and towards the right of the image, the industrious landspace continues with more storage tanks and large buildings, including what might be processing plants. Interestingly, two large square structures filled with water could be seen, which might be cooling ponds or part of a wastewater treatment process.\n\nThe foreground predominantly features an open sandy or dirt area leading toward the waterâ€™s edge, which hints at possible construction or land-clearing activities. This expanse is somewhat barren compared to the busy industrial backdrop, besides a small parking area seen on the lower left of the image.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a heavily utilized industrial sector, with significant implications for environmental management and local ecology due to its proximate interaction with the adjoining water body.","title":"Oil slick on the Buffalo river as it winds through a heavily industrialized area will eventually flow into the niagara river","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549524","551183","552209","549968","555770","549526","550890","555776","555769","548423","551612","552151","552219","551177","551988","549495"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["manufacturing","process","parking","ecology","wastewater","potential","tank","adjoin","sector","discharge"]}
