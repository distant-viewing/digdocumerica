{"path":"542810.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque moment at the beach featuring a woman riding a horse. The horse, which appears to be a chestnut with a flowing mane and tail, is equipped with a bridle and a blue saddle pad. The rider is a woman wearing a white sweatshirt and a white cap, and she seems to be looking away from the camera towards the landscape.\n\nThe background showcases a striking natural scene with sandy beachfront that fades into the distance. Waves can be seen lapping gently on the shore. Various rocky outcrops and densely wooded hills add texture and depth to the scene, enhancing the tranquil and untouched feel of the setting.\n\nThe photograph is taken during daylight with ample lighting, highlighting the rich colors of the natural environment and providing a sharp contrast against the bright clothing of the rider and the deep hue of the horse. The overall effect is a peaceful and dynamic image that encapsulates a moment of harmony between human and animal in a beautiful natural landscape.","title":"Trinidad Beach","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["542885","542966","542806","542800","544308","543014","544414","543071","557988","554010","542972","554689","544362","557051","543366","542956"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["horse","rider","sweatshirt","beachfront","bridle","mane","saddle","pad","harmony","tail"]}
