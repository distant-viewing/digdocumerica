{"path":"545423.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photo captures two young individuals, seemingly teenagers, standing in front of an industrial backdrop during what appears to be the late afternoon or evening, judging by the warm sunlight illuminating their features and the deep shadows around them.\n\nThe person on the left is wearing a pink tank top and dark pants, and sports a cap turned backwards. Their right hand is placed confidently on their hip and they are looking toward the camera with a relaxed demeanor. The other individual, on the right, is dressed in a stripes tank top and darker pants, holding a garment or cloth in their right hand while they look ahead, not directly at the camera. Both appear casual and at ease in their environment.\n\nIn the background, large industrial structures dominate the scene with multiple tall smokestacks emitting thick plumes of smoke or steam into the sky, creating a stark contrast with the natural lighting and these young figures in the foreground. The environment suggests an industrial area, possibly near a factory or a plant, where the presence of metal fixtures and the lack of vegetation amplify the industrial tone of the scene.\n\nThe composition uses the soft lighting effectively, highlighting the contrast between the youthfulness of the figures and the harsh industrial environment, adding depth and context to the image, suggesting themes of youth, environment, and possibly community or locality impacted by industrial activity.","title":"U.S. steel plant operates 24 hours a day","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545415","545404","545401","545953","550174","555909","551502","545084","546043","549299","555896","557358","555950","552747","557899","551926"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["locality","tank","ease","teenager","hip","youth","figure","cloth","garment","pant"]}
