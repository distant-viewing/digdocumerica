{"path":"545627.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape focused on salt evaporation ponds. The image shows several parallel rows of rectangular ponds with varying shades of blues and greens, likely indicating different stages of evaporation and salt concentration. A large, rugged mountain range serves as the backdrop, providing a stark contrast to the geometric precision of the ponds in the foreground.\n\nIn the scene, a heavy-duty yellow piece of machinery, possibly a bulldozer or a grader, is visible. It is engaged in work near the edge of one of the ponds, likely involved in the management or harvesting of the salt. The earth around the machine appears dry and dusty, colored in earthy brown tones.\n\nA small structure, perhaps an equipment shed or monitoring station, appears near the center of the image by the edge of a pond. The surrounding landscape is rugged and barren, emphasizing the industrial nature of the area without much vegetation visible.\n\nThe setting suggests a remote, arid environment typically chosen for such industrial activities due to the natural high evaporation rates that facilitate salt production. The vast scale of the operation and the orderly layout of the ponds highlight both the human impact and the industrial use of natural resources in such settings.","title":"Settling ponds of the Texas gulf sulphur company's potash division","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545628","548600","544782","548602","548601","545619","544686","546208","544788","545623","544569","553867","548774","543644","548640","551557"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["ponds","salt","rate","harvest","precision","monitor","bulldozer","facilitate","shed","duty"]}
