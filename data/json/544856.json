{"path":"544856.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a turbulent river or stream. The water, appearing white and foamy, flows vigorously amongst rocks that are positioned sporadically throughout the riverbed. These rocks are dark and smooth, likely shaped by persistent erosion from the flowing water. The pace of the water suggests a fast-flowing current, likely indicative of a river passing through a steeper gradient or a rapid.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is primarily natural, dominated by the whites and grays of the rushing water and the dark tones of the wet rocks. In the background, there are hints of a forest with trees that appear barren, possibly suggesting that this scene is set in a colder season or in a region where trees have not yet fully leafed out.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the motion and power of natural water bodies, with the river forcefully making its way through obstacles. The focus is mainly on the water and rocks, with sparse vegetation subtly included to frame the river and enhance the wild, natural aesthetic of the scene.","title":"South fork of Rio GRande River near Wolf Creek Pass","placename":"Rio Grande (Colo.-Mexico and Tex.)","location":"Rio Grande, Colorado","nn1":["553416","542743","549550","544867","550742","552061","549442","550658","544862","553855","553420","554407","549542","553388","550605","553653"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["rock","river","obstacle","water","pace","riverbed","gradient","white","stream","erosion"]}
