{"path":"547050.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph appears to be an aerial view of a railway yard. The image shows multiple parallel railroad tracks densely packed into a linear arrangement, extending across the photograph from the left to the right side. These tracks are filled with numerous railroad cars, which seem mostly stationary, possibly parked or stored in the yard. The surrounding area alongside the tracks is somewhat barren, with patches of dirt and sparse vegetation, which suggests an industrial setting.\n\nOn the left edge of the image, there's a noticeably dark area covered in dense trees or bushes, creating a stark contrast with the industrial appearance of the railway yard. This wooded area indicates that the railway might be at the edge of a more natural or undeveloped land, possibly serving as a buffer zone to denser forested regions.\n\nThe ground around the railway tracks features scattered debris and a few scattered patches of grass or weeds, highlighting the utilitarian nature of the space as a functional transit and storage area rather than a more carefully maintained facility. No distinct human activities or individuals are discernible from this elevated perspective, emphasizing the focus on the infrastructure itself.\n\nThe colors in the photograph have a vintage or faded feel, with predominant hues of dark purples and earth tones, which could suggest the image was taken some years ago or has been subject to aging effects. The composition and coloration contribute to a somewhat nostalgic or historic atmosphere.","title":"Railroad tracks follow the shore of Lake Michigan.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547140","556783","547265","556692","545541","544664","546719","552063","556464","556853","556382","551007","554834","556900","548167","546627"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["railway","track","yard","railroad","buffer","weed","coloration","year","transit","edge"]}
