{"path":"546677.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy city scene involving a heavy traffic jam on a curved multilane roadway next to a body of water, possibly a river. The road loops around, leading traffic into a dense urban center characterized by large, prominent, modern commercial buildings. The largest building, directly across the river, has a distinctive wide architectural style, with horizontal stripes, and accommodates multiple stories.\n\nIn this aerial view, the traffic jam appears quite severe, with lines of cars packed closely together, stretching back along the bend of the road. Vehicles of various sizes, including cars, trucks, and buses, can be seen. Just adjacent to the highway, thereâ€™s a small green space with a few trees, and a path that seems to be a walking trail.\n\nDirectly next to the river bank, there is a small, old industrial-like building with a flat roof. It contrasts with the modern architecture seen in the rest of the image. Alongside the building, there are docks with several boats moored to them.\n\nThe surrounding area also includes a parking lot filled with cars, hinting at either another busy day in the city or an event. This mix of natural water scenery, urban congestion, and architectural styles offers a look into the dynamics of a bustling, densely populated urban area. The image captures a moment in time with considerable traffic suggesting either peak commuting hours or potentially a special event impacting traffic flow.","title":"14th Street Bridge, looking north, from Virginia to the District","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546616","546704","546698","546686","546573","546578","555781","548419","546707","546574","546689","546608","546670","552712","553893","555745"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["traffic","jam","river","multilane","car","commuting","event","loop","accommodate","congestion"]}
