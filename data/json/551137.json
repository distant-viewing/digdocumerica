{"path":"551137.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic view of a grand capitol building, structured with a prominent dome and classical architectural details, located in a lush, hilly landscape. The building, likely a government one, sits prominently atop a rise, positioned against a backdrop of densely wooded hills that suggest a location rich in natural foliage.\n\nThe foreground features a sports field, marked with what appears to be a goal post on one end, hinting at recreational or community activities in the area. The field is bordered by a fence, and beyond it, there is a mixture of residential and smaller commercial buildings, presenting a suburban feel to the setting. Streets lined with light traffic and a few parked cars are visible, alongside some greenery interspersing the buildings, adding to the peaceful suburban atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition employs a layered perspective—starting with the sports field in the immediate foreground, followed by the urban residential area, then the imposing government building, and finally the lush green hills in the distance—all under a clear sky. The contrast between the urban elements and the natural environment around the capitol building highlights its significance and grandeur within the setting.","title":"State capitol building on a hazy afternoon, seen from swathmore avenue","placename":"Charleston (W.
