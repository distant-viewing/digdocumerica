The foreground features several green, fern-like plants, boasting long, slender, and spiky leaves. Each plant is adorned with thin, upright flower spikes that appear to be cream or light-colored. \n\nBehind the flora, the background shows a carpet of dried, crisp leaves in shades of brown and reddish-brown, suggesting a scene typical of autumn. No humans or animals are visible in the image, focusing solely on the botanical elements. The lighting appears to be natural, enhancing the vivid textures and colors of the plants and leaves, making the scene feel dynamic and organic. The overall composition of the image wonderfully highlights the contrast between the lively greens of the plants and the earthy tones of the fallen leaves, creating a serene and detailed snapshot of a forest floor during the fall season.","title":"Shining club moss (Lycopodium) and bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at Moose River Plains","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["555191","555192","555093","557165","554993","555040","554744","546011","555037","554991","554715","555183","542615","543615","554718","553358"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["plant","leave","carpet","fern","cream","flora","fall","autumn","snapshot","animal"]}
