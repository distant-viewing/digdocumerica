{"path":"550816.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph displays an aerial or satellite view of a marine or possibly icy landscape. The textures across the image are quite complex, featuring chaotic patterns that could be either foam and waves in a turbulent water body or cracked ice floating on the surface of water. The predominant colors in the scene are dark shades interrupted by silvery whites and grays, forming swirls and clusters that vary intensely in shape and size.\n\nThis type of imagery is often used in geographic or environmental studies, highlighting natural phenomena from a perspective not typically visible from the ground. The image appears to capture dynamic natural processes, potentially from a remote or difficult-to-access region. There are no visible landmarks, people, or man-made objects, emphasizing the natural and undisturbed essence of the scene.","title":"Scum forms on the Wisconsin River near the Mosinee Paper Company.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552426","552907","549630","550404","552922","550740","552424","555705","550637","555793","550519","554024","550418","546110","543521","550517"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["marine","phenomenon","imagery","interrupt","ice","landmark","crack","foam","swirl","study"]}
