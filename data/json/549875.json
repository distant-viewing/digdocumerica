{"path":"549875.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast parking lot filled with hundreds of cars, illustrating a typical bustling urban setting. The picture is taken from an elevated perspective, giving a sweeping view of the cars neatly parked in countless rows, varying in color which adds a vibrant aspect to the scene. In the foreground, a road runs parallel to the parking lot, bordered by a fence, and sporting a couple of street lamps and thinly lined trees.\n\nAbove the parking area, a notable feature in the mid-ground is a structure with round, dome-like roofs, possibly indicating a storage or sporting facility. The background shows an urban skyline with several high-rise buildings that seem relatively distant but contribute to conveying the dense urban environment. The sky is portrayed with soft clouds and a bright but gently diffused light, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe photograph captures a daily-life scene focusing on urban infrastructure and transportation management in a densely populated area. Overall, it portrays human organization in urban spaces, emphasizing convenience and capacity in transport facilities.","title":"Rows of commuter cars outside shea stadium at flushing meadow park, Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546715","556197","550100","548432","556790","546708","547686","543961","546671","548434","556722","553303","546900","547826","556773","546732"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["parking","lot","sport","convenience","capacity","portray","facility","organization","dome","car"]}
