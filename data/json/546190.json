{"path":"546190.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, two people are seen enjoying time in a body of water with an industrial backdrop. On the left, a young girl, appearing to be in her early teens, stands in shallow water. She is wearing a one-piece swimsuit with a distinctive pattern of horizontal red and beige stripes with connecting loops that reveal her sides. She has short dark hair and looks down towards the water, possibly at her own reflection or something in the water.\n\nTo the right, an adult woman is lying on a bright orange inflatable raft. The woman, wearing dark sunglasses and a halter-neck style swimsuit with black and white stripes, seems relaxed and partially submerged in the water. She rests her head on a small inflatable pillow with a polka dot pattern.\n\nThe background features a murky sky and industrial structures, including cranes and warehouses across the far side of the water, suggesting that this scene is near an industrial port or shipyard. The overall atmosphere mixes leisure with a gritty industrial backdrop, capturing a possible contrast between recreational and industrial landscapes.","title":"The polluted Lake Charles which has a dangerously high level of mercury.
