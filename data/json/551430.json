{"path":"551430.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in an outdoor activity within a river setting. The river seems moderately wide and flows beneath a bridge that spans across the top portion of the image. On the riverbank and in the water, numerous individuals—presumably anglers—stand while holding fishing rods, adorned in casual and protective outdoor attire suitable for river wading.\n\nThe environment around them appears to be semi-rural or suburban, as evidenced by the presence of a modern road bridge and a large vehicle that resembles an RV parked near the bridge, which suggests that the location is accessible by road and used for recreational purposes. A line of trees, now bare, indicating a colder season, defines the background. The sky is overcast, lending a muted, somewhat dim light to the scene, which enhances the serene yet active atmosphere of communal river fishing. The focus is on the congregation of people immersed in the water, surrounded by the natural environment.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
