{"path":"554559.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in a lush, verdant forest. In the foreground, a woman and a large dog are the main subjects. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is standing and gently touching a tall tree. The tree's bark is covered in numerous carvings and inscriptions, suggesting it is a popular spot for visitors to leave their mark. The woman appears to be examining these carvings closely. She is dressed in a casual, outdoorsy outfit consisting of a denim jacket and a red headband with white polka dots, adding a touch of color to the green-dominated scene.\n\nOn the right, accompanying the woman, is a large dog with a golden-brown coat. The dog stands next to the tree, looking slightly away from the camera, and exhibits a calm demeanor. The forest ground is covered with fallen leaves and small flora, indicating a natural, untamed environment.\n\nThe background is densely packed with various shades of green foliage, reinforcing the sense of being deep in a forest. The overall mood is serene and contemplative, emphasized by the natural light that seems to be filtered through the tree canopy overhead. The scene captures a moment of interaction between human, animal, and nature, possibly suggesting themes of exploration or reverence for the natural world.","title":"Names and dates are carved in a tree along a trail to Snowy Mountain near Indian Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554532","554537","543446","543452","548684","543040","543490","553376","543445","554099","554971","555116","544332","542791","551942","551367"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dog","carving","woman","forest","reverence","headband","polka","inscription","dot","mark"]}
