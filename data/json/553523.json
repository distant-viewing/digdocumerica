{"path":"553523.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor, intimate family scene. A middle-aged woman with dark, voluminous hair and wearing an orange shirt is seated. She appears slightly disheveled and is looking directly at the young child in front of her. The woman's facial expression suggests she is in the middle of talking or reacting to the child. Next to her, partially visible, is another child who is turned away, showing only dark hair and a part of a green and white striped garment.\n\nFacing the woman is a young child with short, light brown hair who is dressed in a horizontally striped shirt. This child is holding a large baby bottle, clutching it close to his or her chest with both hands. The child is pulling the bottle against one of the womanâ€™s hands, indicating an interaction where perhaps the child is being playful or insistent.\n\nThe background is plain and dark, putting the focus on the interaction between the woman and the children. The overall mood of the image appears to be a candid, everyday domestic moment, capturing the essence of family life and care.","title":"Mrs.  May watkins of mulky square with her three-year-old son kevin, one of nine watkins children","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["544356","553496","553544","556593","553543","552612","557898","556299","558409","557368","550090","551473","556235","557353","556294","557359"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["child","woman","bottle","family","striped","hair","clutch","react","put","baby"]}
