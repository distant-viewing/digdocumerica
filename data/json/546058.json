{"path":"546058.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting captured during a time of day when the lighting is quite subdued, possibly dusk. The focus of the image is a series of large metallic storage tanks, often used in industrial processes for storing fluids like chemicals or fuel. These tanks vary in size and shape; some are vertical cylinders while others are more box-like with rounded edges. The structures are interconnected with various pipes and walkways, hinting at a complex infrastructure.\n\nThe tanks are situated beside or on a body of water, creating a clear and sharp reflection of the tanks and their features in the still water. This reflection adds symmetry to the image, effectively doubling the visual impact of the industrial structures.\n\nThe background is relatively dark with a subdued blue sky, which contrasts with the industrial metallic greys, enhancing the colors of the tanks under the ambient light conditions. There is little to no vegetation visible; the setting is starkly industrial without significant natural elements in the immediate vicinity. The overall mood reflects a quiet but potent industrial environment, typically isolated and functional, focused on storage and perhaps processing activities related to liquids.","title":"Natural gas installation on Bayou Segnette is five miles south of the Westwego public boat launch.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546062","544293","547505","542587","547667","557386","546118","551987","549975","556402","545273","546108","547958","546064","544179","552025"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tank","like","storage","cylinder","reflection","fluid","symmetry","fuel","liquid","chemical"]}
