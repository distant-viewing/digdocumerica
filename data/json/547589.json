{"path":"547589.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene wetland scene, likely taken during sunset given the soft, dim lighting and long shadows. The foreground features lush grasses, bending slightly, with a reflective pool of water dominating the middle ground. This pool is filled with still water, reflecting the surrounding flora and what appears to be visible sediment or algae on its surface, suggesting a shallow depth. Beyond this water, the landscape opens into an expansive view of marshy fields crisscrossed by more patches of water and bordered by a line of tall trees. The overall atmosphere is quiet and tranquil, emphasized by the rich, muted tones of greens and browns and the absence of visible wildlife or human activity. The photograph likely aims to depict the peaceful yet intricate ecosystem of a wetland area.","title":"Tiverton salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547547","547489","547500","547532","547604","553856","547488","550786","547544","550788","550345","544515","545033","550783","554717","546205"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pool","wetland","algae","water","sediment","flora","absence","wildlife","ecosystem","sunset"]}
