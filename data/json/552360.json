{"path":"552360.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a dark cargo truck or container. The photo captures a somewhat mysterious ambiance, due in part to its dim lighting and shadowy figures. The limited light comes from the open truck door, illuminating only parts of the interior and casting most of it in shadows.\n\nInside the truck, a person, appearing as a silhouette against the lighter background of the open door, is in a mid-motion pose, perhaps reaching out or gesturing towards an object or another person not clearly visible. Only the outline and edges of their form can be discerned against the backlight. Visibility conditions within the truck are poor, making it difficult to identify features or the activity in detailed terms.\n\nThe truck interior is also cluttered with various items. There appear to be pallets, perhaps stacks of goods, and what seem to be materials draped in plastic sheeting. The items are indistinct and only sporadically illuminated. \n\nOutside the truck, there is a glimpse of a parking lot or a similar paved outdoor area, where a white vehicle is partially visible. The overall environment suggests a commercial or industrial setting, indicated by the type of vehicle and the structured parking area.\n\nThe image has an overall gritty, industrial quality, with the use of rough textures and materials in the composition of the photographed scene. The lighting creates a dramatic effect, highlighting contrasts between light and shadow and adding depth and mystery to the setting.","title":"Los Angeles reactive pollutant program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["553819","549850","544327","547075","544061","543173","545930","547174","547093","549770","557886","543002","557044","554421","546910","549867"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","interior","parking","backlight","pallet","door","item","mystery","material","person"]}
