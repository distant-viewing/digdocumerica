{"path":"556337.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a group of coal miners at the end of what appears to be a work shift. The main focus is on a miner in the foreground, who seems to be walking towards the camera. He is a robust man with a thick mustache and is covered in coal dust, which underscores the tough and dirty nature of his work. He wears a hard hat with a headlamp, a dark, grimy work suit, and carries a lunch box, emphasizing his role as a laborer. His expression is serious and perhaps tired.\n\nIn the background, other miners can also be seen walking away, most of them in similar work attire and also covered in dirt. They too are equipped with hard hats and carry their belongings, possibly also ending their shift.\n\nThe environment around the miners is industrial and ruggedâ€”there are tracks on the ground, indicative of vehicles or carts used in mining operations. The grimy and foggy atmosphere adds to the overall mood of the scene, highlighting the harsh conditions typically associated with coal mining. The color palette is muted, mostly grays and earth tones, which matches the soiled and gritty settings of the mining site.\n\nThis photograph provides a stark, realistic portrayal of the daily life and working conditions of coal miners, reflecting both the physical demands of their job and the resilience it requires.","title":"Miner, who has just finished his shift at Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4, near Richlands, Virginia, carries his empty lunch pail.
