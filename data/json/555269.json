{"path":"555269.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene, likely taken in a shipping yard or container terminal. The image is dominated by the silhouette of a large crane structure against a deep blue sky. The crane is lifting a sizable, dark red container, which hangs suspended in midair. The structure is composed of heavy metal beams and girders, creating an intricate array of shapes and lines.\n\nThe crane and container are backlit by the sky, causing them to appear as dark silhouettes with some details of the crane's machinery just visible. The lighting situation enhances the contrast between the mechanical elements and the lighter sky, emphasizing the industrial activity.\n\nIn the background, additional elements of the industrial landscape can be subtly made out, including other cranes and structures, contributing to a sense of depth and the busy atmosphere typical of such environments. There is an overall sense of motion and activity, yet the exact moment captured is static and powerful, focusing on the craneâ€™s task of moving cargo, critical in global trade and logistics.","title":"Silhouette of machinery used to load and unload ships in the port of Newark, New Jersey","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555285","547615","550874","555273","555283","547223","555284","544127","553027","544109","555261","550907","545655","547113","546915","550910"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","container","girder","terminal","trade","silhouette","logistic","situation","shipping","cargo"]}
