{"path":"553153.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"In the photograph, two men appear to be engaged in a joyful conversation outdoors. The man on the left is dressed casually in a light grey polo shirt, smiling broadly and showing his teeth. He has a medium skin tone and a visible tattoo on his left arm. The man on the right wears a classic outfit, including a dark suit jacket over a light-colored shirt and a tan fedora hat. He also wears dark sunglasses and is in mid-laughter or conversation, facing the other man.\n\nBoth men are surrounded by a verdant environment with green leaves in the immediate background that suggests a calm, tree-shaded area, possibly in a park or a similar serene setting. There is a hint of a structure in the farther background, indicating they might be near a building or an urban park. The focus and composition of the image underscore a moment of genuine interaction, highlighting expressions of happiness and companionship.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: a talk in the sun","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["549293","557079","551028","557030","549292","557031","547382","547443","553182","549947","553244","553208","553189","557854","549291","550763"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["man","tattoo","tooth","happiness","conversation","fedora","polo","companionship","tan","underscore"]}
