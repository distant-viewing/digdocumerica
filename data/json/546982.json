{"path":"546982.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic beachfront scene. The image focuses on a sandy beach with gentle waves washing ashore, creating a frothy white foam as they break and recede. In the background, a clear sky with a few soft clouds stretches across the top of the frame, suggesting a serene, possibly warm day. \n\nAlong the water's edge, four people are visible. They appear to be engaged in casual activities typical of a beach visit, such as walking or playing near the waves. Their attire and actions are not distinctly detailed but suggest leisurely beachwear. \n\nThe photograph's composition emphasizes the expanse of the beach and the meeting point of sea and sand, creating a tranquil seaside atmosphere. The perspective is taken from a low angle near the shore, giving prominence to the line where the sea meets the sand, leading the viewer through the scene towards the people and the horizon.","title":"Along the shore of hunting island state park on st.
