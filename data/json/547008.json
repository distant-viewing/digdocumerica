{"path":"547008.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene where nature and human activity intersect. The foreground shows a sandy beach with a large gathering of birds, predominantly seagulls, spaced out along the shore. Some of the birds are standing and facing different directions, while a few others are captured in mid-flight, soaring just above the waves.\n\nThe ocean appears calm with gentle waves breaking close to shore, adding a dynamic texture to the seascape. The blue of the water is a rich, deep hue, indicating the depth and vastness of the ocean.\n\nIn the background, there are two boats visible on the horizon. One is closer and appears to be a fishing trawler, indicated by its structure and apparent activity around it, while the other is much further in the distance and less discernible.\n\nThe sky above the sea is clear, contributing to the visibility in the scene and highlighting a sense of openness and tranquility. The overall ambiance of the image is peaceful, showcasing a typical moment by the sea where wildlife and human pursuits coexist. The color saturation and film grain suggest that this image may have been captured on film, adding a vintage quality to the scene.","title":"Bull Island is a wildlife refuge north of Charleston.","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545081","544504","552146","543283","543317","543059","548697","543329","552238","543282","547612","543281","557508","543244","543089","554002"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["film","bird","ocean","wave","beach","shore","sea","pursuit","seagull","seascape"]}
