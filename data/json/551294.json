{"path":"551294.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image portrays a young girl who appears to be deeply focused on reading or studying. She is seated in a room with low lighting. The girl has blond hair and is wearing a beaded necklace. The setting suggests an indoor environment, perhaps a study room or a small corner designed for reading and work. There are objects around her that indicate this is a personal space, possibly in a home. To the right side of the photo, there are some shelves with various objects, including what looks like a microphone stand, and a glass cup adorned with star patterns. The background is overall dark with some reflections and light spots which give a cozy, somewhat muted atmosphere to the scene. The composition uses a close-up framing that captures the girl's concentration and the intimate nature of the setting.","title":"Girl tries to pick up prize with a miniature crane at \"fun city\" recently opened establishment on \"the strip.\"  \"the strip\" is a mile-long commercial playground that winds south along the ridge tops from bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["546554","553535","553532","546556","558209","546479","546561","552592","555428","546560","544318","556264","558225","546564","546478","558216"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["girl","reading","study","room","microphone","necklace","star","object","cup","shelf"]}
