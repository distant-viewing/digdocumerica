{"path":"544197.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene by a body of water, possibly a lake or calm sea. It features three individuals, likely a family, engaging in daily activities near and in the water. The foreground prominently shows an old wooden canoe partially filled with water, floating next to a makeshift pier. Inside the canoe, there are various domestic items visible, like pots, bowls, a plate, and some cloths, suggesting that the canoe is being used transiently for washing-up or similar activities.\n\nA young child, dressed in a patterned top and shorts, stands on the wooden pier reaching towards a woman who is washing or wetting her hair while being partially submerged in the water. The woman appears to be older and is wearing a dark swimsuit. A third figure, possibly a teenager or young adult, wearing a bikini and cap, stands inside the canoe, seemingly assisting with the chores or organizing the items in the boat.\n\nThe background of the scene is relatively simple, featuring a wide expanse of water with occasional wooden pilings sticking out, and a faint hint of land or a barrier at the horizon under a clear blue sky. The overall ambiance suggests a serene, familial setting where everyday tasks are managed alongside enjoying the natural waterside environment.","title":"Fisherman's family","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544980","552975","554661","543164","549996","550767","543530","547213","553449","548523","544759","545734","543943","554517","551546","546349"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["canoe","pier","washing","piling","teenager","bowl","item","bikini","water","swimsuit"]}
