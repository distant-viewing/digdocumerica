{"path":"545580.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In the photograph, a natural rock arch is prominently featured against a clear blue sky. The arch is composed of reddish-brown rock, forming a large opening that looks like a window through which the sky and distant cliffs are visible.\n\nSeveral people are seen exploring the area around the arch. They are climbing and walking along the rocky floor towards and under the arch. The terrain they navigate is rugged and rocky, with a variety of red and brown tones similar to the arch itself.\n\nThe texture of the rock is rough, characterized by striations and erosion patterns that suggest weathering over a long period. The scene is set in a bright, sunlit environment, emphasizing the natural majesty and open space of what appears to be a desert landscape. The vast, open sky contrasts with the solidity and massiveness of the arch, highlighting the arch's imposing form and the dynamic activity of the people below it.","title":"Double arch in Windows section of the park","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553077","544939","545555","545572","545568","545563","545585","544935","545577","545566","545570","545584","545554","545574","545559","545551"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["arch","rock","striation","majesty","opening","erosion","cliff","desert","period","people"]}
