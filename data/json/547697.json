{"path":"547697.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and natural landscape scene that features a coastal environment. The composition includes an expansive view of a sandy beach intertwined with water bodies and bordered by a forested hill on the left side. The beach curves gently and forms a few inlets where water pools, dividing the sandy shores. On the left, the hill slopes down to the beach and is covered with coniferous and deciduous trees that are sparse, showing some exposed sand due to erosion.\n\nIn the image, there are four individuals engaged in different activities within this coastal landscape. One person stands near the edge of a sandbank looking towards the others, two individuals walk along the beach close together, possibly in conversation or observing the surroundings, while another lone individual appears further in the landscape, walking away towards the thicker areas of the beach. Their presence adds a sense of scale and liveliness to the otherwise quiet natural setting.\n\nThe sky overhead is partly cloudy with hints of blue, suggesting an open and tranquil day. The calmness of the water and the unspoiled natural setting evoke a sense of isolation and peace. The scene likely depicts a natural preserve or an undeveloped coastal region, where the elements of water, sand, and woodland meet, offering a variety of textures and colorsâ€”from the muted greens and browns of the vegetation to the different shades of blue and grey in the water and sky, contrasted with the sandy hues of the beach.","title":"Couple stroll along channel connecting bass lake outlet with lake Michigan","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["555400","543303","543287","546953","543090","545280","551554","545106","557459","547592","557529","543255","543193","555402","543296","547607"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","sandbank","liveliness","inlet","water","walk","overhead","individual","peace"]}
