{"path":"542764.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a busy highway scene during a somewhat hazy or foggy time, likely either dawn or dusk given the soft lighting and absence of strong shadows. The image shows multiple lanes of traffic, with vehicles traveling in both directions.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a lane hosts a variety of vehicles primarily moving towards the camera. These vehicles include a couple of buses and vans, visible in the forefront, and smaller cars further back. The buses look like typical city or tour buses, and the vans appear to be cargo or delivery types. The vehicles further back are too small to discern individual makes or models but are likely a mix of cars and light trucks typical of the period (likely taken in the 1970s or 1980s judging by the style of the vehicles).\n\nThe right side of the highway shows vehicles moving away from the camera. This lane seems busier and includes several cars which, similar to those on the left, represent the automotive styles of the late 20th century, with squarish body shapes and prominent chrome bumpers. Notably, the traffic on this side of the road appears denser than on the left.\n\nThe highway itself is marked with dashed lines indicating lane divisions, and both sides of the highway are bordered by grassy areas. On the far right, a fence runs parallel to the road, possibly indicating a private property or a protected area.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of the highway, the terrain is flat and open, with what appears to be a row of trees or tall bushes lining the background, which further suggests an organized, manicured landscape possibly indicative of suburban or semi-urban settings.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a typical busy traffic scenario, possibly during a commute time, with clear focus on the diverse types of vehicles typical of the era, all framed within a somewhat muted, possibly early morning or late evening light setting.","title":"Smog testing","placename":"Los Angeles County (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles County, California","nn1":["555505","547811","549890","556785","555437","553726","545884","556194","546739","553727","545432","546644","546571","546747","547785","553018"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","vehicle","bus","lane","van","traffic","car","delivery","tour","type"]}
