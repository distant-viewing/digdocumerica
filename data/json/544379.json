{"path":"544379.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a large industrial vehicle, likely a crane or heavy machinery used in mining or construction. The viewpoint is from behind the operator, who is a man wearing a hard helmet and a checkered shirt. He is seated and appears to be controlling the machine, with his hands on two levers.\n\nOutside the window of the vehicle, a cable extends into the distance, moving over a rugged landscape of piled earth and gravel, indicative of a mining or construction site. The cable is attached to a large metal bucket or scoop, which is in the process of digging or moving material. The time of day appears to be either dawn or dusk, as the sky has a soft hazy glow, suggesting early morning or late evening light.\n\nThe background is dominated by mounds of earth and a somewhat barren landscape that stretches to the horizon, under a wide, subdued sky. The scene conveys an atmosphere of industrial activity in a remote or desolate location, focusing on the operation of heavy machinery.","title":"Scooping coal","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["555638","556865","556893","544134","556187","543639","544160","544138","552418","542539","544135","544161","547583","545661","544099","554826"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["cable","mining","lever","scoop","earth","machinery","operator","construction","dig","move"]}
