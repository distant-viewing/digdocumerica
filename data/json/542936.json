{"path":"542936.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a logging truck transporting large, round logs across a tall, wooden trestle bridge. The scene is set against the backdrop of a calm sea and the coastline. The truck, which is white with some black detailing, is positioned on the bridge almost at the midpoint of the image. It carries several massive logs that extend beyond the rear of the trailer.\n\nThe trestle bridge itself features prominently in the composition. It is constructed from crisscrossed wooden beams that create a pattern of rhomboid and triangular shapes, which add a textured, geometric aesthetic to the overall scene. \n\nThe setting is presumably in a coastal region, given the proximity of the bridge to the seashore. The water is relatively calm, and the horizon is visible in the distance, meeting a clear sky. The lighting, likely midday, casts minimal shadows and highlights the details of the truck and the wooden structure of the bridge.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542855","542854","542858","555154","554420","545930","542856","552202","545046","542953","552178","557975","545036","549068","550954","548059"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["bridge","log","truck","round","rear","detailing","trailer","midday","crisscross","coastline"]}
