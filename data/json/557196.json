{"path":"557196.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph shows a landscape during what appears to be the colder months, given the presence of snow. The focus of the image is on the tall, dried grass in the foreground, showcasing their rich brown hues and delicate textures, some blades of which are highlighted by tiny, frozen droplets or a light dusting of snow. \n\nThe background features a gently sloping hill that seems to be covered with a mix of snowy patches and exposed dark earth, creating a pattern. The hill has a barren, subdued appearance, indicating winter dormancy. The sky is overcast with muted, cool tones, contributing to the overall chill and quiet mood of the scene. \n\nThe composition of the photograph places emphasis on the contrast between the detailed, closer grasses in the fore and the vague, undetailed landscape in the back, highlighting themes of depth and texture.","title":"View of the konza prairie, 1,000 acres of virgin tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas, in the winter showing a typical overcast sky.
