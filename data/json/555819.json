{"path":"555819.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic rural setting with three individuals standing in a field of tall, golden-brown grass. The background is populated by a variety of farm buildings, each exhibiting signs of weathering and age, suggesting a long-standing establishment in a country environment.\n\nFrom left to right in the image, there is a long structure with a red metal roof and a series of small, square windows hinting at it possibly being a chicken coop or storage barn. Adjacent to this is an older, wooden building raised off the ground on what appears to be stilts, likely serving as either a granary or additional storage space. Beyond this, a large, traditional barn can be seen characterized by its aged wooden siding and a sliding door that's slightly ajar.\n\nThe three individuals, appearing to be two men and a younger person possibly in their teens, are dressed in casual, comfortable clothing suitable for a rural or outdoor setting. One of the adults wears a plaid shirt and jeans, while the other is in a light colored shirt and dark pants. The younger individual is also casually dressed. They all stand with a relaxed posture, suggesting a moment of leisure or a break from farm activities.\n\nThe overcast sky and the slightly unkempt state of the grass and buildings convey a sense of timelessness and a close connection to nature and rural life. The scene is peaceful yet vivid, with the natural decay of the buildings offering a stark contrast to the vitality of the people and the lush greenery around them.","title":"Farmer and two nephews who help him farm land surrounded by industry near Somerville, New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area.
