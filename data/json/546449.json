{"path":"546449.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of children outside, likely on a field trip or school outing. They are assembled in a grassy area with a building in the background, featuring wide glass windows and a partially visible interior that includes some exhibits or items on display, suggesting it might be a museum or educational center.\n\nOn the left, the children appear in casual attire, wearing a mix of jeans, pants, and colorful shirts or tops, suggesting a relaxed, informal outing. Some are standing still while others seem to be walking or in slight movement, engaging in muted conversation or observation.\n\nThe environment is sunny, casting strong shadows of the kids and the structures onto the green grass, indicating it's a clear day. Behind the building, there's another structure with a sloped roof, consistent with an architectural style that prioritizes functionality, possibly part of the same facility or another building in proximity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is lively, yet orderly, with the children gathered in a group likely following the directions of teachers or guides, focused on learning or exploring the site.\n","title":"Mabel McDowell Elementary School, built in 1960","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546453","556265","553096","546522","544821","556437","544538","554072","557771","547972","545311","551764","546821","544806","551761","544825"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Community Gatherings"],"terms":["outing","child","teacher","museum","kid","guide","exhibit","school","trip","group"]}
