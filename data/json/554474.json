{"path":"554474.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene of an individual in a canoe on a calm lake during twilight. The lake is surrounded by densely wooded hills, creating a tranquil and isolated environment. The sky reflects a gradient of blues with subtle hints of purple and pink, suggesting either early morning or late evening light.\n\nThe individual, positioned towards the far right of the frame, appears to be preparing or adjusting something in the canoe, possibly gathering or organizing gear. They are wearing a jacket, indicating it might be cool. The canoe is partially submerged in the water, highlighting the quietness of the setting with no visible ripples around it, reflecting the stillness of the lake.\n\nThe composition of the image utilizes a rule of thirds, with the horizon line set just below the middle of the frame, and the canoe positioned off to one side, creating a balanced yet dynamic composition. The natural symmetry between the reflection of the sky and trees in the water adds depth and enhances the peacefulness of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph evokes a sense of tranquility and connection with nature, capturing a moment of solitude and reflection amidst a beautiful, natural landscape.","title":"Canoer on a misty evening paddles on Twitchell Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554609","544031","550822","554466","554473","551280","557562","554472","550674","547550","550324","554397","557571","557563","543577","554753"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["canoe","lake","rule","quietness","reflection","symmetry","third","peacefulness","purple","stillness"]}
