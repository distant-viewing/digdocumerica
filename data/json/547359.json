{"path":"547359.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures three older men seated outdoors on what appears to be a sunny day. The setting suggests a casual, possibly rural environment.\n\nThe man on the left is wearing a light blue short-sleeve shirt with a white undershirt visible, dark blue overalls, a denim cap, and glasses. He is seated on the edge of a somewhat worn, white wooden bench and is slightly turned towards the middle man, indicating a possible interaction or conversation.\n\nThe middle man is similarly dressed in a dark denim jacket, denim-overalls, and a coordinating denim cap. He is sitting centrally on the bench, holding a yellow walking stick or cane with a red handle, suggesting some need for mobility support. His posture is relaxed and he is gazing off to the side, not directly engaging with the others or the camera.\n\nThe third man, sitting on the right, wears a brown jacket, a dark cap, and light-colored pants. Unlike the others, he appears to be on a different seat slightly separate from the bench. He seems engaged in a conversation, gesturing with one hand, and possibly speaking to the other two men.\n\nThe background hints at a traditional setting, showing the edge of an American flag and what appears to be the corner of a wooden building with a white and red striped awning or curtain. The composition of the image places the men in a line, suggesting a shared moment of rest or conversation, with their attire and accessories hinting at a casual, possibly work-related gathering. The overall mood conveyed is one of relaxed camaraderie and unspoken bonds.","title":"Old men rest on benches facing the main street of Diller.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["554026","553208","555991","546072","547443","554865","556485","553519","552727","555599","557145","547355","557856","548625","553122","552868"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["denim","bench","overall","man","conversation","cap","seat","cane","bond","mobility"]}
