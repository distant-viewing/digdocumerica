{"path":"543811.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a person holding a glass jar containing a substance resembling dirty or polluted water, partly filled with a thick layer of sediments or pollutants. The jar and its contents are in sharp focus, highlighting the gritty texture and darker colors of the sediment, contrasted with the lighter, more translucent water above it.\n\nThe person's fingers clasping the jar are also visible, partially wrapping around the container, suggesting an examination or demonstration of the contents. The background is out of focus, but it seems to be an outdoor setting with sunlight and patches of water visible, which may imply that this image was taken near a water body, potentially in a context of environmental study or pollution assessment.\n\nThe overall composition and shallow depth of field emphasize the jar and its contents, drawing attention to the environmental condition being showcased. This method is commonly used in environmental documentation to visually communicate issues concerning water quality.","title":"Sewage sludge settles on bottom of beaker.
