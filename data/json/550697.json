{"path":"550697.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic and scenic waterfall. The waterfall itself stretches across the frame, creating a broad curtain of white, frothy water plummeting with great force. It falls into a turbulent pool below, where the water churns and bubbles, indicating strong currents. Rocks are visible in the foreground of the image; some are partially submerged in the water, adding a sense of depth and rugged texture to the scene.\n\nBehind the waterfall, a natural backdrop includes lush greenery, with trees and bushes visible on the surface level, suggesting a serene and somewhat secluded location. The overall lighting in the photograph seems slightly subdued, possibly indicating an overcast day or the effect of dense foliage filtering the sunlight.\n\nThe composition focuses predominantly on the natural elements, capturing the power and beauty of the waterfall while also conveying the tranquility of the surrounding landscape. The image evokes a sense of isolation and the untamed aspect of nature.","title":"Upper falls at rumford, on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["542699","545874","555073","543578","558087","554113","545839","554408","545878","544344","550843","545882","554409","544456","557820","548021"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","bubble","churn","current","curtain","force","pool","submerge","subdue","aspect"]}
