{"path":"555650.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene inside a grocery store, specifically focused on the produce section. The image is filled with an array of fresh fruits, prominently featuring large mounds of red and yellow apples in the foreground. Additionally, there are more fruits and other grocery items in the background, but the details are less visible.\n\nIn the center of the photo, a woman in a red bikini top and light blue denim shorts is reaching out to pick apples. Her back is partially turned towards the camera, showing a glimpse of her profile. Another woman, wearing a white shirt with a black polka dot dress, is also selecting apples next to her. Both seem engaged in choosing the best fruit from the pile.\n\nThe setting includes bright fluorescent overhead lighting which illuminates the space, highlighting the natural colors of the produce and making the scene appear lively and busy. Above them, there's a scale hanging from the ceiling, likely used for weighing the selected produce. Overall, the composition of the photograph is casual, capturing a day-to-day activity in a colorful and detailed manner.","title":"Shopping for groceries in a Washington, district of Columbia supermarket","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550041","544192","557763","555651","553813","546216","544261","556211","551843","550061","550028","551838","550040","544265","551837","555652"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["fruit","produce","grocery","select","choose","polka","bikini","pick","manner","woman"]}
