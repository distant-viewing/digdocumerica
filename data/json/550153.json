{"path":"550153.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a diverse urban landscape, primarily dominated by varying architectural elements and transportation structures. At the forefront, we see a residential area consisting of several reddish-brown brick apartment buildings with pitched roofs. These buildings are surrounded by lush green trees and a small parking lot dotted with cars, emphasizing a semblance of community living.\n\nAdjacent to the residential area, there's an imposing highway viaduct, elevated significantly above the ground, showcasing a modern engineering design. The highway is busy, with multiple cars and trucks captured in mid-transit, suggesting a snapshot of daily commute and connectivity.\n\nBeyond the highway, the landscape shifts to a more industrial setting. There are large cylindrical storage silos and extensive flat-roofed warehouse buildings, hinting at a possibly active industrial or manufacturing district. This area underscores the contrast between the residential quietude and the industrial buzz.\n\nThe background integrates further elements of urban development with more buildings, streets, and cars, somewhat blurred and less detailed due to the distance from the camera's focus. The entire scene is set under a bright daylight condition, enhancing the vibrancy of the greens and the earthy tones of the buildings, and contributing to the overall dynamic and layered portrayal of an urban environment.","title":"Looking toward lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546678","550157","555743","547764","546726","546723","548392","556193","548414","549476","546616","548418","548358","546707","555745","555781"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","commute","building","liive","connectivity","quietude","consiste","portrayal","integrate","shift"]}
