{"path":"547149.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental erosion on a lakeshore. In the foreground lies a sandy beach, speckled with small debris and footprints, leading up to a severely eroded cliff on the right. The beach extends into a calm body of water on the left, which seems to be a lake, hinting at a quiet, overcast day.\n\nProminently featured is a modern, two-story house perched precariously close to the edge of the crumbling cliff. The house has large glass windows, a flat roof, and two visible balconies with metal railings, suggesting contemporary architectural design. Itâ€™s painted in a contrasting color scheme, possibly red and grey, providing a stark visual against the natural tones of the landscape.\n\nThe erosion has exposed various layers of the cliff, showing a mix of soil and patches of vegetation. Some retaining structures, perhaps made of concrete and wooden beams, are partially visible, installed in an attempt to prevent further land loss. These structures, however, appear overwhelmed by the erosion.\n\nOne small, leafless tree stands near the edge of the cliff, highlighting the harsh environmental conditions. The overall atmosphere is one of tense interaction between human habitation and natural forces, capturing a moment of vulnerability for the structure against the relentless elements.","title":"Home poised on eroding sand dune","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["551963","551971","554823","543355","547119","547040","547085","547038","547053","557469","551064","547118","545938","547030","544621","543175"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","erosion","beach","loss","vulnerability","visual","attempt","footprint","house","scheme"]}
