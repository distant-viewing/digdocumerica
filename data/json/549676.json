{"path":"549676.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene set against an urban backdrop. The main focal point is a large statue centered in the frame, which stands atop a pedestal. The statue, seemingly of a historical figure draped in flowing robes, faces away from the viewer, adding a sense of mystery and grandeur.\n\nIn the foreground, the statue is surrounded by a circular arrangement of colorful flowers, mainly red and pink, which provide a bright contrast to the gray tones of the statue and pedestal. Around the statue, several people are engaged in various activities. A group of individuals is gathered around the base of the statue, some leaning on it while engaging in conversation.\n\nThe street behind this focal area features classical-style buildings with decorative facades that suggest a European urban setting. Storefront signs can be seen, including one that says \"Zur Brieftaube\" and another displaying “Piano.” This mix of elements indicates a bustling commercial area.\n\nOther details include a yellow car partially visible to the left side of the frame, indicating the presence of a road beside the pedestrian area. The overall atmosphere is busy yet relaxed, typical of a city snapshot capturing daily life and architectural beauty.","title":"Pedestrian-only zones, which have been established on three of the main streets of the inner city, have lead to a 70% reduction in air pollution in the area.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551823","549681","552705","551804","551830","551789","549660","551794","553214","552736","551796","551788","551799","549991","551851","549659"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["statue","pedestal","robe","say","mystery","street","drape","grandeur","pedestrian","arrangement"]}
