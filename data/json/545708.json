{"path":"545708.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image showcases a spherical cluster of flowers, most likely from a species of flowering plant in the Asclepiadaceae family, which exhibits a unique and intricate structure. The flower head is dense and composed of numerous small star-shaped flowers, each having a greenish-white base and pinkish-purple tips that frame a central protrusion, giving the overall blossom a geometric and textured appearance.\n\nThe flowers emerge from a bundle of upright, slender green stems that taper off from the main thicker, central stem. Surrounding the flower cluster are long, narrow, linear leaves that are spaced apart along the stem, adding to the plant's vertical form. They are bright green, suggesting the plant is healthy and perhaps in its prime blooming period.\n\nThe background is dark and blurred, providing a contrast that highlights the flower cluster. This focus on the flower against a shadowy backdrop places the emphasis entirely on the plant, showcasing its natural beauty and the complexity of its structure in a natural setting.","title":"Utah--Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["555024","553366","545695","554587","542970","547613","543596","545707","554595","553368","557167","544875","557500","554745","543200","550794"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stem","plant","cluster","protrusion","bundle","taper","blossom","star","tip"]}
