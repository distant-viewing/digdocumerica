{"path":"554132.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a series of side-by-side mailboxes mounted on a metal frame, set against a backdrop of dense, green vegetation. Each mailbox is identical in shape and size, constructed from metal with a curved top, and they appear to form one continuous line. The mailboxes have flip-up lids and front plates where the mail is inserted, each secured with a small padlock.\n\nA notable detail in the image is the placement of black signs with white lettering on the lids of some of the mailboxes. When read in sequence, the signs spell out \"THE BURI CHURCH OF CHRISTI THE KA.\" This text seems incomplete or jumbled possibly due to the angle or focus of the photograph. One mailbox, distinct from the others, is painted in a vibrant yellow, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome array.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of quiet and isolation, possibly indicative of a rural setting. The subdued lighting suggests an overcast day, casting soft shadows and enhancing the lush greenery in the background. The focus is primarily on the mailboxes and the signs, with a shallow depth of field blurring the background slightly to keep attention on these objects.","title":"New mailboxes in an area of land development near manuka park in the kau district, on the southwestern side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["556984","552468","549006","549005","542702","557760","557759","557566","547290","557950","550991","547296","556370","557567","552476","549196"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["mailbox","lid","sequence","spell","sign","placement","secure","plate","metal","lettering"]}
