{"path":"550461.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a plant with distinctive features in a natural setting. The subject of the photo is a branch bearing both leaves and fruit. The leaves are small and round, exhibiting a succulent texture, with a coloration that transitions from green at the edge to a darker tone at the center. The fruits are striking, showing a vibrant red color, and appear to be in various stages of ripeness. The branch itself is thin and has a greyish-brown color, indicative of a woody plant.\n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred, suggesting a depth of field that focuses sharply on the branch while gently obscuring the details of the backdrop. Flecks of light that might be from sun filtering through other foliage create a bokeh effect in the background, contributing to the overall aesthetic of a natural, outdoor setting.\n\nThis selective focus not only highlights the textures and colors of the plant but also conveys a sense of the plant's environment, possibly a dense, moist habitat such as a forest or a wooded area where such flora might typically be found. The overall composition of the photograph combines these elements to provide a detailed and intimate look at this bit of natural beauty.","title":"A small cluster of inedible berries near the west bank of the sagavanirktok river","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["544666","557593","555053","554744","542610","554587","544731","555007","558077","553361","558079","557617","551331","553074","555188","551356"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fruit","plant","branch","fleck","leave","coloration","strike","bear","flora","habitat"]}
