{"path":"551393.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a lively moment of two persons engaged in fishing, set against a natural riverine backdrop. The focal point is a young woman standing in the river, appearing jubilant and energetic. She is wearing a denim jacket over a light shirt, paired with brown waders to navigate the waters. She is wielding a large fishing net, which she is joyously lifting out of the water, filled with a good catch of fish that are visible and piled within the net.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, another individual is seen, also engaged in fishing. This person, possibly an older man judging by the attire and posture, wears a dark jacket, trousers, and a cap, and is using a long fishing pole extended into the river.\n\nThe river's environment is natural and tranquil, characterized by a gentle flow of water and a rocky riverbank. Faintly in the backdrop, a sloping, partially vegetated hillside frames the scene, emphasizing the outdoor setting. The lighting appears soft and overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day which is typical for river fishing scenarios.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph along with the expressions and actions of the people conveys a sense of excitement and enjoyment derived from the activity of fishing.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
