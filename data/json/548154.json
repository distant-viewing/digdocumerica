{"path":"548154.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of a young male, staged outdoors presumably during winter or in a snowy setting, indicated by his attire and the visible snowflakes. The man is wearing ski goggles which are pushed up onto his forehead, revealing a pair of sunglasses covering his eyes, which reflect the photographer or the camera setup. He has a neutral expression and is directly facing the camera.\n\nThe subject is dressed in a black and white checkered jacket, suitable for cold weather, and the jacket is zipped up to his neck with a white inner layer peeking out. He also wears white headphones or ear protectors around his neck. The image is tightly framed around his face and shoulders, with two poles (possibly ski poles) crisscrossing in front of him adding depth to the image. These poles create a triangular frame through which his face is seen, focusing the viewer's attention directly onto his features.\n\nThe background is blurred but features muted winter colors, likely snow-covered trees or a similarly snowy landscape, enhancing the subject's features and the wintery theme of the photograph. The color saturation and style suggest that this image could be from a prior decade, given the film-like quality and color tint.","title":"Member of the Oregon Crag Rats, a mountain climbing club based at Hood River.
