{"path":"544127.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody industrial scene, predominantly under a dark, overcast sky which contributes to the somber ambiance. In the foreground, there's a large crane, marked with the name \"Priestman,\" which dominates the scene. The crane's structure is sharply silhouetted against the skyline, and its arm extends towards the right. Suspended from the craneâ€™s cable is a large, bucket-like container that hovers above the ground.\n\nThe landscape around the crane is rugged and uneven, consisting of large mounds of earth or rubble, indicative of a mining or construction site. The color palette is quite dark, with deep blues and subtle hints of lighter colors in the sky, suggesting either dawn or dusk. Patches of fog or dust swirl around the area, enhancing the sense of an active, yet bleak industrial environment.\n\nThe composition focuses on the silhouette of the crane and the suspended container, conveying a sense of weight and gravity. There is a sensation of isolation, emphasized by the absence of any visible human activity or natural landscape features beyond the industrial.","title":"Strip mining at night on Moenkopi wash.
