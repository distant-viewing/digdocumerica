{"path":"551603.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scene by a river where large accumulations of logs and debris are floating on the water's surface. On the left side of the image, there is a railroad track running parallel to the riverbank, highlighted by a long shadow cast by the rails themselves or a nearby structure, indicating that the photo was taken when the sun was low in the sky, either in the early morning or late afternoon. There's a green sign beside the railroad, though its details are not clear in the image.\n\nThe river is littered extensively with logs, branches, and assorted debris, suggesting it might be near a logging area or a place where river trash accumulates. The background is populated with dense vegetation and small trees. In the middle distance, there's an industrial structure, possibly a factory or a processing plant, recognizable by a tall, narrow building and several smaller attachments.\n\nThe sky is a soft blue, and the setting is largely tranquil despite the industrial undertones conveyed by the presence of man-made structures and accumulated debris on the water. This mixture of natural and industrial elements paints a picture of coexistence between these environments.","title":"Con-wed plant at Cloquet discharges waste water into a side channel of the St. Louis River.
