{"path":"544828.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures two men engaged in construction work, apparently in the process of concrete laying or a related activity. The foreground is dominated by a man wearing a red shirt and a white helmet, bent over and focused on his work. He is handling a tool that seems to be attached to a hose, likely used for applying or smoothing concrete. His posture and grip on the tool show a concerted effort in his task.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, is another worker who is also bent over, wearing a light-colored shirt, dark pants, and a white helmet. He appears to be using a hand tool, maybe a trowel or shovel, working directly with the construction material on the ground. \n\nThe scene is an outdoor setting, suggested by the bright, natural light that illuminates the scene and the presence of what looks like a clear sky in the blurry background. The environment is typical of a construction site with visible structural materials, and the ground appears dusty and uneven, characteristic of such settings. The overall composition focuses on portraying the physical labor and concentration of the workers, set against the context of a busy construction site.","title":"Repairing 5th street south","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["547989","554856","556903","556866","554937","547218","543592","553618","547693","548761","556186","546023","553921","546837","547498","546815"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","tool","helmet","bend","worker","work","concrete","site","grip","materials"]}
