{"path":"546073.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set against a natural landscape. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a body of water, possibly a lake or pond, reflecting the sky and partially the surroundings. The middle ground shows a contrasting devastation of the landscape, with exposed earth and scattered dead or leafless trees, suggesting recent clearing or environmental degradation.\n\nTowards the center and slightly to the back of the image, there are multiple industrial structures, including tall chimneys or smokestacks and several large, cylindrical storage tanks. These facilities are likely part of a factory or plant, possibly involved in manufacturing or processing, as indicated by the presence of the smokestacks.\n\nThe background includes a relatively dense forest of taller, live trees, contrasting starkly with the cleared area. Above all, the sky is visible with fluffy, white clouds scattered across, suggesting it is a day with good weather. The overall composition juxtaposes human industrial activity with natural elements, highlighting perhaps the impact of industrial expansion on natural environments.","title":"Bayou segnette swampland, which has been devastated by runoff petroleum sludge from the natural gas installation in background","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["550694","554630","543813","550995","545013","552194","545112","557377","551576","552246","550672","544328","557225","545996","546005","546064"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smokestack","tanks","manufacture","expansion","devastation","pond","degradation","clearing","scatter","chimney"]}
