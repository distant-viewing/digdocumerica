{"path":"542623.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a logging scene within a dense forest. The image is divided into two main sections by a large, freshly cut tree trunk that dominates the foreground. The trunk, exhibiting fresh wood and jagged edges from the cut, stretches across the composition with sunlit splinters and wood details prominently displayed.\n\nIn the background, a worker wearing a dark outfit is visible. This person is engaged with machinery, partially interacting with what appears to be a portable winch or similar logging equipment mounted on a metal framework. This setup suggests that the tree may have been cut using mechanical saws, controlled from a distance for safety reasons. Behind the worker, tall fir trees fill the scene, indicating that the location is likely in a mountainous or otherwise forested region ideal for logging operations.\n\nThe equipment emits some smoke or steam, suggesting recent or active use, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise natural and tranquil forest setting. The overall atmosphere is bustling yet isolated, highlighting the intersection of human activity and natural forest environments._prominent","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["554419","542769","542773","542770","555472","554416","554418","542624","542771","553602","553608","553468","553601","555143","542787","542786"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","trunk","worker","reason","winch","fir","wood","cut","equipment","logging"]}
