{"path":"548457.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a pink-tiled wall, with a distinctive black and white eight-pointed star design in the center of the image. Two male hands, each belonging to different individuals, are pointing towards this star tile. The left hand points with the index finger directly at the left edge of the star, while the right hand does the same but on the opposite side. The hands appear to be of middle-aged adults due to visible aging signs and hairy arms. The context or the reason for pointing at the star tile is not evident from the image alone, leaving the viewer to interpret whether this is a demonstration, an installation, or some form of inspection or presentation of the tile pattern. The overall feel of the image captures a moment likely focused on the tile's design or positioning within the tile arrangement.","title":"Bernard picarello in bathroom of his home at 112 moore street.
