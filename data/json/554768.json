{"path":"554768.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a sprawling open-pit mining site, often associated with the extraction of mineral resources. The landscape featured is extensively altered due to mining operations, characterized by terraced layers revealing various earth strata. The earthen tones vary from dark browns to lighter hues, indicating different soil and mineral layers exposed by the excavation. \n\nIn the middle ground, there's a curved dirt road that snakes through the site, presumably used for the transport of materials and workers around the mine. Patches of standing water can be seen collected in various depressions, reflecting the environmental impact of the mining activities by disrupting the natural water flow and collection in the area.\n\nNo vegetation is visible within the immediate vicinity of the mining operations, suggesting a barren environment; however, sparse greenery can be seen on distant undisturbed lands, hinting at what the landscape might once have looked like. The background shows hills that are similarly terraced, possibly indicating an expansion of the mining activities or previous sites of extraction.\n\nThe light in the image, likely during either sunrise or sunset, casts long shadows and creates a play of light and shadow across the folds of the mined earth, enhancing the rugged texture of the landscape. This lighting condition adds a dramatic effect to the scene, emphasizing the depth and scale of the mining operations. Overall, the photograph portrays a scene of intense human alteration to the natural environment, focused on resource extraction.","title":"A landscape of mesas and canyons was produced by the Hanna Coal Company in south-eastern Ohio.
