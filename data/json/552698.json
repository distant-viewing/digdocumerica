{"path":"552698.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene where two horseback riders are herding a group of cattle along a winding road. The setting is characterized by a rugged, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation, suggesting a dry or semi-arid environment. The road curves gracefully through the scene, bordered on one side by low scrubland and on the other by steep, barren hills that dominate the background. The hills are mostly brown and beige, with a mixture of rocky and grassy patches. The sky above is partly cloudy, indicating that it might be a cool or temperate day. Visual focus is brought to the cattle and horseback riders by their central position in the frame and by their movement along the road, which draws the viewer's eye along the path they are taking. The overall impression is one of a peaceful, albeit rugged, pastoral activity set in a vast and open landscape.","title":"Cattle herd in piceance basin","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["548828","548830","548829","553105","548878","549033","553104","548954","552565","554885","554128","543634","553100","548838","543776","553102"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horseback","cattle","rider","road","winding","hill","rug","mixture","steep","impression"]}
