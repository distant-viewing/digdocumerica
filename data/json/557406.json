{"path":"557406.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman engaging in the everyday activity of hanging laundry outdoors. She is pinned between shadow and sunlight, highlighting her presence amid the more muted colors of the surroundings. She’s holding a white shirt and appears to be in the process of hanging it or has just finished doing so.\n\nThe woman is dressed casually. She’s wearing dark sunglasses and has curly dark hair. She sports a white blouse and red slacks, which stand out against the green backdrop of the garden. \n\nThe setting is a verdant backyard framed by bushes and leafy branches, which introduce a sense of privacy and tranquility. A series of other clothes and linens, including pink and red towels, hang from a simple clothesline. The background features the corner of a house or shed and fences partially obscured by vegetation, suggesting a suburban environment. The garden's lush grass is brightly lit by sunlight, contributing to the vibrant, albeit domestic, atmosphere. The contrast of shadows and sunlight across the setting adds depth and texture to the scene.","title":"Woman displays her clean wash in Boomer near the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. The houses were built when the plant opened in the mid-1930's and rented to employees who later bought them at bargain prices. Many people in the area still work for the corporation, and others are retired. Total plant emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975, from 113,252 to 2,649 tons annually.
