{"path":"554556.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic, small log shelter situated in a mountainous region. The shelter is constructed with thick logs and has a sturdy pitched roof. Noteworthy features of the shelter include a wall covered with a large, transparent plastic sheet, seemingly to protect against the elements or to repair damage.\n\nOn the roof, a collection of rocks and a tarp are placed, possibly to weigh down the roofing material or as another method to manage weather-related issues. The outside of the shelter includes an assortment of natural debris and rocks, which blend into the rough, wooded environment surrounding it.\n\nIn the background, a lush, dense forest and part of a mountain, possibly covered in conifers, can be seen, suggesting the location is quite remote. The image conveys a sense of solitude and a rugged lifestyle in a wilderness setting. The dim lighting and overcast sky imply it could be either early morning or late evening, adding a serene yet somber mood to this scenic outdoor setting.","title":"Lean-to near the summit of mount marcy (in background) shows examples of overuse of parts of the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
