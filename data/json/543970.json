{"path":"543970.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This is a photograph that prominently features a set of large gold-painted antlers in the foreground, seemingly displayed on a wooden surface near some docks. The antlers are textured and branch out in several pointed tines, giving a striking visual effect due to their size and color.\n\nIn the background, there is a bustling scene at a river port. A paddlewheel steamboat is docked, with two levels visible crowded with people. Some are gathered along the railings, looking out towards the view, while others appear to be mingling or walking around the deck. The steamboat is white with multiple layers of decks, each lined with railings, and features a large paddle wheel on the side, and two tall funnels emitting no visible smoke at the moment.\n\nBeyond the steamboat and crowd, a large bridge spans the breadth of the photograph, suggesting the location might be along a significant river. The bridgeâ€™s metallic, truss design adds an industrial flavor to the scene, contrasting with the more leisurely and festive atmosphere on the docks and steamboat.\n\nThe photo captures a moment of leisure or celebration, with numerous individuals dressed in light, casual attire, typical of a pleasant day out near the water. The overall setting is lively and filled with activity, positioned under a sky with light cloud cover, suggesting it is a fair day.","title":"\"Belle of Louisiana\", a paddlewheel steamboat owned by Louisville and Jefferson County","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543954","543966","545732","545917","554657","543972","543964","545921","555948","543960","551147","543959","543938","546839","543963","549509"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["antler","deck","railing","dock","bridge","funnel","breadth","paddle","gold","celebration"]}
