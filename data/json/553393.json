{"path":"553393.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene yet somewhat industrial scene, featuring a river foreground with muddy water reflecting the sky and surrounding foliage. In the background, there are old industrial buildings, possibly mills, exhibiting aged and weathered brick construction with multiple windows. These buildings are located directly beside the river, highlighting their reliance on water power or disposal historically. The banks of the river show some signs of erosion and scattered debris, possibly suggesting neglect or disuse. Additionally, a basic pipe structure spans across the river, connecting the buildings, likely used historically for transport or utility purposes. The surrounding area is lush with greenery, and some trees overhang the river, casting shadows on the water surface and contributing to the tranquility of the scene. This juxtaposition of natural beauty and industrial decay suggests a location that may have once thrived with activity but is now quieter and possibly abandoned.","title":"Confluence of flag brook and the whitman river at Fitchburg","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553462","547519","547890","547807","550204","552040","551519","546067","557376","550854","550673","549515","550947","548098","548357","548061"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","reliance","overhang","disposal","disuse","thrive","mill","muddy","abandon","erosion"]}
