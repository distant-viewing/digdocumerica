{"path":"551914.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a surreal and somewhat eerie scene on a narrow urban street, likely in a cityscape characterized by its old, towering buildings with a vintage architectural style. The street is dimly lit, creating shadows and a moody atmosphere. Most notable is a person in the foreground with a large, reflective astronaut helmet completely covering their head, which stands in stark contrast to their otherwise ordinary and somewhat retro attire, including a patterned shirt and slacks.\n\nThis person walks away from the camera, moving down the center of the street. The helmet obscures any identification details and adds an intriguing, anonymous element to the scene. The setting includes parked cars and a few pedestrians further down the street. Various signs and visual elements typical of a bustling city street, such as shop banners and street signs, are visible but not legible due to the lighting and focus.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on the astronaut-helmeted figure amidst a typical city environment, creates a strong visual narrative that blends the mundane with the unexpected, evoking themes of isolation, anonymity, and the contrast between the individual and the urban environment.","title":"Truck delivery is so slow on the inner city's narrow streets that many deliveries are made on foot.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["547695","546642","546646","549916","557277","553616","553794","556199","545396","543790","553822","552763","547748","547820","552756","552971"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","helmet","anonymity","identification","slack","banner","city","person","shop","pedestrian"]}
