{"path":"549760.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat gritty and industrial waterfront scene with the Statue of Liberty as a striking backdrop. In the foreground, there is a considerable amount of debris scattered along the shoreline, consisting of timbers, rubble, and other disjointed materials suggesting recent demolition or neglect. The middle ground features an old pier or dock structure in a state of disrepair, characterized by numerous vertical wooden pilings that stick out of the water at varying angles and heights. The pilings appear weather-worn and some are broken, contributing to the overall dilapidated appearance of the structure.\n\nA dark jetty or walkway stretches across part of the water, partially lined with similar decrepit pilings, leading the eye towards the Statue of Liberty. The iconic statue stands solemn and intact in stark contrast to the decrepitude in the foreground, positioned on the right side of the image. The water is calm and the sky is clear with a light color gradient, possibly indicating early or late daylight conditions.\n\nThis juxtaposition of the historic and well-maintained monument with the neglected and industrial foreground evokes a poignant narrative about urban change, historical preservation, and possibly the socio-economic disparities between celebrated landmarks and the less-maintained industrial sections of a cityscape.","title":"Trash covers dumping area designated as a future park (liberty state park).
