{"path":"545230.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal landscape under a clear blue sky. The scene is dominated by a dynamic shoreline where powerful waves crash against a rocky coast. The foreground shows jagged, dark rocks leading into the ocean, while white foam from the waves adds a stark contrast to the dark rocks and deep blue water.\n\nThe coastline curves gently and is flanked by steep, verdant hillsides rising sharply from the water's edge. The hills are densely covered with green vegetation, including trees and underbrush, which suggests a natural and relatively untouched environment. The hillside is a mixture of deep greens and some brownish patches, possibly indicating different types of vegetation or changes in foliage.\n\nThe clarity of the air and the brightness suggest it is a sunny day. The composition of the photograph enhances the wild, natural beauty of the coastal scene, emphasizing the interaction between the land and sea. No human presence or man-made structures are visible, highlighting the pristine and isolated nature of this location. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility and the raw power of nature.","title":"Cape Perpetua, on the Oregon coast","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["543290","543049","543297","545125","545129","543184","545122","543243","543300","543291","543289","543328","543061","553775","554023","545226"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["hillside","wave","underbrush","coast","rock","foam","brightness","clarity","change","mixture"]}
