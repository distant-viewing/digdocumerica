{"path":"557840.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban street scene, likely captured in the late 20th century, judging by the style of cars and architecture. The foreground is framed by a column on the left side, suggesting the photo might have been taken from a porch or doorway.\n\nThere are two vintage cars visible: one dark-colored car parked on the street and a light blue car in the process of being parked with a man at the driver's side door. The cars suggest an era possibly around the 1970s or early 1980s given their design.\n\nThe street is lined with residential houses featuring distinct architectural styles characteristic of American suburbs from late 19th to early 20th century. The house directly across the street is a three-story structure with a prominent gabled roof and a symmetrical facade adorned with decorative trim. Next to it is another house, possibly of a similar vintage, less ornate, with a gabled roof.\n\nA man is walking on the sidewalk, heading towards the foreground, and near the porch of the gabled house, there appears to be two children and possibly an adult, interacting near a sign that could indicate a yard sale or similar local event.\n\nThere are utility poles and lines visible, adding to the typical suburban setting. The lighting and shadows suggest it is either early morning or late afternoon. The overall ambience of the photograph provides a nostalgic look at suburban American life in a bygone era.","title":"Car enters the safety lane at the Norwood, Ohio auto emission inspection station.
