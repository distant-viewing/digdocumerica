{"path":"556452.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up portrait of an elderly man facing towards the camera. He appears solemn or contemplative. The man has slicked-back gray hair and wears rectangular glasses. His facial features include distinct lines and wrinkles, which add to his thoughtful expression.\n\nHe is dressed in a vertically striped, collared button-up shirt which is mostly white with thin, possibly gray or blue stripes. The top button of the shirt is unbuttoned, revealing a glimpse of his chest and an undershirt.\n\nThe background of the photo is dark, enhancing the focus on the man's face and upper torso. The lighting is soft and appears to be directed towards the left side of his face, casting part of his face in subtle shadow, which adds depth to his facial features.\n\nOverall, the composition and use of lighting create a reflective and intimate portrait, capturing a moment of human expression and the distinctive characteristics of an elderly individual.","title":"Alvoid allison, 58, from North Carolina shown attending a meeting of the Beckley (West Virginia) black lung association, one of the most militant of the groups concerned with that aspect of the miners' health.
