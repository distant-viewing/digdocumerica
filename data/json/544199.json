{"path":"544199.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this photograph, a middle-aged man is captured in a candid, joyful moment on a boat. He is holding onto a rope or cable with his left hand, which is raised above his head, possibly to support himself or as part of handling the boat. His right arm is relaxed at his side. The man is wearing a short-sleeve, plaid shirt with a pattern of large, light and dark brown checks, unbuttoned at the collar and revealing a white undershirt. He has a noticeable tattoo on his left forearm, depicting a heart surrounded by a decorative design.\n\nThe manâ€™s hairstyle is slicked back, typical of certain styles popular in mid-20th century. His expression conveys happiness and he is smiling broadly, which, along with his squinted eyes, suggests he is in a moment of laughter or deep amusement.\n\nThe background reveals a portion of the blue boat with white railing and the calm sea water visible at the edge. The sky is clear, indicating a bright, sunny day, which casts natural light on the subject, enhancing the vividness and colors in the scene. The overall ambiance is one of leisure and maritime activity, possibly taken during a break in fishing or navigating.\n\nThe photograph exudes a strong sense of warmth and lightheartedness, capturing a moment of genuine human emotion and connection to the setting.","title":"Shrimp fisherman on his boat, near galliano","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["545179","549363","543937","549331","551256","551955","549376","552322","545219","544204","549373","551255","549415","549355","548278","544269"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","tattoo","unbutton","squint","laughter","slick","emotion","happiness","reveal","amusement"]}
