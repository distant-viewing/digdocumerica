{"path":"549323.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at an outdoor market or shopping area. In the foreground, an elderly couple is intently examining an item at a vendor's stall. The man, wearing glasses and a blue blazer, is looking closely at a pair of jeans, holding them out with both hands. The woman, dressed in a cream-colored coat and a wide-brimmed hat, peers down at the jeans as well, perhaps assessing the material or the size.\n\nTo the right, there is a vendor or another shopper, a young woman dressed in a colorful, patchwork coat with her back partially turned to the camera. She appears to be manning the stall or possibly browsing through other items on display.\n\nThe background is bustling with other shoppers and stalls, reflecting an active outdoor market scene. Buildings and other urban elements can be subtly seen in the distance, suggesting the setting is in a city. The overall atmosphere is lively and typical of a busy market day, where various goods are examined and traded.","title":"Outdoor shopping on Chambers Street near Church Street in Lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558249","551690","557163","547374","557135","551694","553141","558252","557131","551837","557177","551696","552613","551749","551695","551832"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["stall","market","shopper","vendor","coat","jean","item","patchwork","blazer","shopping"]}
