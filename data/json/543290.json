The image shows a series of jagged, rocky outcrops that are scattered throughout the turbulent, deep blue sea. Waves crash against these rocks, creating white foam that contrasts starkly with the dark water. In the foreground, there is a hill slope covered with rich, green vegetation and small yellow flowers, suggesting a vibrant natural life thriving in this coastal environment. The sky is not clearly visible in the image, but the overall lighting suggests a bright, clear day, enhancing the vivid colors of the ocean, rocks, and vegetation. The scene is wild and natural, conveying a sense of untouched beauty and the powerful forces of nature at work along the coastline.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["545230","543419","543243","545122","543297","543184","543306","545129","543092","545125","543061","543289","542917","553775","543295","543067"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["outcrop","rock","foam","force","coastline","scenery","slope","vegetation","ocean","wave"]}
