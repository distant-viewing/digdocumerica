{"path":"548556.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a brightly colored scene featuring a two-story residential building with a very traditional American architectural style. The building is painted mostly white with a flat roof and features eye-catching red accents, including red front doors and shutters on the lower level.\n\nIn the foreground, an older man is actively engaged in painting the building. He is shirtless, wearing beige shorts, white socks, and brown shoes, which suggest a warm climate or a comfortable, casual setting for home maintenance work. The man is using a paint roller on a long handle, applying paint to the exterior wall of the building.\n\nThe lawn in front of the house is neatly trimmed and decorated with several small shrubs and plants, which add a touch of greenery to the residential setting. There are balconies on the upper level with white railings, contributing to the clean and orderly aesthetic of the property.\n\nThe background shows a clear blue sky, indicating a sunny day, which is perfect for outdoor activities such as painting. The overall composition illustrates a peaceful, suburban environment, possibly depicting routine home upkeep or renovation activities in a residential community.","title":"A resident of the Century Village retirement community waters the flowers in front of his apartment.
