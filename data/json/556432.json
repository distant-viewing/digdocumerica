{"path":"556432.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape showing elements of both natural beauty and industrial impact. A curving road occupies the foreground, meandering around a hillside; one white car can be seen traveling on it. Alongside the road, there are power lines on utility poles, indicative of human infrastructure. \n\nDominating the middle of the image is a large exposed cliff face, likely the result of mining or some other form of excavation. The cliff has stark bare surfaces showcasing sedimentary rock layers, contrasting sharply with the surrounding vegetation. These layers provide a textural visual element that reflects the environmental manipulation characteristic of such areas. \n\nThe background is densely wooded, with deciduous trees in early leaf, suggesting this photo was taken in spring. The lush green of the new leaves adds a vibrant life to the scene, contrasting with the gray and brown of the excavated earth and rocks.\n\nIn terms of activities, a lone individual dressed in red can be seen near the roadside, possibly a worker or a passerby, contributing a human element to the scene. The overall atmosphere blends elements of tranquility with human activity and environmental alteration.","title":"Slag heap on Buffalo creek near man and Logan, West Virginia.
