{"path":"548309.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a flowing body of water and a partial view of a spillway or weir structure. Notably, water is forcefully flowing through large rectangular gates or openings spaced evenly along the structure, indicating that this infrastructure is likely used for controlling water flow or levels, possibly in a dam or flood control system.\n\nThe foreground prominently displays the top of the structure, showcasing linear, concrete side barriers topped by metal railings that serve both as protective and structural elements. Each of these rectangular slots through which water flows forms vigorous foamy cascades into the river or lake below, creating a dynamic interplay of light and dark water streams, highlighted by the white aerated water.\n\nLooking down the length of the structure into the background, the spillway extends into the distance, fading into the horizon, tapering off slightly due to the perspective. The water beyond the structure appears calmer, extending towards a faintly visible distant shoreline under a light blue sky.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its rugged industrial features and expressive water movement, offers a somewhat gritty yet powerful scenario that emphasizes both human engineering and the natural force of water.","title":"Bonnet carre spillway, opened for first time since 1950 diverts water from flooding Mississippi river to lake pontchartrain","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["557247","552472","550654","553137","552471","547215","550743","547952","544795","548016","553372","549304","543978","549539","551180","553654"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["spillway","flow","water","control","taper","structure","gate","dam","flood","cascade"]}
