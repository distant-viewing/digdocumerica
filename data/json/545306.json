{"path":"545306.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of a fisherman at work on a boat during what appears to be early morning or late evening, given the warm, subdued lighting. The man is engrossed in handling a fishing net, which is visible with several floaters attached. He is dressed in casual fishing attire—a dark jacket, pants, and a headband, suggesting he is prepared for physical work. The background reveals a rough, slightly wavy sea with hues of blue and orange reflecting what might be a setting or rising sun. The perspective is from above the fisherman, looking down onto the deck of the boat where miscellaneous fishing equipment can be seen, and the boat’s prow points towards the glowing horizon. The focus and composition emphasize the fisherman’s task and the expanse of the water around him, capturing both the solitude and the breadth of his environment.","title":"Larry schaub is gill net fishing in the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545185","552298","543033","547563","546301","544256","547558","552273","547552","544208","554200","552122","544714","552308","543484","547555"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","fishing","boat","headband","breadth","engross","reflec","net","work","deck"]}
