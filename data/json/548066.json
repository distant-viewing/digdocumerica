{"path":"548066.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny day at a lakeside or riverbank where several boats are moored. In the scene, a young girl wearing a tank top and shorts is in mid-motion, seemingly jumping off a boat into the water. On the boat she is jumping from, there's a man and a woman; the man is seated at the back of the boat, handling the motor controls while looking towards the shoreline, and the woman is standing, holding a rope tied to another boat, seemingly securing it.\n\nThe boats are small, motorized, and vary slightly in design and color, but predominantly have a metallic or gray hull. The motors of the boats are prominently visible and various brands can be seen, including \"Evinrude.\"\n\nThe water is relatively calm and dark blue, indicating deep waters. The lighting suggests it's a bright sunny day, making the outdoor water activity pleasant. The backdrop is predominantly open water, giving a feeling of a recreational or leisure setting commonly found in summer aquatic settings.","title":"Boating on the Columbia River from a public boat launch","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548054","558234","551310","554611","548080","548736","543943","544122","543942","549934","552316","543944","546352","549088","546976","551308"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","motor","water","brand","lakeside","hull","woman","rope","girl","control"]}
