{"path":"550424.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image features a dramatic aerial view of a rugged mountainous terrain, primarily characterized by sharp, angular slopes covered in snow or ice. The mountains exhibit steep ridges and textured surfaces, with shadows enhancing the depth and provide a strong sense of the terrain's ruggedness. The angle of the image suggests that it was taken from a high altitude, possibly from an aircraft, which emphasizes the harsh and remote nature of this environment. The color palette consists of various shades of whites, grays, and dark rocky outcrops visible through the patches of snow, indicating a cold, possibly alpine or high-latitude, environment. There are no people, structures, or visible signs of human activity in the image, imparting a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty. The composition focuses on the contrast between the dark rocky materials of the mountain and the bright snow, along with the interplay of light and shadow, to highlight the dramatic topography and natural texture of the landscape.","title":"Tilted horizontal bedding of rock strata on the west side of the atigun valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550505","550422","550419","550514","550501","555672","550645","550515","550423","550408","542519","545807","550502","542520","542831","550406"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","outcrops","alpine","impart","mountain","whites","ruggedness","ice","topography","aircraft"]}
