The central object in the image is an old, dirty toilet seat surrounded by various types of litter. Interspersed amid the debris are multiple discarded and rusty tin cans, many of which are labeled with \"Budweiser\" beer logos, indicating they are beer cans. There are also fragments of unidentifiable paper and cardboard scattered throughout. The ground is muddy and covered with leaves and small twigs, suggesting an outdoor setting possibly in a wooded or neglected urban area. The overall appearance is messy and neglected, evoking a sense of disregard for the environment. The focus and composition bring attention to the prevailing issue of pollution and the human impact on natural surroundings.","title":"Lot behind apartment house at Lexington Avenue and 105th Street is strewn with assorted trash.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549788","544640","551246","544647","546920","551440","550806","550352","548131","544648","552089","547525","550807","550927","550812","550801"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["beer","neglect","can","disregard","tin","twig","cardboard","fragment","bring","outdoor"]}
