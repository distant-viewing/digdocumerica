{"path":"546886.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph presents a serene yet somewhat somber cityscape scene reflected onto a calm body of water. The main feature of the photograph is the city skyline in the background, showing a variety of buildings that include tall skyscrapers and industrial structures. The architecture suggests a mix of mid-century and more modern elements.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is notable pollution in the water, which includes various debris such as tires and what appear to be discarded objects partially submerged. Dominantly, there is an oversized, rusted metal structure resembling a crane or part of a ship, tilting awkwardly into the water, which adds to the impression of neglect or decay. This structure is reflected in the water, enhancing its visual impact.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat muted, with hazy or foggy air that slightly obscures the view of the buildings in the distance, suggesting either early morning light or pollution-related haze. The coloring is predominantly a mix of blue and grey tones, conveying a cool and possibly melancholy mood. The contrast between the natural calmness of the water and the unnatural objects within it raises themes of environmental impact and urban decay.","title":"Trash afloat in the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor.
