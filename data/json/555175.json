{"path":"555175.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This is a vibrant and complex micrograph image that appears to showcase crystalline structures under polarized light microscopy. The image features several elongated, platelike structures arranged in a somewhat radial formation around a dark central area. These structures display a rich palette of colors including blues, greens, oranges, and reds, which are typical of birefringence phenomena observed in crystalline substances when viewed under polarized light.\n\nThe intricate details within each crystalline plate are highlighted by bright and dark banding, which suggests variations in thickness or composition. The edges of the plates and the spaces in between are adorned with smaller crystalline formations that contribute to the overall complexity of the image. The background is dark, enhancing the vividness of the illuminated crystals, giving a sense of depth and emphasizing the geometrical arrangement of the forms.\n\nThe image does not include any recognizable biological or man-made objects, focusing solely on the abstract beauty and intricate details of crystalline material under a microscope. The composition is orderly yet organic, showing the natural symmetry and irregularity found in microscopic mineral or chemical formations.","title":"Phase contrast microphotograph of stained Douglas fir fibers.
