{"path":"545431.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet somber scene of nature silhouetted against a sunset. It features a number of tall, slender plants, which stand in the foreground. Each plant ends in a distinct, rounded, flower-like top, creating an almost delicate silhouette. These botanical silhouettes are set against a dramatic sky, painted with hues of dark blue, purple, and a fiery orange at the horizon where the sun is setting. The background shows a blurred landscape that further enhances the mystical and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the setting. The smoke or mist in the sky adds a layer of texture and a sense of movement to the otherwise tranquil scene. Shadows and the gradient of the sky contribute to a feeling of depth, making this image both simple in its composition and rich in emotion.","title":"Smoke from the continuously operating steel plants gives Birmingham its spectacular nighttime red-orange glow","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["542625","554731","549847","545495","543400","552312","550646","543410","547719","543145","543137","546100","547705","557588","547733","549075"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["distinct","emotion","fiery","silhouette","round","plant","slender","orange","silhouet","gradient"]}
