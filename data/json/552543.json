{"path":"552543.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a geological specimen that appears to be a piece of striated rock, possibly a form of sedimentary rock or layered mineral deposit. The rock is characterized by distinct horizontal layers with variations in color and texture. The top layers of the rock have partially peeled or flaked off, revealing the contrasting stripes beneath. These stripes range in color from light cream to darker brown tones.\n\nThe rock is positioned in a naturally lit environment that suggests an outdoor setting, casting shadows and highlights that accentuate its textured surface. Smaller rocks and stone chips, likely fragments of the main rock, are scattered around the base, providing a sense of the brittle nature of the material.\n\nThe background is relatively dark and indistinct, focusing attention on the rock itself. The shadowy setting surrounding the rock is indicative of either a shaded or sunlit area but with focus primarily kept on the rock, providing little detail about the wider environment. The overall composition highlights the rock's textures and stratification, suggesting geological processes and the passage of time that have influenced its current form.","title":"Oil shale. It is the kerogen in this rock which, when heated to 900 F., yields oil.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["545558","553770","543151","554410","550474","544815","555182","550475","544907","546165","552546","543421","543149","552890","553582","545589"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","layer","stripe","stratification","specimen","chip","deposit","fragment","cream","mineral"]}
