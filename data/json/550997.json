{"path":"550997.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an industrial setting contrasting with a natural environment. In the foreground, several tall, cylindrical smokestacks stand prominently, emitting plumes of white and gray smoke into the air. The smoke partially obscures the view, blending into the scene and adding a sense of atmospheric haze.\n\nIn the background, a densely wooded hillside provides a natural backdrop, highlighting the contrast between the industrial elements and the surrounding greenery. The hillside features a variety of trees with lush, dark green foliage, suggesting a location rich in vegetation.\n\nAdding to the industrial feel, there is an inclined conveyor belt structure visible on the left side of the image, ascending the hillside. This structure is likely used for transporting materials, possibly related to the operations of the smokestacks. The presence of utility poles and lines atop the hill further integrates elements of human-made infrastructure within the natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its juxtaposition of industrial and natural elements, captures a moment that speaks to the impact and presence of industrial activity within a natural setting. The imageâ€™s colors, predominantly shades of blue and green, are muted, which may be due to the lighting or photographic technique, giving the image a somewhat serene yet sobering quality.","title":"Smokestacks of the DuPont Belle works on the Kanawha River.
