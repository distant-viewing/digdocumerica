{"path":"555535.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This is a photograph capturing a rural landscape scene, likely in the early evening given the subdued lighting and soft shadows. It depicts a small village or farm community nestled in a valley surrounded by gentle hills. The terrain is dotted with leafless trees, indicating it might be taken during fall or early spring.\n\nThe center of the image features a collection of buildings which vary in type and construction. Prominent among them are several large barns or agricultural structures, characterized by their large, sloping roofs and rustic appearance. The barns are predominantly constructed of wood, with one particularly large barn in the middle having dark cladding and a red roof.\n\nTo the left side of the photograph, there are smaller buildings that resemble residential homes or small commercial structures, painted in lighter colors. There are a few vehicles parked next to these buildings, suggesting a moderate level of activity or habitation.\n\nA meandering river cuts through the forefront of the image, reflecting light and adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting. The river, bordered by bare trees, enhances the serene and pastoral feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its focus on rustic buildings, natural surroundings, and a quiet river conveys a peaceful rural life, encapsulated within a lush, hilly landscape.","title":"The village of East Randolph, Vermont, where buildings only change with the weight of years and heavy snows, is seen shortly after the dawn mist has risen.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["554767","556963","554819","547309","557091","547428","555577","555624","549256","555537","554800","547289","551305","551101","555635","554801"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","river","village","building","roof","habitation","fall","collection","farm","forefront"]}
