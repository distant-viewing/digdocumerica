{"path":"542662.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man standing outdoors near a complex piece of electronic equipment that appears to be measuring or monitoring tools. He is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and a thin dark tie, and he is holding a pencil and a clipboard, suggesting he might be taking notes or readings. The man is standing in front of an entrance to a building labeled \"STATEWIDE AIR POLLUTION RESEARCH CENTER.\" The building has a simple, modern design with a covered area over the walkway, supported by columns.\n\nIn the background, there are hints of a residential or semi-urban environment with palm trees and a clear sky, giving a sense of the location possibly being in a temperate or subtropical climate. The focus and depth of field in the image emphasize the man and his activity, making him the main subject in the frame. The overall impression is of a professional individual conducting scientific or technical fieldwork, possibly related to air quality or environmental research.","title":"Edgar Stephens, professor of environmental science at the State-wide Air Pollution Research Center, using optical particle counter","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542661","542663","552371","553907","547740","549625","557829","549628","544499","542776","548879","551595","545390","553025","545480","549352"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["pencil","clipboard","fieldwork","reading","note","palm","tie","walkway","research","man"]}
