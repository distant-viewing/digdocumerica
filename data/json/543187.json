{"path":"543187.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures the intricate details of seaweed submerged in water. The image shows several strands of seaweed floating near the surface of dark, blue-toned water. The sunlight, likely hitting the water at an angle, creates a sparkling effect where the light touches the ripples and edges of the seaweed, highlighting parts of it with bright, shimmering spots. This effect gives a dynamic texture and vibrant contrasts to the photo.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is serene yet lively due to the play of light and the organic forms of the seaweed drifting gently in the water. The composition focuses on the natural beauty and complexity of this aquatic environment, with no human presence or man-made objects visible. The calmness of the water and the detailed focus on the seaweed's textures invite contemplation of this small, often overlooked aspect of marine life.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543292","555069","543555","555022","543566","543558","551354","555044","548713","553180","555023","542582","543194","546202","554076","545674"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["seaweed","strand","effect","water","calmness","complexity","contemplation","play","texture","spot"]}
