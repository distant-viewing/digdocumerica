{"path":"543328.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents a stunning aerial view of a coastal landscape characterized by rugged terrain and dramatic natural beauty. In the foreground, you can see mountainous hillsides that descend steeply into the sea. These hills are covered with patches of green vegetation, contrasting with areas of bare earth and rock, showcasing shades of brown, green, and orange. The coastline features jagged cliffs that are punctuated by several rock formations jutting out from the water, around which waves are breaking. This contributes to a dynamic interplay of land and water. \n\nThe beach visible in the scene is a narrow strip of sand, enclosed by high cliffs on either side, suggesting a secluded and possibly difficult-to-access area. The ocean color is a deep blue, indicative of deep waters close to the shore. \n\nFurther in the background, the mountain range continues with numerous ridges and valleys that suggest a terrain rich in elevation changes and geological features. The blue sky above is partly cloudy, casting shadows on the mountains and adding a dramatic effect to the overall landscape. \n\nThe time of day appears to be either late afternoon or early morning, as indicated by the long shadows and the soft lighting conditions that emphasize the topography and texture of the landscape. The photograph encompasses a sense of untouched natural beauty and the powerful forces of geological and oceanic processes at work.","title":"Mountains and water","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543430","543434","545934","543432","543435","543300","543051","543424","543085","543429","543045","553983","543297","553995","554020","543090"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","encompass","jut","mountain","rock","descend","topography","force","punctuate","elevation"]}
