{"path":"548035.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a quiet, serene lake setting with a large cooling tower prominently rising in the background. The cooling tower, often associated with nuclear or thermal power plans, is massive and shaped like a hyperboloid, narrowing towards the middle and flaring out at both the top and bottom. It is positioned on the far side of the lake, surrounded by a lush green landscape of trees.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph shows the dark silhouette of reeds and grasses along the near shore of the lake. The lake itself is relatively calm, reflecting some of the light from the sky, which gives off a gentle, soft glow suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThere is a hint of construction or industrial activity visible near the base of the cooling tower, suggested by what seems to be a crane in the mid-ground area among the trees. The sky is mostly clear with a few wispy clouds, adding to the tranquil and quiet mood of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the natural beauty of the lake and landscape with the imposing man-made structure of the cooling tower, reflecting themes of nature versus human engineering.","title":"The Trojan nuclear plant on the banks of the Columbia River.
