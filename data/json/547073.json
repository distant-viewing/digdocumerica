{"path":"547073.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a visually vibrant and bustling urban street scene at twilight. The image prominently features two cars parked along the curb, with a yellow Volkswagen Beetle closest to the viewer. This car, showing distinct design features like its rounded shape and unique rear window, is well-preserved and notable for its cheerful color.\n\nThe street is lined with various neon signs advertising several types of eateries and services, contributing to a lively, glowing atmosphere. The signage includes ads for pizza, chicken tacos, and a phone number alongside names of different restaurants like \"Great Lakes Restaurant.\" The neon glow and soft street lighting provide a rich, moody hue to the scene, typical of evening urban life.\n\nThe setting appears to be a commercial area dedicated to food and entertainment, indicated by the clustered, brightly-lit signs and the presence of multiple restaurants. The atmosphere suggests a lively locale where people might gather for dining and night-time activities. The presence of the cars and visible wet pavement suggest recent rain, adding a reflective quality to the surfaces and enhancing the vividness of the neon lights.","title":"Near the Great Lakes Naval Station","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551322","555446","551321","555381","556709","549014","551239","545462","554297","545216","551135","550139","547051","551913","551863","556983"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["neon","restaurant","street","ad","car","entertainment","phone","dining","locale","curb"]}
