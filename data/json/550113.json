{"path":"550113.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a deteriorating two-story house that exhibits a mix of neglect and past architectural grandeur. The structure, predominantly wooden, is in a state of disrepair with visible damage to the siding, porch, and roof. The house features intricate woodwork, including decorative trim and a distinctive arched entryway, which hints at its former charm and elegance.\n\nThe facade of the house is dark, weathered, and missing several patches of exterior wall material, exposing the underlying structure. The porch is cluttered with various items including a chair and unidentifiable debris, suggesting disuse or abandonment. The front yard is unfenced and appears overgrown, while a distinct, low iron fence borders the foreground of the image, separating the viewer from the scene.\n\nOn the porch, two figures are partially visible, suggesting some human presence or activity. A car is parked just outside the fence, adding to the scene's sense of normal daily life amidst decay.\n\nThe environment is residential with a paved street in front of the house and another building visible to the right, which looks to be similarly rundown with boarded-up sections. The general atmosphere is one of urban decay and neglect, yet the photo also captures a nuanced picture of life continuing despite these conditions.","title":"Old victorian home at 2904 clinton street will be restored as part of Ohio city area renewal","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550144","552491","557346","551115","552494","557633","557640","557650","557649","557646","554818","552488","554799","546989","553555","552455"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","decay","arched","fence","neglect","rundown","boarde","woodwork","entryway"]}
