{"path":"555001.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a significantly weathered, old tree trunk, showing profound signs of decay and aging. The texture of the wood is prominently displayed, characterized by deep, dark crevices and jagged, splintered edges that reveal the trunk's internal structure. The wood’s surface varies in color from grey to dark brown, indicating exposure to elements over time.\n\nMoss and small plant growth, likely lichens or similar forms of vegetation, are visible on the surface and within the crevices of the trunk, suggesting the tree exists in a moist or humid environment, typical of a forested or woodland area. These plants add a subtle hint of green, contrasting softly against the dark, rugged texture of the trunk.\n\nThe focus is tight on the details of the trunk’s decay, and there is no background context provided beyond the immediate vicinity of the tree, enhancing the viewer's attention on the natural processes and time's impact on this trunk. This image captures the raw and intricate beauty of natural decay in a forest ecosystem, illustrating the cycle of life and decomposition within nature.","title":"Spruce trunk with center decaying on an ocean strip in the Pacific Coast area of Olympic National Park.
