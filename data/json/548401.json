{"path":"548401.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph depicts a sprawling aerial view of a transportation infrastructure that includes both a bridge and a highway system. The bridge, which is a large arched structure supported by multiple pillars, spans across a vast expanse of water, providing a direct route that bypasses the more congested areas. The body of water appears calm and is of significant size, suggesting it could be a river or a coastal bay.\n\nTo the right of the bridge, there is a toll booth area on a highway. It shows multiple lanes of traffic, with some congestion apparent near the toll booths. Vehicles lined up include cars, buses, and trucks, suggesting a mix of commuter and commercial traffic. Adjacent to the toll booth, there are patches of trees and greenery, and it looks like an area less developed, possibly a small park or undeveloped land.\n\nThe scene below the bridge and near the coastline features industrial facilities or possibly marinas, as there are structures that look like docks. Additionally, the surrounding area includes more greenery and some buildings, which might be residential, given their proximity to the highway and layout.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a complex interaction between natural landscapes and human-made structures and emphasizes the role of transportation in connecting various sections of a geographic area. The atmosphere seems slightly hazy, perhaps indicating weather conditions or air quality issues common in densely populated or industrially active areas.","title":"Entrance to the tappan zee bridge on the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548413","548341","546724","558049","546588","549469","552846","546689","546870","546569","551989","558051","546722","558048","549547","555745"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","highway","arched","transportation","traffic","commuter","booth","congestion","pillars","sprawling"]}
