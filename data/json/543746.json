{"path":"543746.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a panoramic aerial view of a narrow valley nestled between steep, mountainous terrain. The valley floor is elongated, aligning with the direction of the mountains, and is predominantly green suggesting lush vegetation.\n\nWithin the valley, there’s a visible settlement that forms a linear pattern along the length of the valley. The settlement comprises numerous small structures, likely houses and other buildings, interconnected by visible roads that run parallel to each other. This organized layout indicates a small town or village which looks well-integrated into the valley environment.\n\nTo the side of the town, a river meanders through the valley. The river is sinuous, forming natural curves and loops, and appears to be bordered by lighter colored banks, indicating possible sandy or silty edges. This river likely plays a crucial role in the valley’s ecosystem and possibly for the livelihood of the town's residents.\n\nThe surrounding mountains have a rugged appearance, with rocky and forested slopes. The topographical differences between the valley floor and the mountain heights create a dramatic contrast in the visual perspective.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combined with the dense, dark hues of the mountains and the vibrant green of the valley, illustrates a serene yet isolated environment, underscoring a sense of remoteness and natural beauty. The photograph likely captures the essence of rural life amid challenging geographical features.","title":"Aerial view of Telluride showing newly-cut ski trails (in right foreground)","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["552593","550525","550528","552595","543738","548199","550499","555676","543750","550497","542998","557531","546424","550512","549116","552582"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","town","mountain","settlement","river","floor","loop","difference","remoteness","village"]}
