{"path":"556365.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image depicts a scene inside a coal mine. The setting has low clearance and is dimly lit, illuminated only by the workers' headlamps and some ambient light, which reflects slightly off the wet, dark surfaces around the area. The ceiling of the mine appears to be supported by heavy wooden beams and metal reinforcements, which can be seen just above the miners' heads.\n\nIn the foreground, two male miners are visible. Both are wearing hard hats, and one appears to be operating a large piece of machinery, possibly an underground mining vehicle or equipment for drilling. They are focused on their task, and one miner is in the process of handling or adjusting this machinery.\n\nThe equipment and the environment around them suggest a muddy and rugged terrain. There are scattered installations and wires, which contribute to a sense of industrial activity and the harsh conditions typically associated with coal mining workspaces.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the challenging working conditions and the compact, confined spaces of an active coal mine, emphasizing the resilience and diligence of the workers in such environments.","title":"Section of a long wall mine with jacks holding up the ceiling at the left and the mining machine in the foreground and at the right where teeth rake coal onto a conveyor belt which takes the material out of the tunnel for transport out of the mine.  Miners are illuminated by the photographer's lighting.  Long wall mining is relatively new in the u.s.  And is more costly, but allows about twice as much coal to be taken from a mine.
