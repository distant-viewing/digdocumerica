{"path":"545852.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a striking silhouette of a windmill set against a vibrant sky backdrop displaying warm tones. The image captures the windmill at the left side of the frame, with its blades, tower, and tail clearly outlined. Its silhouette contrasts dramatically against a muted sky. To the right, a large, luminous sun is depicted, glowing with shades of yellow and orange, enhancing the atmospheric feel of the scene.\n\nThe positioning of the sun near the horizon suggests that the photo was taken either at sunrise or sunset, a time known for soft and golden light. The overall composition is balanced, with the sun acting as a counterpoint to the windmill on the opposite side. The absence of clouds and other elements in the sky focuses attention on the interaction between the bold shapes of the windmill and the radiant sun. The atmosphere conveyed is serene and tranquil, evoking a sense of quiet and timelessness.","title":"Sunset over windmill in sealy","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545848","547283","545856","547347","547345","549212","549216","549210","547293","545832","549213","555291","549211","548886","557310","545418"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","sun","timelessness","silhouette","blade","positioning","tail","know","sunrise","act"]}
