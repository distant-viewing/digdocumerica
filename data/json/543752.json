{"path":"543752.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a mature man inside an industrial setting that appears to be some type of workshop or factory focused on stone or concrete work. The man, who has light-colored hair and is wearing glasses, is dressed in casual work attireâ€”a light grey long-sleeved shirt and beige pants. He is sitting on a concrete block and leaning slightly forward, intently writing or sketching on a clipboard.\n\nThe environment around him is somewhat chaotic, filled with numerous stone or concrete blocks of various sizes and shapes, some appearing to be in the process of manufacture or assembly. These blocks are arrayed haphazardly across the floor, with some small cloud-like emissions of smoke or steam arising from the area directly in front of him, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The background is dimly lit, emphasizing the work area in the foreground where reflective and metallic materials can be seen, suggesting the presence of other industrial tools or machinery, potentially related to cutting or assembling these blocks. The atmosphere conjured is one of focus and industriousness within a specialized manufacturing or processing setting.","title":"Experimental wind tunnel device built at Colorado state university.
