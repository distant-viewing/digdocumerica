On the right side of the image, a woman is seated on the edge of a dock or walkway. She has curly hair and wears a colorful sleeveless top paired with jeans. She holds the leash of a large, shaggy dog standing beside her, attentively looking off to the side.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a man is seated casually with his back against the viewer, looking out toward the water. He is dressed in light-colored slacks, a cream jacket, and dark shoes. A small, black and white dog lies next to him on the ground, appearing relaxed or asleep.\n\nThe background features a shimmering expanse of water that fills the upper half of the composition, under a clear sky. The overall vibe of the scene is peaceful and leisurely, with both the humans and animals enjoying a sunny day by the water. The picture captures a moment of tranquility and casual interaction in a picturesque outdoor setting.","title":"Morton Street Pier on the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553089","543500","551516","549716","542874","548695","543083","543327","549954","554126","554532","542731","554537","551571","545958","549471"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dog","leash","slack","cream","half","water","walkway","outdoor","shoe","vibe"]}
