{"path":"556126.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a railway station, focusing on a man signaling to a passing train. The man, positioned on the right side of the frame, is wearing a light jacket and appears to be holding up a red flag with his right arm fully extended, likely signaling to the train crew. His back is towards the viewer, and his head is turned towards the train, watching its approach.\n\nThe train itself is composed of several cars, which appear as sleek, metallic, and feature various shades of blue and silver. It's captured in motion, blurring slightly which conveys a sense of movement. The locomotive at the front is dark-colored with visible windows and some machinery details. Behind it, passenger or service cars follow closely, reflecting the industrial design typical of mid to late 20th-century trains.\n\nThe location seems to be a simple, possibly rural or suburban train station with minimal structures in the visible background. What dominates the background are clear skies and a distant line of trees or bushes, suggesting an open, spacious environment. The platform on which the man stands appears to be made of concrete, adding to the utilitarian feel of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of routine railway activity, focusing on human interaction with the technology of transportation under a bright, clear day.","title":"The Mount Rainier passenger train being directed enroute from Seattle, Washington, to Portland, Oregon. Unlike most other Amtrak trains, this one shows its colors from various railroads; eventually, the non-Amtrak cars will be painted in the corporation's colors. Amtrak is working to upgrade the equipment it inherited from the nation's railroads in an effort to attract more riders.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556846","556108","556090","556109","556857","556782","551006","556064","556120","556021","555984","556063","556845","556022","556116","556087"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","railway","station","locomotive","approach","dark","crew","silver","technology","concrete"]}
