{"path":"548637.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal marina setup. The marina consists of various canals and waterways that form a complex network surrounded by land. These man-made inlets appear to be well-organized and are primarily designed for the mooring of boats, which can be seen docked along the water's edge.\n\nThe layout on land is characterized by neat, curvy roads, and various compartments, which are mostly vacant in the image. Each division in the vicinity is surrounded by sand and equipped with what looks like infrastructure to support watercraft and marine activities. These infrastructures could include boat slips, docking facilities, and maintenance areas. Some buildings, possibly for administrative or service-related uses, are visible near the waterfront.\n\nTowards the horizon, the landscape expanses into larger water bodies, mingling with distant land masses. The image captures this coastal region on a clear day with visibility stretching far into the horizon, where water meets the sky. The overall impression is of a man-made, highly structured, and functional marina designed to cater to recreational boating and possibly commercial marine activities.","title":"Natural waterways and green groves of Cudjoe Key give way to the geometric canals and denuded land of the developers.
