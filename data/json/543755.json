{"path":"543755.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a beautiful winter scene set in a mountainous area. In the foreground, there are numerous thin, intertwined branches heavily coated with pristine white snow, creating a delicate lattice-work of winter foliage. The branches dominate the foreground, with some extending across the frame, suggesting a dense thicket or a cluster of shrubby vegetation.\n\nBehind this snowy veil, the background reveals towering mountains, which are also covered in snow. The slopes of the mountains are steep and rugged, indicating a potentially harsh terrain typical of higher altitude regions. The peaks of the mountains are distinct and rise sharply against the sky.\n\nThe sky above is partially clear with some clouds, suggesting a break in the weather or a transition between snowfalls. The contrast between the deep blue of the sky and the bright white of the snow adds a vibrant and crisp element to the scene.\n\nThis photograph effectively conveys the quiet and serene mood of a snowy landscape in a mountainous region, underscored by the stillness suggested by the undisturbed snow on the branches and the surrounding terrain. The natural beauty and the harshness of the winter environment are captured vividly, offering a glimpse into the tranquil yet stark aspects of winter in such regions.","title":"Early spring snow storm","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["544901","543770","552607","557608","550412","552173","557180","557193","550416","543610","555110","557199","555656","557200","550504","544936"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["winter","snow","branch","region","mountain","veil","thicket","harshness","snowfall","lattice"]}
