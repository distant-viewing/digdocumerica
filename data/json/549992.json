{"path":"549992.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day in an urban setting. The scene is set on a broad plaza with brick paving, surrounded by towering buildings which have a modern architectural style. In the background, the prominent feature is a tall historic tower, partially obscured by a nearby high-rise building. The tower is ornate compared to the sleek minimalism of the surrounding structures and is adorned with flags, including the American flag, fluttering in the breeze.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on a woman with short hair, dressed in a sleeveless top and shorts, walking briskly. She is pushing an old-fashioned pram in which a small child sits. Accompanying her is another child, a young girl, walking beside the pram and a small, light-colored dog on a leash led by the woman.\n\nAdding to the urban feel of the photo are street lamps with spherical, globe-like fixtures that line the plaza. Despite the bustling environment, the area does not appear overly crowded, but several other indistinct people can be seen walking or sitting in the background, enjoying the day. The lighting conditions suggest it might be midday or early afternoon, given the bright sunlight and the sharp shadows cast on the ground. Overall, this picture portrays a lively moment in a diverse and dynamic urban space.","title":"City Hall and Customs House Tower","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546443","557272","544808","551823","550759","550751","551815","557279","551668","557257","551829","551792","557267","550003","553324","551911"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["plaza","flag","leash","tower","globe","paving","child","fixture","breeze","midday"]}
