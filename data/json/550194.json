{"path":"550194.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a city skyline at dusk. The sky shows a gradient of colors ranging from a deep blue at the top of the frame shifting to darker hues towards the horizon, where traces of orange and red are visible suggesting the recent setting of the sun. A few clouds can be seen scattered across the sky, softly lit by the waning light.\n\nThe city skyline is outlined against this colorful backdrop, dominated by various building silhouettes, including high-rises and one particularly prominent skyscraper which stands taller than the others, characterized by its spire and a tiered structure.\n\nThe city is illuminated by numerous lights, creating a pattern of white specks against the darker foreground, hinting at an active urban environment. This includes strings of streetlights and windows of buildings shining in the fading light.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a quiet yet vibrant evening cityscape, with attention focused on the interplay of the artificial city lights and the natural colors of the sky during the twilight hour.","title":"Cleveland at daybreak","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552264","545406","555736","550011","548383","556188","547429","543965","545499","548337","544082","555406","548339","549490","547207","548328"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","skyline","streetlight","string","trace","spire","speck","light","skyscraper","hour"]}
