{"path":"550175.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial, urban landscape, dominated by smog and pollution. The scene is captured during a time of day when the light is dim, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, which adds a dramatic quality to the atmosphere. The primary focus is a busy multi-lane highway that recedes into the distance, bustling with traffic. Vehicles, mostly cars of various models suggestive of an earlier era, are seen in large numbers, both moving and stationary, indicating congested traffic conditions.\n\nIn the background, multiple tall industrial structures emit large plumes of smoke or steam, contributing to the hazy and polluted sky. Numerous electric poles and power lines crisscross the foreground and middle ground, adding to the sense of dense infrastructure and industrial activity. The photo captures not just the physical aspects of the area, but also hints at environmental and possibly health concerns related to air quality and industrial emissions.\n\nThe overall composition, with its deep perspective and layers of infrastructure, vehicles, and pollution, presents a stark portrait of urban and industrial life, likely highlighting concerns about sustainability and environmental impact.","title":"Clark Avenue and Clark Avenue Bridge, looking east from West 13th Street, are obscured by industrial smoke.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550171","550179","551069","553020","548326","550173","550185","550191","542682","553021","551057","550181","545451","547122","545265","551033"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["concern","pollution","sustainability","traffic","smog","infrastructure","health","portrait","quality","emission"]}
