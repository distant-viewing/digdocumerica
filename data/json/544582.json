{"path":"544582.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of nature featuring a cactus plant with large, blooming yellow flowers. The main focus of the image is a bright yellow cactus flower in full bloom, exhibiting delicate, broad petals and prominent stamens with white anthers. To the left of the blooming flower, there is a bud about to open, shaded in a soft peach to yellow hue.\n\nThe cactus itself has large flat pads that are green in color with black dots from which sharp spines protrude. These spines vary in length, with some longer and more pronounced, creating a stark contrast to the softness of the flowers.\n\nThe background features a slightly blurred mixture of green foliage, which gives a lush backdrop to the cactus, enhancing the colors of the flowers. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken either in the late morning or early afternoon, providing a natural and well-lit environment that highlights the textures and colors of the plants.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo balances the harsh, spiky textures of the cactus pads with the soft, gentle appearance of the cactus flowers, showcasing the unique beauty of desert flora.","title":"Cactus flower along devil's backbone ranch road #12","placename":"San Marcos (Tex.)","location":"San Marcos, Texas","nn1":["554844","545709","544885","544891","545727","544877","555370","545712","545722","545309","545718","544875","544890","544879","554580","545699"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cactus","flower","spine","bloom","pad","stamen","softness","bud","petal","plant"]}
