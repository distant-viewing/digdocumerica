{"path":"551624.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures two young girls enjoying a day at an urban community garden. Each girl is proudly displaying freshly picked vegetables. The girl on the left holds a cucumber and a carrot, and she wears a dark blue halter top and denim shorts, accessorized with a large buckle belt. The girl on the right, with curly hair, holds up a carrot and a green leafy top. She wears a plain navy blue sleeveless top and a knee-length denim skirt.\n\nThe garden around them is lush and densely planted, indicating a mid to late growing season. There are various types of plants visible, including large leafy greens and possibly some tomato plants in the background. The environment suggests a well-tended and productive space.\n\nIn the background, beyond the fenced perimeter of the garden, there is an urban setting with visible buildings which look somewhat industrial or possibly part of a construction site. This juxtaposition of vibrant, natural gardening against the backdrop of city infrastructure highlights the contrast and coexistence of natural and man-made environments. What is particularly interesting is the sense of joy and pride the girls exhibit, which brings a human warmth to the urban landscape.","title":"Successful city \"farmers\" proudly display early harvest grown on vacant block (92nd to 93rd street, 2nd to 3rd avenue) volunteer gardeners were assigned plots by community organization","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551623","551621","551620","551728","551619","550063","551618","551617","555358","551738","551730","551633","550055","550764","553424","551748"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["girl","garden","leafy","denim","buckle","halter","top","vegetable","pride","perimeter"]}
