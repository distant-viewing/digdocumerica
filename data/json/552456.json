{"path":"552456.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene centered around a small white building labeled \"La Porte City Elementary School.\" The building shows signs of wear and age, with peeling paint and a somewhat unkempt appearance. It has a modest construction with a single-story structure, and there appears to be an extension or an attached secondary structure on the left that is partially obscured.\n\nA dirt road curves around the front of the schoolhouse, marked by patches of grass and scattered gravel, suggesting a less-traveled pathway. Surrounding the building are several tall, thin trees, adding a touch of nature to the setting.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with sizable, fluffy clouds suggesting a serene or calm day.\n\nThis scene is typical of many small, rural school buildings from earlier times, indicating that this may be a historical photograph. The image captures the essence of rural educational facilities, possibly highlighting themes of education accessibility in less urbanized areas or the community-centered nature of small-town schools.","title":"La Prairie Center Grade School: closed","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["553818","557171","552507","549626","558099","549221","552681","547658","557154","558205","550648","556330","550704","555611","557103","557948"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["school","education","extension","accessibility","building","gravel","peel","essence","pathway","travel"]}
