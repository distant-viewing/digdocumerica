{"path":"551625.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts a man standing on a rooftop garden in an urban environment. He is dressed in a red shirt and dark pants, focused on tending to a row of plants housed in a long, narrow, black planter box. He appears to be either planting or caring for the small, bushy, yellow-flowered plants.\n\nThe garden is lush and densely packed with a variety of plants, showing a commitment to greenery amid the city backdrop. Directly behind the man is a white railing, possibly a safety feature for the rooftop. The architecture of the roof suggests an older, charming style with visible elements like a white structure adorned with wooden slats and a hint of ornate detailing near the roof's edge.\n\nBeyond the intimate scene of gardening, the background reveals a cityscape with numerous mid-rise buildings, suggesting a densely populated urban area. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, which enhances the vividness of the plants and the city buildings' muted tones.\n\nOverall, the composition balances the personal scale of human activity and the broader urban environment, highlighting a moment of tranquility and connection to nature in a bustling city setting.","title":"Cherries, carrots, strawberries and roses are only some of the plants that flourish twenty floors up in stuart mott's penthouse garden.  77th street and park avenue","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551627","551626","551628","550059","550764","551755","551623","551620","551490","551705","551630","550055","555523","551743","555522","551704"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["rooftop","plant","garden","city","charme","slat","planter","gardening","roof","detailing"]}
