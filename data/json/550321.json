{"path":"550321.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape featuring a wide river under a cloudy sky. The river gently flows in the foreground, reflecting the moody grey of the overcast sky above. On one side of the river, partially visible in the frame, is a pile of freshly cut logs, hinting at logging activities in the area. These logs are gathered at the edge of the water, likely ready for transport or processing.\n\nThe background is densely lined with a lush forest of evergreen trees and a few deciduous ones, suggesting a northern or temperate climate. The colors are muted, with the greens of the trees and the grayish hues of the sky blending seamlessly, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat somber atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements convey a natural landscape potentially impacted by human activity, under a vast, expansive sky that dominates the mood of the scene.","title":"St.  Croix river about two miles above the Georgia pacific paper plant--looking north.
