{"path":"551629.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene street scene, possibly in a historic or affluent neighborhood. The focus is on a row of tall, traditional townhouses that feature multiple stories and a uniform aesthetic. These buildings are adorned with red and maroon facades, accented by white-framed windows and elegant, ornate black ironwork on the balconies. The architecture suggests possibly a Victorian or Edwardian era style.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a lush green area with a small well-kept garden flanked by a low iron fence. A person, dressed in light-colored clothing, is engaged in washing or cleaning the sidewalk with a hose, creating a wet surface that reflects some light. This person appears calm and focused on their task.\n\nThe scene is shaded by overhanging trees which cast dappled shadows on the buildings and the sidewalk, adding a tranquil, almost idyllic quality to the setting. The lighting suggests it might be morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight is soft and angled.\n\nAdditionally, there's a glimpse of parked vintage cars on the street, further hinting at the era or the historic preservation of the area. The overall composition of the photo, with its rich colors and calm activity, conveys a sense of quiet urban life, possibly from a bygone era.","title":"The old fashioned homes and gardens of Gramercy Park have been beautifully maintained since 1831.
