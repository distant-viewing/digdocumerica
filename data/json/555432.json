{"path":"555432.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a car's rear license plate, which is mounted on a beige or light-colored vehicle. The license plate is yellow with black text that reads “WET OREGON,” playing humorously on the state’s reputation for rainy weather. Above the main text, “JUN” is printed, indicating the month, and below “OREGON,” there's a sticker indicating the plate is valid until June 1974. The license number, although partially obscured, appears as 452-890 or similar. The plate is framed by two shiny chrome bumper parts or details, suggesting a classic car model from mid-20th century. There are minor signs of wear and rust around the plate and vehicle’s details, hinting at outdoor exposure.","title":"An Oregon personalized license plate with the letters \"wet\" however, lack of rain created a serious energy crisis in the pacific northwest in the fall of 1973.
