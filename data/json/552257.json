{"path":"552257.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"In this photograph, two young boys are engaged in fishing by a small body of water. The boy closest to the camera is dressed in a bright yellow shirt and dark beige pants. He is holding a fishing rod, and his focus seems to be on the water, observing either his line or the water's surface. The second boy is partially visible; he stands behind and to the side of the first boy, also with a fishing rod in hand. He dons a white short-sleeved shirt and darker pants.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor environment with industrial elements. Just beyond the body of water, a substantial and complex series of electrical power towers and ancillary structures dominate the background. Green vegetation, including tall grasses and bushes, surrounds the edges of the water, adding a natural element to the frame.\n\nThe overall composition balances the tranquility of a leisure activity like fishing with the imposing industrial backdrop, suggesting a juxtaposition between nature and human-made structures. The scene under a bright, seemingly sunny sky, possibly indicates a warm, casual day outdoors.","title":"Youngsters fish in the intertidal area of the duwamish river which flows into puget sound at Seattle","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["551162","553914","544303","552118","550848","549935","551025","543516","557741","553081","550231","542740","552116","550776","543220","542564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boy","fishing","rod","don","water","closest","pants","towers","beige","shirt"]}
