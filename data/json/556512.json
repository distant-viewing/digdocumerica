{"path":"556512.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a dark cave. A person, possibly a caver, dressed in caving gear which includes a grey jacket, pants, gloves, and a helmet with a headlamp, is prominently featured. They are in a squatting position with their back slightly hunched, as if carefully navigating or inspecting the uneven terrain. Their focus seems directed towards the ground or something out of the frame.\n\nThe cave around the person is dimly lit, showing rough and uneven surfaces. The ground appears to be covered with small stones or rubble, reflecting some light and creating a speckled pattern. Portions of the cave's ceiling and walls are visible, characterized by their rocky, rugged texture that commonly typifies subterranean environments.\n\nIn the background, the hints of some objects are partially visible; however, due to the low lighting, specific details are obscured. The space is cloaked in shadow, giving it an eerie and isolated ambiance. The sparse illumination provided by the person's headlamp and possibly other distant light sources highlights only segments of the surrounding area, leaving much to darkness.","title":"Jerry Layne, foreman of a crew at a Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company mine near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee, checks the roof of a shaft prior to placing a four to five foot roof bolt in the ceiling as a brace. This is dangerous work because the roof could cave in before being braced.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551359","556427","556398","556367","556514","545567","556519","556319","543756","556357","556358","556362","556364","556513","556366","556515"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["cave","headlamp","person","rubble","glove","segment","illumination","darkness","source","ceiling"]}
