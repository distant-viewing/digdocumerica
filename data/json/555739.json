{"path":"555739.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image presents a sweeping aerial view of a densely packed urban landscape, possibly capturing a major city's riverfront area. The photograph mainly features multiple bridges spanning over a broad river. Closest to the foreground, thereâ€™s a distinctive suspension bridge with a tall, ornate tower and steel cables. Beyond it, a second suspension bridge can be seen, slightly larger with similar structural elements.\n\nBetween and around these bridges, extensive industrial infrastructure lines the riverbanks, including factories with large chimneys emitting no visible smoke, storage tanks, and what appear to be cargo loading areas. A multitude of dense industrial and commercial buildings fill the rest of the visible land area, suggesting a highly developed urban zone.\n\nIn the river, a few boats, likely industrial or cargo vessels, are visible. These elements collectively suggest a bustling, busy industrial sector, possibly in a historic period given the film quality and coloring, which has a slightly faded or dated appearance.\n\nOn the left side closer to the bottom of the frame, a small green park area provides a contrast to the industrial backdrop, featuring what looks like a baseball diamond, paths, and grassy areas.\n\nThe background extends into a hazy horizon where further bridge structures and industrial facilities repeat, underscoring the scale and industrial focus of the region. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of this urban landscape's complexity and industrial activity.","title":"The East River and Queens, New York. Transportation in an urban and industrial area like New York produces environmental problems of its own. Freeways sprawl across the landscape and cut through the hearts of cities, isolating one neighborhood from another. The autoMobile must take responsibility for air pollution, one of the more critical environmental problems affecting the bight.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555758","551181","547586","548427","555767","551182","555744","548344","551989","551178","548416","550964","548320","546569","555733","546903"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","suspension","cargo","sector","diamond","coloring","multitude","loading","baseball","river"]}
