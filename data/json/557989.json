{"path":"557989.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting featuring a series of symmetrically aligned chalet-style buildings, possibly serving as lodging or resort facilities. The structures exhibit dark walls with contrasting white trim around windows and doors, under steep red roofs, contributing to a rustic yet orderly appearance. The central part of the image is occupied by a large gravel area, suggesting a communal or parking space, dotted with a few cars that reflect the era's automotive design.\n\nTowards the right foreground of the frame, there's a prominently placed wooden sign in a triangular shape, displaying the text \"Boston Mills Ski Area\" in white letters on a red background, indicating the location's primary recreational purpose during winter seasons. Lush green grass and sporadic wildflowers occupy the lower foreground, adding a touch of natural vibrancy to the scene.\n\nThe background is composed of a gently rising, tree-covered hill under a sky dotted with scattered clouds, enhancing the peaceful and secluded atmosphere typical of a mountain resort area. The overall composition and elements of the photograph suggest leisure and outdoor activity focus, aimed at attracting visitors and skiers.","title":"Ski lodge and slopes in the background in Boston township at riverview road and Boston mills, near Cleveland, Ohio.
