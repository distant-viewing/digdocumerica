{"path":"542808.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a striking coastal seascape scene during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, indicated by the low illumination and the way light reflects off the water’s surface. The view is directed toward the ocean, which is riddled with a series of rock formations and small islets protruding from the sea. \n\nThe primary feature is the shimmering sea, animated by wavering, golden highlights that trace along the crests of small waves. Multiple levels of wave patterns can be seen, creating a textured and dynamic water surface. The intensity of the sunlight casting these reflections suggests the sun is low in the sky, near the horizon, either setting or rising.\n\nIn the distance, the silhouette of a larger, dome-shaped island can be discerned against a slightly lighter sky, further enhancing the depth of the scene. The foreground is dominated by dark, sharply-defined rocky outcrops, their jagged edges cutting starkly against the softer patterns of the water.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a serene yet magnificent atmosphere, focusing on the interplay of light, shadow, and natural forms. There’s a palpable sense of tranquility and the immensity of nature captured in the mix of darker tones and glints of light.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553852","543060","543064","543051","557508","547483","544985","543025","547638","543068","542917","545173","543304","547091","543080","552886"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["animate","wave","glint","islet","sea","crest","trace","seascape","outcrop","dome"]}
