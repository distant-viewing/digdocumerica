{"path":"548899.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to be taken from the cockpit of a helicopter, capturing the view from inside as well as the scenery outside. Inside the cockpit, the back of the pilot's head is visible; he is wearing a dark uniform and a headset. The interior features several control panels, and part of the cockpit's frame is seen, which houses numerous knobs and gauges.\n\nOutside the helicopter, the landscape consists of a serene river snaking through a dry terrain dotted with green vegetation. The river curves gracefully through the landscape, reflecting the blue of the sky. The surrounding terrain is mostly flat with occasional small hills or mounds, covered sparsely with bushes and small trees. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day, contributing to the vividness of the colors in the scenery.","title":"EPA's helicopter surveying the Colorado River","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545645","553787","553786","548815","544737","547533","545642","547272","542696","546688","545638","546687","545637","544749","555835","550542"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["cockpit","helicopter","scenery","pilot","knob","gauge","vividness","snake","river","mound"]}
