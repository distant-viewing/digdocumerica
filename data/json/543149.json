{"path":"543149.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image appears to depict a close-up view of a textured surface, possibly a rock or a mineral formation. The dominant colors in the photograph are yellow, ochre, and black. These colors form a pattern across the surface that includes patchy and uneven areas, indicating natural weathering or chemical reactions. The yellow areas are especially bright and are contrasted by the black spots that seem to be depressions or holes in the material.\n\nThe rough texture suggests a conglomerate of different materials, potentially lichens or mineral deposits that give the surface a pitted and uneven appearance. The intricate details and variations in color might also suggest that this is a type of geological or biological sample, possibly taken from a rock face or a bark with lichens. No specific activities, people, or objects other than the textured surface are visible in this image. The focus is solely on the intricate details and the natural beauty of the patterns and textures.","title":"California--point lobos state park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["553582","555793","550606","550474","544682","555182","543151","554594","550476","550483","545597","544907","544815","554410","550475","546119"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lichen","mineral","surface","depression","reaction","hole","sample","deposit","rock","material"]}
