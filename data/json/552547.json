{"path":"552547.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a large, varied pile of wood pieces, likely kindling or split wood. The wood is fragmented, showing diverse shapes, sizes, and textures, applying light to dark shades primarily in brown and beige tones but includes areas of deeper browns and blacks. Each piece reveals different grain patterns and possible bark remnants, creating an intricate visual mosaic. The sunlight illuminates the pile, casting sharp shadows and enhancing the textures and layers of the wood, suggesting the photo was taken in bright, natural light. The focus depth is shallow, blurring the background which appears to continue this theme of scattered wooden pieces. The composition is dense, with little to no space unoccupied by wood, giving the photograph a textured and richly detailed appearance that emphasizes the natural organic beauty and the chaotic order within a seemingly random heap of wooden pieces.","title":"Oil shale.
