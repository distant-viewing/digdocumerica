{"path":"554855.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a man in a work setting, carrying a large bundle of wood. The man wears a worn white shirt, dark pants, and a yellow hard hat, suggesting he may be engaged in laborious or construction-related work. His facial expression is serious or focused.\n\nIn the background, there are numerous stacked bags with printed labels, indicating they contain some kind of industrial or construction material. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly within a storage or construction area, given the visible dirt on the ground and the informal arrangement of materials.\n\nThe man is centrally positioned within the frame, highlighting the physical burden of the wooden logs he carries. The composition of the image, with the man offset slightly to the left, draws focus to the large volume of packed materials behind him, perhaps underscoring the industrial context in which he is working. The overall appearance suggests a scene of physical labor, possibly in a developing or industrialized setting given the nature and amount of the materials.","title":"Worker from Mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554853","553612","553648","557110","553631","554432","553618","553614","554427","542497","542857","554431","553647","553643","553613","553644"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["material","construction","bundle","man","volume","work","label","kind","amount","log"]}
