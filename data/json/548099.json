{"path":"548099.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a winding mountain road that dramatically snakes its way through a densely wooded area. The road bends sharply, forming S-shaped curves, which are clearly visible from the high viewpoint. One particular sharp turn stands out because of its almost complete circular layout.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is densely forested with tall trees, suggesting that the area is in a mountainous region. Parts of the roadside are scattered with large rocks, indicating recent roadwork or natural rockslides. In the foreground, a small portion of a guardrail is visible, enhancing the sense of height and the precipitous nature of the terrain.\n\nThe color palette of the photo is rich with dark greens from the trees and shades of gray from the asphalt and surrounding rocks. The lighting seems natural, possibly photographed during midday, judging from the minimal shadowing around the bend of the road. There are no vehicles or people visible, which adds an air of tranquility and isolation to the scene. \n\nOverall, the image may evoke a sense of adventure or caution due to the treacherousness of the road, and it highlights the beauty of natural, rugged landscapes.","title":"Columbia River Gorge looking west from the summit of Rowena Hills between Mosier and the Hood River.
