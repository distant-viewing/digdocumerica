{"path":"544554.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a serene coastal landscape, likely taken from a high vantage point looking out over a tropical area. The image prominently features a body of water that weaves through the center, surrounded by lush greenery. Below, there are curving sandy shores that border the water, surrounded by various types of vegetation, including numerous palm trees and other bushy plants, enhancing the tropical atmosphere.\n\nThe waterway curves gently from the foreground toward the horizon in the upper part of the image, bordered on the right by a more densely forested area which fades into the distance. There is a noticeable man-made structure with a thatched roof on the right side of the shoreline near the center, possibly a dock or small building, that contributes a human presence to the mostly natural scene. Several small boats are visible in the water, adding to the leisurely, calm setting often associated with coastal regions. \n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced with the natural curve of the shoreline directing the eye from the front left to the center and out towards the horizon. The overall lighting suggests it was taken during the late afternoon, given the soft, warm tones and long shadows cast by the trees, contributing to the peaceful and idyllic mood of the scene. The sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, suggesting good weather conditions.","title":"Florida--near matheson hammock, south of Miami","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["542870","554101","554081","556923","548604","543362","548785","553982","554085","551573","553983","554074","542918","545030","557529","547980"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["curve","shoreline","border","center","palm","weave","horizon","vantage","waterway","direct"]}
