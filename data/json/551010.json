{"path":"551010.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures two children engaging in outdoor play on a sunny day. The setting is a residential area, indicated by a large blue building in the background possibly serving as a home, with a simple white door alongside a closed window.\n\nThe foreground shows a concrete walkway surrounded by a grassy area dotted with small white flowers. On this pathway, a young girl is seated on a yellow, flat skateboard, holding onto the front edges, ready to ride. She wears a red shirt with a purple collar, adding a vibrant touch to the scene. Her focus is directed forwards, suggesting movement and action.\n\nStanding behind her is a boy who appears to be assisting or pushing her. He is bent over in an active position, with one foot on the board's back end, perhaps contributing to propelling her forward. He wears a white shirt and dark brown pants, and his attention is fixed on the task.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is playful and light-hearted, as both children seem engrossed in their activity, enjoying a typical childhood moment outdoors. The image reflects themes of friendship, assistance, and the simple joys of a leisurely day.","title":"The children of Rand live in a town where much of the housing is substandard and many of the roads unpaved","placename":"Charleston (W.
