{"path":"552117.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals on a sloped riverbank. The person on the left, a man, is dressed in a sleeveless top and flared pants, stepping carefully down the muddy terrain. The person on the right, likely a woman, wears a light-colored, short-sleeve top and slacks. She is holding onto a tree for support as she navigates the steep bank. Her gaze is directed towards the ground, concentrating on her footing.\n\nThe background features a broad river, flowing left to right, with industrial structures visible on the far bank, including a large factory with tall smokestacks and a bridge spanning the river. The foliage around the two individuals is lush, indicating a possibly humid or tropical environment. A wooden structure, possibly part of a small dock or fishing platform, can be seen at the waterâ€™s edge next to the woman.\n\nThis setting suggests an outdoor activity possibly related to fishing or river access, with a mix of natural and industrial elements in the surroundings. The image conveys a sense of careful movement and attention to the rugged, natural terrain.","title":"Warren freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas river.
