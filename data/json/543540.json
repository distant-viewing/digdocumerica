{"path":"543540.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a family scene outdoors featuring five people, likely a father and his children, set against a background of wooden buildings and crates.\n\nA man, possibly in his 30s, holding a toddler girl, stands in the foreground on the left. The man is wearing glasses, a white T-shirt, and blue jeans, with a rugged pair of work boots, suggesting a casual and labor-oriented setting. The toddler has shoulder-length hair and is clad in a horizontally striped T-shirt and darker pants.\n\nTo the right, three children are interacting amongst themselves on and near a stack of wide wooden crates. The crates appear new or unused, hinting that this might be a residential or agricultural area. The child directly next to the man is a girl, standing on the ground, wearing a light-colored top with dark stripes, matching shorts, and she looks directly at the camera with a slightly reserved expression.\n\nFurther to the right, on the crates, are two more children, boys, engaged in playful or curious activity looking outward. The boy on the lower crate is dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans, while the one on the uppermost crate also wears a plaid shirt, styled in a lighter color, with a ornamental design on his wristwatch band or bracelet.\n\nIn the background, the setting consists of rustic-looking wooden buildings with shaded windows, which might be residential cabins or storage units. The area around the buildings and crates is covered with gravel, and there is sparse vegetation, suggesting a rural or semi-rural environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image is bright, probably indicating a sunny day, casting prominent shadows and enhancing the warm, familial atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Family of Ron and Teresa Eppers and construction of Lake Forest Glen","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["547135","556531","547398","544361","558292","553498","544310","552821","548312","554506","553094","557368","551129","555546","554447","557933"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["crate","toddler","child","girl","boy","shirt","30","bracelet","father","jean"]}
