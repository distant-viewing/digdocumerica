{"path":"553670.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a vast, lush green landscape. The plane's shadow is distinctly visible on the left side of the image, casting onto a slightly textured green field, which hints at a low altitude or relatively large aircraft. Directly below the shadow, we see a thin strip of a well-defined dirt path or small road flanked by lines of trees, suggesting some form of human access through the area.\n\nTo the right of the image, the greenery spreads widely across the landscape, showing variations in color intensity that could indicate different types of vegetation or the sun's angle. In the distance, a broader dirt road cuts horizontally across the scene, demarcated by occasional sparse trees or shrubs.\n\nIn the far background, running parallel to the plane's forward direction, there appears to be a clear line dividing the green field from a more barren or lightly vegetated area. This division might be another road or a property boundary.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, focusing heavily on the natural elements from an aerial view, offers an expansive sense of open space and hints at minimal human intervention aside from the visible paths or roads through the terrain.","title":"Irrigated fields along the Truckee River","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["553817","557003","556937","550575","556938","550578","556968","554164","556920","543767","553564","550569","552858","550643","549175","553668"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["plane","road","path","demarcate","dirt","division","intervention","field","aircraft","intensity"]}
