{"path":"551562.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of industrial environmental degradation, focusing primarily on polluted water in the foreground. The water is dark and appears thick with various effluent, showing swirls and filmy substances on its surface. This contamination contrasts starkly with the otherwise calm appearance of the water.\n\nIn the background, an old industrial building that seems abandoned shows damaged windows and decaying walls, contributing to the sceneâ€™s grim and neglected feel. Piles of rubble and debris litter the bank to the left of the building, possibly remnants of demolition or uncared-for waste. On the right side, more modern industrial structures are visible, including a silo and what appears to be a conveyor system, possibly still in use.\n\nThe area around these buildings is devoid of vegetation, reinforcing a sense of desolation. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright day, which adds an eerie brightness to the otherwise dark and polluted setting. This scene conveys a poignant message about environmental neglect and industrial impact on natural resources.","title":"The shipment of gain is a major activity of Duluth harbor.
