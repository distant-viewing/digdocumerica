{"path":"550713.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial or construction environment in a state of disarray, likely reflecting some activity related to waste management or construction. You can see heavy and tumultuous water flow emerging from a large pipe, which is discharging into what looks like a natural or man-made channel, helping to focus on an environmental or pollution issue.\n\nSpecifically, the foreground is dominated by the muddy, foaming water flow, while the mid-ground shows various industrial elements like the large pipeline and other construction or debris management equipment. There is a significant accumulation of debris or waste, indicated by a large pile of them visible in the background, which also includes some wooded areas which suggest that this site is on the outskirts of a wooded or rural area.\n\nThere is a person in the background, roughly in the center of the image, standing and facing towards the piles of debris or waste, although it's unclear what specific activity they are performing due to the distance and angle. The overall feeling of the picture suggests issues such as pollution control, waste management, or heavy construction in a somewhat disorganized environment. The atmosphere of the image, with overcast skies, and scattered industrial wreckage or litter, underscores a sense of environmental urgency or cleanup.","title":"Effluent from the International Paper Company mill at Jay gushes into Allen Brook near confluence of the brook and the Androscoggin River.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550959","550193","549564","543819","544775","553467","546793","544810","552046","551562","550708","544784","555867","547485","544040","543773"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","construction","management","issue","flow","debris","pollution","pile","cleanup","wreckage"]}
