{"path":"555639.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape scene dominated by a sloping hill with a single leafless tree standing at the top center, starkly contrasting against the clear sky. The foreground features a rough, stony path, leading up towards the hill. The vegetation covering the hill is a mix of green, indicating it might be spring or summer. This setting is rural and somewhat desolate, emphasized by the lack of other trees or buildings in immediate view. The photograph has a feel of solitude and a slightly subdued color palette, likely due to the lighting or the type of film used in the camera.","title":"Hanna Coal Company land off Interstate 70 near Fairview, Ohio, which has been recontoured and seeded.
