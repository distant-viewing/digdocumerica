{"path":"544651.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural environment where large broad-leaved plants dominate the image foreground. These plants have vibrant green leaves that are large and arched, resembling those typically found in warm, moist climates. Amongst this lush vegetation, there appears to be an assortment of discarded beer cans, contrasting sharply with the natural surroundings. These aluminum cans are scattered across the ground, lying among small ferns and other green undergrowth. The background is densely packed with similar vegetation, creating a closed, green environment, emphasizing the discordance between the natural setting and the human-generated waste. The photograph may serve as a poignant comment on pollution or neglect of natural habitats.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the TaMiami Canal area beside Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544640","544648","544652","546946","544644","543616","544298","551440","544647","551246","555257","551247","550812","550806","550687","552089"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","comment","aluminum","beer","fern","generate","undergrowth","assortment","plant","habitat"]}
