{"path":"549129.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape with a distinct focus on a warning sign planted in the ground. The sign is centrally positioned in the frame and is made of a white background with red and black lettering. The top of the sign prominently features the word \"NOTICE\" in bold, red letters, below which the text, in black, reads: \"ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT BY EMPLOYEES&AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\". Below this warning, additional text advises \"ALL OTHERS OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM OFFICE\" with the address or contact \"MORRISON-KNUDSEN, INC. 802 WEST 3 ST. - HARDIN\" underneath in smaller black letters.\n\nThe background behind the sign consists of an expansive, grassy field with sparse vegetation, primarily low scrub and patches of bare soil, indicative of a dry or semi-arid environment. The horizon is flat with no visible trees or structures, enhancing the sense of isolation and emptiness in the scene. The overall composition of the photo, along with its soft focus, conveys a quiet and secluded rural setting, possibly on or near a construction or restricted site managed by the mentioned corporation.","title":"Sign at the westmoreland coal company mine site in sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["548951","548845","555858","548836","544845","544245","555647","557546","554103","545159","557474","555582","543637","555856","545949","553905"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","letter","sign","text","emptiness","restrict","scrub","contact","notice","address"]}
