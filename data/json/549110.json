{"path":"549110.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a series of large electrical transmission towers stretching into the distance under a muted sky. The towers are metal structures, angular and intricate, designed to support multiple high-voltage electric lines. These lines sag between the towers, forming gentle curves and appearing almost delicate against the robustness of the towers.\n\nIn the background, a mountainous silhouette can be seen under a hazy sky, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. The colors in the image are somewhat monochromatic, dominated by shades of green and yellow, which might be due to the time of day or a filter used in the photography process.\n\nThe overall composition leads the viewerâ€™s eye along the line of towers, and the horizontal layout of the image emphasizes the vast, open space occupied by the towers. This setting is likely in a rural or suburban area, given the absence of any buildings or other human-made structures besides the electrical infrastructure. The combination of technology and nature creates a compelling juxtaposition, highlighting the scale and impact of human engineering in natural landscapes.","title":"Power lines from nearby hoover dam bring electricity to southern California","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553028","544355","553830","555574","548136","557977","549011","543728","543903","544300","544613","545050","544296","547940","546389","547936"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["towers","voltage","desig","transmission","line","hazy","photography","engineering","technology","combination"]}
