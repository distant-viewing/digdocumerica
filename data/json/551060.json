{"path":"551060.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene set against a mountainous backdrop. It features thick plumes of white and grey smoke ascending prominently into the air from what appears to be a factory or industrial facility nestled in a valley. The factory comprises several buildings with metal roofs, some exhibiting signs of rust and age. To the left of the image, a large metal-framed powerline tower stands, aligning vertically with the billowing smoke.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is lush and densely wooded, indicating that the facility is situated in a heavily forested area. The sky above is a muted blue, possibly tinged by the smoke or the time of day. No visible human activity or people are present in the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention on the environmental impact and the stark contrast between industry and nature. The image evokes a sense of isolation and possibly hints at environmental degradation associated with industrial processes.","title":"Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant seen from across the Kanawha River at Montgomery Heights","placename":"Charleston (W.
