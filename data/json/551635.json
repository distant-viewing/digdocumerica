{"path":"551635.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor café scene in front of a large, modern building characterized by three prominent arches. The building features tall windows set within these arches, and is constructed of a light-colored material, possibly concrete or stone.\n\nIn the foreground, the café area is bustling with people seated at various small, round tables. The patrons appear relaxed and engaged in conversations, enjoying what seems to be a warm day. Some individuals are eating, while others are simply sitting, contributing to a casual, social atmosphere.\n\nAdding to the ambiance, vibrant red planters filled with lush greenery and bright red flowers line the café area, serving both a decorative and functional purpose as space dividers. The overall setting suggests a public space designed for leisure and dining, possibly situated in a civic or cultural district given the architectural style of the building.\n\nThe photograph, likely taken during the day given the bright lighting and shadows, vividly portrays an urban environment where people come together to enjoy outdoor activities in a well-designed architectural setting.","title":"Lincoln Center Plaza is bounded by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
