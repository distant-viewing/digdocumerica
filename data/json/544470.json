{"path":"544470.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural scene focusing on a water channel and its surrounding environment. Here is the detailed description:\n\nAt the forefront of the image is a water channel, with muddy, murky water flowing from left to right. The water appears to have a smooth, flowing texture but is filled with debris including twigs and leaves, reflecting its brown color prominently.\n\nThe banks of the channel are evident on both sides. The left bank, which is closer to the camera, is quite distinct, showing erosion or a cutaway that exposes the dark soil underneath. This bank is lined sharply with dense, green grass that appears lush, running parallel to the water's edge, and dips directly into the water line, suggesting that the water level might be high or the bank might be steeply cut.\n\nThe right bank of the channel is less visible and blends more into the background, but it is similarly covered with grass and has a more gentle slope compared to the left side. \n\nIn the background, there are trees and an open field, suggesting that this channel is situated in a rural or semi-rural environment. The field is sprawling and covered in same dense, green grass, enhancing the peaceful and natural quality of the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a sunny day, given the brightness and the clear shadows cast in the water and on the banks. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of calm and a touch of wilderness, emphasizing an undisturbed waterway in a natural landscape.","title":"Topsoil washed away by flood waters of Guadalupe River jagged fissures remain in wake of receding flood","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["547487","553427","545008","544765","549641","550341","553083","558009","550351","546126","545473","545866","542557","547526","552953","553434"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["channel","bank","water","description","grass","twig","field","brightness","calm","erosion"]}
