{"path":"546767.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, characterized by a myriad of intertwined and layered piping systems. In the foreground, large pipes with round protrusions on their surfaces run horizontally across the image. These pipes appear metallic, perhaps stainless steel or aluminum, and are bathed in droplets, suggesting the presence of moisture or a spraying mechanism. Leading from the front to the middle, these pipes converge into a central structure that looks like a complex network of connectors and support frameworks.\n\nThe background features additional arrays of similar piping, but these extend vertically and horizontally, creating a dense mesh of industrial complexity. The pipes intersect at various angles, and additional horizontal cables or small-diameter pipes are suspended above. The scene is enveloped in fine spray or mist, densely filling the space between the pipes, which adds a shimmering haze to the image. This mist contributes to an atmosphere of dynamic industrial activity, possibly related to cooling, cleaning, or chemical processes.\n\nThe setting has an outdoor feel due to the presence of natural light and distant trees visible in the background, hinting that this industrial installation is located in an open area rather than enclosed within a factory building. The general ambiance is technical and intense, highlighted by the sun's glare reflecting off the wet surfaces of the metallic pipes and the diffused light filtering through the mist, giving a slightly eerie and dramatic tone to the overall composition.","title":"Filters at the back river sewage treatment plant.
