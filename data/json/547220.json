{"path":"547220.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial construction site in a semi-urban area. It captures several key features and activities related to the installation or expansion of infrastructure.\n\nForeground and Center:\n- The ground is uneven, filled with dirt, tools, machinery, and construction vehicles which indicates ongoing heavy construction work.\n- Prominent in the center is a fuel truck labeled \"Safety-Kleen,\" indicating its function in delivering or removing hazardous materials for safe disposal.\n- There are several other vehicles, including red cars and a variety of trucks, some likely used for moving heavy equipment or materials.\n- Construction materials such as wooden planks and metal beams are scattered throughout, along with trenches reinforced by wooden walls suggesting foundational work or installation of underground utilities.\n- There are no visible people, suggesting minimal activity at the time the photo was taken or focusing more on the site setup.\n\nMiddle Distance:\n- A large electrical substation with multiple transformers and high-voltage lines is seen, indicating that this construction site might be related to energy production or distribution.\n\nBackground:\n- Beyond the immediate construction activities, the area opens up to what appears to be a river or a large body of water with a bridge spanning across. This geography suggests strategic placement for either transport ease or the use of water resources.\n- The farther background shows a wooded area with fall season foliage, giving the scene a mixed industrial-natural vibe.\n\nThe sky is clear, suggesting good weather, which is typically optimal for construction activities. The overall mood is busy yet orderly, typical of large-scale industrial projects.","title":"Expansion of the blue plains sewage treatment plant","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["553383","553453","547225","544167","554809","546252","556939","550274","553382","549169","549204","555787","551966","552814","547591","548437"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","installation","site","material","voltage","ease","geography","trench","remove","expansion"]}
