{"path":"546191.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene, apparently in the midst of some type of event or activity that involves heavy machinery and smoke. Dominating the background is a large industrial building, possibly a factory or warehouse, which appears to be emitting a volume of smoke or steam. The subtle hues near the top of the image suggest the presence of smoke or air pollution, coloring the sky in murky browns and grays.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, several pieces of heavy machinery and equipment are scattered around an open area, which looks like an outdoor section of the industrial facility. One prominent piece of equipment in the forefront resembles a tow truck or a mobile crane, equipped with various tools and cylindrical objects, perhaps for maintenance or construction tasks. Nearby, scattered debris or materials add to the sense of ongoing industrial operations or cleanup efforts.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is gritty and busy, suggesting a snapshot of industrial activity, possibly related to manufacturing, construction, or emergency response within a factory setting. The color tones are subdued, mainly consisting of browns, grays, and muted yellows, contributing to a somewhat somber and utilitarian mood. Signs of wear or aging in the photograph, such as scratches and dust, indicate it might be an older image, capturing a moment from a past industrial era.","title":"Le tourneau Marathon ammunition plant","placename":"Longview (Tex.)","location":"Longview, Texas","nn1":["542999","547010","544169","545445","550328","546146","550982","549967","545447","557225","546757","546908","544691","550181","557214","546107"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","browns","factory","gray","tow","response","cleanup","scratch","machinery","piece"]}
