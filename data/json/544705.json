{"path":"544705.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and scenic landscape featuring a coastal scene under an overcast sky with vibrant sunbeams piercing through the clouds. In the foreground, there are large industrial tanks, possibly for storage of oil or water, located on a grassy hill. The tops of a few small white buildings are visible, suggesting a nearby settlement or industrial facility.\n\nThe middle ground shows a large body of water, likely a bay or sea, shimmering with reflections of light filtered through the clouds. On the water, there are two large ships, adding a dynamic industrial element to the natural setting.\n\nIn the background, the vista continues with a series of mountains lining the horizon, partially obscured by the heavy clouds but still discernible. The contrast between the darkened landscape and the bright beams of sunlight creates a striking visual effect, emphasizing the dynamic weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of human industrial activity with the vastness and wildness of the natural environment, enhanced by the atmospheric lighting conditions.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["553857","544701","552000","545979","552242","543298","545277","550291","552349","554064","554041","545020","556908","544713","547147","553778"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cloud","wildness","settlement","oil","bay","condition","ship","beam","vastness","water"]}
