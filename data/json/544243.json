{"path":"544243.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene aquatic landscape featuring two prominent rustic, stilt houses built over a water body, likely a lake or calm river. These houses are aged and weathered, constructed primarily of wood with tin roofs, suggesting they are adapted for a watery environment, possibly for fishing activities or as part of a rural community.\n\nThe surface of the water is calm, reflecting some of the structures above it. Poles and thin wooden planks protrude from the water around the houses, indicating makeshift pathways or docks possibly used for securing boats or small vessels. These elements add a quaint, operational charm to the scene, suggesting a lifestyle centered around the water.\n\nIn the background, a natural landscape of dense, low-lying vegetation can be observed, possibly indicating a marshland or coastal wetland. The sky above is clear with few clouds and hints at a peaceful, sunny day. The environment indicates a remote or less urbanized location, offering a glimpse into a lifestyle deeply intertwined with the natural aquatic environment.","title":"Louisiana--Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544201","548044","548056","548030","550357","545005","544567","545067","547953","545137","545197","552270","542908","558062","553925","543529"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lifestyle","house","tin","marshland","stilt","adapt","intertwine","secure","protrude","water"]}
