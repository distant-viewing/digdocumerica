{"path":"543467.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene where three individuals, a family it seems, are engaging with nature, each in a distinct way. Sitting on large, smooth boulders, their relaxed postures suggest a moment of pause during an outdoor excursion, such as a hike.\n\nOn the left, a man is seen in a contemplative pose, looking off to the side, not engaging directly with the others. He is dressed in a light blue shirt and dark pants, and appears to be in a moment of reflection or enjoying the peaceful surroundings.\n\nIn the center, a child sits comfortably leaning against an adult, likely his mother, while engaging with the surroundings in an observant manner, suggesting a curiosity about the natural elements.\n\nOn the right, a woman with distinctive blue hair styled in an updo sits facing slightly away from the camera, her gaze directed towards the distance, portraying a sense of thoughtfulness or admiration for the environment. She wears a dark blue shirt and light blue jeans, complementing her vibrant hair color.\n\nThe background is densely filled with trees, indicating that this scene is set in a forested area with ample foliage, providing a serene and sheltered setting. The use of natural light filtering through the trees creates a calm, inviting atmosphere, enhancing the overall feeling of a peaceful escape into nature.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553376","551942","551682","553377","552033","558187","551027","558096","543234","554679","553415","544739","549716","557985","545786","543505"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["sit","admiration","mother","excursion","hike","escape","filtering","surrounding","hair","pause"]}
