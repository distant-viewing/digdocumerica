{"path":"546538.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial setting dominated by a vast parking lot filled with numerous cars from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s. The parking extends to the perimeter of the image, indicative of a large facility. On the left foreground, prominently positioned, is a stationary mobile laboratory/storage unit with the text \"Cummins Air Quality Laboratory\" labeled on its side, suggesting that this might be a site concerned with environmental monitoring or engine testing.\n\nIn the immediate background and extending to the middle right of the image, there's a significant industrial plant or manufacturing facility, characterized by large, long buildings with flat roofs and a tall metal fence defining its boundary. Notably, tall structures, possibly antennas or light poles, punctuate the skyline, rising above the facility. \n\nThe environment is open with a clear blue sky and very few indications of vegetation, emphasizing the industrial nature of the location. The cars and the design of the mobile lab unit suggest the photo was taken in the latter half of the 20th century.","title":"Cummins air quality control truck","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["545443","552002","550199","554433","547469","556201","546900","548496","548433","549506","556773","556790","546866","549726","546685","546447"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["unit","facility","parking","perimeter","indication","testing","antenna","lab","monitoring","laboratory"]}
