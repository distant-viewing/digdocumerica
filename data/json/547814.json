{"path":"547814.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene under strong sunlight. In the foreground, a vintage teal bus with a round back and two small round rear windows is parked on the street, partially visible from a side and back viewpoint. Its license plate is visible along with the number \"984.\" Just behind the bus, a covered sidewalk extends into the background, supported by wooden poles.\n\nTwo men are walking on the street near the bus, heading towards the foreground. They appear casually dressed, typical of street attire from mid-20th century America, possibly in shirts and pants.\n\nThe urban setting includes several visible commercial signs like \"Corral L. White\" painted in large letters on a dark building in the background. There's also a classic car parked on the street aligned with the bus, hinting at an era that might be around the 1950s or 1960s based on the vehicle's style.\n\nOverall, this photograph presents a vivid slice of urban life, emphasizing historical transportation and mid-century urban architecture, with a focus on the dynamic between the stark light and shadows on a clear day.","title":"Main street in northside (stockyards area) of ft.
