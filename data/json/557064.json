{"path":"557064.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures the upper architecture of a Victorian-style house, viewed at an upward angle. The house features intricate details starting with a red brick exterior. Several architectural elements stand out including decorative white corbels supporting the roof's overhang. Each corner of the house has a small, peaked roof dormer that includes small white attic windows, possibly for ventilation. Above these attic windows, the dormers are adorned with ornate metal finials which accentuate the peaks.\n\nAbove the brickwork, the window arches are highlighted with a row of staggered brick headers creating an arch pattern. The windows are traditional, rectangular, and fitted with white frames. Below the eaves, detailed white fretwork adds to the houseâ€™s ornamental charm.\n\nThe photograph's background shows a lightly clouded blue sky which contrasts with the bold architecture. The perspective, focusing upward at the house's details against the sky, conveys a sense of majesty and the fine craftsmanship typical of the Victorian era.","title":"Restoration of a late 19th century example of Victorian architecture in Atchison, Kansas.
