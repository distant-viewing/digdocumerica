{"path":"543416.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a scenic and rugged coastal landscape, filled with natural beauty and dramatic elements. In the foreground, there are two people hiking through a field blanketed with a diverse array of foliage, some of which have orange hues possibly due to seasonal changes or the lighting conditions. The terrain seems uneven and is densely covered in shrubs and small plants, creating a rich tapestry of greens, oranges, and earthy tones.\n\nIn the background, there is a striking glimpse of the ocean, gleaming under what appears to be low light conditions, suggesting it could be either early morning or late afternoon. The ocean is framed by large, jagged rock formations which jut out dramatically into the sea, adding a raw, majestic quality to the scene.\n\nThe natural light casts soft yet vibrant colors across the scene, with the ocean shimmering and reflecting light, contrasted sharply against the dark, craggy rocks. The composition of the photograph, with the hikers positioned in the lush, vibrant environment heading towards the wild and rugged coast, presents a narrative of adventure and exploration in a breathtaking natural setting.","title":"Southern California -- Rocky Point","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543248","543389","553775","543204","543316","544305","544903","545772","543184","543297","543424","543061","543431","545751","543304","543090"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","hiker","tapestry","coast","rock","condition","adventure","change","exploration","narrative"]}
