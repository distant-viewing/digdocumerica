{"path":"551773.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene inside a brightly-lit garden or plant exhibition. The room has high ceilings and large windows that fill the area with natural light. The floor is tiled, and the walls are painted in a neutral cream color. There are several hanging and potted plants distributed throughout the space, adding greenery and a variety of colors to the ambiance.\n\nIn the center of the photograph is a circular arrangement that looks like a water fountain or a pond, surrounded by small potted plants. Suspended above it, hanging planters overflow with lush green and flowering plants. The decor includes circular structures, possibly for aesthetic enhancement or additional plant support.\n\nSeveral elderly individuals can be seen within the scene. Some of them are engaged in conversations while others are observing the plants. The women and men are dressed in casual yet smart attire, indicating a social community event during a daytime setting.\n\nThe image also suggests an exhibition context, possibly a flower show or a botanical exhibit, as seen from the framed artworks or informational displays attached to the walls and standing on easels around the room. The overall atmosphere is calm and cheerful, likely focused on plant appreciation or horticultural activities.","title":"Annual flower show at Bryant Park, behind the main branch of the New York Public Library in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551649","555298","551705","555372","555299","551700","551698","551699","551774","551687","551701","546286","552408","546505","555304","546457"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["plant","exhibition","room","hang","flower","overflow","planter","appreciation","artwork","pot"]}
