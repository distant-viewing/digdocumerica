{"path":"547586.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial riverside scene. The scene is dominated by a sprawling array of bridges and roads intertwined with various industrial structures. Towards the foreground, a curving road leads to a neatly structured bridge crossing the river. This bridge supports traffic that includes a couple of cars and is flanked on one side by green grass and a walking path.\n\nCentral in the image is a more complex set of bridges including a drawbridge with its segments lifted, allowing for river traffic. Adjacent to these, thereâ€™s a railway bridge, indicated by the presence of a stationary cargo train toting red containers. Beyond these transportation structures, there are several large industrial buildings, with cylindrical and spherical tanks suggesting storage facilities for various industrial materials.\n\nIn the background, the river extends towards a distant horizon dotted with additional industrial structures. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, which contributes to the industrial ambiance of the photograph. The landscape beyond the immediate industrial area appears flat and is less defined, suggesting a broad river basin area.\n\nThe image provides a thorough look at a busy, functional industrial area with a significant focus on transportation and manufacturing, typical of mid-20th century industrial city skylines.","title":"Providence river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555758","555739","546076","550189","550966","548427","555744","551181","546112","555767","550214","551182","550855","550964","550955","557295"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","river","transportation","traffic","structured","stationary","riverside","sprawl","lift","road"]}
