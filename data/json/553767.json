{"path":"553767.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a prominent sign that reads \"Sea Life Park,\" mounted on a stone column to the left side of the image. The sign is circular with a rustic wooden border, and the center design consists of a stylized marine life image, possibly of dolphins, depicted in a swirling motion with waves, carved in relief with a dark stain on wood.\n\nIn the background, we see an open, airy architectural structure that appears to be a pavilion or entrance area to the Sea Life Park. There are several people gathered around, although the individuals are not distinctly visible. The pavilion has modern elements, possibly made of concrete or another similar material, and overlooks a bright, sunlit area with a view of the sky and possibly the sea in the distanceâ€”suggested by the presence of a bright horizon line.\n\nThe setting gives the impression of a sunny day, based on the bright lighting and deep shadows, indicating strong sunlight. There's a hint of a natural, rocky landscape or construction material that matches the base of the sign, suggesting the area is either coastal or designed to emulate a natural, rugged seascape environment typical of marine parks. The overall atmosphere is leisurely and touristic, appropriate for a place intended for public visitation and enjoyment of marine life exhibits and performances.","title":"Sea Life Park, like Paradise Park, is a commercial enterprise built in a conservation zone. An extensive collection of marine life ranging from anemones to whales is imaginatively displayed. The State Department of Land and Natural Resources controls land use in conservation districts which are primarily forest and water reserve lands.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553768","554119","554168","545154","548670","554457","543221","557489","548771","554034","543108","553942","554060","551929","553791","547865"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["pavilion","relief","stain","exhibit","sign","seascape","material","performance","border","concrete"]}
