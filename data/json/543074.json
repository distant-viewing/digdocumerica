{"path":"543074.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a serene beach scene composed of several visually intriguing elements. In the foreground, there are several stems of pinkish flowers, possibly thrifts or sea pinks, slightly blurred, which suggests a focus on the background. These delicate flowers provide a gentle contrast in texture and color to the rest of the scene.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a dark, volcanic sand beach that curves gracefully along the frameâ€™s right side in a sweeping bay shape. The striking black sand contrasts sharply with the white surf of the waves gently breaking onto the shore. The tide appears to be moderately high, as it reaches close to the rocky formations that flank the beach.\n\nThe background consists of rugged, dark rocky cliffs that frame the beach. These cliffs add a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty to the scene. The sky is not visible in the image, giving full focus on the geological and floral elements.\n\nThe overall composition and the soft focus used for the flowers create an ethereal, dream-like quality to the photograph, inviting contemplation and evoking a sense of tranquility. The stark contrast between the soft pink flowers in the foreground and the moody, rugged coastal elements in the background effectively captures the diverse textures and moods of coastal landscapes.","title":"Sea and wildflowers","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542968","547592","545101","543199","547596","543401","543399","543287","553997","543066","551554","543404","548184","544985","545280","543255"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","flower","cliff","surf","tide","pink","wafe","stem","intrigue","rugged"]}
