{"path":"555468.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a vast area covered with a large collection of driftwood. The scene is taken during the day under clear, blue skies. The foreground and middle ground are dominated by scattered pieces of wood, ranging in size, shape, and colorâ€”from pale, weathered logs to darker, freshly water-worn timbers.\n\nA person is present in the scene, appearing relatively small compared to the expansive spread of driftwood. They are dressed in a light blue jacket, white pants, and dark shoes, with a white-and-dark-striped knit hat. The person seems to be intently navigating through the cluttered landscape of logs, looking down, perhaps to find a safe or stable place to step.\n\nThe background is less detailed but continues the theme of densely packed driftwood stretching back into the horizon. The expanse of wood creates a texture-rich environment that speaks of natural processes and perhaps the aftermath of a significant weather event or the natural accumulation at a water body's edge. The overall mood is one of isolation and rugged natural beauty, highlighting the human figure's interaction with the environment.","title":"Conservation of electricity resulted in more people collecting firewood along the beaches as did this person near Lincoln City.
