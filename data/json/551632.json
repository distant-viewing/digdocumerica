{"path":"551632.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene featuring a construction or redevelopment area. In the foreground, a man is standing next to a newly planted row of trees along a city street. The man is dressed casually in blue jeans and a long-sleeve red shirt. He is interacting with the scene possibly by stabilizing one of the trees or adjusting its position.\n\nThere is an excavator to his right which has a pile of dirt in its scoop, suggesting recent work in planting these trees. The street and sidewalks appear older and worn, hinting at an urban environment undergoing renewal or maintenance.\n\nIn the background, several older multi-story buildings line the street, providing a contrasting architectural texture with varying styles and states of upkeep. Further back, a tall modern high-rise building stands prominently, juxtaposing the older, shorter buildings in the foreground, showcasing a city in transition between different architectural eras.\n\nCars can be seen parked and moving on the street which is partially visible. The atmosphere seems slightly overcast, and the lighting is soft, giving the scene a muted tone.\n\nOverall, the photo documents a moment of urban development, highlighting the efforts to greenify a cityscape amidst the backdrop of a densely built environment. The juxtaposition of an urban renewal activity with the bustling city life in the background underscores themes of growth and change.","title":"The active 76th street neighborhood association has brought a new mall and many plantings to the area of broadway and 76th to 77th streets","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552031","550764","551739","544960","546567","553423","549665","545520","549913","549914","551652","545251","553352","551685","549268","551489"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["renewal","street","city","scoop","upkeep","excavator","stabilize","undergo","plant","document"]}
