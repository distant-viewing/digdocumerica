A stream of muddy, reddish-brown water flows through the center, exhibiting a foamy, yellowish discharge that indicates chemical contamination. The ground surrounding the water is dark and muddied, with textures suggesting either dried or semi-solid sludge. The landscape is devoid of lush vegetation, suggesting a high level of pollution that has negatively impacted the natural habitat.\n\nIn the background, there are industrial structures visible, hinting at the source or involvement of industrial activities in the area's condition. Also noticeable are a few bare trees and some scattered debris, further emphasizing the degraded state of the environment in this area.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its vivid depiction of pollution and environmental degradation, serves to highlight the impact of industrial waste on natural water bodies and the surrounding land. The photograph likely serves an investigative or documentary purpose, aiming to draw attention to environmental issues in industrial zones.","title":"Water containing iron oxide seeps from old mine shafts into nearby streams at the now-closed Rico-Argentine mill.","placename":"Rico (Colo.)","location":"Rico, Colorado","nn1":["551077","544804","543815","550959","544810","551562","550193","544779","548090","550723","547485","551531","557999","550369","544784","544775"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","impact","documentary","serve","discharge","contamination","involvement","depiction","aim","degradation"]}
