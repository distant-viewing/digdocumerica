{"path":"544450.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This image features a geological formation showing layers of earth and rock along a road or clearing. The foreground is dominated by a rough dirt road that curves gently toward the right side, displaying visible tire tracks in a dusty surface. Alongside the road, a steep embankment or cutaway shows stratified layers of soil and rock. \n\nThe embankment layers vary in color, showing a mix of lighter tan and darker brown hues, with a notable layer of grayish rock running horizontally partway up the embankment. The upper edge of the embankment is topped with vegetation, including scattered patches of grass, small bushes, and a few protruding rocks. \n\nToward the right third of the photo, trees with dense green foliage extend upward, partially concealing the sky but creating a canopy-like effect in the background. The lighting in the image appears to be natural, likely midday sunlight, casting distinct shadows and highlighting the textured details of the embankment.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any human activity, focusing solely on the natural and geological aspects of the landscape. This could be a location used for geological studies or simply a rural road with an exposed natural formation providing insight into the geological history of the area.","title":"Freshly-cut access road to new trailer park","placename":"Travis, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Travis, Lake, Texas","nn1":["554766","552445","552685","551233","545534","554548","553770","554802","555595","555573","556432","554410","545764","558083","555592","550395"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["embankment","layer","rock","road","protruding","formation","grayish","midday","third","tan"]}
