{"path":"553841.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and intense scene of industrial activity. In the image, massive billows of thick, dark smoke are rising voluminously into the sky from two large stacks. The smoke is dense and expansive, covering much of the frame and creating a powerful visual impact. The clouds of smoke are various shades of gray and white, indicating the intensity and heat of the emissions.\n\nThe smokestacks themselves are only partially visible at the bottom of the image, with their tops appearing just at the bottom edge, suggesting their considerable height. The sky in the background is a deep blue, contrasting sharply with the white and gray of the smoke, enhancing the vividness of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph underscores the scale of industrial pollution, with the smoke dominating the landscape and overshadowing the clear sky. The image serves as a stark depiction of environmental impact, capturing a moment of significant emission of pollutants into the atmosphere.","title":"Burning discarded autoMobile batteries.
