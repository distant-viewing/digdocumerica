{"path":"548210.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vast landfill scene under a partially cloudy sky. Dominating the foreground and center of the image is an abundance of scattered waste, including various types of rubbish such as cardboard boxes, bags, containers, and other miscellaneous refuse. Notably, a large yellow industrial vehicle, possibly a compactor or bulldozer, is positioned on the left-hand side, giving a sense of scale to the area and indicating ongoing operations to manage the landfill.\n\nIn the far background, you can see a hint of greenery and trees lining the horizon, suggesting the landfill is located near a rural or semi-rural area. The presence of another vehicle and some distant figures suggest the activity of workers actively managing or navigating through the waste.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a busy, somewhat disorganized atmosphere typical of active waste disposal sites, emphasizing the extent and impact of human waste and the efforts required to manage it.","title":"City of Portland landfill","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["546246","546235","549750","546238","550256","544799","549936","543828","549748","545299","549792","546231","550252","546257","543832","548350"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","compactor","rubbish","extent","abundance","refuse","cardboard","disposal","bulldozer"]}
