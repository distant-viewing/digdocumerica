{"path":"548716.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures a serene underwater scene, evidently taken at a coral reef. In the foreground, we see a large, prominently featured angelfish characterized by its dark body adorned with a striking pattern of white spots and vibrant yellow trimming around its fins and tail. The fish is angled towards the camera, providing a clear view of its profile and distinct features, including its elegant, long dorsal fin trailing back beyond its body.\n\nThe background comprises various forms of coral, demonstrating different textures and colors, primarily in hues of brown and green. The sea bed is sandy, with sporadic patches of coral spread throughout, contributing to the diversity of the marine landscape. The water appears calm and clear, with a gradient of light permeating from above, providing a natural illumination that enhances the visibility and coloration of the underwater environment.\n\nThis tranquil scene exudes a natural beauty, focusing on the intricate details of marine life and the delicate balance of the ecosystem in coral reef areas. The composition of the photo, with the fish positioned off-center, allows for an appreciation of both the subject and its surroundings.","title":"Grey angle fish swims among branches of living coral in the protected waters of john pennekamp coral reef state park, a few miles off key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548717","548715","548719","548718","548682","548713","548677","548712","548722","548711","548721","548676","548710","548678","548679","543567"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["reef","coral","fin","fish","trimming","appreciation","tail","coloration","demonstrate","illumination"]}
