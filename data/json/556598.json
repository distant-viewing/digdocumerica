{"path":"556598.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a group of people dressed in red uniforms, wearing helmets adorned with what appears to be a logo or number on the front, engaged in what looks like mechanical or engineering work outdoors. Each individual is deeply focused on the task at hand, working on various components of a large, complex machine with visible pipes and gauges.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor environment with greenery and a structure visible in the background that suggests this could be a workspace near a building facility. The individuals appear to be technicians or engineers possibly performing maintenance, assembly, or some form of technical operation.\n\nThe uniforms, matching in color and style, along with the helmets suggest that these individuals are part of an organized team, possibly a rescue team or an emergency response crew given the robust nature of their attire and equipment. The focus and teamwork evident in the activity contribute to a serious and professional atmosphere in the scene.","title":"Members of a coal company safety team don their equipment in preparation for the Kentucky state mine safety contest at benham, near Cumberland, in harlan county.
