{"path":"549655.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image depicts a traditional red and white tram moving on a street, possibly in a European city, judging from the design of the tram and the surroundings. The front of the tram displays the number \"446\" and its destination, which reads \"St. Marx.\" Below the destination, there's a sign that says \"Schaffnerlos,\" possibly indicating the tram operates without a conductor.\n\nThrough the windows of the tram, various passengers are visible, as well as the driver, who is focused on the road ahead. A hint of a serene expression is observable on the driver's face, suggesting a quiet moment in transit. The interior glimpse reveals some passengers seated and others possibly standing, indicating a moderately busy tram.\n\nThe background shows lush green trees lining the street, which suggests an urban area with considerable greenery. Another tram, similar in design and color, can be seen in the background, indicating a network of trams operating in this locale. The road on which the tram runs appears to be a dedicated tramway lane, well-maintained and smooth.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a slice of everyday urban life, focusing on public transportation in a tram-serviceable city. The vintage aesthetic of the tram adds a sense of timelessness and nostalgia to the image.","title":"Vienna's trolley system is efficient and well-scheduled.
