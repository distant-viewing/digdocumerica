{"path":"548196.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat industrialized environment. The focus is split between a large factory complex in the background and industrial infrastructure in the foreground.\n\nThe factory area in the background consists of large buildings with metal sidings, several vent pipes, and cylindrical tanks. Visible details include a large silo with a ladder, some parked trucks, white sacks or containers near the building, and a few parked cars showing that the facility is operational. The factory buildings seem dated, showing some wear and atmospheric exposure.\n\nIn the foreground, there are wastewater treatment ponds, as suggested by the sedimentation or chemicals present in the water, which is separated by earth dykes. The water in these ponds is brownish, suggesting processing or waste runoff. Piped infrastructure runs parallel to the dykes, contributing to the industrial function of the scene.\n\nIn between these elements, a person is visible walking on the path alongside the water treatment ponds, which contrasts human presence with the mechanical and industrial surroundings.\n\nThe overall setting is surrounded by wooded hills in the distant background under a clear blue sky, which represents a juxtaposition of natural landscape against industrial activity. This scene likely raises questions about environmental management and industrial impact on natural landscapes.","title":"Crown-Zellerbach paper mill in Camas, with effluent treatment canal in foreground","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550724","554630","552246","546080","545836","557392","546117","553450","550694","552194","543573","546073","548212","551576","544044","544471"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pond","factory","treatment","wastewater","question","sack","runoff","ladder","vent","infrastructure"]}
