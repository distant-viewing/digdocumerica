{"path":"544953.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an ancient Puebloan cliff dwelling, nestled under a large overhanging rock formation. The setting is arid and appears to be in a canyon with steep, rocky walls.\n\nThe dwelling itself consists of various stone structures, built with a reddish-brown rock, which helps them blend into the surrounding cliffs. Some of these structures are multi-storied, characterized by doorways and small windows. There is intricate masonry visible, indicating advanced architectural techniques for the time period in which they were constructed.\n\nIn the foreground, one of the most remarkable features is a circular kivaâ€”a subterranean ceremonial structure with a discernible roof hole and ladder leading into it, though this particular one is uncovered. The intricate arrangement of the buildings suggests a highly organized layout, pointing to a well-established community life.\n\nFlora in the scene includes scrubby bushes and small trees, predominantly junipers, which dot the landscape adding a touch of green to the primarily sandy, rocky environment.\n\nThe sky above is a clear blue, suggesting daylight and good weather, further illuminating the architectural details of these ancient structures. This site is presumably protected, hinting at its historical and archaeological significance. The overall composition of the photograph provides a window into the past civilization that inhabited this challenging landscape.","title":"Part of Cliff Palace, ancient Indian village, built between 1100 and 1300 A.D.","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544927","544952","544922","544941","544951","544948","545554","544923","544919","545550","544421","544949","545567","555286","544429","545565"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dwelling","cliff","masonry","civilization","ladder","hole","technique","rock","canyon","doorway"]}
