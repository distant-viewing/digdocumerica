{"path":"554642.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic landscape dominated by two prominent, rounded mountains in the background. The mountains are covered in dense foliage which appears to be in the midst of seasonal color change, suggesting an autumn setting. The foliage displays a blend of green, orange, and red hues, hinting at a variety of tree species and the changing leaves of fall.\n\nThe foreground features a forest that stretches across the entire view, with the trees showing a similar variation in autumn colors. This dense tree cover creates a textured appearance that gently leads the eye towards the mountains in the distance.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it was taken during the daytime with clear skies, as the colors are vivid and well illuminated. The overall composition balances the rich tapestry of the forest with the serene and unobstructed view of the mountains, creating a tranquil and picturesque natural scene. The photograph likely aims to showcase the beauty of an autumnal landscape in a mountainous area.","title":"Tops of the hills are almost bare of leaves on the trees, but the hardwoods and Aspens in the valleys remain bright in the Adirondack Forest Preserve south of Route 28 east of Indian Lake.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554638","550478","554761","554653","554640","554639","550602","554634","548025","552600","543582","555130","557127","554636","554713","554637"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","autumn","tapestry","forest","foliage","midst","specie","daytime","variation","fall"]}
