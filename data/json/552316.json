{"path":"552316.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil scene of recreational boating on a clear day. Three boats are pictured on a calm, expansive body of water, each boat containing different groups of people engaged in various activities, likely enjoying a leisurely day on the water.\n\nThe first boat on the left is white and appears to be a small, cabin-style boat. There is at least one person visible on this boat who is partially obscured by the cabin structure. This boat seems to be idling or moving slowly through the water.\n\nThe middle boat is crowded with at least four people visible; two are seated at the back with two more standing or sitting towards the front. This boat has a simple, open top design making it easy to see the occupants.\n\nThe far right boat also sports a white and blue design and holds at least three people. One person is standing, managing the boatâ€™s controls, while the others are seated and outfitted with life jackets, suggesting readiness for water activities.\n\nThe backdrop features a forested landmass and distant mountains, muted under a hazy sky that suggests depth and distance. The overall atmosphere seems calm and leisurely, with clear skies and a slight ripple on the water's blue surface, enhancing the serene setting.","title":"Salmon fishing on the north fork of the lower skagit river near la connor","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552982","548736","546856","552050","549417","548080","549411","544021","555718","550841","548555","547781","549934","552292","546976","553403"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","cabin","readiness","water","landmass","occupant","standing","seat","people","boating"]}
