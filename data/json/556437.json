{"path":"556437.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene of children engaged in an outdoor activity. The focus is on a group of young boys and one girl, approximately seven to ten years old, arranged in a line across the frame. They are on a paved area, likely a school playground or similar outdoor setting, during daytime under bright sunlight.\n\nStarting from the left, the first boy is wearing a dark navy t-shirt, looking straight ahead with a neutral expression. Next to him is a boy in a red shirt with horizontal white stripes, standing closely with a gentle smile. The third child, a girl, has a ponytail and wears a blouse with a small floral pattern. Continuing right, the fourth boy wears a dark blue sports jersey with the number \"15\"; he looks upward with an amused expression. Beside him is a girl dressed in a black hoodie appearing slightly shy, only her face visible. The sixth child, a boy, is smiling broadly and sports a navy-blue hoodie with a logo emblem. Next to him is another boy half-turned to his side, wearing plaid pants and what appears to be a colorful pajama top or shirt.\n\nIn the background of the image, other children can be seen active across the pavement; some are running and appear to be playing. Behind the active area, there are parked cars and patches of green grass, hinting that the setting might be near a park or an educational institution.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of youthful energy and innocence, capturing a moment that might be a break from school activities or a special event. The attire of the children varies, indicating no strict dress code and a casual, playful day outside.","title":"Children at recess in their schoolyard at chattaroy, West Virginia, near Williamson.
