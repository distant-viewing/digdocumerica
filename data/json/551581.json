{"path":"551581.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a large ship moored at a dock, the ship dominating the right side of the frame. The side of the ship facing the viewer features a largely curved front bow painted in white and red, with the name visible just below the bow. The ship is tethered to the dock with multiple thick ropes, which stretch across the image at an angle. The left side of the frame shows the textured, weathered wooden edge of the dock along with these ropes, both of which are bathed in sunlight.\n\nThe water around the dock and alongside the ship appears dark and rippled, reflecting sunlight in places and showing some floating debris. In the distance, directly behind the ship, a clear blue sky and a flat, barely visible land or water horizon line can be seen. The scene is bright, with the lighting suggesting that it is a sunny day, enhancing the contrast between the red and white of the ship and the dark blue of the water. There are no people visible in the photograph, focusing attention solely on the ship, its mooring, and the surrounding water.","title":"Ship loading at the Cargil grain elevator.
