{"path":"542510.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a landscape dominated by a winding canal and infrastructure. The canal features dark blue water and snakes through arid, brown terrain. At the center of the image, there are twin bridges that enable road traffic over the canal. The bridges are part of a highway that aligns closely on each side of the canal.\n\nThe terrain around the canal is bare with shades of brown and sparse vegetation, suggesting a semi-arid or desert environment. The composition of the photo, with its juxtaposition of man-made structures and natural barren land, emphasizes themes of human intervention in nature. The photograph seems to be taken from a high altitude, giving an expansive view of the areaâ€™s geography.\n\nThe stark contrast between the dark blue of the water and the pale, dusty colors of the landscape provides a visually striking effect. There are no visible clouds in the sky, suggesting a clear day which enhances the visibility and colors in the photo. The lack of any significant greenery or other water bodies indicates that the region may be prone to dry conditions.","title":"California - San Joaquin Valley","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["548896","548895","549076","548192","549032","552733","548949","548928","547098","544658","548925","558043","548847","542713","547227","548870"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canal","bridge","geography","snake","intervention","altitude","terrain","lack","highway","visibility"]}
