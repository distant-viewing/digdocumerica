{"path":"547477.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of scattered, old, and rusty bicycles and tricycles in a field. These toys are in various states of disrepair and decay, scattered across a grassy and dirt-covered ground that is dotted with dandelions and other small wildflowers. The field itself is devoid of any vegetation in some patches, exposing bare earth and small rocks.\n\nIn the foreground, a particularly prominent bicycle lies partially dismantled with its wheels still attached but askew, and its frame heavily rusted. The saddle of this bicycle is torn, revealing the padding beneath. Another tricycle in the midground has retained more of its paint, colored in red, but still shows signs of significant wear with rust on its frame and handlebars.\n\nIn the background, additional similar objects can be seen. There is another tricycle, much like the others, lying on its side. Interestingly, there is also what appears to be a small, rusted pedal car, hinting at further variety in the types of children's ride-on toys that were discarded in this field.\n\nThe setting suggests a forgotten or neglected play area, possibly on the outskirts of a rural or suburban area. The overall mood evoked by this scene is one of nostalgia mixed with a sense of abandonment and decay. The presence of vibrant wildflowers among the derelict toys adds a poetic contrast, reinforcing the passage of time and the resilience of nature.","title":"Along the Seekonk River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["553870","547473","547786","545977","557701","554211","552102","542585","542590","545340","543354","544060","554212","550797","553985","547024"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tricycle","toy","bicycle","wildflower","field","decay","saddle","dandelion","handlebar","nostalgia"]}
