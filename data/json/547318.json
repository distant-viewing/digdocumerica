{"path":"547318.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, slightly mysterious nature scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting. The focal point of the image is a bird perched atop the sharp, vertical peak of a weathered wooden post. The bird is silhouetted, making it difficult to discern its species, but it has a distinct profile with what looks like a crest on its head and a fanned tail, possibly suggesting it is a type of songbird.\n\nThe background features blurred elements which contribute to the dreamy atmosphere of the photo. On the left, there appears to be another vertical element, possibly another post or tree, which is out of focus and creates a shadowy figure. The rest of the background is filled with the soft, out-of-focus silhouettes and textures of tree branches and leaves, predominantly in darker tones with hints of lighter shades breaking through, suggesting either the presence of a mist or the soft glow of the sky at twilight.\n\nThe overall composition and mood of the image are evocative, emphasizing the beauty and serenity of natural environments, and the silhouette technique used enhances the sense of mystery and calm. The color palette is quite muted, dominated by purples and dark blues, reinforcing a serene and slightly somber atmosphere.","title":"Part of rural Nebraska's varied bird life","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["551378","557628","553776","551379","544547","554601","550388","548832","547322","555013","543595","544612","543063","544601","548885","544597"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","post","silhouette","crest","technique","tail","serenity","mystery","specie","profile"]}
