{"path":"555010.jpg","date":"September 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph portrays a bird perched on a branch. The bird, likely a type of jay based on its physical traits, is slightly turned to its left side, showcasing its profile view to the camera. Its plumage is predominantly light gray with subtle variations in shades throughout its body. The bird's eyes appear alert and focused, reflecting a poised demeanor.\n\nThe bird's perch, a branch, exhibits a rough surface texture with patches of white material that could be lichen, giving it a weathered and natural look. The background of the image is softly blurred, featuring dark and light spots which could be other out-of-focus branches or foliage, rendering a bokeh effect, typical in nature photography to emphasize the subject by using a shallow depth of field.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph focuses on the bird as the clear subject set against a undistracted, serene backdrop, resembling a natural environment that would be typical for this bird's habitat. The use of natural lighting appears to highlight the bird effectively, without creating harsh shadows or overexposures, adding to the clarity and the visual appeal of the image.","title":"Gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis) on a Douglas fir branch in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544547","548885","557628","543595","557614","549115","544477","544489","547318","551378","554601","557204","550471","544497","557208","555013"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","perch","branch","subject","lichen","plumage","render","poise","appeal","photography"]}
