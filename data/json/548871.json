{"path":"548871.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet dynamic outdoor scene set in a flat and open landscape. It features a large body of water in the foreground into which water is effusively flowing from a concrete channel. The water jet forms a curved silhouette, entering a foamy and agitated area in the pond.\n\nThe angle of the shot places a silhouetted figure on the right side of the image. This person appears to be walking along the edge of a narrow path bordering the water, and is likely a male judging from the attire and posture. The person's silhouette is dramatically backlit by the bright sunlight, enhancing the sense of motion in the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance, the landscape is quite flat and expansive, showing a grassy field that stretches into the background. The horizon is graced with a range of subdued mountains, and interestingly, the sky is devoid of clouds, contributing to the stark and open feel of the scene.\n\nLens flares are visible due to the strong sunlight, suggesting that the photograph was taken at a time when the sun was quite bright, likely around midday. The overall composition uses natural lighting effectively to create contrasts and highlights the textures of the water and landscape.","title":"Irrigation canals on Colorado River Indian Reservation","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["550268","551552","545882","545031","545923","544709","550237","549065","551230","550389","548811","557599","552914","543058","549187","547047"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["judging","silhouette","flare","water","jet","sunlight","midday","channel","person","pond"]}
