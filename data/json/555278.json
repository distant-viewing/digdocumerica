{"path":"555278.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features two prominent skyscrapers captured from a ground-up perspective, highlighting their towering presence against a clear, blue sky. Both buildings exhibit a sleek, modern design characterized by their smooth, reflective surfaces and sharp, angular forms. The facade of each skyscraper is lined with a multitude of closely spaced vertical elements that enhance the buildings' streamlined appearances.\n\nThe photograph is taken in such a manner that the two structures almost seem to converge at the top, creating a dynamic and dramatic architectural composition. The left building is slightly tilted, adding to the photograph's sense of depth and perspective. The sky's intense blue tone acts as a stark, uncluttered backdrop, allowing the buildings to stand out prominently.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the essence of modern architectural design and urban grandeur, emphasizing verticality, symmetry, and the interaction between man-made structures and the open sky.","title":"Closeup of the World Trade Center towers in New York City.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549301","550116","555275","545885","548387","549971","551455","550007","549317","549997","550062","552363","555419","552395","549302","545873"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["skyscraper","verticality","symmetry","multitude","perspective","building","manner","design","grandeur","essence"]}
