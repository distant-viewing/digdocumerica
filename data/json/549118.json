{"path":"549118.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a barren landscape, possibly a disused mining site or a similar industrial area that has been stripped of vegetation. The dominating feature in the foreground is a long, white pipeline extending from the bottom-left corner towards the center of the image, before bending slightly. The pipeline is equipped with some fittings and valves, suggesting it might have been used for transporting water or other fluids.\n\nThe terrain is mostly devoid of vegetation, showcasing exposed earth, scattered patches of grass, and minor tracks or grooves likely made by vehicles. The soil's texture is uneven, mixed with some small stones and debris. Towards the background, you see a series of steep, eroded slopes with bare, multicolored earth, indicating significant soil disruption or excavation activities. The horizon reveals more of these mounds, heightening the sense of a vast, altered landscape.\n\nThe environment appears inhospitable and abandoned, characterized by a lack of any visible wildlife or human activity. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber and desolate mood of the scene. The overall impression is of a place heavily impacted by industrial or construction activities, left in a state of neglect.","title":"Irrigation pipe attests to efforts at reclamation by the Peabody Coal Company at its strip mine near Colstrip.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["545615","555610","544751","552004","545827","554804","552432","552427","547653","558107","545680","549119","547979","546208","552420","554811"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pipeline","fitting","groove","soil","valve","earth","fluid","disruption","mound","excavation"]}
