{"path":"553342.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a rusted, metallic cylindrical tank lying on its side in a shallow body of water surrounded by a muddy area. The tank, which appears weathered with patches of rust and a fading red color, has a part of its body submerged in the water, reflecting its curvature gently on the surface. The front end of the tank is closed off, rounded, and partly buried in the wet soil, giving a sense of abandonment or long-term placement.\n\nAttached to the front of the tank is a makeshift structure, possibly wooden or metal, which includes rods and chains. This structure looks old and worn out, blending into the muddy environment. The background consists of dry vegetation, including bushes and small trees, indicating a seasonally dry or arid area. The scene is under a clear sky, suggesting a sunny day, and the colors are a mixture of earth tones including browns, greens, and hints of red from the tank and the clay-heavy soil. The overall mood of the scene reflects neglect and a quiet, undisturbed natural setting where man-made objects have been left to the elements.","title":"Dumped in the Nashua River","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["543154","551497","546201","556402","546164","556352","545680","542587","552255","555512","546064","547024","543257","543762","549307","545029"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tank","clay","soil","curvature","placement","rod","term","chain","rust","mixture"]}
