The tuba, prominently displayed in the foreground, reflects some trees and perhaps other objects in its glossy surface. The man is dressed casually with a pale yellow short-sleeved shirt and a red cap that has a badge or emblem on the front. His glasses are quite noticeable and he appears focused on playing the instrument. The mouthpiece of the tuba is in his mouth and he seems to be blowing into it.\n\nThe background is blurred and green, suggesting a setting in a park or a tree-rich environment, enhancing the serene and artistic vibe of the scene.
