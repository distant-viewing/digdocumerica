{"path":"547315.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a moody, rural setting featuring a person walking in front of a large wooden barn. The barn's exterior is made of wood planks, painted in a weathered red hue, with a texture that shows signs of wear and aging. Below the red upper part of the barn, there are double barn doors constructed from gray, weathered wood. These appear to be functional yet bear the marks of significant use and exposure to elements.\n\nThe person in the image is dressed in a gray, well-worn hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans covered in mud up to the knees. They are wearing tall, muddy boots, indicating recent activity in wet or muddy conditions. The individual is walking with a slight lean forward, suggesting movement or the bracing against cold or wind. The person's face is not visible, adding a sense of anonymity and solitude.\n\nThe ground where the person is walking is deeply rutted and muddy, indicating either recent rain or activity that has churned the soil. This setting gives a strong impression of a working environment, likely a farm, where practical daily tasks are performed regardless of weather conditions.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber and slightly bleak, underscored by the overcast sky and the muted colors of the scene. This image captures a moment of solitary labor in a rural setting, highlighting themes of endurance and the ruggedness of outdoor work.","title":"Farmer john dolezal in rain gear passes his barn during downpour.
