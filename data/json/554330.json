{"path":"554330.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene, likely in a city like New York based on the style of the taxi and architecture. In the forefront of the image is a distinctive yellow taxi, a hallmark of New York City. The taxi is somewhat aged with visible dents and wear, portraying a well-used city vehicle. Its design suggests the model is from the 1970s or early 1980s.\n\nThe taxi is positioned in the right lane of a multi-lane street, surrounded by other vehicles indicating congestion or traffic. Immediately to its left is a blue bus with a sleek, modern design, hinting at public transportation options available in the city. Behind the taxi and further up the street are various other vehicles including more cars, with another noticeable taxi among them, showing the common use of taxis in this area.\n\nThe streets are lined with tall, older buildings typical of a dense urban environment. These buildings house what appear to be businesses on their lower floorsâ€”visible signs suggest commercial activity, although specific names are indiscernible.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo conveys a typical bustling city vibe with a mix of transportation and architectural elements that provide a snapshot of urban life. The overcast sky and slight blur of some vehicles suggest movement and a perhaps brisk pace of activity, typical of a cityscape. The scene effectively reflects the hustle and typical scenery of a metropolitan area from a past decade.","title":"Lexington avenue in midtown","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554315","549848","554331","549873","554310","549869","554316","549859","554314","548410","549868","549876","548331","549862","554293","545325"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","city","street","vehicle","transportation","dent","option","congestion","pace","hustle"]}
