{"path":"547262.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large industrial or infrastructural facility with numerous cylindrical tanks, which appear to be part of a water treatment plant. The layout includes several rows of these tanks aligned in a patterned formation; they are large with what seems to be water or some other fluid inside, and have central agitators or aerators.\n\nThe upper part of the image shows additional infrastructure that could be related to the processing or storage of water, featuring more tanks and covered buildings that could house control rooms or additional processing equipment. To the left, beyond the main facility, there are even more tanks, of a different configuration, possibly for initial or different stages of water treatment.\n\nThe surrounding area has construction activity evident, with exposed earth, construction machinery, and what appears to be ongoing work for either expansion or maintenance. Vehicles, presumably construction-related, are scattered across the site, and toward the bottom of the image, there is a road with moving vehicles, reflecting the everyday operation despite the industrial activities.\n\nThe background includes more industrial or possibly commercial buildings, suggesting that this facility is located within an industrial zone or outskirts of a town or city. The overall impression is of a complex, busy water treatment facility playing a critical role in managing water resources for a populated area.","title":"Expansion of Blue Plains sewage treatment plant: additional aeration tanks are being placed in cleared area in foreground","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547239","545840","547681","553900","548216","547260","548212","543571","546895","548151","543572","551171","553837","543574","547670","549636"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["treatment","tank","facility","construction","processing","water","configuration","fluid","expansion","outskirt"]}
