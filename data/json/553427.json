{"path":"553427.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a curving waterway lined with a muddy and sediment-rich bank, showcasing variations in earthen colors from tan to dark red. The scene appears still, with the water reflecting the surroundings like a mirror, displaying inverted images of the trees and structures on the opposite shore. There doesn't seem to be any visible activity or people in the scene. The surrounding vegetation is lush and green, indicative of a possibly secluded, natural environment. The overall mood of the image is serene, yet there's a hint of disturbance given by the way the silt and mud have dispersed unevenly along the banks, possibly pointing to recent water movement or environmental changes. The lighting is diffuse, which could suggest an overcast day, providing a softness to the colors and features of the landscape.","title":"The Nashua River flows past the Fitchburg Paper Mill.
