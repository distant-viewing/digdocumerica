{"path":"557493.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene lake setting during sunset or sunrise. In the foreground, several slender, leafless trees stand against the sky, creating a stark, silhouetted appearance. These trees vary in curvature and branching, adding an organic and slightly eerie feel to the composition. The lowest part of the sun is visible between the trunks, suggesting it might be setting, casting a soft, warm light that bounces off the water.\n\nThe lake itself occupies the middle ground of the scene. The surface of the water reflects the light from the sun, punctuated by numerous birds, likely ducks, that are clustered near the center and spread out towards the far side of the lake.\n\nThe background is composed of a hazy sky with wisps of clouds lightly tinged by the sunlight. There's a hint of a distant shoreline or a land feature on the far side of the lake, but it's mostly obscured by the glare and the reflections on the water.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a tranquil natural scene characterized by the interplay of light and shadow, the stark outlines of the trees against the sky and water, and the peaceful presence of wildlife, all contributing to a calm, contemplative atmosphere.","title":"Birds float undisturbed near the edge of Buena Vista Lagoon. The wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons in Southern California, there is concern for the body of water because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's it had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["550746","554752","552319","557569","554749","554760","557021","543611","550389","550735","547744","551207","554477","554404","545229","550299"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["lake","wisp","duck","glare","curvature","sun","sunrise","water","bird","wildlife"]}
