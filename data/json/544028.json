{"path":"544028.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph showcases a striking and somewhat desolate scene set against a dramatic cloudy sky. In the foreground, there is an old, weathered gas station that appears to be abandoned. It features a flat roof with significant wear and patches, and a partly collapsed structure which supports a rusting gas station sign that reads \"Opert.\" The building's white paint is peeling extensively, contributing to an overall sense of decay and neglect.\n\nThere is no visible activity or people in the scene, enhancing the feeling of abandonment. The gas station is surrounded by tall, unkempt grass, hinting it has been quite some time since the area was last maintained. To the right, a dense bush or small tree partially obscures the view, adding to the wildness of the landscape.\n\nThe background consists of a wide, open sky filled with textured clouds that suggest an impending storm or late-day atmosphere, and a glimpse of mountain silhouettes can be seen in the far distance, suggesting a remote, rural setting. The atmosphere is moody and evocative, possibly conveying themes related to isolation, the passage of time, or rural decline.","title":"Abandoned gas station","placename":"Wilhoit (Ariz.)","location":"Wilhoit, Arizona","nn1":["550103","546973","554784","552515","554561","550279","554707","556330","558107","547782","545739","552997","544809","555509","543344","547656"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["gas","station","wildness","decline","storm","time","passage","paint","abandonment","neglect"]}
