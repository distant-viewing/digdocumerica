{"path":"555527.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene, possibly inside a home, featuring an older man sitting in a chair in a room filled with a variety of objects. On the left, there is a large black stove with shiny cooking pots and a kettle placed on top. Above the stove, what appears to be a cooking pot is suspended. The room has wooden cabinets and a white curtain hanging in the background, partially obscuring a window that lets in subdued natural light.\n\nThe older man, seated on the right, is dressed in light-colored casual attire including a cap, and is holding a telephone to his ear, suggesting that he is in the middle of a phone call. His expression is relaxed and attentive. He is sitting on a chair with a towel or cloth draped over its back, and beside him a washing machine or dryer can be seen, emphasizing a multifunctional use of the space.\n\nThe room appears lived-in and utilitarian, with a casual arrangement of everyday objects that give it a cozy, if somewhat cluttered, atmosphere. Other small items and personal effects are visible around the room, contributing to the sense of this being a well-used living space. The overall ambience is one of quiet and domestic activity.","title":"An 80-year-old native of East Randolph, Vermont, sits back in his favorite corner near the warmth of the woodstove to take his mid-day rest.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["548454","545986","555532","545974","558317","552104","552619","547353","552105","556488","557352","544232","553517","553030","552114","556484"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["room","stove","cooking","pot","chair","washing","in","cabinet","telephone","phone"]}
