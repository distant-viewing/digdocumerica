{"path":"544636.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a waterbody, which could be part of a river or coastal area, featuring a variety of elements primarily related to industry and nature.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a long earthy embankment or dike that runs horizontally across the image. Attached to it, partially submerged in the water, are several structures that look like barriers or part of water control systems, which are organized in a line perpendicular to the embankment. These barriers are likely used for controlling water flow or for marine construction purposes.\n\nIn the center of the image, slightly to the left, there is a large dredging vessel. This vessel is equipped with machinery and devices typical of dredgers, used for excavating and removing material from the bottom of the waterbody. A visible dredging operation is in progress, as evidenced by the different colors in the water around the vessel, indicative of stirred-up sediments.\n\nThe background of the image features a series of small, densely wooded islands stretching across the water. These islands are irregular in shape and are separated by calm waters, likely channels or waterways between them.\n\nThe water itself appears calm, and the sky overhead is partly cloudy, reflecting a serene ambiance over an industrious scene. The overall composition presents a juxtaposition of industrial activity within a natural waterborne landscape.","title":"Reclaiming land at Marco Island","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544650","544643","552206","551565","544639","551524","548361","549470","551980","552836","552258","545024","547668","544635","551599","551203"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["dredging","waterbody","vessel","embankment","island","barrier","water","overhead","progress","channel"]}
