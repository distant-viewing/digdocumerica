{"path":"544722.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene seascape scene highlighted by the silhouette of a large suspension bridge, which spans from the left to the right side of the frame. The bridge arches over a body of water that glistens under the presumably late or early day sun, as indicated by the low light and silhouette effect.\n\nBelow the bridge and closer to the foreground, a small sailboat with its sails set is visible on the water, sailing from left to right. This adds a touch of tranquility and a human element to the natural and constructed environment in the scene.\n\nThe water is calm, with light reflecting off its surface, suggesting a peaceful day. The silhouette of the landmasses that anchor the bridge on either side suggests hilly terrain covered in sparse vegetation. Above the bridge, a lightly clouded sky completes the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a quiet and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, enhanced by the dominance of dark tones and the backlit effects of the lighting. The use of silhouette and the simple color palette focus attention on the shapes and forms of the bridge and the sailboat, emphasizing their graceful lines against the natural background.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["547669","543050","543087","544671","546810","542804","552846","546203","547828","548978","545022","548415","555937","548335","557096","546870"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","silhouette","sail","sailboat","dominance","suspension","backlit","effect","landmass","complete"]}
