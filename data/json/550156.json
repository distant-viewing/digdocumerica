{"path":"550156.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a suburban residential scene with a dramatic focus. A large airplane is flying prominently at a low altitude over a neighborhood of single-family homes. The neighborhood features neatly aligned houses with gabled roofs and well-maintained lawns. The houses are predominantly white, with some showing elements of brickwork. \n\nThe street is visible, lined with parked cars which appear to be models from the mid-20th century, suggesting an earlier time period for the photograph. Trees—fairly young and medium in size—dot the lawn areas beside the street, contributing to the serene suburban atmosphere.\n\nUtility poles and power lines are visibly running along the street, emphasizing the residential character of the area. The sky seems relatively clear with some light clouds, indicating good weather conditions at the time the photograph was taken. \n\nThis description reflects the juxtaposition between the peaceful, ordinary setting of the neighborhood and the unusual closeness of the large aircraft, which adds a layer of tension or surprise to the scene.","title":"Low flying plane in Brook Park, just outside Cleveland.
