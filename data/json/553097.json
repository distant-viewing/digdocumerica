{"path":"553097.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in front of a small, single-story building labeled \"Abe & Sue's Grocery.\" The building has a white facade with slight wear and tear, indicating it may be somewhat old or weathered. Adjacent to the grocery store, there are visible elements like a \"76\" gas station sign, suggesting the location also serves as a gas station. There is a vintage pickup truck parked near the store, aligning with the mid-20th-century rural American vibe.\n\nIn the foreground, two children are engaged in playful activities. One child, wearing a red and white outfit, skips joyfully, holding a hula hoop. The other child, dressed in light-colored clothing, stands a bit further back, observing or waiting for a turn. Their presence adds life and motion to the otherwise still setting.\n\nThe setting itself is a gravel lot, scattered with a few other automobiles hinting at a functional if not overly busy, locale. Behind and to the left of the main building, the sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an uncertain weather pattern, typical of expansive rural landscapes.\n\nOverall, the image captures a slice of life from a certain period, showcasing rural business, leisure activities of children, and elements of mid-century American automotive and gas station culture. The overall composition provides a narrative of everyday life and community interactions in a rural setting.","title":"Paiute Indian children outside grocery store in Nixon Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["556368","556454","542803","551105","554784","544882","546376","557382","545440","551001","556439","557684","558028","551116","551070","549003"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["gas","child","station","store","hoop","grocery","tear","life","turn","pickup"]}
