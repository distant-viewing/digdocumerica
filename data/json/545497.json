{"path":"545497.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic scene of two individuals camping in a forest. The setting reveals a dense array of trees around them, giving a secluded and natural backdrop. The individuals, possibly a male and female, are engaged in preparing or enjoying a meal.\n\nOn the left, the male appears to be shirtless wearing only denim shorts, accessorized with a necklace and glasses. He is casually seated on a tarp or blanket, reaching out to handle some objects that look like beverage cans or small food containers. His relaxed posture and focused activity suggest a comfortable environment.\n\nThe female, on the right side of the image, is sitting with her legs crossed, focused on cooking. She wears a light blue shirt and red pants. In front of her is a small fire over which a pot is perched, apparently containing food that she is preparing or stirring. Various camping essentials like a plastic bottle, possibly water, and other food items are scattered in front of her.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights a serene moment of outdoor living, complete with the essential elements of campfire cooking and preparation among the wooded surroundings. The mood is one of tranquility and togetherness in nature.","title":"As part of campaign to prevent clear-cutting in bankhead national forest gasp (greater Alliance to stop pollution) members spent a weekend here.
