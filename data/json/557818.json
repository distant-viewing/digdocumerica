{"path":"557818.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat hazy marine scene. Dominating the frame, the vast, calm expanse of the sea in varying shades of blue sets a tranquil tone. A noticeable aspect of the composition is a ship, depicted on the right side of the frame, sailing on the sea. The ship appears to be a medium-sized cargo or fishing vessel, and it is creating a noticeable wake as it moves through the water. This wake forms a curved white line on the surface of the water, trailing behind the vessel and adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still waters. The color palette of the scene is mostly a blend of blues and muted tones, suggesting this scene could be either during early morning or late afternoon, with a slightly overcast sky contributing to the subdued lighting.","title":"In the distance, a New York city sludge carrier dumps its cargo into waters of the New York bight.
