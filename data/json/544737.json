{"path":"544737.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a helicopter in flight over a water surface, set against a striking backdrop of rugged, multi-hued hills. The helicopter, appearing mid-flight, is captured making ripples on the water's surface beneath, highlighted by the small waves it generates. Its rotor blades are in motion, and the shadow of the helicopter casts clearly on the water, enhancing the sense of its motion and interaction with the environment.\n\nThe background consists of large hills or mountain slopes that display layers of color ranging from deep rust reds at the base transitioning to soft whites and grays towards the top, suggesting geological variation and possible mineral deposits. The texture of the hills is rough and striated, indicating erosive processes and a barren, rocky surface without vegetation. \n\nThe image's composition emphasizes the contrast between the mechanical presence and motion of the helicopter and the natural, static, and rugged terrain surrounding it. The use of lighting seems to focus on the drama of the context, with the helicopter brightly illuminated against the darker, more shadowed landscape.","title":"Colorado--Clear Creek","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545642","544741","545637","545638","544771","555835","547533","552372","552365","552393","548815","544754","548899","545645","544766","553787"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["helicopter","flight","motion","hill","rotor","drama","blade","surface","deposit","mineral"]}
