{"path":"551460.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a lively outdoor social scene featuring a group of four young adults. Two women and two men can be observed engaging in a animated conversation around a table. The setting looks sunny and festive, possibly a public place like a park or an outdoor café, characterized also by hints of greenery and other indistinct background activity that suggests a casual, communal environment.\n\nThe man on the right, clearly the focal point of the image, appears to be mid-conversation, entertaining the group as he eats a sandwich. He has a casual style, wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a light shirt, and thick-framed glasses. Beside him, a woman with long hair tied back, smiles as she looks on; she is dressed smartly in a dark dress. The back of another woman and man are seen on the left, both with dark hair, the woman leaning slightly inward and wearing a grey top and blue jeans, indicating her engagement in the group's interaction.\n\nOverall, the composition and the expressions convey a sense of relaxed enjoyment and camaraderie among friends in a lively public setting. Details like clothing and hairstyles give a hint of a setting in possibly the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"Lunching on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553167","551433","551028","557031","556532","550082","553169","549909","553804","543511","553275","553185","551853","551459","557030","551419"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","group","sandwich","conversation","café","camaraderie","hair","friend","hairstyle","hint"]}
