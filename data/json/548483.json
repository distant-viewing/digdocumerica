{"path":"548483.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures three people, likely in a park or a tree-lined street. To the left, a man is wearing a houndstooth jacket, dark pants, and a fedora hat. He appears to be operating a camera or adjusting a setting on it. In the middle, a woman in a red coat is covering her face with her hands, possibly reacting to a bright light or protecting her eyes from the sun. On the right, another woman stands with her back slightly turned toward the camera, dressed in a shiny dark jacket over a possible dress, looking away from the camera with a smile on her face, appeared to be enjoying the moment.\n\nBehind them, the setting is a residential area with green trees and a pathway possibly moving through a park or along a roadway. A couple of classic cars can be seen parked along the streets, suggesting the photograph may have been taken in the mid to late 20th century. The general atmosphere is casual and seems to be a sunny day due to the shadows cast on the ground and bright lighting.","title":"A jet flies over neptune road","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547185","550079","551742","553204","551648","555944","549925","552412","557176","547772","550967","556711","556733","545231","549324","556725"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["camera","park","react","fedora","jacket","street","mid","face","protect","woman"]}
