The background features tall, grand columns and high windows that contribute to the monumental feeling of the space. Large, ornamental doors are visible under three archways. The floor of the station is filled with assorted stalls, selling items such as books, clothing, and souvenirs and there are scattered shoppers browsing the merchandise.\n\nThe central part of the image shows an elevated platform with steps leading down to the main floor. Near this platform, a few people are standing or walking. The environment appears serene and moderately busy with a few individuals exploring the station or tending to the stalls. The high ceiling and architectural details such as chandeliers and the classic decor highlight the historical significance of the building. Prominent signage that reads \"EXIT\" directs traffic towards what appears to be the main exit of the station.","title":"Chicago's union station pictured in the summer of 1974.
