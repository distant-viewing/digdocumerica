{"path":"543691.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a polluted river environment with a starkly contrasting natural backdrop. The foreground presents the muddy banks of a river littered with various debris, including where an old, rusted oil drum partially submerged in water, broken branches, a discarded cardboard box reading \"FRED MEYER,\" and miscellaneous trash. The river itself, tinged with a red-brown color likely from sediment or pollution, flows gently through the scene.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo shows the riverbank transitioning to sparse vegetation and leafless bushes, perhaps indicating early spring before full foliage. In the background, majestic snow-capped mountains rise sharply. The mountains, under a cloudy sky, give a sense of the broader natural landscape's beauty, contrasting sharply with the polluted state of the river environment in the forefront.\n\nThis juxtaposition could imply a narrative about environmental degradation in natural landscapes, showcasing the impact of human waste and neglect in even the most picturesque settings.","title":"Open dump near the San Juan Mountains.
