{"path":"545551.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures the striking natural formation known as Angel Arch, located in the scenic landscapes of Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The main feature of the image is the arch itself, which stands prominently against a deeply blue sky. This natural arch is characterized by its large, round shape with a hole that punctures through the reddish-brown sandstone.\n\nThe arch is framed by massive rock walls that rise vertically with layered striations, indicative of geological processes over millennia. These layers display various shades of red and brown, typical of desert landscapes. The ground beneath the arch features a mix of large, smooth boulders and smaller rocks, interspersed with patches of desert vegetation, including shrubs and small trees.\n\nThe atmosphere in the photograph is clear and vivid, enhancing the contrast between the earthy tones of the rock formations and the vibrant blue sky. This picture captures the essence of the rugged and arid desert environment, showcasing the beauty and grandeur of natural rock architecture shaped by erosional forces. The absence of any human presence or man-made objects emphasizes the untouched and pristine condition of this wild landscape.","title":"Angel Arch, famous rock formation in Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544935","544939","545568","553077","545573","545566","545572","545582","545569","545559","545570","545580","545555","545584","545563","545711"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["arch","desert","rock","millennium","formation","striation","sandstone","hole","boulder","force"]}
