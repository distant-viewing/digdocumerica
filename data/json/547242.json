{"path":"547242.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene, likely taken from a moving boat based on the prominent wake in the foreground. The water appears turbulent and muddy, suggesting strong currents or recent rainfall. In the background, an industrial riverside setting is visible. Key elements include a crane, several large buildings including one with twin smokestacks, and a large cylindrical structure which might be a gas tank or similar storage unit. The sky is deeply blue with minimal clouds, indicating clear weather conditions. The composition provides a dynamic contrast between the rough textures of the muddy water in the foreground and the complex industrial structures in the background.","title":"The wake of the power boat on the Anacostia River is a dirty brown.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547238","550900","551993","548081","548061","550710","557309","552070","550673","551515","550854","550901","546019","557223","555792","549515"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["rainfall","current","riverside","wake","gas","unit","smokestack","crane","tank","storage"]}
