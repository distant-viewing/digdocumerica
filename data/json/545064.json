{"path":"545064.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or commercial food processing environment, likely a fish processing facility based on the context. Workers, both male and female, are engaged in various tasks related to food processing along assembly lines. Most are standing at conveyor belts or processing tables.\n\nThe workers are attired in practical work wear including aprons or smocks and hairnets or caps, suggesting health and safety regulations are being followed in a possibly wet or messy environment. They are handling what appear to be fish, using tools like knives, and working intently on their respective tasks.\n\nThe facility itself has a functional and utilitarian design, with visible structural elements like beams and pipes. The lighting is bright, coming from overhead industrial lamps, which illuminate the working space effectively. There are several large tanks or basins, likely for holding fish or water, and yellow plastic crates and containers are used for storing or transporting processed items. Water or liquid spills can be seen on the floor, reflecting the messy nature of the work.\n\nThe setting is indoors, and the photo captures a scene of active labor, depicting a moment in the everyday operations of the facility. The overall atmosphere is busy and focused, indicative of a high-energy workplace with a clear emphasis on efficiency and productivity.","title":"Seafood processing plant","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545065","543245","550316","545202","552633","554431","544018","558350","544026","545211","550320","544826","552875","552635","558353","552634"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["processing","fish","food","facility","worker","spill","productivity","workplace","indoor","task"]}
