{"path":"545113.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial facility nestled in a forest setting. The central focus is an extensive building complex characterized by its large, flat-roofed structures with a stark, utilitarian design. Prominent in the scene is a tall chimney from which a thick plume of white smoke is being emitted, billowing into the sky and mingling with the clouds. The background is densely covered with evergreen trees, typical of a coniferous forest, suggesting a location that balances industrial activity with natural surroundings.\n\nThe foreground is framed by towering evergreen trees, likely pines, which partially obscure and provide a natural contrast to the industrial scene beyond. This juxtaposition highlights the interplay between industrial development and nature. The overall composition, with the industry in the center flanked by nature, creates a narrative about the impact of human activities on natural environments. The image has a vivid color palette, with the deep greens of the trees and the blue and white hues of the sky and smoke adding to the visual impact of the photograph.","title":"Lumber mill pollutes air in recreation area","placename":"Reedsport (Or.)","location":"Reedsport, Oregon","nn1":["546141","551059","543009","550998","551056","552185","551055","550997","548195","550329","557225","542997","551054","543011","551060","543013"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["mingle","smoke","impact","forest","pine","billow","plume","nestle","chimney","narrative"]}
