{"path":"558108.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features an adult male in an outdoor setting, possibly engaged in a field study or some type of environmental investigation. The subject is crouched down on the ground, examining something intently with his hands. He wears glasses, a dark leather jacket and casual pants, which suggests a setting in cooler weather.\n\nThe background showcases a vast, open field that appears wet or muddy, indicative of recent rain. The terrain is sparsely vegetated, with only a few small plants scattered across the plain soil surface, hinting that the area might be regularly used for agricultural or similar activity. In the distant background, a line of trees or shrubs slightly obscures the horizon, adding a sense of depth and isolation to the scene.\n\nThe overall lighting of the photograph is soft, with overcast skies casting diffuse natural light, which further emphasizes the quiet, serene outdoor environment. The manâ€™s focused activity and the barren landscape suggest a moment of scientific inquiry or contemplation, removed from urban disturbances.","title":"Scientist from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History examines fire cracked rock which are reddish in appearance at the Kurtz site, a prehistoric earthwork Indian site east of Riverview Road in Boston Township south of Cleveland, Ohio. The location is visited by many amateur archaeologists who unearth similar stones. The area is part of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in a 20-mile stretch of land between Cleveland and Akron. It is rich in Indian history.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["543802","552289","554797","552290","552110","549083","548956","549086","545099","542716","557097","543781","542548","542663","546312","556991"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Environmental Conservation"],"terms":["inquiry","investigation","leather","field","disturbance","male","study","rain","contemplation","adult"]}
