{"path":"552411.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image portrays a bustling street scene captured presumably in the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the style of clothes and cars. The street is lined with various businesses and adorned with colorful signs advertising motels, restaurants, and attractions like a wax museum featuring \"The Bride of Frankenstein.\"\n\nIn the foreground, a group of children and adults walk along the sidewalk. One young girl in the left foreground is walking briskly, dressed in a pink button-up shirt and shorts, complemented by white socks and dark shoes. Behind her, another young girl in a red and white dress seems jubilant, looking directly at the camera with a joyful expression as she steps forward. Both seem to be in motion, suggesting a moment of playful, lively activity.\n\nFurther back, adults and other children are seen walking along or standing, giving a sense of everyday urban activity. People are dressed in a casual manner typical of the era, including flared pants and jackets. There is a diversity of ages and possibly ethnic backgrounds among the pedestrians.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, a classic 1970s blue car is parked by the sidewalk, next to various commercial signs, contributing to the urban commercial ethos of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is busy yet casual, underpinned by a cloudy sky which suggests an overcast day. The array of signage, the architecture typical of mid-20th-century commercial districts, and the presence of various establishments (like a bridal shop, Chinese food restaurant, and a coffee shop) all combine to evoke a lively, eclectic street scene from a few decades ago.","title":"Amusement section of Center Street, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, offers lures on all sides for tourists and honeymooners.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["551125","550142","545216","548369","542586","550139","554297","549872","551124","548399","556199","549882","557705","551135","556224","546626"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["restaurant","shop","girl","sidewalk","street","adult","museum","motel","1970","coffee"]}
