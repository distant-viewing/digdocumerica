{"path":"543459.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young child, viewed from behind, walking towards the ocean waves. The child, who appears to be shirtless and sporting black swim shorts, has a dark tan and is wearing a ragged cloth cap. The child is walking on wet sand, and the surf can be seen foaming around their legs as they advance towards larger waves further ahead. \n\nThe background features rolling ocean waves in various shades of blue and green, breaking white as they approach the shore. The sky is clear and notably blue, adding to the serene and vibrant seascape. The overall atmosphere is sunny and bright, emphasizing a day at the beach in an active and playful environment. The focus and motion suggest a moment of youthful adventure and exploration by the seaside.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543214","549105","550244","544380","547867","547727","550241","548805","552279","550233","543215","552940","547083","547676","550229","555398"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["wave","child","ocean","surf","seaside","swim","cloth","seascape","adventure","leg"]}
