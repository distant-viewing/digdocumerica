{"path":"555106.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of several thin, flowering plants. These plants have long, vertical stems, and are covered in dense clusters of small, white, sparkling blooms that catch the light, giving them a luminous appearance. The background is dark and consists of densely packed tree trunks and foliage, which enhances the contrast with the brightly illuminated flowers in the foreground. The setting and lighting suggest that the photo may have been taken in a shaded woodland area, with sunlight selectively highlighting the flowering plants. This composition focuses on the natural beauty and detail of the plants in their environment, emphasizing their delicate structures against a dark, muted backdrop.","title":"Hemlocks in olympic national timberland, Washington.
