{"path":"543735.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape dominated by a river cutting through varied terrain. The river appears wide and prominent, snaking through the frame in soft, meandering curves. Surrounding the river are extensive sandy or muddy banks that gleam in light shades, showing signs of sediment deposits or possibly salt flats.\n\nTo the left of the river, there is developed land where clusters of lights and structures suggest a populated area, possibly a small town or industrial zone. The presence of man-made shapes, possibly buildings and vehicles, can be discerned in this built-up area.\n\nA well-defined road parallels the river's course on its left bank, curving along the landscape and occasionally intersected by what appear to be bridges or culverts crossing the river. This roadway enhances the connectivity to the region, indicating an infrastructure set up to support access and possible economic activities around the river.\n\nThe overall picture is shot during nighttime or in dim lighting conditions, casting most of the area in shadows and highlighting the contrasts between the light surfaces of the banks and the darker waters of the river. This image captures a blend of natural and human-altered landscapes, presenting an interesting study of how land is used and developed in relation to water bodies.","title":"Settling pond where wastes are allowed to \"settle out\" from milling process, Idarado Mill.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["550392","555753","547990","550861","546694","557506","547227","548931","548916","546351","550623","550546","549081","550530","557420","550885"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["river","bank","flat","relation","connectivity","nighttime","salt","deposit","land","course"]}
