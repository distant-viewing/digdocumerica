{"path":"542987.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial or water treatment facility captured in an environment with a striking, natural background. Two large circular tanks dominate the foreground; the nearest tank appears to have water or some liquid along with some internal structure or equipment, which is visible. The second tank looks similarly constructed but is filled with a glistening liquid, likely water, reflecting the light. A small strip of land separates them, along with a path that two figures in safety gear (noticeable by their bright yellow helmets) are walking on. The workers seem small in comparison to the massive scale of the tanks.\n\nThe landscape around the tanks is barren with minimal vegetation, suggesting a possibly harsh, remote environment. The horizon behind the water treatment facility meets a tumultuous sea, indicating the proximity to a coastline. Above this landscape, the sky is dramatic, filled with clouds tinted with hues of pink and orange, possibly indicating either dawn or dusk. The overall atmosphere of the image, combined with the industrial setting against a powerful natural backdrop, evokes a sense of isolation and the contrast between human activity and the vastness of nature.","title":"Sewage treatment","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548212","543571","543573","545840","548151","547568","543572","548137","547262","549636","545836","543568","543574","548216","546037","542587"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tank","liquid","treatment","comparison","facility","pink","glisten","tint","water","separate"]}
