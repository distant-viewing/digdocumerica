{"path":"551973.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an action moment of a woman playing softball in a park. The woman is in mid-swing after hitting a softball, captured from a side angle. She appears to be right-handed, and is wearing a sleeveless black top and matching black shorts, completing her attire with sneakers. Her body is in dynamic motion, with her right leg slightly lifted off the ground and her back arched as part of the follow-through from her swing.\n\nThe woman's focused expression and the positioning of both her arms stretched outward holding the bat suggest a powerful swing. The background is a vibrant green grassy area scattered with small yellow flowers, reflecting a sunny day. Further in the background, the park setting is evident with several visible parked cars and lush trees lining the area. The scene conveys a casual, recreational atmosphere typical of a pleasant day out in a public park.","title":"Turn at bat.
