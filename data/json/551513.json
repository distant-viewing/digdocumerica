{"path":"551513.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph portrays a quaint and richly detailed street scene. In the foreground, an elderly woman with short, curly blonde hair is using a broom to sweep a paved area. She wears a navy blue outfit accented by simple, practical shoes. The focus of the scene is a vintage-style food cart, featuring bright colors mainly red, with intricately detailed yellow and white patterns. The cart has large, decoratively spoked yellow wheels, and advertises a variety of snacks such as \"Fresh Roasted Peanuts,” \"Carmel Corn Popcorn,\" and \"Hot Dogs,\" all listed with prices. A female vendor is visible inside the cart, seemingly in the process of managing the food.\n\nThe food cart is situated under a dark, shaded area that looks to be a passage or a semi-indoor setting, given the brick walls and the presence of ceiling lights. On the right half of the image, there’s a column partially obscuring the cart, and the scene opens up to a brighter, outdoor area where we can glimpse several figures in the sunny outside environment, portraying a nice contrast between the shaded indoors and the sunlit street. The overall ambiance suggests a relaxed, public space possibly located within a park, a marketplace, or near a tourist attraction.","title":"Popcorn wagon employee keeps that part of Nicollet Mall clean.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["558135","558136","551731","556212","554217","553486","554708","557803","548544","551695","550115","556223","551822","556210","551837","557129"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["cart","food","marketplace","broom","indoor","navy","snack","attraction","price","vendor"]}
