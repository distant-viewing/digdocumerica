{"path":"548858.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows an indoor setting that appears to be a laboratory or workshop involved in food science or quality testing. The image is dominated by a female scientist or technician who is actively engaged in handling and examining a light-colored granular substance on a black tray she holds. She is dressed in a white lab coat, suggesting a professional, scientific environment.\n\nIn the background and to the right side of the frame, there is a long bench cluttered with various containers and scientific equipment. Notable among them are numerous clear plastic cups lined in a row, possibly containing samples for testing or experiments. Further back, there appears to be rows of bottles and other laboratory glassware.\n\nDirectly next to the scientist, on a metallic tray, are several pieces of raw meat, suggesting that the work being conducted might involve food processing, safety inspections or similar activities. This setup indicates a meticulously organized space designed for scientific or culinary research.\n\nThe lighting is subdued, focusing primarily on the subject and her immediate workspace, which helps draw attention to her and the materials she is interacting with. The general tone and composition of the image evoke a sense of serious scientific inquiry and analysis.","title":"From red meat to ash--a four week laboratory procedure for measuring gamma radiation at EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548867","547710","548860","548862","548856","549342","546327","546278","546288","546344","542737","546323","549608","548891","549607","555254"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tray","scientist","testing","laboratory","food","inquiry","glassware","meat","technician","science"]}
