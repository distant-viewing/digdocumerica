{"path":"557751.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene of three men involved in farm work, specifically in the process of hay baling. The setting is a wide, open field backed by rolling hills partially covered with trees. The image is alive with the lush greenery typical of a fertile, rural landscape.\n\nOn the left side, there is an older man dressed in a white T-shirt and red baseball cap. He is lifting a large bale of hay and wearing gloves, indicating manual labor. This man's expression suggests exertion or possibly a moment during casual conversation.\n\nTo the right, two younger men are prominently featured. One, in a striped red, yellow, and white sleeveless top and jeans, is also holding a bale of hay. The other, wearing a checked shirt, denim pants, and a white cap, is turned towards his companion, smiling and seemingly engaged in a light, joyful conversation.\n\nBehind these individuals is a red and white truck loaded with more hay bales, suggesting the ongoing activity of loading or transporting hay. There are numerous other hay bales scattered across the field in the background, indicating the scale of the harvesting operation.\n\nThe overall atmosphere depicted in the photograph is one of work intermixed with camaraderie among the laborers in a pastoral setting. The presence of necessary farm equipment and the clear depiction of manual labor underscore the agricultural nature of the scene.","title":"Hired laborers gather hay on a farm owned by former Georgia governor Hardeman who now lives in Florida and has the land managed by an overseer. The farm is located in the Nacoochee Valley two miles southwest of Helen, Georgia, which is near Robertstown. A nearby field holds a Nacoochee Indian mound which was the center of the ancient Cherokee town of Gauxule which reportedly was visited by the Spaniard, DeSoto, in 1540 during his search for gold.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552576","557752","557754","552578","551158","551168","551167","551169","549258","557753","549036","555620","554922","552577","555619","549137"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hay","bale","farm","labor","exertion","conversation","cap","companion","harvesting","man"]}
