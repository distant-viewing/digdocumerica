{"path":"545236.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely captured from a distance across a body of water. The primary focus is on an expansive industrial facility characterized by various structures including towers, piping, and smoking chimneys. These chimneys emit a significant amount of white and grey smoke, which billows into the clear blue sky, creating a stark contrast. The facility is complex, with several large buildings and construction scaffolding, suggesting ongoing development or maintenance.\n\nIn the foreground are piles of a dusty, brownish material, possibly coal, ore, or industrial waste, which are stored open-air within the facility's boundaries. The industrial environment is stark and devoid of visible vegetation, focusing solely on the functional aspects of the facility.\n\nTo the right of the image, port equipment, including cranes, can be seen, indicating that the facility may have its operations tied to shipping or receiving goods via a nearby waterway. The overall ambiance of the photograph hints at heavy industry and manufacturing, typical of mid-20th-century industrial settings. This setting is a vivid illustration of industrial activity, highlighting themes of development, environmental impact, and economic operations.","title":"The St. Regis pulp mill, with all stacks at full blast","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550868","543005","546908","549508","548379","546769","544777","557225","546884","552179","550716","546808","549510","550344","548376","550328"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facility","chimney","ore","illustration","development","smoke","receive","scaffolding","piping","operation"]}
