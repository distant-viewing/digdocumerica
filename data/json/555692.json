{"path":"555692.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape dominated by a large body of water in the foreground and a majestic mountain range in the background. The water appears calm with slight ripples, suggesting a gentle breeze. The mountains rise steeply from the shores of the lake, displaying slopes that are densely covered in coniferous forests up to a certain altitude, beyond which the trees give way to rocky terrain and patches of snow.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is an island or peninsula densely populated with trees, separating two parts of the water body, which adds depth and interest to the composition. The clear blue sky above offers a sense of openness and tranquility, with only a few wispy clouds visible near the peaks of the mountains, accentuating their heights.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its natural color palette ranging from the deep blues of the water, vibrant greens of the forests, to the rocky greys and whites of the mountain peaks under the azure sky, invites the viewer into a peaceful and untouched wilderness setting. The image captures the beauty and serene atmosphere of a pristine natural environment, likely taken during a sunny day judging by the brightness and clear visibility.","title":"Taken from a point between Saw Island and Jackson Point this view looks east.
