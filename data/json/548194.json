{"path":"548194.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph shows an outdoor scene with a strong industrial and natural contrast. In the foreground, there is a winding gravel path that leads through a field of brown and green grass. The path is edged by darker soil or perhaps a thin barrier, and it occupies the lower half of the image, drawing the viewer's eye towards the background.\n\nIn the middle ground, the natural landscape transitions into an industrial setting. Sparse foliage frames the view of various industrial structures, including buildings and storage tanks. Several smokestacks are visible, one of which is emitting thick white smoke that ascends into the sky, indicating active industrial operations.\n\nThe background of the image features a clear blue sky with wispy clouds, suggesting a crisp or cool weather condition. The contrast between the rural foreground with the industrial background creates a dialogue about industrial impact on natural landscapes, hinting at themes of environmental change and human intervention.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph balances the serenity of a natural path with the harsh reality of industrial advancement, presented under a wide, expansive sky that adds a sense of space and openness to the scene.","title":"Effluent treatment canal of the Crown-Zellerbach Corporation, one of the largest specialty paper mills in the world.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545989","544676","555542","545988","545013","544039","543668","545993","543813","545112","555569","545035","549191","545053","546398","545971"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["path","advancement","dialogue","reality","ascend","serenity","intervention","openness","half","gravel"]}
