{"path":"553194.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene nighttime scene in an outdoor setting, possibly a park. People are seated along a long, wooden deck or embankment that borders a dark, reflective body of water, likely a pond or river. There is a dense array of lush trees with leaves illuminated from beneath or behind by ambient light, casting a vibrant green glow that contrasts with the dark sky and water.\n\nMost individuals in the scene appear to be engaged in quiet activities such as talking, relaxing, or simply enjoying the tranquil surroundings. The lighting is subdued, creating a calm and slightly mysterious atmosphere, emphasizing the natural beauty of the setting. There are dimly lit structures visible in the background, suggesting that this location is adjacent to an urban area. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interplay of light and shadow and the reflective quality of the water, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence between the urban environment and natural space.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: Saturday night","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553193","546392","551223","554477","550852","552225","551431","550777","547099","551280","549716","553181","549060","547245","557515","549099"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["embankment","nighttime","coexistence","pond","deck","glow","array","interplay","water","park"]}
