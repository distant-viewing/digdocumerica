{"path":"545254.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a devastated landscape dominated by debris and broken timber. The foreground of the image is cluttered with splintered and shattered pieces of wood strewn across the ground, suggesting the aftermath of a significant disruptive event, possibly a forest clear-cut or aftermath of a natural disaster such as a storm or landslide. The broken pieces of wood vary in size, with some large tree trunks and stumps visible amidst the destruction.\n\nTowards the middle ground, the terrain remains uneven and covered with the remnants of fallen trees, some of which have their roots exposed, indicating they were violently uprooted. No human activity or people are visible in the chaotic mess of the foreground.\n\nIn contrast to the devastated area, the background features a dense forest on a hill, seemingly untouched, with a multitude of healthy, green trees standing stark against the sky. This juxtaposition emphasizes the extent of the destruction in the foreground compared to the untouched nature in the distance. The sky above appears somewhat cloudy, casting a gloomy light over the scene, which enhances the somber mood of the image.","title":"The Butte Creek stream, formerly a salmon spawning ground, was ruined by forestry practices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs according to forestry consultant, Dee Terry. The hillside in this picture was replanted with Douglas fir and hemlock.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545264","555089","555086","555230","555142","555162","555207","555208","557008","555139","555150","546060","555092","555148","545138","547527"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["destruction","aftermath","landslide","wood","extent","piece","root","multitude","disaster","stump"]}
