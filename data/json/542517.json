{"path":"542517.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a striking landscape dominated by agricultural fields, which are characterized by their varied earthy tones and geometric shapes. The fields are patchworks of different shades of brown, orange, and beige, some sections darker and others a luminous light color, possibly due to varying crop types or the stages of agricultural production. The fields are segmented by a network of straight roads and pathways, which create clear demarcation lines.\n\nA curving road cuts through the center of the image, creating a visual contrast with the predominantly linear patterns of the fields. This road, highlighted by its darker pavement, snakes gracefully through the composition, merging into the distance towards the upper right. The road's curvature introduces a dynamic element against the static backdrop of the fields.\n\nThe photo's perspective, likely taken from a significant altitude, enables an expansive view, turning a typical rural scene into an almost abstract mosaic of color and form. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, highlighting textures and enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the terrain. The shadows cast by possible elevation changes in the landscape further amplify these effects. Overall, the composition captures a blend of human impact and natural patterns, providing a snapshot of rural planning intersected by natural landscape management.","title":"California - Kings River","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["558414","557517","548908","553047","549094","549253","554030","547350","542708","554059","547684","555888","553972","547724","553977","553973"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","road","enable","demarcation","amplify","curvature","mosaic","darker","patchwork","curving"]}
