{"path":"557251.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and serene view of a body of water, possibly a shallow stream or river, with numerous visible stones on its bed. The water is clear enough to allow the shapes and textures of these stones to be distinctly visible. They vary in color, predominantly in shades of gray and brown, rounded from erosion.\n\nThe surface of the water is calm with slight ripples, likely caused by a gentle flow. Among the stones and ripples, tiny flecks of sunlight reflect off the water, adding a touch of sparkle to the scene. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as the light appears soft and diffuse.\n\nThere are no human activities or people in the photo, emphasizing nature and tranquility. The backdrop is out of focus, suggesting an open space that continues the water theme, though it is not possible to determine specific details about the surroundings. The photograph's composition is straightforward, focusing primarily on the texture and the peaceful flow of the water over the stones, evoking a peaceful, natural environment.","title":"Closeup view of polluted water on the Ohio river in Beaver County near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
