{"path":"549759.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph describes a scene involving a sanitation vehicle in action inside a large industrial or warehouse structure. The vehicle, predominantly white with black trim, is labeled \"sanitation\" and features a logo that appears to be a stylized \"P\" intersected by a ring.\n\nThe vehicle is equipped with a mechanical arm that is extended upwards towards a metal chute, out of which garbage is being poured into the vehicle's loading area. The garbage includes a variety of unidentifiable debris and waste materials, generating a stream of refuse from the chute to the vehicle.\n\nThe background reveals a spacious building interior characterized by large, multi-paned windows that let in ample natural light, and a dark framework supporting the roof. The environment suggests a functional area for waste management or processing in an urban setting. The focus and exposure of the photograph emphasize the operation of the sanitation vehicle and the movement of garbage, while the industrial elements convey the sense of a working facility dedicated to managing city refuse.","title":"Garbage trucks at 91st Street Marine Transfer Station.
