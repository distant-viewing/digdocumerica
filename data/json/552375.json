The man, wearing headphones and a headset microphone, is focused on adjusting or monitoring equipment. He has a beard and is wearing a jacket with an emblem on it, suggesting he may be part of a specific organization or crew.\n\nThe room is filled with various technical equipment including gauges, dials, and switches. On the left side of the image, there's a panel labeled \"OZONE MONITOR\" which includes several measurement dials and toggles. In the center and right-hand parts of the room, more complex control panels can be seen, featuring an array of buttons, gauges, and readouts.\n\nThe interior has a metallic finish, with a technical and utilitarian design typical of aircraft or specialized mobile operations centers. Several notes and labels are attached around the equipment, providing instructions or data. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and technical precision, characteristic of environments where monitoring and data collection are critical.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542668","551916","542659","549378","545943","555334","551905","551896","552380","548880","542765","549610","557394","551902","556384","557317"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["gauge","datum","dial","room","monitoring","aircraft","panel","control","equipment","switch"]}
