{"path":"546237.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and dense plume of smoke or steam rising into the sky, framed against a backdrop of clouds and clear blue sky. The plume is dark and thick at its base, becoming increasingly billowy and lighter in color as it ascends. Its massive form is reminiscent of cumulonimbus clouds, which are typically associated with thunderstorms and severe weather, but its origin is clearly industrial given its emanation from narrow, elongated structures at the bottom of the image.\n\nThese structures appear to be tall industrial chimneys or smokestacks, which are only partially visible at the bottom corners of the photograph, reinforcing their towering height. The smokestacks are dark and feature ladders, emphasizing their functionality and scale.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the man-made industrial elements at the bottom with the natural sky and cloud phenomena above, emphasizing a contrast between human activity and nature. The lighting in the image highlights the textures and forms of the smoke, providing a visually striking and somewhat ominous aesthetic.","title":"Sulphur fumes pour out of the smokestacks of the olin mathieson chemical plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["548157","547204","550905","550987","550333","544704","545472","550938","549634","550821","553841","545439","545990","545468","547137","555166"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plume","smokestack","bottom","phenomena","origin","smoke","ladder","elongate","ascend","become"]}
