{"path":"553831.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The foreground shows lush green grass and a barbed wire fence lining the bottom edge. Just in the center of the image, there is a prominent sign that reads \"SPACE FOR LEASE - INDUSTRIAL SITES FOR SALE - NASHVILLE 251-9176.\" This suggests the location might be near Nashville.\n\nBeyond the sign, the middle ground reveals a plowed field curving gently, surrounded by patches of grass and trees spaced at intervals. Further back, there are scattered farms; visible are several structures including red barns, which contrast vividly with the green fields. The setting appears peaceful and pastoral, with a sense of openness and quiet typical of rural farm areas. The composition of the photograph—with the sign indicating development, the agricultural land, and farm buildings—captures a moment of potential transition from rural to industrial use.","title":"Farmland for industrial lease off route 77, southwest of brecksville.
