{"path":"551325.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling, somewhat chaotic street scene that appears to be set in a busy amusement park or fairground. The setting is evidently lively, with many different activities and objects contributing to the overall dynamic of the scene.\n\n**Foreground:** The foreground of the image is dominated by a congested road filled with a variety of vehicles, including cars and emergency vehicles like a fire truck and an ambulance, both with lights flashing. People are scattered among the cars, walking or standing, which suggests that there might be a temporary or sudden halt or slow movement in the traffic. A motorcyclist is visible near the center of the road, contributing to the variety of transportation methods in the scene.\n\n**Middle ground:** Further into the scene, a large crowd is noticeable around more attractions and rides. Notably, there is a Ferris wheel adorned with lights, hinting that the photograph could have been taken during the evening or late afternoon hours. The ambience of a fair is further suggested by the presence of amusement rides and carnival-style booths.\n\n**Background:** Beyond the rides, there are additional signs of commercial activity. Various signs and advertisements are visible, including one promoting an \"All U Can Eat Chicken\" special, setting a casual, festive tone typical of fairs and carnivals. There's also a speed limit sign prominently displayed, likely meant to caution the heavy traffic in this area.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:** The photograph has a somewhat dark, moody lighting which could be indicative of overcast weather or the onset of dusk. The lighting accentuates the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles, adding to the urgency or emergency-like atmosphere suggested by their presence.\n\nOverall, this photograph portrays a vibrant, if somewhat disorderly, scene filled with various activities and elements typical of a busy fair or amusement park, juxtaposed against regular city life elements like heavy traffic and emergency services in action.","title":"Emergency vehicle rushes to scene of a Memorial Day auto accident on \"the Strip\", crowded commercial amusement area of Bagnell Dam.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551324","553298","545465","553845","556983","550143","554309","547776","546743","555446","549872","549874","544817","550018","555782","553822"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["emergency","amusement","ride","carnival","traffic","fairground","onset","vehicle","limit","park"]}
