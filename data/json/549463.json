{"path":"549463.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an exciting and dynamic moment of white-water rafting. In the image, a large inflatable raft, dominated by a bright red color with the word \"TRAIL\" visible, is navigating through turbulent, foaming rapids. The raft is manned by several individuals equipped with life vests and helmets for safety. Most of the people in the raft are seated and using paddles to steer and propel the vessel. The expressions on their faces are focused and determined, suggesting they are actively engaged in maneuvering through the challenging waters.\n\nThe background scenery features rugged, rocky canyon walls covered with sparse vegetation, hinting that this activity is taking place in a remote, natural setting possibly within a river gorge or canyon. The waters around the raft are tumultuous and white, indicating strong currents and swift movement. The overall composition of the photo, with its vivid colors and dynamic action, conveys a sense of adventure and the thrill of battling natureâ€™s elements.","title":"A large (28 foot) raft running Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River during a conservation trip through Hells Canyon.","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549464","549462","549437","549440","545733","549439","549465","545729","545741","549447","545737","549441","544925","545937","545730","545745"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","canyon","gorge","rafting","thrill","rapid","steer","paddle","maneuver","current"]}
