{"path":"552982.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene aquatic scene, where a group of people are engaging in boating activities on a large body of water surrounded by a picturesque landscape. There are two boats in the image, both located close to the rocky, muddy shore of the lake.\n\nThe first boat, closest to the camera, is a canoe occupied by four individuals. Three of them are seated facing the direction of movement, each holding an oar, while the fourth person sits in the stern, facing backwards, with no visible oar. The occupants appear to be in casual, light attire suitable for a warm day.\n\nThe second boat, slightly further from the shore, is another canoe with two individuals seated at either end, handling their oars. They are dressed in similarly casual, warm-weather clothing.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features calm water reflecting a clear blue sky. In the background, majestic mountains, partially covered in snow, rise spectacularly. This combination suggests that the location might be in a mountainous region during a period when the last remnants of winter snow are still evident. The water at the edge of the lake is clear, revealing the rocky bed beneath and enhancing the overall tranquility of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is balanced and peaceful, showcasing an enjoyable moment of leisure activities in a beautiful natural setting.","title":"(from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
