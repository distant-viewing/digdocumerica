{"path":"556614.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a discarded, dented beer can lying on the ground, prominently in the foreground of the image. The can's label reads \"BUDWEISER KING OF BEERS,\" and it appears worn and aged, with exposure from the elements evident in the fading and scratches on its surface. \n\nIn the distance, a sign that reads \"TAOS TOWN LIMIT ELEV 6950\" is centrally positioned and slightly out of focus, indicating the image's setting on the outskirts of Taos. The elevation mentioned on the sign is 6,950 feet. \n\nThe environment surrounding these objects includes wild, scruffy vegetation and dried leaves, typical of a semi-arid region. Thick, leafy trees and some shrubs can be seen behind the sign, also contributing to the rural or outskirts feel of the location. The sky in the background is overcast, suggesting a cloudy day.\n\nOverall, the image gives a sense of abandonment or neglect, possibly aiming to convey a commentary on pollution or neglect in natural settings. The juxtaposition of the natural environment with human-made waste serves as a strong visual element in the photo.","title":"Empty steel beer and soft drink cans that litter the countryside could become a sight of the past if the experimental houses built from them near Taos, New Mexico, become popular. Some 70,000 cans are needed to build one structure, so the can manufacturing industry is watching with interest. Builder Michael Reynolds considers the houses functional and attractive, and as much as 20% cheaper than ones built by conventional methods.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["550806","550805","556615","547506","549789","556640","551418","542809","551246","543614","542978","544640","543616","544651","552099","544647"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["beer","outskirt","sign","commentary","label","foot","can","elevation","exposure","abandonment"]}
