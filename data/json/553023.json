{"path":"553023.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic industrial scene dominated by a large water tower and billowing clouds of steam or smoke. The water tower, positioned in the center, stands on a metal framework with a spherical base and an upper section built in a traditional tank style. The scene is bathed in a dim, dusky light, giving the image a moody and intense atmosphere.\n\nThe background is obscured by dark clouds and a smoky haze, which may suggest pollution or the operation of heavy machinery typical of industrial environments. In the foreground, partial silhouettes of industrial structures or machinery can be discerned, contributing to the feeling of a busy industrial complex.\n\nThe composition uses silhouette and backlighting to create a stark contrast between the dark structures and the lighter, yet dense, clouds of smoke or steam. This contrast emphasizes the environmental impact of industrial activities, possibly highlighting themes of pollution or industrial decay. The overall effect is one of a powerful, somewhat foreboding representation of industrial might and its environmental implications.","title":"Armco steel company.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
