{"path":"553330.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a man working in an industrial or mechanical workshop environment. The man, wearing a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves and dark pants, is intently focused on adjusting or inspecting a complex apparatus which appears to be part of a vehicle or machinery set up for testing or maintenance.\n\nThe machinery features various metal components, hoses, and wires, suggesting that it might be an engine or motor setup. There are some noticeable elements like a large black cylindrical object which could be an exhaust or part of a cooling system, and multiple metal pipes and tubes connected to the machinery, indicating the setup could be used either for performance tests or repairs.\n\nThe background includes several other mechanical devices and equipment, reinforcing the idea that this space is dedicated to mechanical work or engineering. To the left and right, you can see storage shelves with various tools, boxes, and possibly spare parts.\n\nThe surroundings look orderly yet busy with equipment, signaling a well-used working environment. The floor is made of gridded metal panels typical for industrial or workshop settings, likely designed to handle heavy machinery. There's a sense of precision and technical expertise required in the tasks being performed, highlighting the skill and focus of the man at work.","title":"Emission test at the National Environmental Research Center of EPA: the Chevrolet engine (red) with Chevrolet's pelletized catalytic converter (flat aluminum, lower center).
