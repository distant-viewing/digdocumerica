{"path":"549064.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural outdoor scene primarily focused on water management or agriculture. In the foreground, a large pipe, partly covered by some sparse vegetation, is expelling a forceful stream of water into a small reservoir or pond. The water is frothy and turbulent where it hits the pond, suggesting considerable force behind the flow.\n\nOn the right, a person stands on a narrow strip of land that divides the pond from the background, observing the scene. The person is in silhouette against a clear sky, detailed enough to indicate a standing pose looking towards the pipe and water.\n\nThe background features a flat landscape dotted with low hills on the horizon, under a wide and clear sky that suggests a bright, sunny day. There are a few distant trees and possibly some small structures, which adds a sense of open, undeveloped land.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photo suggest it might be capturing an aspect of water management in agriculture, possibly for irrigation. The scene has a quiet, solitary feel, emphasized by the single human figure in a vast landscape.","title":"Irrigation canal on the Colorado River Indian Reservation","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549065","549078","543792","546829","543759","552134","553652","549056","549053","543830","548871","543781","548869","543810","545680","550713"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pond","agriculture","pipe","management","reservoir","irrigation","water","land","standing","person"]}
