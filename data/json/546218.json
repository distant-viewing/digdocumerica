{"path":"546218.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between a man and a young fawn in an outdoor setting. The focal point of the image is the interaction where the man, seen from the chest down, is feeding the fawn milk from a clear glass bottle with a rubber nipple. The man wears a light-colored shirt partially tucked into dark trousers, secured with a belt. His hands are marked by signs of age and hard work, indicating a life of labor.\n\nThe fawn, standing on the right side of the frame, exhibits a gentle demeanor, its mouth clasping the bottle's nipple. It has a beautifully spotted coat typical of a young deer, with distinct white spots contrasting against its light brown fur. The fawn's large ears are perked up, indicating alertness.\n\nIn the background, there is a hint of a green-colored vintage truck, suggesting a rural or farm setting. The overall setting appears to be a grassy area under bright sunlight, contributing to a warm and pastoral atmosphere. This scene likely exemplifies human-animal interaction in a nurturing context, possibly on a farm or wildlife sanctuary. The vivid colors and detailed texture in the photograph enhance the emotional and warm essence of the moment.","title":"Garner state park","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["543847","550803","543839","543368","543279","550804","543851","544434","549200","544916","554619","550802","546163","555531","554620","553064"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["bottle","milk","alertness","exemplify","ears","clasp","rubber","tender","deer","feed"]}
