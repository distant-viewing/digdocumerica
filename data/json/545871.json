{"path":"545871.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a natural outdoor scene featuring a small, rugged water stream amid a wet, muddy environment. The foreground is dominated by water flowing dynamically across rough terrain packed with stones, gravel, and scattered patches of grass and dry foliage. This vivid depiction of water displays its burst through the land, reflecting a momentary or seasonal rainfall that has saturated the previously dry earth.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows bits of vegetation, primarily small scrubby bushes that appear somewhat sparse, indicating a potentially arid or semi-arid biome. These plants are interspersed with pockets of water and mud around them, suggesting a recent overflow or flood.\n\nIn the background, the scene opens up to a broader vista featuring distant mountains with soft, rounded contours discernible under an overcast sky. The overall grayness and diffuse light suggest an ongoing or imminent rainfall, contributing to the somewhat solemn and damp mood of the landscape. The terrain and vegetation indicate that the location may be prone to flash floods, transforming briefly during intense rainfalls then possibly returning to a drier state.","title":"Hard rain causes run-off from pasture land.","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["550486","554407","553653","550351","549550","550655","550742","550698","551231","555214","555153","552994","553855","555550","545656","544856"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rainfall","flood","burst","vista","pocket","mud","depiction","water","gravel","terrain"]}
