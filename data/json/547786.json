{"path":"547786.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a poignant scene set in an industrial or post-industrial environment. The central focus of the image is an old, abandoned tricycle in the foreground. The tricycle, which appears worn and rusted, is casting a long shadow, indicating that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon when shadows are elongated.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, dilapidated brick building. The building's condition is poor, with visible signs of decay such as missing bricks and what appears to be a collapsed roof in one section. Next to this brick structure, there is another building with visible industrial piping and metal infrastructure, suggesting that it might have been a factory or a similar type of industrial facility.\n\nThe ground is largely barren, covered with dirt and patches of grass, which enhances the sense of desolation in the scene. The lighting in the image suggests it is either dawn or dusk, contributing to the somber mood of the photograph. The sky is mostly clear except for a few clouds, providing a natural light that starkly illuminates the scene.\n\nThe composition leverages the contrast between the child's plaything in the foreground and the industrial decay in the background, possibly as a commentary on lost childhood or the abandonment of areas once bustling with activity. The setting and subjects combined create a narrative that speaks to themes of neglect, change, and the passage of time.","title":"Mexican-American neighborhood in Frisco, a cotton manufacturing town","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553495","547477","553870","547587","547473","550263","545982","554565","543354","551727","552997","547470","543258","545977","554353","556324"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["tricycle","brick","decay","commentary","piping","childhood","desolation","passage","change","dawn"]}
