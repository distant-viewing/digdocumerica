{"path":"547840.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a prominent informational sign on the right, set against a coastal beach scene. The sign has a striking design with a yellow background and black text, featuring the message \"YES! ENJOY SOUTH BEACH\" in bold uppercase letters. Below this is a subtitled \"New York City Department of Parks\" in smaller font size. Additional instructions on the sign note that \"Swimming is permitted only when lifeguards are on duty 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.\", alongside encouragements for cleanliness and safety regarding lightning storms.\n\nThe background of the image displays a wide stretch of sandy beach leading up to a calm sea. The beach is relatively empty with only a few distant figures spread out; they are almost indistinguishable due to the distance. The sky is a hazy blue with some clouds, suggesting it could be a warm and somewhat overcast day. On the left side of the image is visible a large, unidentifiable building near the shore, adding a contrasting element of urban development to the natural seaside environment. The whole scene conveys a sense of quiet leisure, emphasizing the recreational use of the location highlighted in the sign.","title":"South Beach, Staten Island, is safe for swimming.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547836","554119","546928","547973","550932","557480","550223","546874","553683","545162","547976","550243","553764","547628","553686","547871"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["beach","sign","cleanliness","instruction","seaside","note","swimming","storm","stretch","duty"]}
