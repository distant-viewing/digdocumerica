{"path":"553888.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a striking urban scene featuring a large airplane flying low over a residential street lined with multi-story buildings. The architecture of the buildings suggests older, possibly Victorian style three-story residential structures with bay windows and intricate detailing, painted in dark tones. The street appears to be typical of an urban neighborhood, framed by power lines and paved roads.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently displayed, is a road sign that reads \"DRIVE SLOW CHILDREN,\" indicating caution in the area due to the presence of children. The sign is diamond-shaped and mounted on a metal pole. \n\nThe airplane, a large commercial jet with the American Airlines livery, is captured in mid-flight, descending towards the street at an unusually low altitude, possibly suggesting proximity to an airport. The plane's dynamics, with landing gears retracted, suggest it is either taking off or in a landing approach phase.\n\nThe sky serves as a vivid backdrop, colored in bright blue with scattered clouds, enhancing the dramatic juxtaposition between the serene neighborhood and the imposing presence of the low-flying aircraft. This scene gives a surreal or unexpected twist to an otherwise ordinary urban setting. There are no visible people in the image, which focuses on the interaction of man-made environments and technology.","title":"Approaching Logan airport.  (from the sites exhibition.
