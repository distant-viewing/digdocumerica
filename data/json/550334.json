{"path":"550334.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large, curved barrier that separates two distinct sections of water. The barrier, composed of floating logs, wood debris, or similar materials, forms a crescent shape from one landmass to another, creating a contrasting visual between the accumulated wood and the dark blue, almost black water. The upper and left edges of the image show dense green foliage indicating forested areas surrounding the water body. The lower and right parts of the picture are dominated by the deep color of the water, enhancing the isolation of the lighter colored debris barrier in the water. The overall composition highlights a sharp division between the natural landscape and the human interventions utilized to manage or direct natural resources.","title":"Aerial of Georgia Pacific pulp log boom in the St. Croix River near the company's Woodland plant","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550338","550207","545676","545024","550222","548633","549504","545148","547668","546905","549538","553398","549539","550655","552178","551602"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["barrier","visual","wood","division","accumulate","water","landmass","debris","intervention","resource"]}
