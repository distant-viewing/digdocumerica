{"path":"555280.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts an older male scientist or chemist engrossed in his work within a well-equipped laboratory setting. The man, dressed in a white lab coat, is closely examining a notebook, suggesting he is perhaps recording observations or analyzing data. His focused expression indicates a deep concentration and engagement with his work.\n\nThe background of the image is filled with complex laboratory apparatus, featuring an array of glassware and scientific equipment such as beakers, flasks, and tubing, indicative of an environment for chemical experiments. These apparatuses are mounted on racks and interconnected, possibly for distillation or other chemical processes.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photo is dim, highlighting the subject and the immediate surrounding equipment, creating a sense of depth and focus on the man and his immediate environment. The ambient blue and green hues suggest artificial lighting, perhaps from the equipment itself or overhead lights typical in a laboratory, giving the scene a technological and scientific feel.\n\nThis composition effectively portrays a professional scientific environment where meticulous analysis and experimentation occur, emphasizing the scientific process and the dedication required in such a field.","title":"An environmental protection agency laboratory technician in New York city works with dithiocarbamate","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542666","546277","555281","546278","545002","546284","549333","549608","555256","555265","555249","555250","549364","546285","549332","543834"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["laboratory","equipment","distillation","experimentation","glassware","notebook","flask","dedication","scientist","record"]}
