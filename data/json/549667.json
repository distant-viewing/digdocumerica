{"path":"549667.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene that seems to be from a European city, portrayed with a somewhat vintage aesthetic. The image depicts a horse-drawn carriage riding away from the viewer down a busy urban street. The carriage, led by a driver wearing traditional formal attire including a black top hat, carries two passengers: a woman with blonde hair viewed from behind and a man with dark hair, facing sideways, who looks casually dressed compared to the driver.\n\nThe street is lined with classic architecture, possibly late 19th to early 20th century in style, with shops and balconies visible. The scene is busy with people; numerous pedestrians can be seen both in the background and along the sides of the street. The street appears to be bustling with activity, yet the focus is softly on the carriage and riders, contributing to a slightly blurred backdrop that includes several no-entry traffic signs indicating a possibly pedestrian-prioritized area.\n\nThe overall composition successfully captures a moment of everyday life, possibly exploring the contrast between traditional and modern elements within the cityscape. The use of soft focus enhances the nostalgic feel of the scene.","title":"Vienna's famous fiakas (horse-drawn carriages) are the only form of transportation permitted in the pedestrian-only zones. These zones, which have been established on three of the main streets of the inner city, have led to a 70% reduction in air pollution in the area.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551717","550098","549659","549647","550094","557050","549682","557712","551864","549662","549574","549681","549646","544395","551786","548369"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["carriage","street","driver","pedestrian","19th","entry","rider","hair","explore","horse"]}
