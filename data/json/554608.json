{"path":"554608.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene aquatic landscape at what appears to be dusk or dawn, given the soft lighting and reflective qualities of the water. The scene is centered around a large, still, dark water body, reflecting the overcast sky and the surrounding natural elements. Prominently, a variety of trees, including a few dead or leafless ones, emerge from the water; their reflections add to the mystical charm of the scene.\n\nThe foreground prominently features reflections of sparse, thin trees and some denser, bush-like vegetation that seem to be floating due to their reflection on the water's surface. In the middle distance, the landscape becomes denser with a mix of both live and dead trees. The background shows a dense woodland that extends into the distance, suggesting a secluded or untouched natural area.\n\nThe overall mood is quite moody and somber, emphasized by the color palette dominated by dark blues and greens, occasionally highlighted with lighter tones in the sky reflection. The stillness of the water and the silence of the scene might suggest a remote location, far removed from human activity, encapsulating a sense of peace and natural beauty. There are no visible human elements or any signs of active wildlife, focusing entirely on the natural elements and their interplay with water and light.","title":"Black spruce (Picea mariana) swamp on Stillwater Road between Stillwater and Big Moose, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546066","550788","543611","546963","550389","552142","554717","550777","554623","557572","545213","550735","543700","553410","554776","550745"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["reflection","water","peace","woodland","one","stillness","charm","wildlife","distance","dawn"]}
