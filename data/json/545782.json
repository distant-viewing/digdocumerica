{"path":"545782.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor activity set against a dramatic natural backdrop. We see a series of high, steep, reddish sandstone cliffs that take up most of the background. The cliff walls feature natural streaks and lines, indicative of geological formations and perhaps water erosion over time.\n\nIn the foreground, there are four individuals who appear to be campers or hikers taking a break. They are sitting and resting along the base of these cliffs on a sandy ground. The people are surrounded by various pieces of outdoor gear, including backpacks, a large blue bag, water bottles, and what appears to be camping equipment.\n\nThe sunlight in the image is soft, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle shadows and emphasizing the textures of the cliff walls. \n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of adventure and relaxation in a remote, rugged environment. The composition contrasts the grandeur of the natural world against the small, colorful figures of the hikers, illustrating both human interaction with nature and the scale of the natural formations.","title":"The towering walls of a canyon provide shelter for this group of backpackers in the maze, a wild and rugged region in the heart of the canyonlands.  Access to the maze is by rope, or occasionally, steps cut in the rockface.  Hikers here need experience, for the going is hard, water scarce, and trails non-existent.  But the rewards are great, and many say that the canyonlands can be truly experienced no other way","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545780","544903","544931","545689","545700","545776","553370","544305","545767","545697","545601","544301","545694","544093","544917","544902"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["cliff","hiker","formation","camper","wall","backpack","camping","streak","world","bottle"]}
