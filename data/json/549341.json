{"path":"549341.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of thirteen individuals, likely a team of scientists or medical professionals, inside a laboratory or clinical setting. All are dressed in white lab coats, suggesting a professional environment focused on science or medicine.\n\nThe group is mixed in terms of gender, with both male and female members present. They are arranged in a semi-circular formation, with some seated and others standing. The mood appears jovial and informal as many individuals are smiling or laughing, indicating a moment of casual camaraderie or a break in their work.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is sitting on a stool turning slightly towards the camera, portraying a sense of leadership or central importance. The rest of the group is somewhat focused towards him, which may suggest that he is a senior figure or the head of the team.\n\nThe background features scientific or medical equipment, including what looks like large machines or instrumentation panels, consistent with a lab or specialized clinic setting. There are also windows letting in daylight, which helps illuminate the scene and adds a bright, airy feel to the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of professional unity and perhaps celebration or casual interaction among colleagues in a scientific or medical field.","title":"Dr.  Vinko skaric, director of the ruder boskovic institute and his staff.
