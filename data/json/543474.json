{"path":"543474.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny beach scene with a vivid depiction of recreational activity. In the foreground, two people are walking across the sandy beach; the person on the right is dressed in retro-style clothing characterized by a patterned, long-sleeve shirt and red pants, while the other person features more subdued attire with a dark hairdo. They are engaged in what seems to be casual conversation, contributing to a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere.\n\nThe beach itself stretches wide with a relatively smooth and undisturbed sand surface, dotted sparsely with garbage cans. Notably, these cans are not just functional but also colorful, painted in a variety of hues such as red, blue, green, and orange, and they are aligned in a diminishing perspective line stretching into the distance.\n\nThe backdrop is simple and open, emphasizing the emptiness and broad expanse of the beach, which is lit by bright sunlight. The clear blue sky suggests a perfect day for beach activities. Shadows cast by the people and trash cans are sharp and long, indicating that the sun is somewhat low in the sky, likely morning or late afternoon. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph curates a sense of nostalgia through the attire of the individuals and the color palette, alongside conveying a calm, serene day at the beach.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["550930","547503","550936","555402","557507","553882","553951","547009","543225","545162","547628","553952","546982","546874","543072","546794"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["beach","can","emptiness","nostalgia","person","depiction","garbage","attire","trash","sand"]}
