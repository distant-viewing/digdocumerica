{"path":"553997.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph conveys a captivating landscape view, possibly from a high vantage point. The focal point of the image initially seems to be a singular white flower placed in the bottom left foreground, striking a contrast with its delicate appearance against the rugged wilderness beyond. The flower's petals are opened toward the sky, showcasing its yellow central pistils.\n\nBeyond the flower, the landscape stretches out; a mix of dry brownish brush and scattered patches of denser green shrubbery dominates the middle ground, suggesting a semi-arid or coastal environment. The land gently slopes downward toward a serene shoreline that hugs a vast and tranquil sea, which merges into a horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The clouds cast dynamic shadows on both the water and land, creating a play of light and shadow which enhances the depth and mood of the scene.\n\nIn the distance above the sea, a mountain range or island can be seen, enshrouded partially by cloud cover and mist, lending a sense of mystery and vastness to the panorama. The colors in the photograph are muted, with earth tones and the blues of the sea and sky dominating, punctuated only by the crisper whites and yellows of the foreground flower.\n\nThis composition artistically juxtaposes the delicate elements of nature, represented by the flower, against the broader, majestic scape of an untamed coastline and distant mountains, highlighting themes of scale, isolation, and natural beauty.","title":"In may, 1973, in a controversial decision now in the courts, the land use commission agreed to reclassify 22,340 acres of the island of Lanai for urban use.
