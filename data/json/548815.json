{"path":"548815.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up side view of a helicopter in flight, as seen from an external perspective with a dramatic fisheye lens effect that warps the image’s edges into a circular frame. Inside the helicopter’s cockpit, a pilot wearing red headgear and sunglasses can be seen, appearing focused on flying the aircraft.\n\nThe helicopter is white, and on the side, there are visible markings such as \"EXIT RELEASE\" near the door. The fuselage of the helicopter has a fairly curved shape, characteristic of many light civil rotary-wing aircraft, with landing skids visible beneath the body.\n\nThe backdrop features a wide expansive sky that occupies the upper portion of the image, showcasing a deep blue color indicating clear weather conditions. Below the horizon, a dim landscape stretches across the view with subtle details due to the viewing distance and perspective, providing a sense of the helicopter's altitude and operation within a vast environment. The spinning rotor blades are visible at the top of the image, captured in motion, creating a slight blur that conveys the speed of the aircraft.","title":"Helicopter attached to epa's Las Vegas national environmental research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["545645","548899","553786","552365","544737","555835","553787","545642","544771","545638","555825","546688","552372","547533","544741","552393"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","aircraft","headgear","rotor","pilot","cockpit","landing","viewing","blade","perspective"]}
