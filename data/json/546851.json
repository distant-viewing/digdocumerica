{"path":"546851.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a leisurely, familial moment at what appears to be a beach or lakeside setting. The focus is on a woman and a baby, standing in shallow water. The woman, wearing a lime green bikini, is slightly bent over, holding the baby’s hands. The baby, dressed in a white outfit with stripes, is being guided to stand or take steps in the water. A sense of care and interaction between the two is evident in their activity.\n\nIn the background, there are other people partially visible: a woman (on the left) wearing an orange dress or swimsuit, observing them. In the water beyond, there’s a figure in a red cap, suggesting possibly another swimmer or participant in water activities.\n\nThe water appears calm with gentle ripples, indicative of a serene, relatively quiet water body. The sky is overcast, diffusing the natural light and giving the entire scene a soft, muted look. The focus and composition center on the interaction between the woman and the baby, fostering a narrative of family bonding and early life experiences.","title":"Enjoying the water at Sandy Point State Park","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548793","552975","556293","544230","548699","543515","548805","553449","552702","543499","551544","547727","548794","549105","543530","548465"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["baby","woman","bonding","swimmer","water","swimsuit","lakeside","care","participant","interaction"]}
