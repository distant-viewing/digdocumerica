{"path":"551080.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image depicts a lush garden setting with a mountainous backdrop under a clear blue sky. Two people, a woman and a man, are immersed in a gardening activity. The woman, wearing a white t-shirt and sunglasses with her hair tied back, is bent over, examining or working on something within the dense green foliage. The man, also in a casual white t-shirt, is kneeling beside her, seemingly engaged in a close discussion or observing the same task. They are surrounded by tall, dense plants, making the garden look very green and vibrant. In the background, beyond the greenery, a series of utility poles line up, leading to the gentle slopes of the hills in the distance, enhancing the rural feel of the scene. Overall, the photograph captures a serene moment of collaboration and nature.","title":"Picking vegetables for the table","placename":"Charleston (W.
