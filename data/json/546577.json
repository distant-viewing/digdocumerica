{"path":"546577.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a significant urban area characterized by prominent landmarks and a well-structured road network. In the foreground, a complex intersection of roads with circulating traffic is visible, which includes a series of ramps and curved driving lanes.\n\nJust beyond the intersection, the Lincoln Memorial is central and prominent. It's an imposing, white, classical building with numerous columns, positioned on an elevated platform. Further in the distance, aligned perfectly with the Lincoln Memorial along the National Mall, stands the tall and slender Washington Monument. This obelisk is a notable focal point in the vista and is surrounded by a large, open grassy area.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a scenic view of the Potomac River, providing a natural boundary in the landscape. Across the river, various buildings and green areas can be seen, with the horizon stretching wide under a mostly cloudy sky, suggesting a vast urban landscape.\n\nThis panoramic view encapsulates important symbols of American history and is likely taken from a high vantage point that allows a comprehensive overview of this section of Washington, D.C.","title":"Looking east to Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool Washington Memorial","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546585","547267","546737","546674","546741","546692","546679","547268","546570","547228","546584","546693","547226","546717","546613","546740"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["intersection","ramp","overview","vista","symbol","point","landmark","history","view","road"]}
