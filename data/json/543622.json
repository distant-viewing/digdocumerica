{"path":"543622.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up of a young plant, specifically seeming to be a sprouting bulb. The main subject is centrally positioned, dramatically filling the frame with detailed focus. The budding bulb is topped with a darker brown cap that is textured and slightly glossy, possibly indicating moisture or a mucus-like coating. Emerging from beneath this cap are several slender, elongated, green leaves arranged in a radial pattern around a sleek, translucent stalk.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, drawing focus to the plant, and showing indistinct hints of brown earth tones which suggest a natural, outdoor setting with fertile soil. Close to the base of the plant, a few grains of soil can be identified, accenting the otherwise smooth surface of the earth.\n\nNo human activity or other objects disrupt the intimate study of this young plant's development, which suggests themes of growth, nature, and possibly the start of a new life cycle during early spring. The image exudes a sense of quiet, focusing entirely on the botanical subject.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542573","553361","557617","555053","555004","555667","555055","558077","552111","557593","555039","544875","543852","557625","542610","555548"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["bulb","plant","cap","subject","soil","earth","cycle","stalk","grain","close"]}
