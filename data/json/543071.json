{"path":"543071.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a coastal scene with a strong emphasis on the contrasting elements of nature and domesticated animals. Focusing on the composition, the image features three white horses trudging along a sandy shoreline. These horses, painted in a pearly white hue and adorned with saddles, appear to be unaccompanied by riders and are guided by an unseen force, possibly just meandering or being directed by an off-camera individual.\n\nThe terrain is a wide expanse of sand with varying textures, distinguishing damp and dry patches. Spread across the beach are several large and small rocks, which provide a contrast to the otherwise smooth sandy surface. One notably large rock stands prominent in the midground, vertically elongated and bearing the rugged marks of coastal erosion.\n\nThe backdrop is characterized by a steep, rocky cliff that dominates one side of the frame, casting shadows over part of the beach and suggesting the proximity of a potentially towering seaside ridge or mountain. The color palette of the environment shifts from the sandy beige of the beach to the darker, rustic tones of the cliff, instilling a sense of varied natural elements at play.\n\nThe ambience evoked is serene, yet somewhat desolate, capturing a moment of quietude in nature interrupted only by the gentle trek of the horses. The overall scene presents a tranquil yet slightly melancholic atmosphere, ideal for reflective observation.","title":"Horsemen ride in moonlight","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542956","542806","542800","542885","543014","542966","542972","542622","551229","542810","544308","552501","543287","557186","543726","555400"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["horse","beach","cliff","saddle","seaside","shift","quietude","rider","beige","mark"]}
