{"path":"552153.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial harbor area. The image prominently features a dark blue body of water, with several large docks and ships in and around it. One central focal point is a large cluster of what appear to be logs or timber loosely formed into several circular formations floating on the water. These log booms are gathered near the docks and ships, which are likely involved in the transportation or processing of these logs.\n\nOn the left side of the image, adjacent to a dock, there is a sizable industrial complex with multiple large, cube-shaped buildings. These buildings are diverse in color, featuring shades of off-white, light gray, and red. Numerous smaller structures and vehicles can be seen around the buildings, suggesting active industrial operations.\n\nTo the right and left of the harbor, the background of the photograph shows a densely built-up urban area with rows of buildings, likely residential, laid out in a grid pattern. This includes streets lined with what appears to be houses and small commercial buildings. The streets run parallel and perpendicular to each other, creating a very organized town layout.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a bustling industrial scene bordered by a residential area, highlighting a blend of industrial and urban environments typically seen in a harbor city. The clear skies and visibility in the image suggest it was taken on a day with good weather, enhancing the vivid colors and details of the area.","title":"Everett harbor: rafted logs, loading log ship, and scott pulp mill","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552215","555766","546359","552132","549472","551609","555773","555724","552170","555806","552207","555760","552008","552214","555814","547998"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["harbor","dock","logs","ship","building","boom","timber","street","adjacent","processing"]}
