{"path":"551350.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene centered around a group of people in a small boat on a calm river. The boat, which appears to be a simple, metal rowboat with an outboard motor, is occupied by four individuals wearing casual outdoor attire, including hats. Most of them seem engaged in fishing, as one can spot fishing rods.\n\nThe river itself is surrounded by lush, dense foliage primarily consisting of green trees that reflect slightly on the surface of the water, highlighting the calmness of the scene. The sunlight appears to be bright, casting vivid reflections and creating a sparkling effect on the water's surface.\n\nIn the foreground, a rocky outcrop is visible, partially covered by water, which suggests either a small waterfall or rapids are nearby. This creates a bubbly, white foam on the water, adding a dynamic contrast to the otherwise tranquil water in the background where the boat is located.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its natural setting and leisure activity, evokes a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere, typical of a warm, sunny day spent enjoying nature and perhaps engaging in fishing.","title":"Fishermen in the ha ha tonka region, an area of unusual interest and beauty on the niangua arm of the lake of the ozarks three miles south of camdenton.
