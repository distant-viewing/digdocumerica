{"path":"553174.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a figure made from sculpted material such as paper mâché, seated on a bench in an urban setting. The figure wears a red shirt, blue jeans, and a brown hat, accessorized with a small American flag sticking out from the hatband. The face of the figure is intricately crafted with visible text and image clippings, suggesting it might be covered in newspaper or a similar printed material. The figure's hands also appear to be made from the same newspaper-like material, with one hand resting on the figure’s lap and the other hanging by its side.\n\nThe background includes architectural elements such as buildings and a parking structure, indicative of a cityscape. The buildings are modern, with straight lines and what appears to be metal or stone facades. The lighting is harsh, likely suggesting the photograph was taken during a bright, sunny day. The strong shadow on the figure and the ground further emphasizes the brightness of the day.\n\nOverall, the composition and the use of the American flag element introduce a thematic layer, potentially touching on themes of patriotism, commentary on social issues, or public art in urban spaces.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: sculptured figure at the student art show, a part of the elder high school's 50th anniversary celebration","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553175","550188","553281","551830","558132","553163","552751","546445","553090","551646","552736","546520","553769","556153","553240","551922"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["figure","newspaper","flag","material","patriotism","sculpt","accessorize","commentary","introduce","art"]}
