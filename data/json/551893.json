{"path":"551893.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph appears to have been taken inside a subway or train station, depicting a scene bustling with activity and a number of commuters. At the foreground, there are several turnstile gates labeled with the letter \"E,\" indicating entry points through which people are passing. These turnstiles look metallic and functional, set up to manage the flow of passengers.\n\nOn the right, there's a woman in a white coat who seems to be either entering or preparing to insert a ticket into one of the turnstiles. She is carrying a handbag, and her posture suggests she might be in mid-movement or pausing to find her ticket.\n\nThe interior space is expansive, with a low ceiling lined with long fluorescent lights which brighten the area. Beyond the turnstiles, the area opens up into a wider hall where various other passengers are scattered about. Some are walking purposefully, possibly towards their platform, while others seem to be milling around or waiting.\n\nIn terms of attire, the people shown are wearing light jackets and coats, suggesting it might be a cooler season. The age range varies, with both younger and older adults visible. The environment suggests a typical busy day with people going about their routines.\n\nThe station itself has a dated look, reflecting architectural and design choices from a few decades ago, possibly the 70s or 80s. The overall ambiance is fairly subdued with neutral color tones, predominantly shades of beige and grey, common in public transit areas designed more for function than aesthetics.","title":"Entrance to Marienplatz station--no turnstiles--just the \"E\" box to punch time and date on ticket.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551890","551886","556819","556815","556054","556682","551887","551879","556818","556823","556677","556680","556821","556697","551883","556779"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["ticket","passenger","coat","station","80","handbag","70","commuter","entry","hall"]}
