{"path":"554867.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a single brown horse with a dark mane and tail, grazing on grass beside a rustic barbed wire fence. The horse has a saddle on its back and is outfitted with a bridle, suggesting it was recently ridden or is about to be ridden. The saddle seems to be of a Western style, commonly used for working with cattle or other ranch activities.\n\nThe horse is positioned close to the camera, filling most of the frame. It stands in a grassy area, and its head is lowered as it nibbles at the grass near the ground. The background shows a natural landscape, featuring green grass and trees under a bright blue sky, hinting at a rural or wild setting.\n\nThe fence next to which the horse stands appears somewhat worn and is constructed of wooden posts connected by several strands of barbed wire, adding a rustic feel to the scene. This type of fencing is typical in ranching or rural areas to contain livestock.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene moment suggesting rural life and the companionship between a horse and its rider, set in a natural, pastoral environment.","title":"Saddle horse nibbling grass, awaiting the return of its owner in the area of Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["543726","554161","551229","542622","557186","549198","547424","552501","552562","543787","552564","544290","553118","544308","542972","542805"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","saddle","ride","wire","grass","ranching","bridle","lower","mane","fence"]}
