{"path":"551597.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and thoughtful scene involving two fish and a woman, all positioned behind the glass of an aquarium. The main focus is on three black fish with distinctive fin patterns and scales; they are swimming in an aquarium tank that fills the frame. Their details are sharp and clear, showing off their textured bodies and delicate fins.\n\nThe woman, who appears behind the aquarium glass, is slightly blurred and out of the main focus. She has a gentle and contemplative expression, her gaze intently directed towards a point presumably within the aquarium, possibly observing the fish. Her facial features are soft, and she has dark hair that frames her face. The glass distorts and somewhat magnifies her features, adding an interesting visual effect to the composition.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, with warm, muted colors that suggest an indoor setting, providing a calm and tranquil ambiance. The lighting is subtle and provides a soft illumination to the entire scene, enhancing the reflective and introspective mood captured in the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully combines elements of nature and human interaction, using the tank's glass as a medium to explore perspectives, focus, and reflection.","title":"National water quality laboratory","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["548713","551596","551589","546313","543189","549346","548073","553258","543260","548717","551473","545165","555556","546779","546319","548716"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fin","fish","glass","tank","distort","medium","swim","explore","illumination","woman"]}
