{"path":"548377.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene with a focus on environmental impact and industrial architecture. In the foreground, two large smokestacks dominate the image, with smoke visibly emitting from one of them, suggesting active industrial processes. The smokestacks are part of a larger industrial complex that includes multiple buildings and structures equipped with piping and other functional apparatus.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is an expanse of what appears to be a parking area with a few parked vehicles, and a road that curves around the buildings. This portion of the image provides a sense of the scale and operational scope of the industrial complex.\n\nThe background reveals more industrial buildings, some of which are emanating smoke as well, contributing to a haze that blurs parts of the distant landscape. An array of cylindrical storage tanks can be seen, which are typically used for storing chemicals or processed fluids.\n\nOverall, the view is comprehensive, showing both the functional components of the industrial operations and the environmental impact visible through smoke emissions. The atmosphere of the photograph may raise concerns about air quality and industrial pollution.","title":"Consolidated Edison smoke stacks in Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548376","550981","548336","549967","557373","551567","551034","550176","546908","557225","551054","550177","546141","547137","550868","557214"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","smokestack","complex","scope","fluid","impact","piping","apparatus","concern","emission"]}
