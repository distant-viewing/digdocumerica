{"path":"543589.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene tarnished by human waste, illustrating a troubling instance of environmental pollution. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of discarded appliances and broken parts scattered over a grassy surface. The collection includes various old-fashioned, bulky items, such as washing machines, ovens, and refrigerators, along with smaller mechanical scraps and objects, most of which have become rusted or stripped to some degree. This suggests the debris has been exposed to the elements for some time.\n\nThe background contrasts starkly with the cluttered foreground, showcasing a serene and untouched natural landscape. Towering pine trees fill the scene, stretching upward into a clear sky. The calmness and purity of the nature in the background emphasize the disruptive and harmful presence of the garbage in the natural setting. This juxtaposition likely serves to highlight the impact of human carelessness on natural environments, urging viewers to reflect on the importance of responsible waste management and environmental preservation.","title":"Trash dumped in field","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["551247","552089","550352","550799","551440","544298","550687","543684","557307","552098","555228","543765","544637","543676","550801","552100"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["waste","refrigerator","washing","instance","appliance","preservation","degree","scrap","importance","calmness"]}
