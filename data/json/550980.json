{"path":"550980.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, yet dynamic river scene where flooding appears to have submerged the surrounding vegetation. At the center of the image, two individuals are seen paddling in a small, dark-colored canoe amidst the expansive, shimmering surface of the water, which reflects the light, giving it a silvery sheen. The river is wide and its currents are visible through the texture and movement of the water.\n\nThe background shows more fully submerged trees and bushes, suggesting that the water level is significantly higher than usual. These partially submerged trees add a sense of tranquility and a natural obstacle course for the canoeists. The entire scene is bathed in natural light, likely indicative of a sunny day, which contrasts with the potentially perilous situation brought on by the flood.\n\nThe composition focuses on the interaction between humans and nature, emphasizing adaptability and the serene beauty of a flooded landscape. Although the environment suggests a challenging situation due to the flooding, there is a peaceful coexistence visible in the moment captured, highlighting both the resilience and the vulnerability of the subjects within their surroundings.","title":"The mouth of the Kanawha River at Gauley Bridge, where Gauley and New River meet to form the Kanawha.","placename":"Charleston (W.
