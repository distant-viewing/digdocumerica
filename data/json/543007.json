{"path":"543007.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and somewhat industrial landscape under hazy or smoggy lighting conditions. On the left side of the image, there are large structures that resemble cooling towers associated with an industrial plant or power station. These towers are large, conical, and have machinery and metal frameworks visible around them, suggesting heavy industrial activity.\n\nThe center and right portions of the image are dominated by a series of utility poles stretching towards the horizon, following the perspective line provided by railway tracks. The utility poles are evenly spaced and feature multiple crossbeams and wires, which create a network of lines across the photograph.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is misty, contributing to a moody and somewhat eerie effect, with the background bathed in a soft, diffused light. This haze partially obscures the details of any farther buildings or landscape features, focusing the viewer's attention on the silhouettes of the towers and the stark lines of the utility poles and wires.\n\nThe ground along the railway tracks appears damp or wet, reflecting some light and adding to the overall ambience of the scene. There are no visible people or moving vehicles, which enhances the stillness and possibly the desolation of the scene. The overall color tone is a monochrome or sepia-like hue, which emphasizes the vintage or timeless quality of the image.","title":"Wood chip burners in smog","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543006","547940","550982","550867","550183","550168","557375","557220","551030","548850","545239","550181","549965","544035","557374","543728"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["utility","tower","pole","railway","wire","track","line","ambience","desolation","stillness"]}
