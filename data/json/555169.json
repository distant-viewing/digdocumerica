{"path":"555169.jpg","date":"January 1966","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a man standing inside a cavernous and hollowed-out tree trunk. The tree itself appears to be of colossal size, with the internal walls showing rich, dark brown colors and smooth textures that indicate the wood might be wet or polished. The contrast between the dark and the inner, lighter red layers of wood brings out a dramatic and natural tableau. Patches of light filter through from the top and the sides, creating a naturally lit spotlight effect around the man.\n\nThe man, standing in the center of the frame, appears to be in middle age, and is dressed casually in a denim jacket over a patterned shirt. He is looking upwards and seems to be pointing or reaching out towards the light or an unseen object above him. His stance and gesture convey a sense of exploration or discovery, aligning well with the mysterious and wondrous environment of the hollow tree.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the grandeur and scale of the tree as compared to the human figure, highlighting nature's immense scale and beauty. The subdued lighting, aside from enhancing the mood, also casts engaging shadows and highlights across the scene, enriching the visual texture of the image.","title":"Raw material at Macmillan-Bloedel, Ltd., in Port Alberni, Vancouver Island, Canada.
