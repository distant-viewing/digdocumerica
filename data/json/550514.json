{"path":"550514.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic aerial view of a mountainous landscape covered in snow. The mountains are sharply defined, with steep, rugged ridges and valleys, and their peaks are blanketed in a thick layer of white snow, indicating a high-altitude environment. The terrain is largely barren and inhospitable, with no visible vegetation or wildlife. Sunlight illuminates portions of the mountain slopes, creating a striking contrast with the deep shadows cast in the crevices and lower areas.\n\nThere are clouds scattered in the sky, some hovering close to the mountain peaks, adding a misty, ethereal quality to the scene. In the background, the landscape transitions into darker, more shadowed areas, which suggests that the terrain continues to be mountainous and complex.\n\nThere is a visible deep valley or gorge cutting through part of the mountains, suggesting the presence of a river or glacial path carved into the landscape over time. The overall composition of the photograph displays a powerful, raw natural beauty, highlighting the majestic and overwhelming scale of the mountain environment.","title":"The snow-covered north ridge of table mountain appears in the foreground of this western view across the dietrich river valley.
