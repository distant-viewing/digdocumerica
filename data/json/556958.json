{"path":"556958.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene bathed in the glow of early morning or late afternoon sunlight. The image features two horses in a grassy field; one is a larger dark-colored horse standing prominently in the foreground, while the other is a smaller horse, possibly a foal, which is grazing nearby. The landscape is dotted with scattered trees and shrubs, adding touches of green and autumn hues to the setting.\n\nIn the background, modestly distanced from the horses, there is a two-story traditional farmhouse. It is a white wooden building with a steep pitched roof, surrounded by rustic wooden fencing that blends into the rural setting. Behind this house, and slightly elevated on a hill, we can see another house partially obscured by the surrounding trees, suggesting a small community or a cluster of farm buildings typical in rural settings.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is peaceful and pastoral, with the soft sunlight filtering through branches, creating a warm and inviting tone over the landscape. The quiet nature of the scene suggests a slow, leisurely pace of life, typical of a rural farm setting.","title":"Horses are seen in a pasture in front of the \"first generation (white house)\" of Jerri Fisher. He lives in the countryside near Poulso. Beyond the white house is his \"second generation\" home. These houses are in an area which will be affected by population growth when the navy's proposed Trident submarine base is built nearby.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["542622","542619","552562","542972","552501","557186","556586","551327","556957","551229","543726","554161","545890","545894","542916","542801"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","farm","farmhouse","pace","fencing","house","dark","sunlight","autumn","glow"]}
