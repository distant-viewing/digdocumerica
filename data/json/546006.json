{"path":"546006.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial area, prominently featuring a large building complex with several layers of flat roofs and a row of four vertical smokestacks projecting upward. The building is predominantly beige with dark windows. In the foreground are numerous wooden pilings sticking out of a water body, appearing weathered and partially submerged, suggesting a dilapidated pier or dock. The shore is visible, characterized by muddy terrain and scattered debris, possibly coal or other industrial materials.\n\nOn the left of the building, there is a visible structure resembling a small tanker or storage container with red markings, possibly for fuel or chemicals. The environment around the building includes other smaller structures, indicative of an industrial site with various operational sections.\n\nThe sky is reasonably clear with a few clouds, suggesting a fair weather day. The overall setting is coastal, with human-made structures dominating the view and very minimal natural landscape visible. The scene portrays a sense of industrial activity, possibly in decline given the state of the pier and the surrounding debris.","title":"Yellow material in foreground is the remains of sulphur stockpiles at the Freeport Co. sulphur mine on Lake GRande Ecaille.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546083","555769","546087","555776","548423","545987","548340","550868","551994","551183","551566","549508","551998","544999","552135","543000"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pier","tanker","piling","decline","fuel","debris","coal","building","marking","chemical"]}
