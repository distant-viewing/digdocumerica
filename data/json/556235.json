{"path":"556235.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a tender family moment featuring a man, a woman, and a young child, presumably their daughter. The three individuals are closely grouped together, illuminated warmly under soft lighting that suggests an indoor or nighttime setting.\n\nThe woman, positioned on the left, exhibits a pleasant smile and is dressed in a bright green sleeveless top. She has short, curly hair styled into an afro, indicative of the popular hairstyles from past decades. The child, held centrally between the two adults, is a toddler wearing a pale cream dress adorned with delicate embroidery and a bow in her hair, echoing the same shade as her dress.\n\nThe man, on the right, holds the child gently from the side and gazes directly at the camera with a calm expression. He wears a casual-formal outfit consisting of a checkered shirt under a herringbone blazer, reflecting a relaxed yet polished look.\n\nIn the backdrop, subtle out-of-focus lights hint at a public or communal space, possibly a restaurant or a reception hall, contributing to the serene and joyous atmosphere of the photograph. The family's close arrangement and comforting expressions convey a strong sense of unity and affection.","title":"Black family at the church of the messiah on Chicago's south side for the baby's baptism","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557368","556561","558405","553496","556593","552612","551934","557898","556531","556173","543863","547398","558292","557353","556525","551027"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["child","family","unity","affection","afro","toddler","echo","restaurant","hall","nighttime"]}
