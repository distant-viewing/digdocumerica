{"path":"551954.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a gloomy, overcast scene at an industrial waterfront setting. It features multiple large cranes, tall transmission towers, and other industrial structures. Near the right side of the image, there appears to be a docked barge, indicating that this might be a shipping or cargo area. Notably, the foreground shows an expansive flat surface, which could be the deck of another ship or a pier, lined by railings and what appears to be small puddles of water, reflecting a recent rain.\n\nThe dark, overcast sky suggests it might be either early morning or approaching evening, contributing to the somber mood of the scene. Additionally, there are no visible people or moving activity in the photo, enhancing the still and quiet atmosphere of the industrial setup. The body of water is calm, reinforcing the overall serene yet melancholy ambiance. The composition uses a wide, panoramic angle that captures a sense of scale and the industrial nature of the waterfront.","title":"Seaman on lead barge indicates clearance as tug pushes barges toward open railroad trestle and Lake Michigan.
