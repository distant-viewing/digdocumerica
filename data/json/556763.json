{"path":"556763.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a young girl walking beside a railway track. It appears to be a sunny day, enhancing the vibrant green colors in the scene. The girl, with long blonde hair, is dressed in a green and white checked dress and a cream-colored cardigan. She wears white shoes and a floral hat, suggesting a somewhat formal or vintage style, possibly from mid-20th century.\n\nThe girl is carrying a sort of satchel or bag, hinting she might be on a journey or returning from an event or day at school. Her attention is directed down towards something in her hand, possibly a ticket or a small book.\n\nThe railway setting includes multiple tracks, indicating this might be a fairly busy junction. There's a platform visible adjacent to one of the tracks, equipped with a few standard lamps. Trees and shrubbery can be seen in the background, alongside a utility pole, contributing to a semi-urban setting. A train car, particularly a freight car, is visible on a parallel track, adding industrial elements to the otherwise tranquil setting.\n\nThe combination of natural and man-made elements and the depiction of a lone figure in this environment creates a contemplative mood, maybe suggesting themes of travel, youth, or solitude.","title":"Passenger crosses tracks to catch the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) commuter train for downtown Philadelphia.

Improvements in service and fringe parking have helped. SEPTA has an operating budget of $180 million. Half of it comes from fares, the remainder from state and local governments.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552763","555990","556588","552961","557964","556548","556782","556091","550790","556541","556041","546563","556856","555981","556837","556490"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","girl","railway","junction","ticket","cardigan","youth","freight","school","journey"]}
