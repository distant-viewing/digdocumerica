{"path":"543813.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set in a natural landscape. In the foreground, the terrain is covered with lush greenery, including trees and shrubs in various green shades, capturing a sense of rural or less urbanized terrain.\n\nIn the middle ground, the landscape becomes more developed and forms a transition to the industrial area. A river or stream meanders through the middle, surrounded by grassy banks, before leading to an industrial complex.\n\nThe industrial complex, which occupies the mid to background of the image, includes several large buildings and smokestacks, from which white smoke is billowing into the sky. The structures are predominantly gray and metallic, with some storage tanks visible. Adjacent to the complex, various infrastructure elements such as roads and possibly some smaller buildings or installations can be seen.\n\nOverall, the image presents a contrast between the industrial activities, marked by the factory and smoke emissions, and the surrounding natural environment, suggesting themes of industry versus nature, possibly implying environmental impacts or the encroachment of industrial development into natural landscapes. The lighting suggests it might be either morning or late afternoon, given the soft sunlight casting across the scene.","title":"Rural electric administration power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["557225","554630","551156","545996","557377","543011","545053","545989","551026","551567","546073","547539","545013","550997","550694","545112"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["complex","encroachment","smoke","become","installation","emission","meander","billow","terrain","stream"]}
