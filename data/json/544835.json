{"path":"544835.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph features a man in a work environment. He appears to be middle-aged with a square jaw, wearing a silver hard hat labeled with the number \"2\". He's dressed in a long-sleeve, plaid, button-up shirt in tones of red and white, and faded blue denim jeans. His outfit is completed with a dark brown belt and what looks like a set of work gloves. He's holding onto a thick rope, connected to a large metal box which appears to be slightly rusted and worn, indicating it might be a piece of heavy equipment or machinery used in his work.\n\nThe man is standing in front of what looks like a section of a large vehicle or machinery, which has a shiny black surface and is rich in complex metallic parts, suggesting an industrial setting. His posture and facial expression imply readiness and attentiveness, possibly taking a short break from his tasks or preparing to move the metal box.\n\nThe background is out of focus, providing all attention to the worker and his immediate surroundings. The setting suggests a bright sunny day, given the harsh shadows and bright lighting in the image. This element, along with the man's gear, underlines the outdoor, hands-on nature of his occupation.","title":"Working on 6th avenue west development in west Denver (jefferson county)","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["547163","544171","556391","553618","542497","555239","542783","556155","553603","556320","554953","556315","556903","554441","556867","544105"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["box","occupation","work","attentiveness","machinery","readiness","complete","glove","silver","underline"]}
