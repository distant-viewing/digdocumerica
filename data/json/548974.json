{"path":"548974.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a stunning natural landscape, likely observed from an elevated position or a flying device. The image prominently features a large water body, possibly a lake, showing dark waters surrounded by vibrant green aquatic vegetation which makes the water appear patchy in places. Along the edge of the water, dense shrubs or small trees cluster in irregular formations, distinct against the waterâ€™s dark background.\n\nBeyond this immediate aquatic environment, the landscape transitions into a broad plain dotted sporadically with similar green vegetation. This grassy area gradually gives way to rugged terrain, consisting mainly of dry, arid land with brownish colors, which suggests a desert or semi-desert environment. Several mountainous formations rise prominently in the background. These mountains are barren and predominantly brown, showing gentle slopes that steepen as they rise.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with water at the forefront and mountains in the distance, creates a contrast between the life-affirming lushness near the water and the harsh barrenness of the mountainous desert terrain. The photo is defined by its rich textures and the interplay of natural colors, conveying a sense of isolation and the sparse beauty of a remote natural landscape.","title":"Las Vegas Wash carries Las Vegas sewage out to Lake Mead","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552902","543761","555712","550400","555705","555683","555695","557533","550397","542882","552904","550641","555388","550601","556926","552426"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["water","desert","formation","lushness","mountain","terrain","device","position","transition","forefront"]}
