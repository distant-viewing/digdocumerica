{"path":"551032.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts three young boys on a dirt road in what appears to be a rural or semi-rural setting. The surroundings include lush greenery and a backdrop of verdant hills, suggesting a summertime scene in a valley. The long road is bordered by dense trees and telephone poles, adding to the rustic atmosphere.\n\nThe boys are positioned at the forefront of the image. The child in the center is shirtless, wearing only shorts that are belted at the waist, and has a light-colored towel draped around his neck, giving him a playful, care-free look. Standing to his left (our right) is another boy who is taller, dressed in a plaid shirt and trousers, who has his left hand on the shoulder of the shirtless boy, suggesting camaraderie or a protective gesture. To the right of the central figure is a third boy, who is slightly shorter, dressed in a brown t-shirt and darker shorts, standing with his hands behind his back and smiling towards the camera, depicting a sense of ease and happiness.\n\nFurther in the background, we see two other children. One is riding a bicycle towards the group, adding a sense of movement and activity to the scene. Another child can be observed walking along the roadside in a white shirt and shorts. Additionally, parked cars and a truck further up the road suggest residential activity and the presence of families in the area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of childhood in a serene, natural setting, filled with a sense of friendship and playful adventure. The presence of various modes of transportation (bicycle, cars) and infrastructure (road, telephone poles) also reflects aspects of rural or suburban American life during the era in which this image was likely captured.","title":"Children play in an unpaved street in Rand.","placename":"Charleston (W.
