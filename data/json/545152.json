{"path":"545152.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a panoramic aerial view of a river landscape, which includes industrial activities along the riverbanks. Primarily, it captures an expansive river meandering through a lush, green valley. Both sides of the river are lined with developed land areas. \n\nOn the right side of the river, there is an industrial facility with several large buildings with gray rooftops. This facility appears to be a lumber mill, as indicated by the presence of numerous stacks of logs neatly arranged in rows. These stacks are prominently visible along the riverfront and within the facility. There is smoke emanating from one of the large buildings, suggesting ongoing industrial processes, and drifting across the river adding a slightly hazy quality to the air in that section.\n\nAcross the river, on the left bank, the area appears predominantly rural with patches of fields, perhaps agricultural, and interspersed with areas of dense trees. A road runs parallel to the river and crosses it via a bridge in the middle foreground of the image. The bridge is modest in size and connects the two sides of the river, facilitating access between the rural and industrial areas.\n\nThe background consists of a range of hills or low mountains, contributing to the scenic quality of the area. The sky is somewhat overcast, diffusing the natural light, and casting soft shadows. This adds a dramatic tone to the landscape, emphasizing the interplay between nature and industrial activity.","title":"Waunna pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542933","551199","551196","550327","551197","551191","550860","557295","550539","546705","551192","551579","552258","551195","552175","551194"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","stack","facility","bridge","lumber","mill","rooftop","quality","access","log"]}
