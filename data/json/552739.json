{"path":"552739.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dense and expansive pile of compressed and stacked old cars in a junkyard. The compacted vehicles exhibit various states of deterioration and damage. The cars, primarily from mid-20th century American makes, are stacked in layers with some parts like grilles, bumpers, and body panels still recognizable. The colors of the cars, though faded, range from whites and rusted browns to blues, greens, and reds, creating a mosaic of automotive history. Their arrangement is tightly packed with no visible ground or sky, suggesting a vast accumulation. The overall effect is both visually chaotic and texturally rich, emphasizing themes of obsolescence and the industrial lifecycle of automobiles.","title":"Stacked cars in city junkyard will be used for scrap","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553005","555492","545365","555491","552738","553004","545340","545303","554348","546268","543166","553006","552999","545545","547476","542656"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["cars","obsolescence","stack","lifecycle","compress","emphasizing","junkyard","compact","deterioration","mosaic"]}
