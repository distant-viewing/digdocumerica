{"path":"551957.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set against an intriguing, somewhat dimly lit background dominated by an old brick building. The building, evident in its weathered and aged appearance, features several windows symmetrically aligned along its facade. Each window is framed by thick, white sills and lintels, contrasting with the dark bricks. Below the bottom row of windows, there's visible deterioration on the building with peeling paint and areas of exposed underlayers.\n\nIn the foreground, a figure is walking beside a churning, frothy body of water, possibly a river or stream. The individual is wearing a red scarf and light-colored coat, distinguishing them from the darker, more subdued environment. Their head is bent downward, suggesting they are either watching their step or deep in thought as they walk along the rocky riverbank.\n\nThe natural setting around the water and building includes some barren shrubs and trees, which contribute to the stark, wintery atmosphere of the image. The natural light is low, indicating that the photo could have been taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. This setting creates a moody and somewhat mysterious tone, emphasizing solitude and perhaps contemplation.","title":"Man recoils from large wave.
