{"path":"548310.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph presents a dynamic outdoor scene involving both technology and human activity along a brown-water river bordered by green foliage and trees. In the foreground, a significant portion of the image is dedicated to a scientific surveying instrument set up on a tripod, suggesting that there is an ongoing survey or some form of environmental study.\n\nTo the left, a small date crew boat is moored on the river. This boat, equipped with a canopy and what appears to be various operational equipment, holds several individuals wearing casual and work attire, reflecting readiness for fieldwork.\n\nIn the middle and right portions of the image, a group of four people are seen on foot on what appears to be a grassy riverbank. Most of them are wearing hard hats, vests, and carrying poles, typical of workers or researchers conducting outdoor or environmental studies. One individual is distinctly noticeable as he carries two long, white poles (possibly measuring tools or equipment components), while another person observes or assists.\n\nMeanwhile, beside the surveyor's instrument in the foreground, a white Chevrolet truck is visible, which also seems equipped with roof-mounted gear, possibly related to the ongoing activity depicted. The truck's license plate and design suggest the image could be from an era around the 1960s to 1980s in the USA.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the photo is one of organized activity, possibly related to environmental monitoring, surveying, or research, taking place in a naturalistic setting that appears serene yet industrially engaged.","title":"Survey team of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Mississippi River levee at Montz.
