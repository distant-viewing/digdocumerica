{"path":"545360.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a twilight scene at a dirt racing track. The track is curved and deeply rutted from the tires of vehicles, indicating frequent use for racing or similar activities. A row of vintage cars, brightly colored in hues of pink, blue, yellow, red, and white, are parked along the edge of the track. It appears they are either positioned for a race or on display, contributing to an atmosphere of an organized car racing event.\n\nThe setting sun casts a dim, warm light over the scene, enhancing the nostalgic ambiance. The sky, though mostly obscured by the timing and lighting, hints at a transition between day and night. There are no visible spectators or significant structures; the emphasis is purely on the cars and the track, suggesting that the photograph is taken from a spectator or participant vantage near the curve of the track, focusing primarily on capturing the lineup of the cars ready for an event.","title":"Albuquerque Speedway Park, one of three stock car race tracks","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["545318","553000","549852","543899","553896","552596","544009","554879","546177","545352","552800","557877","547495","555491","548435","543166"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["racing","track","spectator","car","lineup","timing","race","event","participant","night"]}
