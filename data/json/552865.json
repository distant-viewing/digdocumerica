{"path":"552865.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an oyster harvesting scene. The main focus is a man standing on a wooden deck, surrounded by work equipment and piles of oysters. He is wearing a light-colored fabric hat, a long-sleeve denim shirt, and dark pants secured with a belt. His facial expression is focused, and he is holding onto a heavy chain that is part of the machinery used in oyster farming.\n\nThe deck has visible signs of wear and is littered with both open and closed oyster shells, showing the fruits of the harvest. There are metal structures around, possibly parts of a conveyor system or machinery designed for lifting and sorting the oysters. \n\nIn the background, the open sea or a large body of water can be seen under a blue sky with some fluffy white clouds, suggesting a sunny day, conducive for outdoor work.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment typical of maritime labor, highlighting both the manual labor and the machinery used in the process of oyster harvesting.\n","title":"Lake borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi river flood waters has polluted their oysterbeds.
