{"path":"553379.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor construction scene along a river. The river curving through the scene is bordered by heavily dug-up banks, indicating earth-moving or construction activities. The excavated soil, debris, and exposed rocks are prominent along the riverbanks. In the background, there's a considerably disturbed landscape with large patches of upturned earth and scattered construction equipment. Among the visible equipment, there appears to be machinery like excavators and possibly heavy trucks.\n\nAcross the river, there's a residential area with what looks like houses and smaller buildings, giving a touch of lived-in presence amidst the widespread construction disturbance. The environment around suggests it might be in a rural or semi-rural region, possibly involved in a significant development project or land alteration, such as for mining or redevelopment.\n\nThe vegetation framing the scene includes a few foreground leaves that are sharp against the more subdued colors of the dusty and rocky construction site, highlighting the contrast between the natural environment and human-modified landscape. The image captures a clear day with sunlight, which illuminates the top parts of trees and structures while casting shadows on the dug-up earth, enhancing the depth and texture of the landscape.","title":"Flag brook is being diverted to make way for new sewage treatment plant, an epa assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553380","553392","545858","553353","544282","553932","544943","550673","549255","544812","553350","546403","553375","544438","543112","549169"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["construction","dig","earth","river","modify","excavate","excavator","alteration","equipment","disturbance"]}
