{"path":"543061.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape, likely taken during late afternoon based on the lighting. The composition emphasizes a dramatic cliffside along a coastline. The cliff is steep and rugged, densely covered with evergreen trees and underbrush extending down to where the rock meets the ocean.\n\nThe ocean itself appears somewhat turbulent, with white waves crashing against the rocky base of the cliff. There is a sandy beach visible at the base of the cliff, although it's mostly strewn with large rocks and boulders, suggestive of a more remote or less accessible part of the shore.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a closer view of the cliff edge showing smaller details of the rocky surface and scattered vegetation clinging to it. In the distance, the ocean stretches to the horizon under a clear sky with very few clouds, hinting at open weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of rugged natural beauty typical of rocky coastal regions, untouched and wild, with emphasis on the textures and interplay between land and sea.","title":"Pine Bluff on a foggy morning","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543080","545125","543249","543184","545122","543300","543297","553771","545934","543291","545129","543243","542917","553775","545222","545226"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","base","rock","boulder","emphasis","coastline","interplay","wave","beach"]}
