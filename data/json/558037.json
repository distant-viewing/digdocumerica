{"path":"558037.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, small-town street scene, possibly during the mid to late 20th century, judging by the architecture and vehicles visible. The main focus is on a large, two-story house with a covered porch and white trim, featuring architectural detailing typical of rural American styles from the late 19th or early 20th century. The house displays a sign indicating it might function as a business, named \"The Tavern,\" suggesting it could be a local pub or restaurant.\n\nIn front of the house, there is a paved road with a yellow car driving by, and further down the street, there are additional vehicles parked or in motion. Alongside the road, various signs are observable that could be traffic signs or advertisements, contributing to the feel of a lived-in, active community environment. A series of utility poles with wires strung between them line the street, typical of semi-rural American settings.\n\nOn the right foreground of the image, there's a concrete post with unclear engravings or markings, hinting at some form of roadside information marker or utility infrastructure. The area is lush with greenery; trees are abundant in the background, suggesting the locale might be in a more verdant part of the country.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a sense of quaint, small-town America, with its architectural details and the sleepy ambiance of a less hurried epoch. It serves as a still from a day in the life of a typical American community from a bygone era.","title":"Main street building in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron, houses the post office and a gift shop.
