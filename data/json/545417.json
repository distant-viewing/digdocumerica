{"path":"545417.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up portrait of an elderly man from shoulders up, showing significant signs of aging. The man’s head is turned slightly to his right, providing a side profile view of his face. He has a pale complexion interspersed with freckles and age spots, and his skin shows some wrinkle lines, particularly around his eyes and forehead. His hair is thin, combed back, and light-colored, most likely white or gray.\n\nHis facial expression seems calm with a slight, friendly smile, and his eyes appear to be gazing off to the side, focused on something outside the frame. His right ear is visible and also shows signs of aging. The man’s neckline is deep and exhibits creases and loose skin, typical of advanced age. He is shirtless, which reveals more of his aged skin on his shoulders and upper chest. The texture of his skin and body shows a natural, unidealized depiction of aging.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a plain, nondescript light color, focusing attention entirely on the subject without any distractions. This setup highlights the detailed textures of the man’s skin and the natural aging process. Overall, the photograph carries a mood of softness and candidness, providing an intimate glimpse into the later years of human life.","title":"Damaged lung patient","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556452","543701","552871","556563","548616","553055","552872","552103","547179","547282","556540","554857","545408","557035","554846","544409"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["skin","aging","shoulder","neckline","forehead","comb","complexion","age","distraction","wrinkle"]}
