{"path":"555990.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts an outdoor scene at what appears to be a train station or similar transportation setting. In the foreground, a young child, presumably a girl given the long blonde hair and blue coat trimmed with white fur, is kneeling down towards railway tracks. She seems to be placing or picking up small objects, possibly coins, on the rail, exhibiting a curious and focused demeanor.\n\nStanding to the right and behind the girl is a man, likely in his 30s or 40s, observing the child. He is dressed casually in a dark red collared shirt and blue jeans, with sunglasses hung on the front of his shirt and his hands resting on his hips.\n\nFurther back, slightly out of focus, another young child who looks to be a boy is to the right edge of the scene. He is casually dressed in a green jacket and blue jeans, looking towards the camera with a neutral expression.\n\nThe setting includes a clear blue sky and elements typical of a small train station, such as a rail signal on the extreme left. In the background, buildings with a Southwestern architectural style, possibly indicating a location in the southwestern United States, can be seen. The structures are low-rise and include elements like arched doorways and flat roofs, with one featuring a bell tower or cupola.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is candid and outdoorsy, capturing a moment of everyday life possibly related to travel or a family outing.","title":"A child places pennies on the track at the Albuquerque, New Mexico, train station and will wait for the Southwest Limited to flatten them as a souvenir.
