{"path":"548841.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a beautifully crafted silhouette scene set against a low-light background, likely capturing either dawn or dusk. In the foreground, we see the silhouette of a person who is holding a flag or a similar fabric, which billows in the air, flowing upward to the left. The personâ€™s head is turned upwards, possibly observing or interacting with the scene above.\n\nIn the background, sharply contrasting with the darkened silhouette, there is a biplane illuminated by the backlight of the sun. The biplane is captured mid-flight, and emanating from it are two trails of smoke or vapor streaming downwards. The trails create a striking visual effect, resembling long, white tails trailing the plane.\n\nThe composition is framed in such a way that the plane and the smoke trails form a diagonal line across the top portion of the image, adding dynamism and direction to the entire scene. The overall ambiance is dramatic and serene, emphasizing the interplay between the human element and the spectacle of flight. The use of backlighting emphasizes the contours and movements, making for an impactful visual narrative.\n\nAdditionally, some elements like a structure's edge or railing partially frame the left side of the image, adding to the sense of depth and context to the setting, which suggests the observer might be on a platform or an elevated position.","title":"Crop duster and \"flagman\" near calipatria in the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548884","542500","548881","553873","542506","542496","547721","542501","549072","548215","542499","553832","542577","554674","544491","554421"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["trails","biplane","plane","vapor","backlight","dynamism","silhouette","spectacle","smoke","observer"]}
