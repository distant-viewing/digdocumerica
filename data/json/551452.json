{"path":"551452.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photo captures a young couple walking hand in hand along a street. The man wears a slightly unbuttoned, blue denim shirt over a tank top, paired with blue jeans and a black belt with a large buckle. His hair is long, blonde, and unkempt, and he has a full beard and mustache. The woman sports a deep purple, form-fitting, sleeveless top and high-waisted blue jeans, also held by a black belt with a conspicuous buckle. She has medium-length blonde hair that is somewhat disheveled, and she looks forward with a serious expression.\n\nThey both exhibit a rugged, somewhat nonconformist style typical of a 1970s counterculture aesthetic. In the background, reddish-brown brick structures possibly suggest the setting is a town or small city street. The ambiance of the setting is casual with an overcast sky, lending a subdued tone to the image. The photo communicates a sense of youthful defiance or independence, underscored by their attire and serious demeanors.","title":"Oasis in the city--block square park at East 5th and Market streets","placename":"Saint Paul (Minn.)","location":"Saint Paul, Minnesota","nn1":["551820","549324","550106","549925","551301","551426","554852","553279","545415","549756","551124","557285","555904","547834","544408","556493"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["buckle","belt","unbutton","jean","mustache","hair","beard","street","communicate","hand"]}
