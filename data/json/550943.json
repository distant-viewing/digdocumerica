{"path":"550943.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a gentle, silhouetted moment between an adult and a child, likely a father and daughter, standing in front of a luminous and abstractly patterned background that resembles a multitude of shimmering light orbs. The adult male, wearing a casual short-sleeved shirt and shorts, is turned slightly towards the child, bending over to engage closely with her. Beside him, the young girl, attired in a dark dress or top and lighter shorts, appears to hold an object, possibly a toy or a small bag, as she looks up towards the adult.\n\nThe enchanting quality of the light in the background creates a bokeh effect, where circles of light are blurred to form a dreamlike and out-of-focus pattern. This artistic choice adds a whimsical and almost magical atmosphere to the scene. The figures, shown in silhouette against this bright backdrop, contribute to a sense of intimacy and wonder, encapsulating a moment of shared connection or discovery. The overall composition and the interplay of light and shadow make the photograph both striking and tender.","title":"Father with little girl on a crabbing expedition on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543866","543863","551473","556607","556299","556144","556235","556294","556527","553536","553094","547135","553496","556561","553543","558186"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["adult","short","father","orb","discovery","wonder","toy","child","intimacy","circle"]}
