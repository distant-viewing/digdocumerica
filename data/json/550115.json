The image shows a row of attached buildings with different architectural styles and colors which add to the variety and vibrancy of the scene. \n\nStarting from the left, the first building is a large, three-story structure made of light-colored stone. It features a classical porch with a prominent white column, supporting a balcony that protrudes over the entrance. Two individuals can be seen standing at the doorway.\n\nNext to this building is a three-story brick townhouse with a small American flag hanging perpendicular to the building. The roof is green metal with a slight peak, and the facade features multiple windows outlined in white.\n\nTo the right of this, there is another three-story townhouse with a similar structure but painted in a deeper brick red, also sporting green metallic roofing. The ground level includes a white-framed shop window and door, and another small American flag hangs on the facade.\n\nFurther right, the subsequent building’s facade is painted in pastel yellow with white door and window frames. This building also features a green metal roof and a flag, underlining a patriotic theme seen across several buildings.\n\nAt street level, there is a variety of decoration including potted plants and well-maintained flowerbeds that contribute to the streetscape's attractiveness. Each building also features stylish streetlamps that match the historical feel.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small street vendor cart, complete with a red and white striped umbrella, suggesting a place that serves refreshments or snacks. A solitary figure interacts with the vendor at the cart.\n\nClear skies above suggest it’s a sunny day, and overall, the street exudes a well-kept, inviting ambiance. The presence of people and a vendor's cart adds a sense of liveliness and community activity.","title":"'Bonne Bell Cosmetics' restoration program transformed a decaying business section of suburban Lakewood into this attractive \"Georgetown Row\" of shops'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550107","557656","543360","550031","551778","549659","551790","558030","551686","546440","558118","546428","550114","555920","549974","550111"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["vendor","cart","townhouse","flag","facade","building","street","story","flowerbed","streetscape"]}
