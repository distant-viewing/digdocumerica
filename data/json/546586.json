{"path":"546586.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures an aerial night-time view of a bustling highway system. The photograph is characterized by a winding, busy road illuminated by the headlights of numerous vehicles. The road is lined with multiple lanes, and the traffic is dense, showing a mix of both moving and stationary vehicles that create a flow of white and red lightsâ€”a typical indication of active traffic moving in both directions.\n\nThe surrounding environment is dark, suggesting that the picture is taken either late at night or before sunrise. Fleeting lights and shadows hint at a landscape possibly containing trees, buildings, or other structures, but these are not distinctly visible due to the low light conditions. There is a brighter area on the upper left part of the image where more intense lighting outlines what seems to be a more densely developed area, possibly a commercial or a residential hub.\n\nThis high-angle perspective provides a panoramic view of the traffic and the road layout, emphasizing the connectivity and the dynamic movement typically seen in urban or suburban settings during peak traffic hours. The overall composition of the photograph, with its curved lines of the road and the streams of light from the vehicles, creates a vivid display of nighttime urban activity.","title":"Rush hour traffic, 4:30 to 6:30 pm.
