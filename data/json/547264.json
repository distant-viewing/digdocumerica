{"path":"547264.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph features a scenic aerial view of a landscaped area. In the foreground, there is a large body of water with a notable brownish hue, likely due to sediment. Prominently placed in this water is a gazebo-style structure with a pointed roof, supported by a pier extending from the shore. Adjacent to this water body and pier, thereâ€™s a neatly arranged landscaped area with trees that appear to be in an early stage of bloom, suggesting that the season could be early spring.\n\nMoving towards the midground, there are several houses with traditional architecture, surrounded by lush green lawns and multiple aligning and standalone trees. The arrangement of the landscape and buildings suggests a well-maintained residential area, possibly a suburban or semi-rural setting.\n\nIn the background, the landscape transitions into a denser and more varied assortment of trees and foliage, indicating a natural or less manicured environment. The horizon is flat, with no significant elevation changes, supporting the semi-rural setting theory. The sky is clear, adding a bright and clear quality to the entire scene, emphasizing the colors and details of the landscape and architecture.","title":"Aerial view of mt.  Vernon.
