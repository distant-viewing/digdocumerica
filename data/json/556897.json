{"path":"556897.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a group of railway workers actively engaged in maintenance work on a railroad track. The image shows four men, all wearing safety helmets in different colors (blue, orange, and white), focused on the task at hand. They are bending over and using tools, possibly to repair or inspect the railway tracks.\n\nThe scene occurs during the daytime as suggested by the clear sky and the bright daylight illuminating the scene. Each worker is dressed in heavy-duty clothing suitable for manual labor; some are wearing gloves, and all are in long pants and long-sleeved shirts or jackets.\n\nIn the background, to the left of the image, there is heavy railway maintenance equipment, including a large orange machine that appears to be mounted on train tracks. This machine likely supports the maintenance work being done.\n\nBehind the workers, the railroad tracks extend into the distance, framed by scrubland and some low vegetation, under a broad and lightly clouded sky. This setting appears to be in a rural or semi-rural area given the natural landscape surrounding the railway. The inclusion of utility poles along the tracks adds to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThis photograph not only depicts the physical efforts involved in maintaining railway infrastructure but also the collaborative nature of the work, emphasizing teamwork and skill in the face of physically demanding tasks.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew jack up a rail. They are removing old ties and replacing them with new ones while improving the roadbed. The maximum safe speed for virtually all the company's 10,531 miles of track is 60 miles per hour. That contrasts with another company which had some track with a safe speed maximum of eight miles per hour. In 1974 Southern spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556881","556859","556871","556012","556869","556895","556898","556883","556894","556884","556862","556899","556872","556875","556874","556901"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["railway","track","worker","maintenance","railroad","machine","work","task","skill","inclusion"]}
