{"path":"542737.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up scene of a person, likely a scientist or lab technician, engrossed in meticulously handling lab equipment. The individual, shown from a side profile, appears concentrated on the task at hand. This person is wearing a white lab coat, suggesting a scientific or medical environment.\n\nThe person is working with several clear glass vials, which are being extracted or placed into a labeled tray filled with numerous compartments, each housing similar vials. This tray occupies the central portion of the image. The technician is using a pipette, indicating the measurement or transfer of liquid substances, which is a common activity in lab settings requiring precision.\n\nThe setting appears industrious yet ordinary for a laboratory, with blurred background elements that vaguely resemble other lab equipment and counters, enhancing the focus on the meticulous task being performed. The image is tinged with a vintage or analog quality, indicated by its color tone and grain, suggesting it might have been taken several decades ago.\n\nThe focus and framing of the image emphasize the dexterity and attention to detail required in scientific experiments or tests, highlighting both the human aspect and the essential scientific tools involved.","title":"John Nakata feeding and watering larvae of carabid beetle, a predator of the grape leaf folder moth.","placename":"Fresno County (Calif.)","location":"Fresno County, California","nn1":["546327","546283","549342","546277","546278","549608","546328","546284","548862","542666","543834","546344","546323","549605","549607","546288"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lab","technician","tray","transfer","person","test","task","scientist","measurement","precision"]}
