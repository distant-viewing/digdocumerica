{"path":"546000.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast accumulation of numerous industrial barrels, piled haphazardly over a large area. The barrels vary in color, predominantly shades of grey, blue, and rust, indicating possibly metal material and varying states of wear or weathering. Some barrels appear newer while others show significant signs of rust and decay.\n\nIn the background, partially visible large industrial tanks can be observed, suggesting that this site might be an industrial storage or waste facility. These tanks are large, rounded, with visible metal structures and seem intact compared to the condition of the barrels. The sky is visible at the top portion of the photo, appearing overcast with muted, possibly early evening lighting casting soft shadows and a relatively flat light across the scene.\n\nThe overall scene gives an impression of abandonment or disuse, highlighting environmental or industrial decay. This may suggest themes related to industrial waste management, recycling needs, or environmental conservation challenges.","title":"A mountain of damaged oil drums near the exxon refinery","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["552885","552884","552883","546004","543806","543762","542494","553433","556324","552248","553045","550301","553866","555277","542587","550880"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrels","barrel","rust","waste","decay","tank","recycl","intact","disuse","need"]}
