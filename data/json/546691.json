{"path":"546691.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive dark wine cellar filled with numerous rows of wine barrels and bottles. The scene is illuminated dimly, casting a moody and somewhat mysterious feel across the setting. Several rows horizontally span the entirety of the image showcasing a large collection of wine barrels that are neatly organized and tightly packed together. These barrels vary slightly in color from light brown to dark brown, suggesting different wood types or ages.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous wine bottles lying horizontally in structured racks occupying the lower section of the image. The labels on the bottles are not discernible due to the distance and lighting, adding to the enigmatic and uniform appearance. The entire cellar exudes a cool, controlled environment ideal for wine aging, emphasized by the absence of any visible windows or natural light sources.\n\nThe overall composition and perspective of the photograph seem to be taken from an elevated angle, providing a broad view of the cellarâ€™s storage layout. No people are visible in the photograph, focusing solely on the wine storage and the atmospheric quality of this cellar. The scene communicates a sense of quiet and the passing of time, pertinent to the wine aging process.","title":"Blurred city lights","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550301","543702","543696","543711","555277","557134","546004","555267","544937","552885","556613","546576","542866","555289","546000","543997"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["barrel","bottle","aging","entirety","storage","row","rack","label","ideal","source"]}
