{"path":"554283.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This image captures a live music performance in a dimly lit venue. Three musicians are on stage, each playing guitars. The central figure, also the focus of the image, wears a dark hat and is actively singing into a microphone while playing an acoustic guitar. To his left, another musician is slightly out of focus, playing an electric guitar. On the right, there's another guitarist facing the audience, also engaged in playing.\n\nThe background of the stage is decorated with a vibrant red wallpaper with a noticeable floral pattern. In front of the musicians, the heads of the audience can be seen, suggesting the performance is well-attended. The audience appears engaged, creating an intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe lighting is soft with slightly darker tones, focusing primarily on the central singer, which casts subtle shadows and gives the scene a warm, inviting feel. The overall ambiance hints at a cozy, perhaps small and intimate venue, typical of folk or acoustic music settings.","title":"Folksingers entertain skiers at end of day in the Timber Line Bar and Restaurant on Snowmass Mountain.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["551318","551479","551319","553890","556308","558387","553305","551317","551012","553152","551708","556251","556032","551320","553297","551770"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["guitar","musician","audience","music","venue","performance","stage","folk","microphone","head"]}
