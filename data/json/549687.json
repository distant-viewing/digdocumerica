{"path":"549687.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph features the building of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emission Laboratory. The laboratory is a large, modern structure with a geometric design characterized by multiple levels and flat surfaces. The main building color appears to be a mix of dark pink and black hues.\n\nIn front of the building and slightly toward the right in the image, there are two flagpoles with flying flags; the American flag is recognizable due to its distinctive stars and stripes. The landscape around the building consists of a well-maintained grass field, reinforcing the building’s isolated and prominent positioning.\n\nProminently displayed in front of the building is a large sign with white lettering that reads \"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\" and below in larger text \"MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION LABORATORY.\" The lettering contrasts significantly with the dark color of the building behind it, making it highly visible against the architecture.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is clear with bright sunlight, suggesting that the photo was taken during a sunny day. There is no visible activity or people in the image; it focuses solely on depicting the laboratory’s architecture and its public identification signage.","title":"Epa's testing facility at ann arbor","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["557825","551605","549691","546448","548866","542762","546538","557930","549690","546329","557873","555366","548911","546447","546702","546456"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["laboratory","lettering","building","flag","flagpole","identification","front","architecture","positioning","star"]}
