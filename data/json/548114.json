{"path":"548114.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows a young Caucasian boy, smiling broadly as he holds up a fish he has presumably caught. The boy has blond, wavy hair and is dressed in a dark blue jacket with lighter blue and white stripes on the collar and cuffs. He is gripping the fish by its mouth and tail, displaying it prominently towards the camera.\n\nThe fish appears silvery with a slightly open mouth and dark eyes, typical of many common freshwater species. The background features a vague glimpse of a tranquil water body, suggesting the photo was taken during a fishing trip near a lake or river. The sky is overcast with clouds, which diffuse the lighting and give a soft quality to the scene.\n\nThe overall feel is one of youthful pride and the enjoyment of outdoor activities. The focus of the image is crisp on the boy's face and the fish, enhancing the personal achievement and the central activity in the photo.","title":"At the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["551022","552118","545180","552322","544303","552315","552274","552323","552329","545165","552321","543472","553095","552828","551025","551392"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","boy","mouth","cuff","achievement","pride","grip","tail","trip","collar"]}
