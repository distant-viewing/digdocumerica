{"path":"556822.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph under discussion captures a moment in a somewhat dimly lit urban setting, perhaps within a subway station or a similar public transit location. Dominating the scene is a large, detailed map or diagram mounted on a wall. This map details an area labeled as \"Manhattan,\" showing a complex network of lines and streets that suggest it might be a subway or transit map.\n\nA young woman is interacting with the map, leaning forward and closely examining a particular section of it. She appears intrigued or focused on deciphering the information displayed. Her profile is well captured, showing long hair and wearing a casual, floral-patterned top. \n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a utilitarian space, typical of public transport utilities, with concrete and echoed spaces hinted by the surroundings. The perspective of the shot, angled slightly from below, adds an intimate touch to the scene, emphasizing the woman's engagement with the map. The image's color tones are muted, adding a vintage feel to the photograph, which may suggest it was taken several years ago.","title":"Young woman looks at a route map of the New York City Transit Authority subway system on a platform along the Lexington Avenue line. Construction is underway for a 2nd Avenue line which would take some of the Lexington Avenue passengers. The work is now a matter of controversy. Originally it was proposed to relieve overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue line, but the number of riders has decreased and the overcrowding is less than when construction was proposed.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548255","548257","557904","554370","557909","556821","556682","548274","556663","548253","556665","556648","546280","546479","548261","556662"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["map","subway","transit","diagram","information","discussion","year","space","woman","profile"]}
