{"path":"550693.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an old, large wooden barn that is weathered and shows signs of decay. The barn is painted dark, likely black, and has numerous patches where the paint has worn away, revealing the lighter wood beneath. Various wooden boards are missing or damaged, especially around the entrance, creating a patchwork of exposed areas.\n\nThe barn has a traditional gable roof design with a centrally located cupola on the top, which also appears to be in disrepair. There is a large sliding door on the front of the barn, and it is slightly ajar. Both standard-sized and small square windows are visible; however, some windows are missing their panes.\n\nThe barn is surrounded by a grassy field with signs of tire tracks or paths leading up to and around the barn. The background features partially cloudy skies and low hills or dense tree lines in the distance, suggesting a rural setting. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of abandonment and the rustic charm of pastoral life.","title":"Barn in bethel, on the androscoggin river.
