{"path":"557536.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph displays a dramatic and rugged mountainous scene, characterized by steep slopes and large rock formations. The focal point of the image is a massive, angled rock face positioned in the foreground, which is heavily adorned with graffiti. Various names and messages are painted onto the rock, creating a stark contrast between the natural brownish-grey hues of the stone and the predominantly white, plus some blue and orange colors of the graffiti.\n\nThe background features a densely vegetated mountainside, showcasing a maze of trees and shrubs in variegated green tones, climbing steeply upward. The mountain's surface is interspersed with smaller rock outcrops, adhering to the natural, rugged terrain. The lighting suggests the time of capture might be either late morning or early afternoon, given the bright and clear visibility of both the rocks and the vegetation. The overall composition emphatically juxtaposes human impact through graffiti against the untouched, wild backdrop provided by the natural environment.","title":"Graffiti defaces rocks in the Malibu canyon area near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550425","550480","543721","554410","550591","550421","550455","550505","557118","545589","555681","555592","554555","550479","550422","544341"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","graffiti","mountainside","climb","outcrop","message","vegetate","visibility","name","juxtapose"]}
