{"path":"545460.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and bustling night scene at a fair or carnival. The central focus is a young couple walking among a crowd of people. The man is dressed in a light-colored jacket and trousers, while the woman next to him wears a patterned dress. They both appear to be intently observing their surroundings.\n\nThe background teems with a variety of vibrant lights and colors from carnival rides and stalls, creating an atmosphere of excitement and activity. Visible are at least two Ferris wheels illuminated with electric lights - one directly in the middle background and another to its right, both adding a festive glow to the scene.\n\nThe street is crowded with a diverse group of people, some pausing to look at the attractions, while others are captured mid-stride. Individuals are dressed in a variety of styles, indicative of the time period, potentially the 1970s, judging by the fashion. To the right, a food stall with the sign \"TACO\" brightly lit in geometric lettering adds to the carnival fare ambiance.\n\nOverall, the photograph is rich with texture and detail, highlighting a lively nighttime gathering filled with motion, light, and an array of expressions and interactions among the attendees.","title":"Midway at the state fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["551298","545464","545449","545465","545444","553298","553331","545448","545459","545456","545454","551297","553304","553259","553260","551820"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["carnival","stall","attraction","nighttime","stride","excitement","variety","attendee","ride","lettering"]}
