{"path":"542917.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph showcases a lush and vibrant coastal seascape, likely captured during the daylight hours given the bright and clear skies. The primary feature of the image is a dramatic seascape that includes steep cliff sides receding into the distance, and a series of rugged, distinctively shaped sea stacks or rocky islands emerging prominently from the ocean waters. These rocky formations vary in size, with the closest being a large, apex-like rock covered in green vegetation, suggesting its occasional exposure during low tide.\n\nThe ocean currents around these formations are gentle, creating soft waves that lap against the rocks. The coastline is adorned with vibrant green vegetation, possibly grass or small bushes, which gently slope up from the cliffs, thus adding a sense of depth to the terrain. The horizon shows the seamless meeting of the sea with a hazy blue sky, which suggests a bit of atmospheric mist or fog that contributes to the tranquil ambiance of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, partially blurred and out of focus, are plants which include what looks to be flowers and other foliage. These plants are likely situated at a high vantage point from where the photo is taken, as they overlook the seascape. Their inclusion in the frame brings a sense of immediate natural beauty and frames the distant view charmingly, providing a layered perspective between the observer and the expansive ocean scenery.\n\nOverall, the composition balances the rugged, enduring presence of the rocks and cliffs with the delicate, fleeting nature of the flora, creating an image that invites contemplation of natural beauty and the serene passage of time at this coastal locale.","title":"Volcanic rocks jut from sea near king mountain coastal range","placename":"Shelter Cove (Calif.)","location":"Shelter Cove, California","nn1":["545130","543068","545122","545173","543184","543297","543061","543060","543080","553805","545129","543289","543300","543049","543291","543404"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["seascape","cliff","rock","apex","formation","sea","observer","reced","endure","meeting"]}
