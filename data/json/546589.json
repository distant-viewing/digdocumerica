{"path":"546589.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at dusk, featuring a beautiful, muted sunset that bathes the sky in warm hues of pink and orange. Against this backdrop, the silhouettes of several elements are visible.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a bus is partially visible, its form outlined against the lighter sky. Its windows and overall shape suggest it is a typical commuter or city bus. To the right, two bus shelters are seen on what appears to be a raised platform typical of a bus station. Each shelter is simple, with a curved roof and minimal structure, designed to protect commuters from the weather while they wait.\n\nBetween these two shelters, a group of people is congregated. They are seen as silhouettes, and it is not possible to discern their features or clothing in detail due to the backlighting from the sunset. The people appear to be engaged in typical waiting behavior, possibly chatting or looking out for their bus.\n\nAbove all, street lamps are intermittently placed, adding to the sense of an urban transport hub. The lighting in the photograph, combined with the positioning of the elements, lends a serene and slightly melancholic atmosphere to the scene, highlighting the end of a day with people making their way home or continuing on to their next destinations.","title":"Early morning commuters at Metro Park and Ride bus station","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546650","549644","547195","556673","553796","543956","556746","552263","545352","553832","544724","549096","556050","552596","543417","546662"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","shelter","commuter","sunset","behavior","silhouette","backlighting","destination","people","positioning"]}
