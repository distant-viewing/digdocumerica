{"path":"550371.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a waterbody, possibly a river or canal, characterized by swirling patterns of foam and pollutants on the surface. The water's color varies from dark blues and blacks, indicating depth and possibly pollutants, to whites and grays from the foam, which forms intricate and somewhat disturbing patterns that suggest water pollution.\n\nOn the right-hand side, there is a concrete structure, which appears to be a dam or a water control feature, built across the water. The dam is substantial and sturdy-looking, with a flat top that serves as a walkway or road, bordered by a metal railing. A red brick building with several windows sits immediately adjacent to this structure, likely functioning as a utility or maintenance building for the dam.\n\nThe background features a tree-lined shore across the water, with visible residential houses and lush greenery, suggesting a suburban setting. The sky is a clear blue, indicating a sunny day with ample light, which enhances the visibility of the water's polluted condition.\n\nOverall, the image presents a contrasting scenario where natural beauty and human construction meet, hinting at environmental concerns due to the visible pollution in the water. This setting likely prompts reflections on industrial impact, water management, and environmental health.","title":"Foamy st.
