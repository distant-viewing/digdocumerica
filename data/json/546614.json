{"path":"546614.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene of several motorcycles parked closely together, likely in a designated motorcycle parking area as indicated by the signage on the wall. A prominent sign on the pale brick wall reads \"MOTORCYCLE PARKING BY PERMIT ONLY\" with details beneath it, suggesting that this parking space is reserved and requires a permit.\n\nThe motorcycles vary in style and color, with visible brands including Honda. They are parked in tight rows and many feature shiny metallic components and handlebars, with some having windscreens attached. The focus on some motorcycles is clearer than others, suggesting a depth of field effect which blurs the background slightly.\n\nThe scene is set against a building with a large window visible, and this shows just a hint of the interior or reflection. The lighting conditions suggest daylight hours. The overall composition focuses much on the lined-up motorcycles, detailing a sense of order and communal parking space usage.","title":"Motorcycle parking by permit only.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556719","549316","551917","558232","551383","551456","544859","546619","551443","546169","546645","548432","556721","553896","546879","554874"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["motorcycle","parking","handlebar","order","wall","brand","usage","space","hour","component"]}
