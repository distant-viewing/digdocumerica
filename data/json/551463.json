{"path":"551463.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts two men engaged in different activities, captured in a setting that appears to be outdoors during daylight, likely in an urban environment due to the presence of structured backdrops in shadows.\n\nThe man in the foreground is focused on manipulating or adjusting some objects on a surface that resembles a makeshift outdoor stand or stall. He wears casual attire—a short-sleeved, plaid patterned shirt and dark trousers. His attention is primarily on his task, and his hands are actively working with what looks like mechanical or crafted items. His outfit and posture suggest a hands-on, possibly artisanal or technical activity.\n\nBehind him, another man stands slightly out of focus, dressed in more formal business attire—light colored suit and tie, suggesting a contrast in their roles or the nature of their activities. His posture and distant gaze imply that he might be waiting, observing, or contemplating, less engaged physically with the surroundings compared to the man in the foreground.\n\nBackground elements are blurred but hint at architectural features and patches of deep shadow, indicating strong sunlight possibly filtering through buildings or other structures. The overall mood of the image conveys a busy, active moment in a day, with each individual absorbed in his own context.","title":"Lunching on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["557907","548299","552382","548372","553270","557854","557830","546036","555287","546023","557163","554945","553246","551899","547382","552369"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["posture","contemplate","man","stall","absorb","makeshift","hand","resemble","colore","role"]}
