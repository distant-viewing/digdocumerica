{"path":"553069.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene. In the foreground, a horse stands, located on the left side of the frame and partially framed by overhanging tree branches. The horse appears calm and is positioned in a shady area, which contrasts with the brighter background.\n\nThe middle ground is occupied by a large expanse of water, which reflects a clear sky. On the water, numerous sailboats are visible. They vary slightly in size, and their sails are predominantly white. The sailboats are scattered across the lake, suggesting a leisurely day of sailing. Some are closer to the viewer while others are near the opposite shore line.\n\nThe background features a lush tree line across the opposite shore of the lake, indicating a rich, green environment. This dense foliage spans the width of the photograph and separates the water from the sky above. The sky is a vivid blue, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the horse in the foreground and sailboats in the background, offers a contrast between the tranquility of the lakeshore and the activity on the water, evoking a peaceful yet vibrant lakeside atmosphere.","title":"White rock lake.
