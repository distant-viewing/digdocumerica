{"path":"552294.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water. The sky, partially cloudy, allows the sun to peek just above the horizon in the center of the frame, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. The setting sun is brightly reflected as patches of golden light on the rippling surface of the water, which fills the majority of the photograph.\n\nThe water's surface has a textured appearance due to the gentle waves, indicating a peaceful but dynamic water movement. The horizon is lined with silhouetted landmasses, including a prominent stretch of forested terrain on the right that extends towards a point jutting into the water, and a more distant, lower silhouette of land on the left under the setting sun.\n\nThe photograph's overall ambiance is tranquil and slightly mysterious because the reduced lighting and shadowy outlines create a subdued and somewhat obscured view of the landscape. The focus and composition are centered on the play of light, the texture of the water, and the contrasting dark shapes of the horizon, showcasing the natural beauty of a tranquil evening by the water.","title":"Sunset on Puget Sound near Marysville","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552277","557447","544711","543144","554404","542618","552335","554759","551206","547731","552338","544707","550296","551215","552038","550288"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sun","water","horizon","landmass","majority","stretch","play","outline","glow","orange"]}
