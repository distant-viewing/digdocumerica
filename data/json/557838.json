{"path":"557838.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts three men in police uniforms standing and conversing in a doorway. The doorway is framed by brick walls and above it a sign reads \"SAFETY LANE\". Visible address numbers next to the doorway read \"121\" and there's a sign that reads \"CLEARANCE 12' 6\" P.M. RUSH HOURS PROHIBITED BY ORDER POLICE COMMISSIONER.\" One of the policemen is holding some papers in his hand while another seems to be gesturing as part of the conversation. The environment suggests an urban setting, possibly outside a building related to police or city operations, evidenced by its semi-industrial architecture and a fence visible in the background. The lighting is bright, indicating daytime, and the atmosphere is informal as indicated by the relaxed body language and attire of the men.","title":"City employees hired by the Norwood, Ohio, public works department to man the safety lane at the auto emission inspection station. The evening shift is slow and the number of vehicles inspected daily averaged only 80 to 100 in August. Shortly after the emissions inspection regulation took effect in January, 1975, 600 to 800 vehicles were checked daily. All vehicles are hooked to an exhaust analyzer which gives readings for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["556847","542757","546634","546676","557867","542758","542759","547412","546633","546657","542756","546663","546658","546654","546637","546680"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["police","doorway","read","clearance","prohibit","language","address","order","rush","converse"]}
