{"path":"548935.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a river curving through a dramatic landscape. On the left bank of the river, thereâ€™s a green park-like area dotted with numerous vehicles and recreational campers. This section includes organized green spaces that might be used for picnics or camping, and several paths or small roads crisscross through the area. \n\nThe river itself appears to be a popular spot for water activities, as evidenced by speedboats creating white wakes as they navigate through the blue waters. One prominent boat is seen moving upstream, leaving a significant frothy wake behind it.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the river is rugged and mountainous, characterized by rocky outcrops and sparse vegetation, suggesting a dry or desert-like environment. This stark, unfertile landscape contrasts sharply with the blue of the river and the manicured greenery of the recreation area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights the interaction between human recreational activities and the natural environment, presenting a scene of leisure and natural beauty.","title":"Boating on the Colorado river below parker dam","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548939","548921","548916","550524","551218","544749","548933","548934","549088","543739","549460","547990","549461","545933","548156","549532"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","wake","speedboat","camper","picnic","outcrop","camping","recreation","crisscross","navigate"]}
