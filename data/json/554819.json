{"path":"554819.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph offers a serene view of a rural landscape, capturing the essence of a tranquil farming community. In the foreground, there is a collection of farm buildings including a large barn and several smaller outbuildings, all characterized by their white exteriors and conventional designs. These structures stand within a countryside setting, surrounded by gentle rolling hills that appear to be in early spring, with sparse vegetation and few leaves on the trees.\n\nA winding road meanders through the middle and background of the scene, enhancing the image's depth and leading the eye across the composition. The road appears well-maintained, suggesting connectivity within this rural environment. Visible on either side of the road are patches of fields, some of which are empty, perhaps lying fallow, while others show signs of early crop growth, likely indicating the beginning of the agricultural season.\n\nThe landscape is broadly open with only a few trees dotted here and there, offering a sense of openness and space typical of rural farm areas. In the background, the terrain rises softly into distant hills that frame the scene, under a sky that is hazy, suggesting either early morning mist or a dull, overcast day.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and solitary, reflecting a quiet day in a countryside setting with no visible human activity, allowing the natural and man-made elements to coexist harmoniously. This idyllic rural scene is typical of agricultural landscapes, providing a snapshot into the daily environment and structure of a farm-based community.","title":"Rolling farmland near Ohio Power Company stripping site, off Route 146, near Freeland, Ohio, and Steubenville.","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["554767","549257","554800","555635","549222","549256","556963","557748","555577","555537","547291","557946","547304","547309","547428","557183"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","countryside","beginning","road","outbuilding","connectivity","community","openness","hill","barn"]}
