In the foreground, large concrete or stone slabs appear scattered along the edge of calm blue water. Just beyond the water, two significant industrial silos bearing the logo \"INC.\" are visible. The middle and background of the image depict a variety of industrial buildings, some featuring tall smokestacks emitting white smoke into the blue sky. The sprawling complex includes various other structures such as tanks, pipes, and possibly conveyors, all indicative of an industrial area dedicated likely to manufacturing or processing operations. The entirety is set against a clear sky with no visible natural vegetation, emphasizing the industrial character of the scene.","title":"Lake Erie waterfront looking toward the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, just south of Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549508","552179","555769","545987","551998","546080","548070","548340","546083","555776","546103","549968","545236","548423","551156","549510"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["slab","entirety","conveyor","silo","concrete","manufacturing","logo","character","pipe","waterfront"]}
