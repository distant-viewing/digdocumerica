{"path":"555733.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a bustling urban landscape, prominently featuring a large suspension bridge in the foreground. The bridge, with its network of cables and beams, spans a wide river and connects two dense areas of the city. The sweeping lines of the bridge and the roads lead the eye across the image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale.\n\nThe cityscape is densely packed with a mix of architectural styles and building heights. On the near side of the river, the area is characterized by tall skyscrapers with modern designs under construction and a few historic towers, suggesting a district of commercial and possibly residential buildings. There are also lower, flat-roofed industrial or commercial buildings closer to the waterfront.\n\nOn the far side of the bridge, the urban environment consists primarily of uniform high-rise residential buildings, arranged in a somewhat grid-like pattern, interspersed with patches of greenery. These buildings are typical of mid- to late-20th-century urban residential planning.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure is prominently displayed with multiple converging and diverging lanes of traffic, signaling a major transportation hub or interchange near the waterfront area. This includes both the bridge and several major roadways.\n\nBeyond the immediate cityscape, the background fades into a hazy skyline indicative of an extensive urban area. The river is a significant geographic feature, adding a natural element to the otherwise highly developed environment.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a dynamic urban center, showcasing the integration of transportation, residential, and commercial structures in a densely populated setting. The photograph likely dates from the latter half of the 20th century, given the style of the buildings and the construction activity.","title":"The Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan, New York transportation in an urban and industrial area like New York produces environmental problems of its own. Freeways sprawl across the landscape and cut through the hearts of cities isolating one neighborhood from another. The autoMobile must take responsibility for air pollution, one of the more critical environmental problems affecting the bight.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548418","548414","546569","548344","548317","555734","548416","548427","548382","551189","546689","546581","553846","550157","555739","546704"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","transportation","waterfront","cityscape","building","river","suspension","century","construction","integration"]}
