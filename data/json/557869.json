{"path":"557869.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph displays a man sitting inside a car, viewed through the open driver-side window. The man appears to be middle-aged, with a slight beard and wide eyes looking towards the viewer, which suggests an element of surprise or attentiveness. He wears a white fedora-style hat, lending an air of retro or classic style, and a light-colored Hawaiian shirt with a prominent floral pattern, which adds a casual, laid-back feel to his attire.\n\nThe car’s interior is not entirely visible, but it seems to boast a typical design from around the mid-20th century, indicated by the chrome and style of the window frame. The steering wheel is partially visible, underscoring the vintage look of the vehicle.\n\nThe background is blurred and nondescript, with pale blue tones that might indicate the sky or a similarly colored structure, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the subject and his immediate surroundings.\n\nThe lighting in the image gives off a slightly greenish-blue tint, perhaps an artifact of the film or developing process used, contributing to the vintage atmosphere of the photo. The composition captures the man’s expression and the details of his attire sharply, making for a striking and engaging portrait.","title":"A motorist watches gauges on an exhaust analyzer as his car is being tested at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood Ohio.
