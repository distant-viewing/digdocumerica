{"path":"545217.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene with a person engaged in an activity within a natural environment that is undergoing or has undergone ecological transformation. The central focus is a person, crouched and apparently engaged in planting or tending to young trees. This person is wearing a light-colored long-sleeve top and bright pink trousers.\n\nTo the left, there's a prominent sign that reads \"GRAND FIR PLANTATION PLANTED BY TAHOLAH GRADE SCHOOL 5TH & 6TH GRADERS-1970,\" indicating that the area is dedicated to the reforestation or educational project initiated by students years ago.\n\nThe surroundings are somewhat scrubby, with various plants and numerous blooms colored mostly yellow, suggesting perhaps a wild or recovered landscape, rather than a manicured garden. There's a visible depiction of new growth through young trees in the foreground, contrasting with the older and possibly dead wood strewn about, hinting at past land use or natural disturbances like fire.\n\nThe background is dense with trees and shrubs, suggesting this plantation is situated within a larger forested or wild area. The sky is overcast, casting soft, diffused light over the entire scene, which brings out the natural and muted tones of the landscape. The area does not appear to be highly manicured, consistent with a focus on natural reforestation or land rehabilitation.","title":"Quinault Indian children planted 10,000 fir trees in this area one of the planters inspects the progress of a few seedlings.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543439","553635","542938","544003","543441","555139","545725","548684","542604","543319","542716","545045","546567","551632","543452","558088"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["person","planting","student","transformation","land","bloom","disturbance","project","year","depiction"]}
