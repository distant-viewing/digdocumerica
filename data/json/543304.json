{"path":"543304.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a striking coastal landscape, likely captured at sunrise or sunset, given the warm, golden light bathing the scene. The setting features a rugged coastline with dramatic cliffs and numerous rocky outcrops jutting out from the turbulent sea. Waves crash against the rocks, creating white foam, which contrasts with the deep blue of the ocean.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by a field bathed in golden and reddish hues, possibly indicating the presence of dry grass or wildflowers. The vegetation is sparse, contributing to the natural, untamed feel of the landscape.\n\nNo human presence or artificial structures are visible, reinforcing the sense of a remote, natural environment. The overall composition uses natural lines created by the coastline to draw the viewer's eye through the scene, from the flowering fields in the foreground, past the craggy cliffs, and out to the horizon where the sea meets the sky. The scene is both serene and dynamic, with the stillness of the landscape contrasting with the movement of the sea.","title":"The southern section of the Big Sur","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543184","543424","543428","543060","543300","543080","543297","545125","545230","543249","543061","542917","543290","543291","545122","545226"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sea","bath","coastline","cliff","craggy","outcrops","flowering","jutt","crash","wildflower"]}
