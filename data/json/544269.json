{"path":"544269.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a scene on a small boat during what appears to be late afternoon, judging by the soft, warm lighting and shadows. There are four individuals on the boat, possibly engaged in a maritime activity given the context.\n\nStarting from the left, one man stands by the side of the boat, looking out toward the sea, with his hair blowing in the wind. He wears a dark blue t-shirt and jeans. Next to him, seated facing the rear of the boat, is another man in a striped t-shirt and jeans, who also seems to be looking out at the sea.\n\nIn the middle of the image, there is another young man wearing a dark blue shirt and jeans, turned away from the camera, interacting with some equipment or controls on the boat.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, another individual is seated in a relaxed posture, leaning against the boat's cabin. He wears a plaid shirt and jeans, with his legs crossed, and appears to be reading or looking down at a document or object in his hands.\n\nThe boat itself is equipped with various maritime gear, including a large white buoy and other safety and navigation equipment. The sea extends into the horizon, indicating that the boat is far from shore. The sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, suggesting good weather conditions for sailing or maritime work. The overall mood of the image is serene and focused, capturing a moment of everyday activity at sea.","title":"Men employed on Lake Pontchartrain dredging operation: a clean-up action","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["554199","554196","547564","548503","552870","547465","554198","552862","549363","549373","553793","548769","549355","547453","549386","548164"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","jean","sea","shirt","buoy","document","equipment","navigation","rear","sailing"]}
