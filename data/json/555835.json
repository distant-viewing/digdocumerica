{"path":"555835.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a helicopter hovering above a large body of water, with a calm sea and clear skies in the background that is tinged with violet and pink hues, possibly indicating either dawn or dusk. The helicopter is shown in the upper right portion of the image, dominating the frame.\n\nIt is a twin-engine helicopter, and it has a landing gear, suggesting it's a utility or transport model. Below the helicopter, a long cable extends vertically towards the calm water, and at the end of the cable, there seems to be a small object, possibly a sonar or some other type of measurement device being lowered or retrieved from the ocean.\n\nThe rotor blades of the helicopter are visible and in motion, indicated by the slight blur of the blades. There is a gentle spray of ocean water being stirred up by the force of the rotor blades, which creates a fine mist around the area directly beneath the aircraft. \n\nThe overall color tone of the image is cool, dominated by shades of blue and pink which give it a serene yet dynamic feel. The horizon is visibly straight, emphasizing the vastness and calmness of the setting. There are no visible landforms or other vessels, suggesting the helicopter may be conducting operations far from shore or in an isolated area.","title":"U.S. Navy helicopter making sonar tests in the New York Bight.
