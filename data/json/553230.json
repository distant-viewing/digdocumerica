{"path":"553230.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a young individual, seen from above, as they are engaged in writing or drawing on a large piece of beige poster paper using a red marker. The person is focusing intently on their task, and has a short, cropped hairstyle. They are wearing a plain white t-shirt and khaki pants.\n\nThe content visible on the poster includes various handwritten texts and perhaps doodles. Visible phrases include “Dogs can talk to us” and some other less discernible words, possibly names or signatures. The handwriting appears playful and spontaneous, suggesting a creative or educational setting.\n\nThe colors in the image are somewhat muted, with the white of the t-shirt and the natural brown tone of the poster contrasting the darker tone of the person’s skin and pants. The background is blurred and mainly indistinct, focusing the viewer’s attention on the person and their activity on the paper.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
