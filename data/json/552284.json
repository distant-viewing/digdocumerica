{"path":"552284.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly couple engaged in handling and inspecting crabs at what appears to be a coastal or riverside setting. The man, on the left, is focused on tying or securing a crab, which he holds in his hands. He is dressed in a dark blue work jacket, a black cap, and glasses. His expression is concentrated and task-oriented.\n\nThe woman, on the right, is smiling broadly, suggesting enjoyment and perhaps pride in their activity. She wears a light blue quilted jacket, a white headscarf, and glasses. She holds a net, which contains other crabs, in her left hand and is either inserting or removing a crab with her right hand into a cloth sack.\n\nThe background is softly out-of-focus, featuring a dim view of tranquil water and a hazy sky, possibly indicating cool or overcast weather. There are vague outlines that could be distant hills or low mountains, adding to the sense of a serene, natural setting.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a moment of daily life, likely part of the couple's routine livelihood or perhaps a leisure activity, characterized by a blend of labor and light-hearted interaction, set in a quiet, natural landscape.","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Lyons, from Priest Falls, Idaho, crabbing on the Hood Canal near Brinnon on Washington's Olympic Peninsula people seek Dungeness crabs, but may also take red cock crabs and black-tip claw crabs such as the one Mr. Lyons is holding.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["546222","544264","545175","545208","554008","545178","554200","545093","545182","550316","546320","551396","544209","551386","552877","552278"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["crab","couple","hand","quilt","sack","pride","headscarf","remove","jacket","glass"]}
