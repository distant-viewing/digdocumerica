{"path":"543653.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene where a man wearing a white hard hat is crouched beside a series of water channels at a facility. The man appears to be inspecting or interacting with the water flow; he is reaching down to touch the water with his right hand. He is dressed casually in a long-sleeve button-up shirt and jeans. The background features a complex structure of a plant with multiple levels of stairs, railings, and piping. It gives the impression of a heavy industrial setting, likely a processing plant or refinery of some sort. The area around the channels is muddy and undeveloped, suggesting ongoing construction or outdoor operations. The overall ambiance is gritty and functional, focused on industrial processes.","title":"Cement plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543810","543795","543804","544822","547956","544171","546027","544105","549632","546904","549063","555815","557388","556447","553025","543648"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["channel","refinery","piping","stair","plant","sort","button","railing","flow","processing"]}
