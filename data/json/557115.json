{"path":"557115.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man engaged in an outdoor activity, seemingly involved in inspecting or constructing a wooden slatted crate or structure. The man is dressed in practical clothing suitable for manual labor, consisting of a light gray shirt, gray trousers, a matching gray baseball cap, and dark, worn work shoes. His posture is slightly stooped as he bends over the wooden object, which rests on the ground in an open, sunlit area.\n\nThe background of the image shows a natural, rural environment. There are various trees and patches of grass visible, as well as a weathered fence partially obscured by the foliage. The ground is composed of dirt and grass, indicating an outdoor setting that could be a backyard or a similar informal work area. The overall atmosphere suggests a serene, quiet day with clear skies, considering the ample sunlight in the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of everyday life, possibly highlighting themes of aging, work, craftsmanship, or rural living. The focus and concentration of the man as he handles the wood reveal a dedication to his task, representing a candid snapshot of personal endeavor in a natural setting.","title":"A Missouri River fisherman shows off his homemade carp trap at White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state. This area is unique because it contains the only hardwood forest in the state in addition to tallgrass prairie. There also are loess Bluffs along the river, a glacial formed solid earth Bluff, which is characteristic of the area.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["553642","556633","555533","558333","558315","548252","554926","552571","553090","548299","547311","543781","547330","554521","552572","542497"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["work","dedication","backyard","crate","craftsmanship","baseball","endeavor","aging","grass","living"]}
