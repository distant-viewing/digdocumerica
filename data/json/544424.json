{"path":"544424.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day where three young children are engaging in play in a sandy area outside a building. The scene features two girls and one boy, all appearing to be of Native American descent. They are focusing intently on their activities, which involve using simple play materials such as a bucket, a shovel, and what seems to be a small, box-like object.\n\nThe children are seated directly on the ground; the boy on the left is pouring sand into the bucket while the girl in the center watches him, and the girl on the right is playing with sand using her hands. They are informally dressed, typical for young children at play.\n\nIn the background, there is a single-story building made of light-colored bricks with three visible windows and what appears to be a chimney structure. Adjacent to this building is a wooden structure with a visible red roof, adding a contrast in both color and material to the brick building.\n\nTo the side of the children, there's a red tricycle, indicating more potential play activities. The environment is somewhat sparse and rugged, evident from the sandy ground and minimal grass. A blue sky with light clouds and distant mountains add a backdrop to the rural setting. There's a sense of peaceful simplicity and childhood exploration depicted in this scene.","title":"Navajo children make mud \"flat-bread\".
