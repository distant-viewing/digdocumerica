{"path":"555032.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The image depicts a close-up of a small water droplet on the edge of what appears to be a green leaf. The droplet is very clear and spherical, reflecting some light which suggests the presence of a light source, possibly sunlight. The leaf is slightly tilted, allowing the droplet to perch delicately on its edge, poised as if it's about to fall off but held in place by surface tension.\n\nThe leaf itself has a smooth texture, and you can also see some tiny particles or debris on its surface near the droplet, which could be dust or pollen. This detail suggests that this is an outdoor setting, or a natural environment. The background of the image is blurred and displays various shades of dark green and black, enhancing the focus on the droplet and the leaf by providing a contrasting backdrop.\n\nThis composition subtly captures the interplay of light, gravity, and the natural world in a tranquil yet transient moment. The overall mood of the image is serene and focuses on the beauty and simplicity found in nature's small-scale phenomena.","title":"Closeup of an Oregon oxalis leaf, water and sunlight photosynthesis; the alchemy of the green leaf, in the queets river valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543564","543629","558077","551371","555184","555044","551353","543565","547287","553853","551357","557592","546217","546096","557593","543620"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","leaf","gravity","phenomena","poise","tension","particle","tilt","perch","world"]}
