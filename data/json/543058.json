{"path":"543058.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape dominated by reflective waters under a vast sky. The image is taken at what appears to be late afternoon, given the muted yet warm lighting, and featuring several vertical wooden posts standing partially submerged in the water, lending an air of abandonment or decay. The water is remarkably still, creating a mirror-like surface that reflects the wooden posts and subtle hues of the sky.\n\nThe foreground shows a rugged shoreline, textured with various sized rocks and pebbles, transitioning into smooth mud or wet sand closer to the water’s edge. The shoreline is punctuated by patches of brightness, possibly caused by the sun glinting off the moist surfaces.\n\nIn the background, a gentle hill or mountain range is faintly visible through a hazy atmosphere, adding depth and a sense of expansiveness to the scene. The overall mood is quiet and reflective, evoking a sense of isolation and the passage of time. The composition of the image, with the line of posts leading the viewer’s eye towards the distant horizon, enhances the depth and tranquil solitude of this natural scene.","title":"Mud flats, Humboldt Bay area","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542993","545008","543611","550493","552336","542994","550391","550389","549446","546963","548030","545213","552142","550750","554527","547047"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["post","shoreline","expansiveness","pebble","mirror","mud","water","passage","brightness","depth"]}
