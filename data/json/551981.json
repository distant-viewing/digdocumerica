{"path":"551981.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful, somewhat rustic aquatic scene, presumably at a river or coastal area, showing elements connected to traditional wooden construction or shipping. In the image, two predominant wooden boats appear heavily laden with cut timber, possibly bamboo or similar lightweight wood. The boats are moored at a larger, partly submerged wooden structure that seems to be a jetty or docking area constructed from similar materials. \n\nSticking out of the water, numerous wooden stakes or posts are visible, some still intact and others broken, possibly serving as foundational supports for the structure or as mooring points. The reflection of the boats and posts in the calm water adds a serene and slightly surreal quality to the scene, with clear mirror-like images duplicated in the surface.\n\nThe lighting suggests it could be early morning or late afternoon, with soft, diffused light contributing to the tranquility of the scene, emphasizing textures and the monochromatic tone of the wood. There are no visible people or active work, giving the picture a sense of quiet abandonment or a pause in activity. The overall atmosphere is one of calm and perhaps decay, suggesting this might be a less frequently used area or one in decline from its original purposes.","title":"Shutters island, at the mouth of Arthur Kill, is a graveyard for sunken barges and derelict vessels abandoned by petrochemical manufacturers on the waterway.
