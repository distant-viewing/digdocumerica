{"path":"557759.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a mailbox mounted on a metal post. The mailbox is traditional in design, primarily rectangular, with a curved top and a front that includes a door with a small, horizontal handle for opening. It is weathered with a metallic finish that showcases various signs of wear and exposure to elements.\n\nAbove the mailbox, there is a distinct and decorative sign that adds a personalized, rustic charm to the scene. The sign is crafted from black metal and depicts a scene of a farmer, wearing a hat, plowing a field with a horse. The scene is framed within the outline of a nameplate that reads \"W. H. CORNELL,\" suggesting this is the name of the property or mailbox owner.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, providing a contrast that highlights the mailbox and sign. The background color tone is greenish-gray, likely indicating grass or a garden in soft focus, which suggests a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph effectively draws attention to the mailbox and the decorative sign, emphasizing a theme of rural life and personalization in everyday objects.","title":"Mailbox on Sims Road at Robertstown, Georgia, a mile northeast of Helen.
