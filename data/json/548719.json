{"path":"548719.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater scene indicative of a marine ecosystem, likely that of a coral reef. The image shows a sandy sea floor dotted with various coral formations. Prominently visible are two large coral structures, one towards the left and another on the right of the frame. The coral on the left appears spherical with a bumpy texture, while the one on the right showcases a more rugged, layered appearance with what seems like branches or extensions protruding outward.\n\nSwimming in the center are four fish, also known as angelfish, characterized by their flat, rounded bodies and distinctive fins. These fish are dark in color with visible light patches or speckles, and their fins are outlined with a pale, almost white edging, enhancing their visibility against the darker, deep-blue water.\n\nThe background is a dimly lit underwater environment where the visibility gradually decreases with distance, creating a fading effect to the expanse beyond the immediate surroundings. Small particles are suspended in the water, possibly plankton or sediment, common in such natural settings.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on marine life amidst natural underwater structures, is balanced between the vibrant life forms and the subdued, tranquil seascape, conveying a serene yet vibrant aspect of undersea life.","title":"Grey angle fish swim in the protected waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a few miles off the coast of Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548717","548677","548682","548715","548716","548713","548711","548712","548678","548718","548722","548679","548721","548723","548676","548681"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fin","fish","visibility","reef","coral","speckle","extension","life","particle","seascape"]}
