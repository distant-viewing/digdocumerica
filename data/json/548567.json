{"path":"548567.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene at a shuffleboard court. In the foreground, an elderly man in a striped shirt and white cap is bending forward in a dynamic pose, intently playing shuffleboard with a cue stick that he is using to push a disc along the court. His expression is focused, and he appears to be in the middle of his game.\n\nBehind him, four other men are spectating and waiting for their turn. Two are on the left, standing together casually: one in a light blue shirt and visor, and the other in a white shirt and dark visor, with a large scoreboard beside them displaying various numbers. To the right, two more men are observing; one is dressed in a red-striped shirt and wide straw hat, and the other in a white cap and white shirt, leaning on his shuffleboard cue.\n\nThe background is a sunny park setting with lush green trees and a clear sky that suggests a warm, pleasant day. The overall atmosphere of the photo conveys a sense of leisure, sport, and camaraderie among the elderly gentlemen enjoying their game of shuffleboard.","title":"Photograph of shuffleboard at the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548566","548564","551757","551759","551760","548580","546155","551758","556507","548647","556219","544213","546140","548579","547376","551958"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["game","shirt","gentleman","cap","camaraderie","straw","push","stick","man","pose"]}
