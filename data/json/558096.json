{"path":"558096.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people enjoying an outdoor setting on a sunny day. Four individuals—one woman and three men—are seen on what appears to be a large rock or cliff edge, overlooking a dense forest that extends into a vast, flat horizon.\n\nOne of the men, seated to the far left, is dressed in a blue T-shirt and jeans. He is handling an item next to a colorful, patterned pillow, and a white blanket or cloth is spread out beside him. His attention is focused downward, likely onto the object he is handling. \n\nTwo men, positioned next to each other to the right of the first man, are both wearing red plaid shirts and jeans. They are in the process of setting up or handling their gear, possibly preparing for a meal or settling in for a rest. One of them is squatting while holding a lighter-colored object, and the other is reaching down toward a pile of items, including what appears to be a gray backpack.\n\nThe woman, standing in the background and donning a red shirt and jeans, seems to be either securing something in place or adjusting her position. Her stance suggests movement, perhaps as she navigates around the rock surface.\n\nIn the background, a breathtaking view of lush treetops under a clear sky showcases the beauty of nature in this location. The expanse of trees suggests a remote or wilderness area. The atmosphere implies a leisurely, possibly adventurous outdoor outing, marked by camaraderie and the enjoyment of natural surroundings.","title":"Scenic lookout on a ledge also offers a good place to picnic in the Virginia Kendall park, part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.
