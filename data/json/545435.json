{"path":"545435.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial pollution with multiple smokestacks emitting thick, dark smoke into the sky. The smoke billows upward, merging into a cloudy sky, suggesting a significant discharge of pollutants. The image shows at least eight vertical smokestacks, prominently aligned in the foreground and background, with additional incomplete structures visible, possibly under construction or in disrepair as suggested by their varying heights and absence of emissions. The smokestacks are industrial gray, and the smoke is primarily black, indicating the burning of heavy fossil fuels. The scene is devoid of vegetation or any natural elements, emphasizing the environmental impact of industrial activity. The overall composition of the photograph, with its stark industrial elements against a heavy sky, conveys a powerful message about environmental degradation.","title":"Chimneys of U.S. steel plant emit smoke 24 hours a day.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545491","550176","550981","553841","545439","557218","550875","557302","548376","550871","550998","545441","550172","550983","550169","545468"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["smokestack","smoke","discharge","burning","pollutant","fuel","degradation","disrepair","emission","message"]}
