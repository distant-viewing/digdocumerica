{"path":"552556.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene featuring a flock of sheep grazing on a green landscape. In the foreground, there are numerous sheep gathered around an area that includes a small, calm body of water, perhaps a pond, reflecting the daylight. The terrain around the pond is uneven and covered with grass and patches of bare earth.\n\nThe middle ground of the image is populated by more sheep, scattered across a gently rising hillside that is lush with greenery and some sporadic bushes. This section also includes more patches of bare, brown soil, creating a natural contrast with the green vegetation.\n\nThe background is comprised of a steeper hill which ascends from the central part of the image. This hill is more densely vegetated at its base but becomes slightly rockier and less densely green as it extends upwards. The top of the hill is not visible, enhancing the depth of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a serene and bucolic atmosphere, portraying the sheep in a tranquil natural setting. The lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, with soft, natural light enhancing the peacefulness of the scene.","title":"Sheep and cattle ranching is the chief occupation of the piceance basin.
