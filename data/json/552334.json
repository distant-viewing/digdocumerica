{"path":"552334.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a nature scene where two individuals are involved in a rock climbing activity. The setting is an outdoor environment featuring a steep, forest-covered slope with two climbers making their ascent on what appears to be a rocky cliff face.\n\nOne climber, lower down on the slope, is dressed in a blue top and dark trousers, climbing with the assistance of a rope. The climber is facing the rock, in a pose that suggests progression upwards. Higher up, another person wearing a white helmet and light-colored clothing is seen from the side, also using ropes to navigate the rocky terrain. This individual seems to be pausing, possibly securing the rope or preparing to continue.\n\nThe background is densely filled with green trees and vegetation, indicating a lush forest environment. The cliff itself is gray and slightly wet, perhaps indicating recent rain or a naturally moist environment contributing to slick rock surfaces.\n\nOverall, the image projects a sense of adventure and outdoor sports, with a serene yet challenging natural landscape surrounding the climbers.","title":"Climbers practicing on a rock wall at larrabee state park on northern puget sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["553370","545777","545773","545769","554503","545781","545768","544931","558078","543375","545785","545772","545782","543248","545697","544739"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rope","cliff","rock","ascent","slope","assistance","climbing","climb","pause","forest"]}
