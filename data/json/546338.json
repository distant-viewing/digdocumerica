{"path":"546338.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two people engaged in activities near a body of water, possibly a lake or a river. The scene is set in a natural environment, surrounded by lush greenery and some rocks.\n\nOn the left, there is a person bending over, appearing to handle or adjust a small, makeshift dam or barrier built from stones. This individual is dressed in a short-sleeved top and plaid shorts, with their hair partly obscured, focusing intently on their task.\n\nOn the right, another individual is standing in the water, holding a long pole or stick, possibly used for probing the water or assisting in the construction or maintenance of the barrier. This person is wearing swim trunks and is bare-chested, suggesting a warm day or involvement in water-related activity.\n\nThe background features a clear sky with few clouds and a flat, expansive landscape that hints at a rural or undeveloped area. There are tall grasses and reeds in the foreground, partially framing the scene and adding texture to the composition.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a moment of human interaction with the natural environment, possibly in an effort to manage or use water resources effectively. The photograph exudes a sense of peaceful coexistence and active engagement with the landscape.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel are seining in a culture pond.
