{"path":"555007.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents an intricate and dense view of a tree or bush heavily populated with small, possibly budding leaves or flowers. The overall image is dominated by the natural textures and colors of the plant, which vary from deep greens to hints of brown and vibrant touches of what appears to be pink or red, suggesting either the blossoming stage of the flora or perhaps the presence of berries.\n\nDue to the close-up and filled frame, there's a lack of a visible background or any other context that might provide additional details about the setting. The focus is entirely on the myriad of branches intertwined with each other, showcasing a complex natural pattern. The image exudes a wild and unmanaged look, typical of a natural forest or a dense thicket.\n\nThere is an absence of visible sky, ground, or any other elements that might offer more detail about the location or environment. The photo captures the density and organic messiness of nature, with a rich texture that draws the viewerâ€™s eye across the diverse interplay of colors and forms. No human activities, objects, or other subjects are discernible within this natural tableau.","title":"New growth of vine maple in the queets corridor of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554983","554993","554980","555019","555192","555093","555187","555040","554954","554961","554744","543488","555183","543542","555037","554590"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["myriad","thicket","blossom","bud","tableau","intertwine","flora","exude","close","detail"]}
