{"path":"548371.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on an urban street, characterized by a sense of activity and disarray. In the forefront, a close view of a pair of legs clad in dirty, work-stained jeans tucked into work boots is prominent. These boots and the lower half of the jeans are covered in dirt, suggesting recent physical labor.\n\nTo the left, a section of rough, textured stone and what appears to be a pillar or block structure frame the composition. The ground is littered with debris like bricks, bits of rubble, and what might be small tools or equipment parts, hinting at construction or repair work being done in the area.\n\nIn the middle background, a coiled wire or cable lies on the ground contributing further to the impression of ongoing work. Several individuals are present in the background. Two are standing closer together with one possibly handing something small to the other, perhaps tools or materials relevant to their work. Another individual, partially obscured behind and to the side of the scene, adds to the busy, somewhat chaotic atmosphere.\n\nThe setting suggests an urban environment, likely a portion of a street undergoing maintenance or construction, evidenced not just by the tools and materials scattered around, but also by the attire and activity of the people involved. The photograph carries a raw, candid quality, capturing the essence of manual labor and everyday urban life, framed by the unpolished and functional aspect of the location and the moment.","title":"'Harlem'","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556893","544968","554936","544959","556447","552750","545343","549268","556376","553497","553887","548372","546824","556391","548299","552969"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["work","tool","boot","labor","jean","do","disarray","construction","tuck","undergo"]}
