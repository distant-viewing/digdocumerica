{"path":"549709.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph presents an evocative scene focusing on a young girl interacting closely with a uniquely ornate candle. The girl, with long, straight hair parted in the middle, is viewed from the front but slightly off-center. She wears a pale yellow blouse with a puffed shoulder, lending the image a soft, vintage feel. The girl's gaze is intently directed downwards towards the candle placed directly before her on a light-colored, nondescript surface.\n\nThe candle itself is quite distinctive: squat and circular in shape, it features elaborate decorative flourishes that spiral around its base, each ending in a scroll-like design, painted in muted tones of green, white, and dark accents. The candle's wick is tall and unlit, standing starkly against the darker, unfocused background.\n\nThe setting is simple with a dark backdrop that contrasts sharply with the subject and foreground, accentuating the girl's face and the detailed candle. The shallow depth of field blurs everything beyond the immediate subjects, focusing all visual attention on the interaction of the girl with the candle. The emotional tone of the image is contemplative and serene, highlighted by the soft lighting that gently illuminates the girl and the centerpiece.","title":"Candle making in the crafts area of bob-lo island","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["555428","558238","555429","553532","556577","555441","551360","552961","551473","556138","545373","551294","556516","544437","556299","548289"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["girl","centerpiece","flourish","subject","downward","accent","accentuat","blur","shoulder","muted"]}
