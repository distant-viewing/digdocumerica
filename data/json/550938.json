{"path":"550938.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph displays a scene of an industrial facility, specifically focusing on a tall, narrow smokestack that is actively emitting a thick, voluminous plume of white smoke into the air. The smokestack is part of a larger complex that features various other structural elements such as cylindrical tanks and interconnected piping, common to industrial settings.\n\nThe background shows a hazy sky that blends seamlessly with the discharged smoke, suggesting possibly overcast conditions or air filled with industrial emissions. Below the skyline, distant trees can be faintly perceived, lightly silhouetted against the sky, adding a natural texture to the otherwise mechanical scenery.\n\nThe composition of the photo is such that the smokestack and the smoke are prominent, placed centrally and vertically, leading the viewerâ€™s eyes upward following the smoke as it billows and merges with the clouds above. The image captures an essence of industrial activity, possibly highlighting themes of environmental impact and the interplay between human activity and nature. The overall mood is somewhat somber or reflective, underscored by the muted colors and the imposing presence of the smokestack.","title":"Smokestack of the Du Pont chemical plant on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545468","550871","550905","550939","545472","545910","548157","550876","550998","548376","550869","551054","551056","546760","545439","550172"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","smoke","air","discharge","piping","merge","emission","impose","billow","follow"]}
