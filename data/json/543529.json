{"path":"543529.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph shows a serene setting by a riverside featuring a series of multi-level residential buildings which exhibit a rustic architectural style. These buildings are constructed mostly with what appears to be weathered wood, featuring large windows and external wooden staircases that connect different levels. Each unit has balconies or decks, many lined with wooden railings, suggesting they offer a view of the river or surroundings.\n\nThe buildings are situated closely together, built along the curve of a small river or lake's edge. Large rocks and boulders are scattered around the banks next to the water, which gently laps at the shore. A small, seemingly unused white boat rests on these rocks, adding a quaint touch to the scene.\n\nIn the background, dense coniferous woodland rises up, providing a lush green contrast to the weathered browns of the buildings and the earth tones of the boulders. The view is peaceful, nestled within a natural setting that seems to emphasize tranquility and privacy. The overall atmosphere suggested by this setting is quiet and idyllic, probably conducive to relaxation and enjoyment of natural beauty. The light and shadows indicate that the photo might have been taken during the day under clear weather conditions.","title":"Condominiums on the lake","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552987","549457","551526","551066","545197","551067","557486","557485","543527","544567","544243","542908","552837","552986","543543","558062"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["boulder","privacy","staircase","rock","riverside","building","river","balcony","relaxation","woodland"]}
