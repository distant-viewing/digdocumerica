{"path":"550164.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene with laundry hanging on multiple clotheslines, stretched across a metal fence, bathed in sunlight. The laundry items vary, including towels, shirts, pants, and smaller cloth pieces, displaying a mix of colors and patterns. \n\nOn the left side of the frame, there is a person partially visible, apparently engaged in hanging or managing the clothes. This individual wears a light-colored outfit. Below the clotheslines, a yard visible with short grass and a couple of birds, possibly pigeons, are present along with a football laying on the ground. \n\nThe background shows a brick building with some details obscured by the laundry, suggesting an urban environment. In the shadow cast by the building, at least two people are sitting or crouching, engaged in conversation or some activity, not clearly visible due to the distance and shadows.\n\nThe scene captures a typical day-to-day outdoor chore, integrating social interaction and a common urban living environment. The atmosphere suggests it is a bright, sunny day, ideal for laundry and outdoor activities.","title":"Laundry day on St. Olga Street, site of Metropolitan Housing","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547950","545394","549270","557406","548472","549276","547896","552482","543867","556166","556167","544398","555951","543657","550718","551100"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["clothesline","football","hang","laundry","crouch","cloth","towel","ideal","integrate","day"]}
