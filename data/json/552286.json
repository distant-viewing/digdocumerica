{"path":"552286.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of several people engaging in activities on a beach area alongside a body of water. The foreground features a man and a young woman, both focused on something near the ground. The man is wearing a checked shirt, trousers, a pair of rubber boots, and a camouflage cap. He is holding a shovel and is in a standing position, gazing downwards. The woman, who is crouching next to him, is dressed in a blue jacket, jeans, and tall boots, and seems to be in conversation with the man or looking intently at the ground.\n\nIn the background, several individuals are spread across the beach, each engaged in similar activities. Some are bending over or looking at the ground, perhaps collecting items. The environment is picturesque, with majestic mountains in the distance that fade into a hazy blue, under a bright sky partly obscured by white clouds. The beach area is littered with what appears to be small rocks or shells, contributing to a natural, rugged outdoor setting. The presence of a yellow bucket nearby suggests that the group might be collecting shells or other natural objects.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural light and vivid setting, frames an activity-focused outdoor scene that conveys a sense of exploration or gathering, set against a serene and expansive natural backdrop.","title":"Oystering on the public tidelands on the Hood Canal at Brinnon on the Olympic Peninsula","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["547117","552278","545208","547504","543225","552305","545204","543047","543492","547167","546320","547020","545077","547009","551411","543216"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["shell","beach","boot","camouflage","rubber","shovel","standing","ground","woman","pair"]}
