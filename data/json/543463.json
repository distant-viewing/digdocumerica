{"path":"543463.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a lively beach scene filled with playful interactions and activity. In the foreground, a woman, dressed in a long sleeve purple top and jeans, is playing fetch with a black dog by the water's edge. The dog appears enthusiastic, possibly retrieving a stick or toy from the woman.\n\nFurther back, three young men are seen enjoying the water. Two of them are in the midst of leaping through the shallow surf, creating dynamic splashes around them. They wear shorts and seem to be having fun splashing in the waves.\n\nThe background features rolling waves that crash onto the shore, hinting at a windy day. The sea looks choppy and energetic with white foam forming on the crests of the waves. In the far distance, beyond the waves, the rough silhouettes of rocky formations are visible, adding to the natural coastal landscape of the area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with the positioning of the humans and animal, varying depths of the ocean, and the surf's action, delivers a sense of motion and vibrance, capturing a moment of joy and play at the beach.","title":"Southern California -- southern Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["545218","543395","553072","543396","543390","544191","548292","543394","548695","553951","543500","543458","543072","543070","543083","548697"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["wave","surf","dog","splash","beach","fun","play","retrieve","deliver","toy"]}
