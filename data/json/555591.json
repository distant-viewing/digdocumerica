{"path":"555591.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting, characterized by elements suggestive of mining or heavy industry. The central feature of the scene is a large coal pile, positioned near a body of water possibly a pond or small lake. The body of water reflects the surrounding area to some degree and provides a sense of calm in contrast to the industrial activity.\n\nA significant industrial structure, likely related to the processing or transport of coal, dominates the middle portion of the image. This structure includes conveyors and possibly sorting or loading facilities. To the left, elevated conveyors rise from the ground, transporting materials to or from the pile.\n\nThe immediate foreground shows grass-covered hills, indicating that the viewpoint is from a higher elevation looking down towards the facility. The background includes wooded areas and distant rolling hills, evoking a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe photo is drenched in sunlight, suggesting it was taken during the day under clear, bright conditions. The overall palette includes greens of the vegetation, dark grays and blacks of the industrial materials and structures, and the blue and reflective silvers of the water.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural landscapes with man-made industrial elements, providing a snapshot that speaks to the interactions between industrial development and the natural environment.","title":"Strip mining coal shovel abandoned in a field where it once had been used","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["543642","557403","551036","556602","554625","554763","551037","554764","554546","554632","556520","554630","556504","556349","549168","550961"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["coal","conveyor","transport","pile","degree","facility","black","silver","material","hill"]}
