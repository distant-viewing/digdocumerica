{"path":"542918.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal scene during what appears to be the early evening, judging by the low sun casting soft light across the scene. The primary elements of this image include a curved shoreline road bordered by a stone barricade, a large body of water reflecting the light from the sky, and a variety of buildings and vegetation.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a notable two-story building with features of a traditional house, including a gabled roof and multiple windows. Next to this house is a curved road where a vintage car is visible, driving along the pathway that hugs the coastline.\n\nIn the foreground, close to the bottom of the image and to the left, there lies a deteriorating boat partially submerged in the water, suggesting it may have been abandoned or is in disuse. Across the bay or river, gentle hills rise, covered with lush, dense trees and illuminated gently by the setting sun, creating a warm, golden hue on their tops.\n\nOn the right side, separated by the water, one can see another vegetated area with several small buildings or structures, and there's a calm reflective quality to the water, suggesting it's either a very tranquil day or a sheltered bay area.\n\nOverall, the composition and tranquil setting suggest a quiet coastal or lakeside community, somewhat remote and surrounded by natural beauty. The scene conveys a sense of peaceful isolation and a slow pace of life, very much intertwined with the natural environment.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542870","550314","542907","543362","557529","554102","554101","545030","545104","542908","542913","544554","542993","546417","542910","552192"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bay","barricade","hug","sun","deteriorate","pace","disuse","house","intertwine","lakeside"]}
