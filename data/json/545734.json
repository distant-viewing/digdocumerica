{"path":"545734.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic riverside setting where a group of people is engaging in various activities. In the foreground, a red and white canoe rests on the edge of a muddy river bank, tipped slightly to one side and filled with personal belongings.\n\nTo the right of the canoe, several individuals can be seen in a relaxed posture under the shade of lush green trees. A woman sits near the water's edge on a small, sandy patch, wearing a wide-brimmed red hat and a sleeveless top, seemingly looking at something in her hand or relaxing. Nearby, another person wearing a cap is kneeling down, possibly attending to an item on the ground.\n\nBeyond them, two more people are occupied with different tasks; one stands facing the river, potentially watching the surroundings or looking towards the water, while another is slightly bent over, possibly organizing items or engaging in a similar activity.\n\nThe background features tall, rugged cliffs of reddish-brown rock that contrast vividly with the greenery of the trees. The river appears calm, reflecting a light muddy color typical of sediment-rich waters. The overall ambiance is peaceful and natural, capturing a moment of leisure and activity in an outdoor, wilderness setting.","title":"After this break for lunch, visitors to the Canyonlands National Park will continue their trip down the Colorado river several outfits in Moab offer such trips.
