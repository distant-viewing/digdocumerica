{"path":"557679.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic and charming scene at \"Betty's Country Store.\" In the foreground, two vintage gas pumps, one painted in light yellow and beige, and the other in red and white, are prominently featured. Both pumps, looking like they belong to a bygone era, have analog meters and hose attachments.\n\nIn the background, under a wide awning that sports a large Coca-Cola signage, the entrance to Betty's Country Store is visible. The signage above the entrance is retro in style, clearly visible with the words \"Betty's Country Store\" set against a vibrant Coca-Cola themed backdrop. Hanging baskets with lush green plants add a quaint touch to the scene.\n\nInside the open store doorway, a person, possibly the proprietor or an employee, appears to be engaged in sweeping the floor, contributing to the daily upkeep of the shop. The interior of the store reveals an assortment of goods, suggesting a variety of merchandise ranging from food items in baskets and possibly some craft or local homemade products casually displayed.\n\nThe setting suggests a small, rural shop that serves both as a gas station and a general store, offering a glimpse of rural commerce and daily life. It evokes a sense of nostalgia and simplicity, characteristic of small-town country stores.","title":"Betty Fain opens for business on Main Street at Betty's Grocery in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552518","555517","547805","554784","555511","556368","555520","549870","555377","555467","548047","552517","546153","550096","547874","555506"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","basket","gas","shop","entrance","signage","employee","attachment","merchandise","upkeep"]}
