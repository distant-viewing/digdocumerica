{"path":"549368.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque lakeside scene. In the foreground, large jagged rocks dramatically protrude into the calm waters of a lake. The middle ground is lively with activity along a rocky shoreline where several people, including children and adults, are engaged in various waterfront activities like swimming, sunbathing, and walking along the rocky beach. \n\nThe background features an elegant, aged building with classic architectural details, painted in a warm shade of pink with white trim around windows and a balcony, suggesting a Mediterranean influence. A line of parked cars, indicative of the era the photo was taken (possibly vintage cars from the mid-20th century), lines the road adjacent to the building, highlighting a popular or residential area. Gentle, foliated terrain that merges into a pale blue sky completes the serene background.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a leisurely day by the water in a quaint lakeside town, blending natural beauty with human leisure activity and historic architecture.","title":"The Adriatic Sea coast attracts tourist fishermen.
