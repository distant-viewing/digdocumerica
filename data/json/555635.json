{"path":"555635.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a pastoral, rural landscape that gives a sense of serene country living. In the foreground, there is a curving, two-lane road that meanders through the scene and out of the frame to the right. Running parallel to the road is a utility pole, suggestive of a connection to more populated areas despite the rural setting.\n\nTo the left of the road, there is a white two-story house partially obscured by lush green trees and an aging wooden shed or barn, both indicative of residential and possibly agricultural use. The side of the road shows gentle hills that are suggestive of a rolling landscape typical of rural farming areas.\n\nThe midground prominently features a field with a bright red barn with a vivid white roof, creating a stark contrast against the lush green grass. Next to the barn, a smaller white building complements the rural architecture.\n\nAt a distance, the landscape is adorned with cows grazing, which further emphasizes the agricultural use of the land. In the background, the land is partitioned into several fenced areas, likely for livestock, and dotted with more trees.\n\nThe clear sky and vibrant natural colors suggest this photo was taken on a bright sunny day, enhancing the vivid hues of the buildings and surrounding vegetation, making it a picturesque scene of rural lifestyle. The entire setting imparts a tranquil feel, typical of a secluded, peaceful countryside environment.","title":"Country road in a farming area that has not been stripmined in southeastern Ohio.
