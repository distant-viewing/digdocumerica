{"path":"546318.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, rusted car that is partially submerged in a body of water, likely a shallow pond or a flooded area. The car appears to be severely weathered and damaged, with elements of its body collapsed and bent, exposing inner components and framework. The front hood is missing, and the steering wheel and dashboard are visible and in a disintegrated state.\n\nThe carâ€™s color is hard to ascertain due to the extensive rust and weathering, but it seems to originally have been a dark color. Parts of the car are submerged, notably the front section and the right side, while the left side, including what remains of the windshield and a door frame, project above the water.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a sandy beach and some sparse vegetation. A few tufts of grass and low bushes are visible directly behind the car, growing out of a sandy bank, which suggests that the enviornment may be typical of a beach or near-coastal area, possibly prone to flooding or high tides.\n\nOverall, the scene contrasts the natural sand and vegetation of the background with the man-made, deteriorating presence of the car, which has been overtaken by natural elements over time. This image could evoke themes of decay, the passage of time, or the environmental impact of human items left in natural settings.","title":"Auto abandoned off the beach of santa rosa island","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["547911","547605","546315","547601","547835","547481","547839","547484","545540","546405","547132","546173","549107","553008","548752","553002"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","submerge","tuft","beach","dashboard","collapse","deteriorate","windshield","flooding","tide"]}
