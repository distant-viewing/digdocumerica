{"path":"546914.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy industrial scene, likely a shipping port or cargo loading area. The focal point of the image is the massive stacks of lumber loaded onto a ship or dock, each layer bound tightly with straps. The sheer volume of lumber suggests extensive import or export activity, an essential component in trade and logistics.\n\nThree workers wearing safety helmets are visible in the scene. Two of them are on the top of the lumber stacks, overseeing the operation or possibly securing the cargo. They appear to be communicating or coordinating with each other as they manage their tasks. The third worker, wearing a red helmet, is partially seen in the foreground, looking towards the stacks, which adds depth to the scene and emphasizes the scale of the cargo.\n\nA large crane or lifting mechanism is in operation, shown by a bundle of lumber suspended in the air by cables. This provides insight into the methods used to handle such heavy and bulky cargo, illustrating the mechanical power and coordination required in such operations.\n\nIndustrial buildings and structures faintly visible in the background, along with a murky sky, impart an atmosphere that is typical of industrious waterfronts. The environment suggests a combination of gritty industrial effort and organized activity, critical to successful cargo handling and shipping operations. The photo exudes a sense of hard work and the vital nature of manual labor in facilitating global trade.","title":"Unloading lumber from a ship docked at Dundalk Marine Terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546901","546917","546881","552303","552214","552148","555261","546910","552149","546762","546796","555797","552200","555283","542857","555270"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["lumber","cargo","stack","trade","operation","shipping","helmet","worker","lifting","bundle"]}
