{"path":"548992.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, the main subject is a man wearing a white robe with a red stole. His attire suggests that he might be a religious figure, such as a priest or a minister. He is standing with his back partially towards the camera, facing the large body of water in front of him. His right hand is raised, with the palm facing outward, perhaps in a blessing or preaching gesture.\n\nThe backdrop of the image is a vast, tranquil body of water that stretches to the horizon under a slightly overcast sky. The waters appear calm, and the lighting in the image gives the scene a serene, somewhat solemn tone. The far distance across the water faintly suggests the presence of a landmass or low hills.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the focus on the man in the foreground and the expansive water behind him, might imply themes of spiritual reflection, solitude, or communion with nature. The deep blue of the water adds a cool tone to the image, further enhancing the calm and thoughtful mood conveyed by the man's posture and setting.","title":"Baptism ceremony performed by members of North Las Vegas \"Church of God in Christ\"","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["547712","550826","547332","550268","545940","548990","548995","542556","547336","548972","549012","554002","550739","547554","554028","550217"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","robe","landmass","palm","face","gesture","man","raise","tone","imply"]}
