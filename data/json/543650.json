{"path":"543650.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an agricultural scene characterized by active irrigation on a cultivated field. The main focus of the image is a series of sprinkler heads in operation, emitting forceful jets of water that arc into the air and disperse over the bare soil. These sprinklers are mounted on poles angled slightly forward, likely to optimize water distribution across the land.\n\nThe photographed field is set on an incline of rolling terrain, with the ground bearing a dry, crumbly texture interspersed with occasional patches of green, possibly young crops or grass. Throughout the site, black and white piping is noticeable; these pipes run along the ground, connecting the series of sprinklers and likely carrying water from a nearby source.\n\nIn the background, the field borders a wooded area, densely packed with trees providing a darker, contrasting backdrop to the mostly brown and muddy terrain of the irrigated field.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, its muted color palette with a dominance of earthy tones, and the captured motion of spraying water create a vivid portrayal of agricultural irrigation practices aimed at facilitating crop cultivation on more challenging terrains. The scene intricately details human intervention in natural landscapes to enhance productivity.","title":"Tailings piles at this uranium mill have been covered with topsoil and seeded.
