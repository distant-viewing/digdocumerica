{"path":"546301.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a man working on a small fishing boat, which is situated on a body of water that appears to be the sea or a large lake, given the expanse of water shown in the background. The sky is clear with no visible clouds, suggesting it might be a sunny day, although the lighting in the photograph is slightly subdued.\n\nThe man is dressed in casual attire, wearing a white-striped polo shirt, blue jeans, and a white hard helmet. He is engaged in lifting a net full of what appears to be oysters or some type of shellfish, which is a catch from the sea. His posture and the strain visible on his face indicate the effort involved in raising the heavy net. He's gripping a rope or chain attached to the net, facilitating the lifting of the catch.\n\nThe boat has a simple, functional design with a flat deck and sides made of what looks like weathered wood, which is typical for a working fishing boat. Part of the boat is visible, including a bench along its length where tools or other equipment might be stored.\n\nIn the background, the horizon where the sea meets the sky is straightforward, emphasizing the open environment and the nature of outdoor, marine work. The composition of the photograph, with the man's action centered, highlights the physical nature of his task and the relationship between human and sea.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: aboard the dolphin.
