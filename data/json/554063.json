{"path":"554063.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling outdoor scene with a group of people, most likely tourists, gathered in front of a large building, the Pioneer Inn, which is a two-story structure characterized by its colonial-style architecture with balconies supported by pillars. The setting appears to be in a warm, sunny environment given the presence of palm trees surrounding the area.\n\nThe group primarily consists of older adults wearing casual, summer attire such as shorts, shirts, and hats, and many have sunglasses and carry bags or purses, suggesting they are engaged in touristic activities. The individuals are seen standing, sitting on benches, and chatting in small groups, indicating a leisurely pace typical of sightseeing or waiting for a guided tour.\n\nThe background of the scene shows several vintage cars and a distinctive green and yellow mini-bus with the words \"Honoler Line\" visible, which seems to be providing transportation for the tourists. The presence of these vehicles adds a historical or retro feel to the scene, suggesting the photo could be a few decades old.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph portrays a vibrant, sociable scene with visitors enjoying their day at a historical or significant tourist location, under a bright and clear sky, contributing to a lively and relaxed environment.","title":"Tourists just off buses crowd premises outside waterfront hotel at lahina.
