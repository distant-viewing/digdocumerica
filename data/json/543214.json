{"path":"543214.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two children, a girl and a boy, on a sunny beach day. They are walking along the shoreline, where the edge of gentle, foamy waves meet the wet sand. The young girl, to the right, appears to be in her early teens. She is wearing a long-sleeve navy blue top, denim shorts, and is barefoot. Her attention is focused downward, possibly watching her steps as she walks.\n\nBeside her, a younger boy, likely in his late childhood, is seen with a joyful expression and an energetic posture as he strides forward. He is dressed in a horizontally striped shirt in shades of red, white, and blue, paired with rolled-up blue jeans and is also barefoot. His hair is short, and he seems to be having a good time walking next to the water.\n\nThe background features a calm blue sea beneath a clear sky with no visible clouds, enhancing the bright and cheerful setting. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of leisure and enjoyment typical of a pleasant day at the beach.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543459","550229","548696","543392","547676","544200","548805","552341","557507","555892","543390","548793","547009","543225","544302","544206"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["girl","boy","beach","teen","navy","childhood","denim","step","enjoyment","sand"]}
