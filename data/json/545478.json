{"path":"545478.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly man and a younger woman in an indoor setting that appears to be a medical or possibly a physical therapy room. The elderly man, clad in a beige shirt and dark pants, is seated on what looks like a wooden treatment chair or bench. He has a somber or discomforted expression, looking downwards with his head slightly tilted forward.\n\nThe younger woman, with voluminous blonde hair, is dressed casually in a white, fitted t-shirt. She stands behind the man and seems to be applying or adjusting something on his back, possibly a medical device or administering some form of treatment. Her expression is focused and attentive to the task at hand.\n\nThe background is nondescript, featuring plain walls and a glimpse of what appears to be medical equipment or machinery, possibly for diagnostic or treatment purposes. The setting suggests a focus on health care or physical well-being. The overall mood conveyed is one of care and attention, with a hint of clinical sterility from the surroundings.","title":"Former machinist Mr. Wilbur Shuff undergoes treatment for emphysema.
