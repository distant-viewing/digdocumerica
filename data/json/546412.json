{"path":"546412.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a lively beach scene dominated by a large, contemporary high-rise building in the background, towering over a tropical beach setting. This building, with many balconies visible, seems to be a significant architectural feature amid a relatively undeveloped landscape punctuated by a few similar, though smaller, structures and some palm trees that give a coastal vibe.\n\nIn the foreground, the focal point is on the beach activity and several vintage cars, likely from the mid-to-late 20th century. Two noticeable vehicles are parked on the wet sand near the water's edge. These cars appear to be classic convertibles, one dark colored and the other perhaps blue or green, both featuring design elements common in older car models like large, rounded front fenders and open tops.\n\nBesides the cars, there are various people engaged in typical beach activities. Some individuals are near the water, potentially playfully interacting with the waves or walking along the shore. The environment is lively yet relaxed, with a casual atmosphere underscored by the informal attire and leisurely posture of the people.\n\nThe overall ambience seems tropical and leisure-oriented, combining elements of natural beauty and human activity in a setting that suggests a popular spot for both recreation and residing, given the proximity of the large residential building. The color quality and style suggest that the image could be a few decades old, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, considering the film's saturation and the style of the vehicles and building.","title":"Luquillo Beach","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547499","550934","546408","557475","547478","550925","545857","553764","550922","550921","557480","548698","550933","553689","553671","550930"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","car","fender","ambience","palm","building","recreation","saturation","balcony","film"]}
