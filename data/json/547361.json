{"path":"547361.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a river with a vivid red color, winding through a densely forested landscape. The river curves gracefully around heavily wooded areas, presenting a stark contrast between the bright, rusty-red water and the dark green tones of the surrounding forest. Several large, white boats or barges are spaced out along the river, with a couple clustered near what appears to be a docking area. The vessels stand out sharply against the red backdrop of the water. The photography captures the scene in rich, saturated colors, with the deep hues dominating the composition. Overall, the image has a somewhat remote and industrial feel, highlighting human activity within a natural environment.","title":"Cars abandoned in a field run-off area are visible only from the air.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["548934","550623","551608","550885","550570","550580","548921","546019","542701","542909","550527","552838","551199","550622","544749","542880"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","docking","forest","barge","photography","woode","vessel","couple","wind","cluster"]}
