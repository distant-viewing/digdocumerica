{"path":"553967.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene set against a backdrop of luxury residential homes perched on a lush, hilly landscape. The sky is vividly blue and cloudless, adding a calm, serene atmosphere to the setting.\n\nThe beach itself has golden sands and is met by the gentle, frothy waves of the ocean, which a few people are enjoying. There are several individuals seen in the sea; some are standing in the shallow water, possibly wading or splashing, while others are in deeper water, which suggests they might be swimming or simply cooling off.\n\nIn the background, there are numerous houses lining the hill, showcasing varied architectural designs and surrounded by abundant green vegetation, emphasizing an affluent, picturesque seaside community. The combination of the architecture and vegetation gives the scene an idyllic, almost tropical feel, suggesting a popular vacation spot or residential area by the sea.","title":"Hotel cottages above Nawiliwili Harbor near Lihue","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["553766","547641","553982","553765","546408","553782","557480","544638","553764","553983","553952","553671","547636","545162","543425","557523"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","luxury","sea","vacation","combination","spot","sand","vegetation","home","ocean"]}
