{"path":"551332.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural scene with a focus on pastoral activities. In the foreground and lower part of the image, there is a lush landscape partially framed by blurred green leaves at the top, giving a sense of looking through a hidden spot or a natural window.\n\nThe central and most prominent feature of the image is a sinuous river or stream, winding through a dense forest. The river, reflecting some light, contrasts visually with the surrounding thick green foliage.\n\nTo the left of the frame, on a sloped field, a tractor trailed by what seems to be a hay baler is captured in the middle of agricultural work. This equipment is creating patterned rows in the field, possibly laying down hay or collecting it, which adds a geometric aspect to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe scene encapsulates a serene and isolated atmosphere, typical of a secluded farmland area, possibly hinting at the activities of rural life and agriculture. The overall composition, dominated by shades of green and the natural curve of the river, gives a sense of peace and tranquility.","title":"Valley farm hay baling operation on the Niangua River just above pont where the river joins the lake proper off Route J.
