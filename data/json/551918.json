{"path":"551918.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a playful scene involving a police motorbike equipped with a sidecar. A person is seated in the sidecar, donning a dark leather jacket and a white helmet with the word \"POLIZEI\" printed across the top. Their expression is cheerful as they peer out from behind the clear, rounded windshield of the sidecar.\n\nThe sidecar itself is mainly white, with the word \"POLIZEI\" prominently displayed on a mounted sign at the front, likely indicating that this is a vehicle used by the German police force. Below this sign, there's a large, round headlight and what appear to be additional lighting or signaling devices, possibly for patrols or emergencies.\n\nThe overall setting seems urban, with a nondescript dark background that might be a closed garage or a shaded area, focusing all attention on the well-lit and amusing portrait of the individual in the police vehicle. The image captures a moment of levity, likely intended to amuse or entertain, contrasting with the typical seriousness associated with law enforcement vehicles and personnel.","title":"One of Vienna's \"finest\" on a BMW motor bike","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["558137","551917","546634","546661","551237","546663","544422","546659","551919","556206","546654","546665","546645","554354","546637","558232"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["police","word","enforcement","law","seriousness","vehicle","personnel","emergency","leather","windshield"]}
