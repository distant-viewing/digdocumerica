{"path":"551869.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor city scene on a rainy day. In the foreground, a man who appears to be a street cleaner is actively captured mid-movement, wielding a broom. He is dressed in work attire, including a grayish-blue uniform covered by a dark apron, and is focused on his task. His dynamic pose and the motion blur convey a sense of action and urgency in his sweeping.\n\nBehind the cleaner, several garbage bins and a cart loaded with various items suggest maintenance or cleaning operations. Other individuals, also dressed for rainy weather, can be seen handling items around the cart, contributing to a busy, utilitarian atmosphere.\n\nThe background features a blend of historic and modern architecture. On the left side of the image, there's a notable historic building with elaborate architectural details and a distinctive roof, adding a contrast to the more straightforward and modern style of the building on the right. The street is paved, reflecting the light shimmer of wetness from the rain, which enhances the glossy look of the surface, reflecting subtle details of the urban environment. The scene is overcast, with a diffuse light that saturates colors and emphasizes the wet conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of daily life in an urban setting, characterized by the combination of historic charm and contemporary life, all under the common conditions of city rain.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgängerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgängerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["546660","552748","551933","551936","546643","551873","546656","551872","545074","556177","549832","547094","553188","549845","551865","546639"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["cart","rain","wetness","broom","wield","cleaning","saturate","apron","bin","urgency"]}
