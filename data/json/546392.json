{"path":"546392.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque scene at dusk by a body of water, most likely a river or lake. The foreground shows the shimmering, smooth surface of the water reflecting the colorful hues of the sky and the lights from a riverside promenade. Scattered brightly lit lamps illuminate the edge of the water, casting a warm glow.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a densely vegetated area can be seen, possibly a small park or a line of trees along the riverbank. The central and right sections of the composition show a more developed area with buildings whose details are not very clear due to the time of day but are visible due to some lights.\n\nThe sky forms a dramatic backdrop with clouds tinged in purple and pink hues, suggesting either a sunset or the onset of a storm. One small boat is visible floating on the water in the foreground. The overall atmosphere of the scene is calm and serene, with a sense of quiet stillness enveloping the area.","title":"Caribbean coastline","placename":"Santa Isabel (P.R.)","location":"Santa Isabel, Puero Rico","nn1":["552263","552225","547230","543119","551223","547142","552311","557497","543956","543143","549099","551280","547110","548978","550299","551214"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["onset","tinge","storm","riverside","hue","water","vegetate","stillness","lamp","envelop"]}
