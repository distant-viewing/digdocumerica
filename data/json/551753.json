{"path":"551753.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a charming scene featuring a window of an aged stone building. The arched window is framed by a thick stone border and consists of dark wood panes reflecting the surroundings, which include a glimpse of a red brick building and trees. Placed in the window is a rectangular flower box filled with large, heart-shaped green leaves that are likely from a plant such as elephant ears. Below the window, small, delicate vines with tiny leaves trail over the edges of the box, adding a gentle, soft texture, contrasting with the bold, sturdy leaves.\n\nThe window sits over an elegant, ornate metal fence running horizontally, featuring detailed, artistic designs. The metal is painted black, which starkly contrasts with the warm brown and tan hues of the stone wall. The overall composition offers a picturesque slice of urban nature and architecture harmoniously coexisting, evoking a sense of peaceful, residential city life.","title":"Window box at 69th street between central park west and Columbus avenue in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547299","543028","549289","551722","551343","552535","543132","551754","548232","546497","552530","551703","551743","552498","557093","552492"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["window","stone","box","leave","vine","heart","ear","pane","coexist","metal"]}
