{"path":"545428.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a hazy urban scene bathed in a warm, golden-orange light, likely created by the setting or rising sun. The image is predominantly composed of a soft, diffuse landscape where the details of the cityscape are somewhat obscured by what appears to be heavy smog or fog. \n\nIn the foreground, we can identify some low-rise buildings that look somewhat industrial due to their flat rooftops and basic architectural style. No distinct features or signage are visible on these buildings, leaving their purpose and use to the imagination.\n\nFurther into the scene, more buildings emerge in layers of decreasing clarity due to the atmospheric conditions. Neither people nor moving vehicles can be discerned from this distance and under these lighting conditions.\n\nThe overall tone of the image evokes a quiet, possibly early morning or evening time, in a densely built environment. The upper portion of the image shows a gradient that transitions from a rich yellow-orange near the horizon to a deeper hue towards the top of the frame, suggesting a sun obscured by the heavy air or haze.\n\nThe photograph likely aims to create a mood or capture the environmental conditions of the urban setting, rather than detailing specific activities or interactions. The lack of clear, sharp lines and the homogeneity of the color palette contribute to a slightly dreamlike or otherworldly atmosphere.","title":"Smog.
