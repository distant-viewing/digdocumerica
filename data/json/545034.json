{"path":"545034.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a somewhat alarming environmental scene involving water pollution. Much of the image foreground is occupied by water that shows obvious contamination; the water's surface is streaked with unnatural colors, suggesting chemical pollutants or oil, which form swirling patterns of iridescent sheens contrasted against the darker shades of the water.\n\nIn the middle portion of the photo stands a sturdy, utilitarian bridge spanning the contaminated body of water. The bridge is supported by robust, dark metal or wooden pylons. No people or vehicles are visible on the bridge, which suggests it might either be infrequently used or captured at a quiet time.\n\nThe background offers a view of an industrial plant comprised of multiple large structures, including storage tanks and buildings with visible staircases on their exteriors. Smoke or steam billows from various points at this facility, reinforcing the industrial nature of the surroundings. The plant adds a backdrop of human activity and manufacturing, contrasting with the natural body of water in the foreground.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo encapsulates a tense juxtaposition between industrial activity and environmental impact, highlighted by the polluted water and the industrial infrastructure in the vicinity.","title":"Effluents from upstream pulp mill floating in Columbia River.
