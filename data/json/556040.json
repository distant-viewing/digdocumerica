{"path":"556040.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an old-style train station platform setting. Prominently in the foreground is an aged, weathered baggage cart. The cart features a flat wooden bed, raised edges, and metal frames, mounted on a pair of large spoked wheels at each end. The wood has a weathered, textured appearance and there is a visible identification number \"459\" painted on the side facing the viewer.\n\nBehind the cart, against the brick wall of the station, there is a framed train timetable chalkboard. The board displays a schedule for northbound and southbound train services, listed with columns for train numbers, times, remarks, and paths. The text and lines are written in white chalk, creating a stark contrast against the black surface of the board.\n\nAdditionally, the station's brick wall is visible, featuring a classic architectural style with a red and white color scheme. A window with a divided light sash and dark red framing can be seen to the right of the chalkboard. The platform itself is paved with herringbone patterned bricks, lending an orderly and historical feel to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a nostalgic and serene atmosphere, capturing a snapshot of historical railway infrastructure and tools.","title":"Baggage cart and timetable at Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, on the route of the lone star between Chicago and Houston, Texas amtrak took over a great variety of stations when it was empowered to oversee most u.s.
