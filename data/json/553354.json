{"path":"553354.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph features a dynamic and turbulent river scene dominated by a wide waterfall. The waterfall spans the middle of the composition, where water cascades forcefully over a curved concrete barrier. The water appears foamy and turbulent, indicative of its power and the height from which it falls.\n\nIn the foreground, concrete structures frame the river, signaling human influence on this natural landscape. The concrete is gray and weathered, showing signs of wear such as stains and minor debris accumulation. To the left, a vertical cliff-like wall provides a rugged edge to the scene. A vegetation-covered embankment is also visible on the left, contributing greenery and a sense of natural encroachment against the man-made structures.\n\nIn the background, beyond the waterfall, the environment reveals further signs of urban development. Fences and metallic structures partially obscure the view, suggesting a town or industrial setting nearby. The upper portion of the image fades into a set of buildings, hinting at the proximity of a more populated area.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a juxtaposition of natural force and human engineering, set against the backdrop of urban encroachment, emphasizing themes of interaction and impact between humans and nature.","title":"The EPA Water Quality Office and the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission together are assisting the construction of water pollution control facilities at Nashua.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["553349","553389","550736","553386","548061","550738","553372","542699","557745","550697","553387","549563","549557","550669","550857","549540"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","encroachment","stain","embankment","influence","accumulation","engineering","force","river","concrete"]}
