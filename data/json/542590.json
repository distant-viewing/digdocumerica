{"path":"542590.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking and desolate junkyard scene. The area is sprawled with various types of debris, primarily consisting of old and rusted car parts, chunks of metal, and miscellaneous scraps. The focal point of the image is a pile-up of decaying vehicles, which are rusted, crushed, and significantly weathered, indicating they have been discarded here for a long time.\n\nThese vehicles are haphazardly stacked atop each other, creating a chaotic amalgamation of shapes and textures. The colors of the cars, now mostly dulled shades of blue, white, and brown, blend into the surrounding earthy tones. Other noticeable objects include fragmented and bent car doors, fenders, and hoods, some still holding hints of their original paint. The cars are entangled with wild, dry shrubbery, suggesting a lack of human disturbance and the slow reclamation of the site by nature.\n\nThe background reveals a flat, arid landscape under a clear blue sky, typical of a vast, deserted area. This glimpses the location's isolation from urban settings. The horizon is barely discernible, emphasizing the expanse of the junkyard and its surroundings. Despite the clear sky, the overall mood conveyed by the scene is one of abandonment and decay. This desolate appearance suggests a remote area where these remnants have been left to deteriorate away from populous regions.","title":"Desert arroyo used as dump","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["546249","545365","552999","545340","549023","544060","546268","542656","553009","555491","543166","553006","547476","553004","545010","545303"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["junkyard","car","reclamation","fender","chunk","scrap","hood","shrubbery","disturbance","remnant"]}
