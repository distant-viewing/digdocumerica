{"path":"544659.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This is a striking photograph featuring a large silhouette of a ship set against a dark blue sky. The ship, probably a cargo or freight vessel given its visible cranes and structure, is backlit by a bright sun, which along with causing a lens flare, creates an intense glare over the water. This glare casts sparkling reflections on the surface of the water.\n\nThe majesty of the image is further enhanced by an atmospheric effect around the sun, possibly a halo that appears like a circular rainbow, which embraces a significant portion of the frame, adding a mystic quality to the scene. The sun sits low in the sky, suggesting either sunrise or sunset, which deepens the dramatic contrast and mood of the shot.\n\nThe overall ambience captivates the viewer with its strong play between darkness and light, and the presence of industrial civilization versus the natural elements. The horizon is minimal, but a slightly lighter strip of sky at the horizon line suggests a clearing or thinning of the atmosphere at that level. The general absence of any human activity or other objects besides the ship emphasizes the scale and isolation of the vessel in the marine environment.","title":"Sunset","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544655","544701","550918","544247","550304","555811","553857","544657","544251","544234","553991","550910","555721","550915","553742","551222"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["glare","ship","sun","vessel","halo","civilization","rainbow","flare","majesty","freight"]}
