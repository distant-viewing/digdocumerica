{"path":"555386.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a rugged, rock-strewn shoreline leading up to a body of water that appears to be a lake or reservoir, viewed under bright daylight. The foreground features a rough trail or path predominated by gravel and large stones, suggestive of a place not often traversed by vehicles. This path meanders toward the water, creating a natural leading line in the composition.\n\nOn the right side of the image, along the shoreline, there are two vehiclesâ€”a car and what seems to be a small truck or utility vehicle. Close to the vehicles, several individuals are engaging in activities near the water's edge, although their specific actions aren't clear due to the distance.\n\nThe lake itself is calm with no visible waves, bounded on the opposite side by a forested area that rises up into hills beneath a clear blue sky. The presence of trees both in the distance and closer, at the sides of the lake, gives a serene and secluded feel to the scene. Notably, the water level appears low, as indicated by the exposed shoreline, suggesting seasonal variations or possibly drought conditions.","title":"Detroit lake shown at an alltime low in the fall of 1973 due to sparse snowfall and rain the year before.
