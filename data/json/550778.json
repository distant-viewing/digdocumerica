{"path":"550778.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil rural scene centered around a placid lake bordered by lush green foliage. In the foreground, tufts of green reeds and grasses emerge from the water's edge, dipping into the lake. Their reflections, along with those of the surrounding trees and bushes, paint a mirroring image on the water's smooth surface, creating a serene and almost symmetrical visual experience.\n\nThe middle ground shows a gentle, grass-covered slope rising from the lake’s edge, leading up to a small hill. Nestled atop this hill and partially obscured by the verdant vegetation is a dark-colored shed or small house, which adds a hint of human presence to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nIn the background, the sky is clear and expansive, blending from a light, almost white hue near the horizon to a deeper blue as it stretches upward. The overall atmosphere of the photo is peaceful and suggests a quiet moment in a secluded natural setting, away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The elements in the photograph—the water, plant life, and sparse human habitation—coexist harmoniously, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of this rural idyll.","title":"Moen Lake--one of the many connected lakes of the 11,815 square mile Wisconsin River drainage basin.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548034","558093","550493","554527","543611","546963","548030","550779","545008","554526","550750","546530","551352","554776","557562","557569"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","dip","appreciate","hustle","coexist","reed","hill","grass","emerge","shed"]}
