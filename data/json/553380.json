{"path":"553380.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a rural outdoor scene, dominated by a river or stream flowing through a construction site. Focused primarily on the body of water, the image shows the waterway brimming with transparent, rushing water, and surrounded by a rugged earthen landscape littered with various sizes of rocks and boulders.\n\nTo the left, the riverbank is steep and largely composed of loose gravel and larger stones, suggesting recent excavation or earth-moving activities. The river transitions into a turbulent area with white water, indicating a small descent or rapid, which adds a dynamic element to the mainly tranquil flow of the rest of the river.\n\nIn the background, the scene extends to a more developed area where multiple vehicles and construction machinery are parked or in operation. These include some trucks and possibly earthmoving equipment, visible against a backdrop of sparse trees and clear sky. This setup indicates ongoing construction or land development activities in the vicinity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is a mix of natural and industrial, with the construction potentially impacting the immediate environment. The photograph itself is taken during bright daylight, as indicated by the vivid blue of the sky and the clear visibility of the details in both the foreground and background.","title":"Flag brook is being diverted to make way for a sewage treatment plant.
