{"path":"557088.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a serene image of a standalone church set against a backdrop of a clear blue sky. The building is traditional in design, with stonework walls and a sharp-pointed tower capped with a red roof, giving it a distinctive, quasi-Gothic architectural allure. Gothic arched doorways and windows enhance this historical aesthetic.\n\nTwo large trees flank the church, partially obscuring it and casting shade on its facade. They are lush and full, suggesting it could be late spring or summer. The church is surrounded by a well-maintained grass lawn, which contributes to the tranquility of the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, particularly the contrast between the warm earth tones of the church's stone and the cool blue of the sky. The composition effectively uses natural framing—with trees in the foreground enveloping the church—creating a sense of enclosed peacefulness.","title":"St.  Patrick's catholic church outside Atchison, Kansas, is an example of native stone pioneer architecture.
