{"path":"554466.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody scene in a natural setting. The central focus is an individual paddling a canoe in still, dark waters. The person is dressed warmly, wearing a light-colored hat and is seated, holding a paddle mid-stroke.\n\nThe background features towering, rugged cliffs that are partially obscured by darkness, creating an almost mysterious atmosphere. The cliffs are dotted with dense greenery, primarily composed of tall, slim trees that cling to the rocky surface. Directly behind the person, a chunk of the cliff seems to jut into the river, where a mass of dead, accumulated wood can be seen partially submerged in the water, possibly a result of a natural collapse or landslide.\n\nThe overall lighting is dim and moody, suggesting that this image was taken either during the early morning or late evening, which is further indicated by the shadowy and slightly grainy quality of the image. The reflections in the calm water add to the tranquility and isolation conveyed by the scene. The composition's play with natural light and shadow, alongside the solitary figure in the vast landscape, evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation.","title":"Kayak in still water beneath blue ledges on the upper Hudson River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554474","550822","554472","554609","544031","553806","547550","555078","550768","550831","557564","554471","557492","547245","553343","550659"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cliff","collapse","landslide","chunk","paddle","result","mass","canoe","person","darkness"]}
