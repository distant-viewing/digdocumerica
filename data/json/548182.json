{"path":"548182.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil sunset scene over a winding river nestled between lush hills. The key focus is the setting sun, which is positioned centrally in the frame, casting an orange and yellow glow across the sky. This glow gently reflects on the river's surface, creating shimmering patches of light amidst the darker areas of water.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features sloping hills and valleys which appear as dark silhouettes against the illuminated sky. The contours of these hills create a layered effect, adding depth to the scene. The river meanders through these hills, enhancing the composition with its serpentine shape. \n\nIn terms of atmosphere, the image portrays a serene and peaceful evening, with the sunâ€™s descent signaling the end of the day. The lighting is soft, with a gradient of warm tones transitioning into cooler hues towards the top of the photo, suggesting the presence of thin clouds or a fading sky. The bottom corners of the image are considerably darker, framing the brighter central portion and drawing the viewer's eyes towards the illuminated areas.\n\nOverall, the composition skillfully uses natural lighting and landscape features to evoke a sense of calm and majesty. The photograph's viewpoint, likely taken from a high vantage point, offers a sweeping overview of this picturesque setting.","title":"Sunrise over the Columbia River gorge between the hood river and The Dalles.
