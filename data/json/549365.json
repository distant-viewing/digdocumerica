{"path":"549365.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a section of a ship's hull, which is predominantly black in color with the name \"VILA VELIBITA\" painted in white, capital letters along the side. The image captures the texture details of the ship's surface showing signs of wear and tear such as scratches, rust patches, and chipped paint, emphasizing the vessel's age and exposure to harsh marine conditions.\n\nTo the right side of the frame, a rounded, textured object — possibly a fender used to protect the ship's side from bumping against docks or other vessels — hangs from a rope. This fender appears worn and has a rough, knobby exterior, indicating it has been used extensively.\n\nThe composition focuses extensively on contrasting textures and the interplay of light and shadow, which highlights the ruggedness of the ship. The background is not distinctly visible, drawing the viewer’s attention solely to the details of the ship’s side and the dock equipment. The ambient lighting suggests the photo might have been taken either during twilight or under a strong directional light source casting deep shadows and enhancing the textures of the ship's surface.","title":"The vila velebita ii, research ship for the ruder boskovic institute, receives partial financial support from epa","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["546040","550897","551581","546789","550891","542980","550058","549618","546858","549264","544657","550918","547572","543879","547474","548127"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","fender","vessel","dock","texture","scratch","capital","tear","chip","ruggedness"]}
