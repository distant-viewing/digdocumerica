{"path":"550573.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a varied landscape. The majority of the frame is filled with a large, barren quarry-like area characterized by deep cut patterns and terraces that indicate extensive earth-moving activities, possibly mining or large-scale extraction. The textures shown in these terraced areas are prominent and detailed, highlighting the massive scale of excavation.\n\nTo the left of the quarry, there is a contrasting patch of dense, dark green forest, providing a stark juxtaposition to the pale, barren landscape of the excavation site. This forestland features mature trees clustered closely together, and it borders directly on the edges of the excavation site.\n\nOn the bottom part of the image, there is a developed area with several buildings, roads, and pathways. The layout seems typical of a small, rural industrial or residential setup, with buildings scattered across the area. The roads are well-defined, curving and intersecting around the buildings and leading towards or away from the quarry.\n\nAcross the bottom, a major roadway or highway extends horizontally. This linear feature anchors the composition of the photograph, providing a sense of scale and access to the region.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a stark contrast between industrial activity and natural landscape, showcasing human impact on the environment through the extensive excavation and the retained patches of forest. This composition not only captures the physical diversity of the area but also invites reflection on the interactions between human endeavors and natural terrains.","title":"Abandoned gold dredge in the Gold-Stream Valley near the old mining town of Fox.
