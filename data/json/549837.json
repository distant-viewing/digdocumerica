{"path":"549837.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph presents an urban scene captured from an elevated perspective. It features a white garbage truck labeled \"Industria\" prominently positioned at an angle on a street corner. The truck's collection mechanism is visible at the back, and there appears to be trash scattered around it, suggesting that the truck may be in the process of collecting or has spilled some garbage.\n\nAround the garbage truck, there are at least four individuals, likely sanitation workers or pedestrians, standing and one appears to be working or picking something up near the rear of the truck. The street setting has other parked vehicles lining the sides, including a red sedan directly behind the garbage truck and a brown and a white car parked further down the street.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene includes a street lined by tall buildings with a mixture of windows and external fire escapes. Some commercial signage is visible, but not fully legible. The tree-lined street adds a touch of greenery to the otherwise grey and urban environment. The overall color tone of the image is subdued, with a worn feel that suggests the photograph might be from an earlier decade, possibly reflecting urban life in the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"Trash is picked up by sanitation workers on 172nd street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550147","550162","549832","550150","550154","549751","549844","549842","549765","549830","547975","545502","549840","549743","544091","549752"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["truck","garbage","street","sanitation","spill","escape","pick","mechanism","rear","line"]}
