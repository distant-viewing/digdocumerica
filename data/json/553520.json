{"path":"553520.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This image captures a touching and intimate moment between an older man and a young boy. They appear to be situated in a somewhat dim, urban alleyway. The older man, dressed in a short-sleeved plaid shirt and holding a can of Falstaff beer, is sitting with his back against a weathered brick wall that shows signs of age and some graffiti. The young boy, wearing a red shirt and blue pants, comfortably leans against the man, looking up at him with a sense of familiarity and trust.\n\nThe background includes the rugged textures of the brick wall and a grimy, darkened window, contributing to the gritty, urban feel of the setting. The lighting in the alley is subdued, casting deep shadows and enhancing the quiet, private moment they are sharing. The photo conveys a sense of closeness and perhaps a moment of rest or reflection in an environment that feels both aging and timeless.","title":"Ernest Watkins of Mulky Square, biscuit company worker and father of nine, sits on his front doorstep with his three-year-old son.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553521","553519","556527","543866","551948","551342","547410","557355","558186","557359","552859","556220","553558","543849","553094","552931"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["boy","alleyway","familiarity","brick","closeness","alley","beer","graffiti","wall","moment"]}
