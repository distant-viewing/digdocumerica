{"path":"551051.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene set against a dramatic mountainous backdrop. The foreground features a large industrial complex, with multiple buildings including structures that appear to be part of a factory or a processing plant. There are tall smokestacks visible, one of which is emitting a thick plume of dark smoke that rises high into the air. Behind the industrial complex, lush green mountains slope upward, clouded slightly by haze or mist, contributing to a somewhat moody atmosphere. The sky is overcast, and the colors in the photograph are somewhat muted, which gives the scene a subdued tone. This setting suggests issues related to industrial activity and environmental impact, emphasizing the contrast between nature and human-made structures.","title":"Looking up the kanawha river valley from deepwater toward Alloy where smoke from union carbide's ferroAlloy plant rises high into the air","placename":"Charleston (W.
