{"path":"547269.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays the back end of a vehicle, specifically focusing on the license plate area, which shows signs of wear and age. The vehicle is painted in a deep blue color, with noticeable scratches and paint wear, indicating it has been used extensively.\n\nThe license plate is from Nebraska, labeled as \"Cornhusker State,\" and is dated 1972 with the plate number \"34-A892.\" Above the license plate, there is another sign that reads, \"I'M PROUD TO BE A FARMER\" alongside an American flag, which suggests the owner's professional and patriotic sentiments. This sign also includes a mention of \"Vigortone Pre-mixes - Cedar Rapids, Iowa,\" indicating a connection or endorsement.\n\nBelow the license plate, part of the vehicle's machinery or structure is visible, showing hydraulic or electrical components that are also worn and dusty. These might be part of the vehicleâ€™s functional apparatus, such as a connection for towing or operating additional agricultural equipment.\n\nOverall, the image captures a snapshot of rural American life, highlighting agricultural identity and state pride through the choice of stickers and license plate. The worn condition of the vehicle and components suggests regular, practical use in a farming environment.","title":"A Nebraskan's mementoes","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["546193","550683","546177","550796","542533","544370","555462","545743","555619","546104","554369","547494","557701","544323","543671","550005"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["plate","license","vehicle","connection","component","farmer","owner","identity","tow","scratch"]}
