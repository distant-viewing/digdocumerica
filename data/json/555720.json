{"path":"555720.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This aerial photograph showcases a broad, sweeping view of an urban landscape, including both architectural and natural elements. In the foreground, a series of identical, multi-story residential buildings are visible, aligned near a road that runs parallel to a sandy coastline. Their organized, block-like structure implies a planned urban housing area, designed to accommodate a large number of residences in a relatively compact space.\n\nBeyond the residential area, a large, curving bridge spans a wide river, connecting the urban zones on either side. The bridge is a prominent feature in the photo, indicative of significant infrastructural development meant to facilitate transport and connectivity across the water.\n\nFarther in the background, the dense cityscape continues with numerous buildings, some of which rise significantly taller than others, suggesting a mix of residential and commercial zones. The skyline is quite extensive, and the city appears to be quite large.\n\nTo the right of the river, another section of urban development is visible, featuring smaller structures that are densely packed, suggesting older or perhaps less affluent urban areas.\n\nThe overall landscape includes areas of water, extensive urban architecture, and developed land, indicating a large, populous city. A hazy sky suggests either the time of day or some atmospheric conditions, possibly pollution. This photograph serves as a vivid documentation of urban living, infrastructure, and development.","title":"Rockaway Beach, Long Island, part of the heavily developed coast bordering the bight. The bight includes 15,000 square miles of ocean waters and the continental shelf off the coasts of New York and New Jersey. There are indications that the stress of man's activities has disturbed, if not damaged, the ecological balance which exists in the marine environment.
