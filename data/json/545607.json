{"path":"545607.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing on a rock outcrop with a stunning backdrop of a deep river canyon. The man appears to be a photographer, as he's equipped with multiple cameras, one of which is hanging around his neck and another by his side. He wears casual outdoor gear: a light long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and sturdy hiking boots. He is also holding a straw hat in one hand, suggesting sunny weather conditions.\n\nHis backdrop is a breathtaking view of a river canyon, possibly indicative of a location like the Grand Canyon or similar landscapes. The river below snakes through the canyon, creating a dramatic contrast between the smooth water and the rugged terrain. The distant horizon reveals layers of plateaus and mesas, under a broad, lightly clouded sky, emphasizing the vastness and isolation of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of exploration and admiration for the natural world, highlighting both the grandeur of the canyon and the rugged, prepared demeanor of the man observing it.","title":"Documerica photographer, David Hiser, at Dead Horse Point","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["545697","554500","545595","544917","545305","545762","545758","545689","544931","544895","544899","545599","545592","553962","545780","545798"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","admiration","river","mesa","plateaus","photographer","straw","hiking","neck","snake"]}
