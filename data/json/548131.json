{"path":"548131.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution and disregard for public spaces. In the foreground, a large, heavily filled and overflowing trash can is captured prominently. The trash can, appearing aged and rusted, bears text that includes \"KISN RADIO METRO EAST\". Surrounding the trash container, various pieces of litter—primarily plastic and paper waste—are scattered across a rough, unpaved ground.\n\nIn the middle ground, a white station wagon is parked facing the camera, appearing unoccupied, with no visible damage and in fair condition. The setting suggests an open area near an airfield, as suggested by the glimpse of airplanes and hangar-like structures in the far background. The environment overall has a somewhat barren, neglected feel, with a wire fence running horizontally dividing the different sections of the terrain. The sky is overcast, adding to the gloomy atmosphere of the scene. \n\nThis photograph likely aims to draw attention to issues of pollution, environmental negligence, or the effects of human activity on public spaces.","title":"\"viewing\" site for visitors at Portland airport--and the view they leave behind them","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547775","550801","543664","557307","543824","547983","551247","550248","551440","551245","544637","550258","555851","553433","553039","544640"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","can","disregard","pollution","aims","overflow","airplane","plastic","wagon","space"]}
