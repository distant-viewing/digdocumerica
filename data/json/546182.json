{"path":"546182.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial setting, specifically an oil field with an active pumpjack prominently in the foreground. The pumpjack, often referred to as a \"nodding donkey\" or \"horsehead pump,\" is painted in a muted red and has a counterweight at one end labeled with faded, barely legible safety instructions.\n\nThe landscape around the pumpjack features a dirt ground muddied and stained with oil, which is indicative of the operation and possibly leakage. Scattered equipment and debris, including barrels and nondescript machinery, are visible near the pumpjack, contributing to a sense of ongoing but unkempt industrial activity.\n\nIn the background, there are several large storage tanks of varying sizes and constructed from metal. These tanks are typically used for storing crude oil or other industrial fluids. The area looks semi-rural with a sparse selection of tall, thin trees lining the background, and no buildings or other infrastructure immediately visible beyond the industrial setup. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon, which casts a soft light over the scene.\n\nThe industrial elements juxtaposed with the natural surroundings convey a robust operational oil field that is somewhat isolated. The lack of human presence in the image focuses attention on the mechanical and structural components of the oil extraction process.","title":"Kimball oil field","placename":"Palestine (Tex.)","location":"Palestine, Texas","nn1":["549207","549209","549208","546135","546179","549211","546201","546064","545827","544272","555634","545815","544512","542632","545963","549959"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["oil","selection","tank","fluid","instruction","pump","extraction","field","barrel","lack"]}
