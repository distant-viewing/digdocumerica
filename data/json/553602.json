{"path":"553602.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image features a forest scene where a person is engaged in cutting a large fallen tree with a chainsaw. The person is wearing a hard hat, which is light in color and appears somewhat worn, and is dressed in a greyish blue work jacket. The individual's focus is on the task at hand, and their face is turned away from the camera, looking down towards the chainsaw.\n\nThe environment around the person is densely wooded, with numerous trees visible in the background. The forest appears lush, suggesting it might be a coniferous forest given the visible pine trees. The ground is covered in brown dirt, and wood chips are being ejected from where the chainsaw cuts into the tree, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph has a natural, somewhat filtered quality, possibly due to the canopy of trees overhead, which casts shadows onto the scene and its subjects. The photo effectively captures a moment of labor-intensive forestry management or wood harvesting, emphasizing the interaction between human and nature.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
