{"path":"557784.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an Oktoberfest celebration, indicated by a welcoming sign that reads \"Herzlich Willkommen!\" with a laurel wreath around a red center. Adjacent to this sign is a whiteboard providing details about the festival hours, stating \"Oktoberfest Hours\" with specifics of \"9 AM to Dark Sat.\" and \"11 AM to Dark Sun.\" It appears that the board is still being updated, as a person in a blue denim skirt and checkered shirt—visible from the back—is writing on it.\n\nThe setting includes a tent with a scalloped edge, under which several people are gathered around a table, engaged in conversation and likely enjoying the festivities. The overall atmosphere is casual and social, set outdoors during the daytime. The tent's purpose seems to be either for dining or general gathering. The background also shows lush greenery, suggesting the event takes place in a park or similar recreational area. The focus of the photograph is on the welcoming sign and the ongoing activities, conveying a sense of invitation and festivity.","title":"The alpine village theme of Helen began taking shape in January, 1969, after local merchants decided to change the town's image in an attempt to increase trade. The first Oktoberfest was held in 1971 and has become an annual event. Festivities for 1975 took place in a large circus tent set up just outside the downtown shopping district of Helen. Renovation of the business district resulted in increased tourism and a new alpine development that will double present facilities.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557786","557802","557792","557800","557787","558264","558287","551789","558266","551688","557794","551874","558294","551808","551847","557934"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["festivity","tent","specific","sign","welcome","festival","dining","celebration","write","skirt"]}
