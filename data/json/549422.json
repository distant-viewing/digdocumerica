{"path":"549422.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This image captures a sailing boat at sea, equipped with a large, vibrant spinnaker sail. The spinnaker exhibits a spectrum of colors, predominantly red at the top, transitioning through white and yellow, to green at the bottom. At the junction of the mast and the spinnaker, the boat's sail number \"13029\" is visible, repeated in inverse on the spinnaker itself suggesting transparency or double-sided print. \n\nOn the boat, several individuals are visible. The crew appears composed of three young adults clad in swimwear, suggesting leisure or recreational sailing. One person is at the stern, handling the sail rigging, while another is standing more centrally on the boat, slightly leaning towards the equipment, potentially adjusting or steering. A third crew member is sitting at the front, holding onto the rigging, partially facing the back of the boat. In the water beside the boat on a rope, a fourth person is waterskiing, adding a dynamic aspect to the scene.\n\nThe surrounding environment illustrates typical open water features with small waves, and there is no land or other boats visible nearby, indicating that this boat is sailing in open water potentially far from shore. This scenario conveys a sense of adventure, teamwork, and enjoyment of water sports and sailing.","title":"Running before the wind on Chesapeake Bay in the Annapolis-Newport race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549421","548491","549386","549425","548526","548513","549404","548494","548522","549392","548495","548203","549394","549426","547456","549389"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","sailing","sail","rigging","crew","spectrum","junction","swimwear","print","steering"]}
