{"path":"548091.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and industrial scene dominated by a raging river flowing through its center. The river, filled with turbulent white water, appears powerful and swift, and leads the viewer's eye towards a large building and a bridge in the background.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is an industrial-style building with large windows and the word “CRYSTAL” painted prominently on its side. This building has an aged appearance with light-colored walls and is positioned directly next to the river, suggesting its operations might be utilizing the waterway.\n\nFurther in the background, a metal truss bridge spans across the river. The bridge, characterized by its geometric structure and greenish color, contrasts with the natural, chaotic movement of the water below.\n\nThe sky is clear and appears to be quite bright, indicating that the photo was likely taken on a sunny day. The overall composition and setting suggest a scene where industry meets nature, providing a snapshot of environmental and man-made interaction.","title":"Spokane River and falls in downtown Spokane","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548061","547238","550673","553392","550647","549514","547242","553389","553380","548098","550710","548097","553395","551519","549515","550854"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["bridge","river","crystal","span","word","waterway","snapshot","building","industry","eye"]}
