{"path":"550173.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a gritty industrial scene dominated by thick smoke and dark colors. In the foreground, a residential or minor roadway with a diamond-shaped road sign visible but not legible. The road itself hosts a few visible vehicles including a blue sedan moving towards the camera and another dark-colored vehicle further up the road.\n\nThe background prominently features large industrial structures, including multiple vertical towers, which give the appearance of chimneys or smokestacks. There are dense clouds of dark smoke billowing into the sky from these structures, significantly contributing to the haze that envelops the entire scene. Additionally, there are other industrial elements like scaffolding and electrical lines crisscrossing above.\n\nIt appears to be an overcast day, as the sky is uniformly cloudy and adds to the somberness of the overall atmosphere. This scene could possibly be depicting environmental pollution issues typically associated with industrial areas. The image captures a moment that illustrates the impact of industrial activities on the surrounding environment.","title":"Clark Avenue Bridge is rendered almost invisible by heavy industrial smoke.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550179","551033","549967","550181","550983","550175","551034","550185","550982","551054","545447","557218","550981","550172","550171","551057"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["road","diamond","smoke","scaffolding","host","crisscross","roadway","billow","issue","sedan"]}
