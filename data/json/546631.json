{"path":"546631.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a city street. In the foreground, there is a man in a police uniform, turned away from the camera and writing on a ticket pad. He is positioned beside a green car, which appears to be a classic model based on its design. The vehicle has a prominent trunk and shiny, reflective chrome bumper. The policeman wears a duty belt equipped with various gear, and he stands close enough to touch the car, possibly indicating that he is issuing a parking ticket or citation.\n\nBehind the policeman and the car, there is a partial view of another vehicle, possibly a bus, indicated by the windows and the height of the vehicle compared to the police officer.\n\nIn the background, urban elements can be observed, such as the blurred outlines of trees and buildings lining the street. There is a hint of a street sign and other typical city infrastructures.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo, enhanced by its muted and somewhat grainy quality, suggests it might have been taken in the later part of the 20th century. The colors are subdued with a mostly cloudy sky, contributing to a somber urban setting. Overall, the composition focuses on the police officerâ€™s activity of writing a ticket, capturing an everyday moment in urban life.","title":"Ticket for speeding","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546635","546661","546653","555461","546654","556720","549932","554293","554309","546663","557841","546743","546630","555447","542755","546647"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["ticket","police","officer","write","street","car","vehicle","bumper","city","chrome"]}
