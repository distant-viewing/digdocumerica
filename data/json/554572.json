{"path":"554572.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural forest scene focusing on a large boulder slanted and partially covered with green moss. The boulder, deeply shadowed in parts, contrasts with illuminated patches highlighting its rugged, textured surface. Surrounding the boulder, the forest floor is littered with leaves and twigs, bearing witness to the deciduous environment. In the foreground, young ferns and other small green plants are thriving, contributing to the lush, verdant feel of the scene. They are bathed in ample sunlight, which facilitates their vibrant appearance against the darker, shadowed backdrop of the forest. There appear to be tree trunks in the distance, indicating that the boulder is located within a densely wooded area. The natural composition of the photograph emphasizes tranquility and the untouched aspect of a forested landscape.","title":"Moss on rock and horsetail (Equisetum) in the foreground in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["558086","554596","547635","542753","558083","558082","544435","553358","554554","555000","545271","555057","555183","555058","554999","543549"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["boulder","forest","fern","twig","aspect","trunk","floor","leave","tranquility","appearance"]}
