{"path":"548011.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph showcases an aerial view of a suburban area characterized by a mix of residential properties and lush greenery. The perspective offers a view from above that captures numerous detached houses, each with distinct roofing styles and surrounded by well-manicured lawns. The neighborhood layout is visible with streets gently curving around houses, enhancing the community's aesthetic appeal.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several prominent homes, one with a bright red roof that stands out against the more commonly seen gray and brown roofs. The properties are bordered by tall trees, offering shade and a sense of seclusion. Flawlessly maintained gardens with varying vegetation are noticeable, indicating a community that takes pride in its environment.\n\nTowards the middle of the image is a road that meanders through the area, with vehicles visible, suggesting routine residential activity. This road connects to a larger highway visible in the far back of the photograph, hinting at easy accessibility to broader infrastructure and possibly urban centers beyond this serene suburban setting.\n\nFurther in the distance, the horizon is marked by a range of mountains, providing a dramatic backdrop and a sense of depth to the landscape. The sky is mildly overcast with patches of blue, suggesting a bright yet calm day, ideal for an outdoor setting like this one.\n\nOverall, the image captures a peaceful, well-established suburb that blends residential comfort with natural beauty, situated in a location that benefits from both accessible urban facilities and an appealing natural environment.","title":"Residential area","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557547","557552","553700","553929","548026","547769","558057","546399","553939","556956","557454","549071","547211","558059","553937","556974"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["property","suburb","pride","house","accessibility","comfort","roofing","community","seclusion","appeal"]}
