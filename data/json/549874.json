{"path":"549874.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy urban scene, likely captured from an elevated perspective, looking down on a densely packed street crowded with vehicles and pedestrians. The scene is characterized by a large number of cars, including many yellow taxis, which suggest the location might be a major city like New York. The vehicles are closely packed, suggesting heavy traffic congestion or a traffic jam. Pedestrians can be seen crossing the street and walking along the sidewalks, navigating around the stationary cars.\n\nThe street has multiple lanes and is bustling with activity; it appears to be a main thoroughfare. Various signs, including traffic signs and commercial billboards, are visible, adding to the urban feel. There are also traffic lights at several points which are contributing to the management of vehicle and pedestrian flow.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image is slightly dim, giving it a somewhat gloomy or overcast look, which may enhance the feeling of congestion and urban hustle. The picture captures a moment in city life that emphasizes the density and busyness typically associated with a metropolitan center.","title":"Massed traffic in herald square","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549849","552711","548419","549899","553893","556732","548410","554315","554310","556727","556729","549886","556807","554314","549863","552710"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","pedestrian","congestion","street","busyness","jam","vehicle","pack","taxi","thoroughfare"]}
