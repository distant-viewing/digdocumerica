{"path":"543731.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an action scene on a BMX or dirt bike track. There's a person mid-ride on a bicycle, handling a steep, dirt bank on the track. The rider is dressed in typical BMX attire, including a long-sleeve top and pants, and is wearing a helmet for safety.\n\nThe landscape of the track area is sparse and open, giving a feel of an outdoor or rural setting. The track itself is made up of mounds of dirt, specifically designed for the sport, with contours that include peaks and valleys to challenge the riders.\n\nOn the left, a safety fence runs along the edge of the dirt mound, helping to define the track boundary and providing safety. In the background, the scene includes a collection of vehicles—likely belonging to spectators and participants—which are parked irregularly across a field, suggesting this event isn't at a formal sports facility but more likely a community or local track.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, suggesting variability in weather, typical of an outdoor sports event setting. There are faint outlines of buildings or structures in the distant background, further indicating that this location is on the outskirts of a developed area or in a rural community dedicated to recreational sports like BMX or motocross biking.","title":"Motorcycle race","placename":"Loveland (Colo.)","location":"Loveland, Colorado","nn1":["543723","543727","545150","553955","545788","542532","545318","553954","551382","545598","544038","557990","553056","553908","557535","550069"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["track","sport","dirt","safety","rider","mound","variability","event","bike","community"]}
