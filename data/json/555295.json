{"path":"555295.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an architectural scene focused on a rustic wooden structure, possibly a cabin or small home. The building is constructed primarily from logs and rough-hewn timber, reflecting a traditional or rural style. The facade includes two visible windows and one door. The door on the left is half glazed with a yellow frame, contrasting with the mostly natural wood tones of the structure.\n\nOne window is clear and large, offering a reflection of trees and sky, indicating that the building is set in a natural environment possibly surrounded by a forest. The other window seems to be open, with a man standing by it, looking outside pensively. He wears a casual white shirt and appears to be engaged in thought or observing something outside the frame.\n\nThe roof of the building is partially visible, featuring uneven wooden slates that suggest it is unfinished or undergoing repairs. The upper portion of the walls under the roof reveals the log construction's ends, adding to the rustic charm of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a peaceful yet somewhat solitary mood, emphasizing themes of nature, solitude, and perhaps contemplation or a pause in work. The lighting and composition focus on the textures of wood and stone, contributing to a strong sense of place and time.","title":"Log home under construction in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where solar heating panels will be installed in the roof.
