The setting is illuminated by warm, golden sunlight, suggesting that it is either sunrise or sunset, casting long shadows and highlighting the signs’ vivid colors and eclectic designs.\n\nThe street is lined with numerous motels, as evidenced by the towering and densely packed signs, each vying for attention with bright colors, bold text, and enticing messages such as \"POOL,\" \"FREE TV,\" \"COLOR TV,\" and \"AIR CONDITION.\" Prominent among them are signs reading \"MOTEL,\" \"SAFARI,\" and \"SILVER SLIPPER GAMBLING HALL.\" These signs reflect a mid-20th-century American aesthetic, characterized by flashy neon and bulb-lit signage designed to attract motorists.\n\nIn addition to motels, there are signs advertising other commercial establishments such as \"B.F. Goodrich,\" indicating the presence of auto-related services, which complement the motels catering to road-trippers. There’s also mention of amenities like a \"FAMILY UNIT,\" \"LARGE ROOMS,\" and a \"24 HOUR RESTAURANT,\" which suggest facilities meant to offer convenience and comfort to travelers.\n\nThe foreground of the photo shows a road filled with vintage cars, indicative of the era, with their designs suggesting the late 1960s or early 1970s. The cars are mostly in motion, with their headlights visible, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe background, though overshadowed by the commanding signs, shows the tops of some buildings and a clear, deep blue sky, offering a hint of the urban environment in which these businesses operate.\n\nOverall, the photograph effectively conveys the atmosphere of a busy, commercial urban roadway from a bygone era, characterized by its automotive culture and the prominent role of road travel in American life.","title":"Las Vegas street scene","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549008","549014","549113","553017","545618","554550","545216","554709","551494","549224","545614","551135","554183","555438","551321","555446"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["motel","tv","sign","business","mention","streetscape","convenience","auto","road","era"]}
