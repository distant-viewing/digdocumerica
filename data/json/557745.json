{"path":"557745.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a serene rural scene featuring a river with two distinct elements. On the right, a waterfall cascades forcefully down, creating a dynamic white splash as it hits the river below. This section of the river, churned by the waterfall, appears frothy and full of energy. In contrast, the left side of the river is calmer, with its surface gently disturbed by small ripples as it flows around a collection of rocks.\n\nBehind the waterfall, older, timeworn buildings with faded and peeling paint add a rustic charm to the scene. These structures, which seem to serve either residential or perhaps light industrial purposes, contribute to the rural, slightly neglected atmosphere. The area around the buildings appears lush, with dense foliage and mature trees framing and partially obscuring the view, which enhances the feeling of discovering a hidden gem in the countryside.\n\nForeground foliage adds a layer of depth to the image, with leaves lightly framing the top corners, drawing the viewerâ€™s eye towards the waterfall and buildings. This framing technique provides a natural border that enhances the idyllic, secluded feel of the environment. The overall composition balances elements of nature with hints of human habitation, suggesting a symbiotic coexistence in this particular landscape. The lighting in the image suggests a bright but overcast day, softening the colors and contributing to the tranquil mood.","title":"This mill on the Chattahoochee River at Nacoochee continues to produce stone ground corn meal and flour. Called the Nora Mill, it is located one and a half miles southwest of Helen, on State Highway 17/75. The Georgia Mountains Planning Commission's 1975 community growth plan for Helen recommends that efforts be made to preserve the mill site as a scenic and cultural attraction. Located near Robertstown, Helen is a tourist attraction with a Renovated business district in a Bavarian alpine theme.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558087","550979","545878","554408","550976","542594","557820","549552","550738","555073","550843","554409","550736","545839","553389","545874"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","river","cascade","countryside","technique","foliage","coexistence","border","framing","splash"]}
