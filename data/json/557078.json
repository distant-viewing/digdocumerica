{"path":"557078.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a middle-aged man standing outdoors with a grand, historic building serving as the backdrop. The building appears to be a large church or cathedral, characterized by its prominent brick construction and architectural features such as arched windows, detailed brick patterns, and a large circular window near the top of the facade.\n\nThe man is positioned in the foreground on the left side of the image and is facing slightly to his right, looking off into the distance. He wears glasses and is dressed in a dark overcoat, giving him a thoughtful, contemplative appearance.\n\nThe environment is overcast, suggesting it might be a cool or cloudy day. There's a lawn area visible in front of the building, with some sparse young trees and grass, which are somewhat muted in color, likely due to the lighting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its mix of architectural beauty and a solitary figure, evokes a sense of serenity and introspection.","title":"Father Eugene Dehner, professor of biology at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas. This religious order settled in the state very early. The church in the background was built in 1864 and the priory was constructed in 1857.","placename":"Atchison (Kan.)","location":"Atchison, Kansas","nn1":["546495","549335","553537","547332","545520","550376","557082","546463","551263","558396","551346","557952","550739","558162","548888","557140"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["overcoat","brick","introspection","serenity","church","window","lawn","building","facade","man"]}
