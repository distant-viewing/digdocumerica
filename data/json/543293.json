{"path":"543293.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a beach scene featuring a single person wandering near the edge where the sea meets the shore. The aerial or high-angle perspective captures the beach with a mix of sandy areas and darker patches where seaweed or marine plants have collected. The textures created by the interplay of the smooth, wet sand and the rough, tangled seaweed add complexity to the scene.\n\nThe person in the photograph appears to be a shirtless man wearing shorts, walking through the shallow water, but leaving little disturbance in the sand, which suggests that the water is shallow and possibly calm. His shadow is sharply defined on the sand, hinting at a sunny day with strong overhead sunlight.\n\nThe surroundings are predominantly natural and unspoiled by human-made objects, focusing the viewer's attention on the natural beauty and serene atmosphere of the beach. This setting communicates a sense of isolation and tranquility, emphasized by the vastness of the beach and the sparsity of human presence.","title":"California--point lobos reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["547943","547612","546953","547607","550826","547600","548757","543078","545195","546970","547596","555402","546982","543287","557509","554159"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","seaweed","tangle","shorts","collect","communicate","disturbance","person","complexity"]}
