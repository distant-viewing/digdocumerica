{"path":"552764.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young child sitting on the steps of what appears to be a residential building. The child is dressed in a patterned shirt, shorts, and shoes, with their hands resting on their knees and their gaze directed slightly off to the side.\n\nThe steps where the child is seated are wooden and weathered, indicating age and exposure to the elements. There are three apparent levels of steps leading up to a landing where two doors are visible. Each door is framed with dark wood and topped with a decorative arched transom. The door numbers '211' and '213' can be seen, suggesting this might be an apartment or multi-family dwelling. The edge of each door features a classical-looking column design, adding architectural interest.\n\nBetween the two doors, there's a tall, narrow window covered with a light-colored curtain, enhancing the residential feel. The overall tone of the scene is quiet and somewhat reflective, focusing on the solitary figure of the child in a relatively aged and textured urban environment.","title":"Child on steps of a North Philadelphia row house","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556165","551729","545338","545436","557796","558151","552742","546529","550137","553497","544207","553553","545526","549973","545319","556164"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["door","step","child","dwelling","landing","apartment","knee","curtain","shoe","column"]}
