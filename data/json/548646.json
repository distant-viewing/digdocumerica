{"path":"548646.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is a vibrant and engaging photograph depicting three elderly women seated on a park bench under the shade of a large tree. The setting emits a relaxed and social atmosphere, seemingly at a park or a similarly communal outdoor area.\n\nFrom left to right: The first woman is wearing a bright peach or pink top paired with white and pink striped shorts. She is actively engaged in a conversation, gesturing with her right hand near her head. The second woman, seated in the middle, is dressed in a sleeveless, black and white checked dress and seems to be listening intently to the first woman while making eye contact. She is wearing a white purse around her shoulder. The third woman, on the far right, is wearing a red and white printed dress and a white hat, looking slightly away from the camera with a neutral expression. She holds a white purse on her lap.\n\nAll three women are wearing comfortable shoes and their attire is casual yet neatly assembled, suggestive of a warm day likely spent enjoying leisure activities. The background is slightly obscured by the dappled shade of the tree, yet some buildings and perhaps other park amenities can be glimpsed. This backdrop contributes to a sense of tranquil urban life, where people find time to unwind and socialize in public spaces. The overall mood is lively and companionable, capturing a moment of everyday sociability among friends.","title":"Typical scene in the south beach area, location of a large retirement community","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["546855","557175","547772","548647","548625","553208","548626","551444","551013","551466","552722","553205","556176","551815","551817","553359"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","purse","socialize","park","assemble","amenity","contact","spend","friend","seat"]}
