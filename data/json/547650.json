{"path":"547650.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river scene filled with foam. The view extends along the river, which snakes through a landscape edged by rugged, rocky shores covered with sparse vegetation. In the foreground, the river is densely packed with white foam, creating a textured blanket over the water's surface. The middle of the river is relatively clear with visible dark blue, choppy water, hinting at a strong current, while further foam clusters sparsely dot the water towards the distance.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features rocky hills with gentle slopes, and the vegetation appears to be low shrubs or bushes, typical of a harsh, possibly coastal environment. The light suggests it's either dawn or dusk, which casts soft shadows and contributes to a slightly muted yet warm color palette. The sky isn't visible but the lighting conditions infuse the scene with a serene yet wild nature.\n\nA shadow of the person taking the photograph, presumably cast by the low sun, is visible in the right part of the foreground, giving a personal touch and indicating the position of the observer relative to the scene. The photograph not only depicts a natural occurrence but also subtly includes the human element through this shadow, bridging a connection between the viewer and the moment captured.","title":"Suds and foam on an incoming tide show effects of increasing development of the bay and coastal area","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547502","557252","550370","557240","544856","553388","549482","542743","552137","553855","550742","553416","553653","550658","549442","549550"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["foam","river","infuse","observer","shadow","current","snake","blanket","connection","dawn"]}
