{"path":"544135.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial mining scene during dusk or under overcast conditions. A large mechanical bucket excavator is in the process of unloading a substantial load of rocks into a heavy-duty mining dump truck. The visible section of the excavator shows a huge, open metal basket filled with rocks nearing the top of a tipping point where its contents are cascading into the truck's hold.\n\nThe dump truck, marked with the name \"ANAMAC MINE\" across its side, is positioned directly beneath the excavator's basket. It's notable for its rugged design, heightened ground clearance, and large wheels, typical of vehicles used in harsh mining environments. A dusty atmosphere envelops the scene, reflecting the gritty nature of the activity and the location.\n\nIn the background, a subdued mountainous landscape provides a stark contrast to the industrial activity. The terrain consists of piles of similar rocks and earth, suggesting ongoing extensive excavation work. Another dump truck is visible in the far back, maneuvering within the mine site, further underscoring the expansive scale of the mining operations.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of dynamic industrial action, focusing on the powerful machinery and the harsh, rugged conditions typical of such environments. The lighting conditions add a somewhat grim and gritty ambiance to the scene.","title":"Strip mining operations at the Navajo Mine of the Utah Construction and Mining Company.
