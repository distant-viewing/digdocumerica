{"path":"552345.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a serene sailing scene during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the soft lighting and muted colors of the sky. In the foreground, the silhouette of a person is visible; they are seated on a sailboat, facing away from the camera toward a scenic view of several small sailboats on calm water.\n\nThe individualâ€™s outline and posture suggest relaxed engagement, likely managing the boat or simply enjoying the view. Their hair is short, adding a casual, sporty vibe to the setting.\n\nMultiple sailboats are distributed across the water in the middle ground, each equipped with sails raised, indicating light wind conditions favorable for sailing. The sails of these boats, while small, vary subtly in design and color, ranging from solid hues to combinations of red, blue, and white. Some sails display numbers or logos, typical for racing or regatta events.\n\nThe background is composed of a distant shoreline covered with dense trees, typical of a lake or protected bay environment. The horizon blends with the sky in a soft, indistinct line, further enhancing the tranquil mood of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its perspective from behind and slightly above the seated individual, invites viewers to share in the peaceful experience of gentle sailing in a picturesque, natural landscape.","title":"Sailboat race by members of the Tacoma Yacht Club on Puget Sound on an almost windless evening","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548521","544669","548118","547781","552039","544224","547273","544667","552346","549411","547754","551541","547757","552343","548510","551539"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["sailing","sail","sailboat","regatta","racing","boat","experience","combination","logo","wind"]}
