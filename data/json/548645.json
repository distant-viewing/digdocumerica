{"path":"548645.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures two men in a tropical, outdoor setting, likely a park or a beachfront walkway. The foreground features an older man sitting on a concrete bench, leaning against a palm tree. He is dressed in a suit and tie, wearing a hat, and has crossed his arms and legs, giving an impression of relaxation or perhaps a nap. His attire suggests a formal or traditional style, juxtaposed against the casual setting.\n\nIn the background, another older man sits on a similar bench. He's dressed in lighter, casual clothing and is also resting, with his head tilted back slightly and his eyes closed. Between these two men, a pathway curves through the scene, edged by other palm trees, which lend a lush, tropical feel to the environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is calm and serene, highlighted by the presence of mature palm trees and the evident coastal breezes suggested by the palm fronds. The setting appears to be a public space designed for relaxation and leisure, with a focus on allowing visitors to enjoy the natural beauty and tranquility of the area. The colors in the photo are vibrant, with the greens of the trees and the gray of the pathway vividly depicted, lending a sense of vividness and immediacy to the setting.","title":"Siesta at South Beach","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["546387","553208","552722","551940","555991","548647","557713","550051","552723","548615","549321","551815","557079","554120","544988","552727"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["palm","relaxation","bench","pathway","immediacy","frond","man","breeze","tree","vividness"]}
