{"path":"551003.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and somewhat disheveled rural setting with a focus on a young boy and a damaged vehicle. The scene unfolds on a narrow dirt road, bordered by patches of grass and some small buildings. The background features lush green hills, contributing to the overall rural atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, a young boy, who appears to be in his early teens, is riding a bicycle. He is moving towards the camera with a relaxed posture, holding the handlebars lightly. He wears a long-sleeve dark shirt, pants, and sneakers, suitable for a casual day outside.\n\nDirectly to the boy’s right is a severely wrecked red pickup truck. The truck’s body is extensively damaged; the roof is peeled away, and the interior is exposed and appears destroyed. Both the passenger and driver-side doors are missing, and various debris surrounds the vehicle, suggesting it has been left in this state for quite some time. This includes random pieces of metal, a disconnected wheel, and other unidentifiable parts scattered around the dirt road.\n\nAn array of small houses or shacks can be seen in the background, along with an overgrown area that edges the road. These structures appear modest, with simple, utilitarian designs typical of a rural setting. The condition and simplicity of the buildings match the rustic and somewhat neglected feel of the overall scene, which is accentuated by the lush, wooded hills rising in the distance, emphasizing the isolated and rural environment of the photograph.","title":"Rand, W.Va., with much of its population living in poverty, has many unpaved roads, substandard houses, and junked autoMobiles.","placename":"Charleston (W.
