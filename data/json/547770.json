The image illustrates several highways that intersect and merge, with numerous cars visible on the roads, suggesting heavy traffic.\n\nVisible in this scene are various ramps and flyovers facilitating the movement of vehicles between different roads. The highways are flanked by wide green grassy areas as well as patches of undeveloped land. Commercial buildings, parking lots filled with cars, and industrial structures are seen adjacent to the roadways, indicating a mix of commercial and possibly light industrial uses in the area.\n\nThe horizon shows a more densely built urban area with high-rise buildings, suggesting the vicinity of a city center. The backdrop features a clear sky, subtly blending into the haze which might be indicative of either weather conditions or air pollution.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph underscores a bustling urban area, emphasizing infrastructure designed to handle significant vehicular traffic and the urban sprawl typical of many modern cities.","title":"Memorial day traffic on stemmons freeway, west of downtown Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547780","552719","546709","553015","553838","546726","548332","546713","546612","546686","546714","546608","546681","553001","547764","546734"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","roads","ramp","infrastructure","city","sprawl","underscore","facilitate","flanke"]}
