{"path":"552652.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene, presumably during a festive or communal gathering. The image, vibrant in color and dynamic in its composition, is taken from a low angle, adding a dramatic flair to the scene.\n\nIn the center of the frame, a bundle of colorful balloons floats against a contrasting backdrop of a clear blue sky scattered with clouds. The balloons cast a festive tone and are tied to strings held by individuals in the gathering.\n\nThe photograph includes a diverse group of people, mostly adults and a few children, clustered closely together. These individuals appear engaged in a community event or celebration. The attire varies, with some wearing casual modern clothes, while others sports what could be traditional or cultural garments, including hats and patterned shirts.\n\nParticularly noticeable is a child in the foreground, whose back is to the camera. This child is reaching up, possibly pointing at the balloons or interacting with someone in the crowd. The expressions on the faces of the people, as much as can be discerned, suggest engagement and happiness.\n\nArchitectural elements of the background indicate this might be a town setting, with visible facades of buildings lining the street. The natural light and shadows suggest that this could be a daytime event.\n\nOverall, the photograph vividly encapsulates a moment of community interaction and celebration, emphasized by the high spirits seen entertained by the use of balloons, which traditionally symbolize joy and festivity.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["553272","556217","551689","553294","551688","549569","551811","557798","552653","553287","557721","553239","557799","551789","553233","553142"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["balloon","celebration","child","gathering","bundle","flair","happiness","festivity","string","spirit"]}
