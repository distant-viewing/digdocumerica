{"path":"554293.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene, likely from the mid-20th century judging by the models of the vehicles and the overall aesthetic. The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly a busy city street with commercial establishments lining the background.\n\nProminently featured in the image is a line of various vehicles, representative of different types of transportation of the era. On the left of the photo, a police officer is seated on a classic police motorcycle. The officer, wearing a standard police helmet, is positioned in front of a large truck. Next to the motorcycle, occupying the central part of the image, is a taxi with a distinctive checkerboard pattern along the edges of the roof, indicative of the iconic taxicabs from this period. The taxi has a yellow body, a common color for cabs during this time.\n\nAlso visible in the image are other vehicles, including another yellow taxi and several older model cars and trucks, depicting a busy traffic scene. The vehicles are closely packed, suggesting perhaps congested traffic or a traffic stop.\n\nThe background shows traditional mid-century American architecture with signs of wear, possibly indicating older, well-used city buildings. Various signs are visible, including one for a bar, suggesting a lively commercial area. The environment appears overcast, with wet roads reflecting possibly recent rainfall.\n\nOverall, this photograph serves as a rich snapshot of city life during this historical period, highlighting aspects of everyday urban transportation and the hustle of street activity.","title":"6th avenue and 32nd street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","549848","554331","554314","549932","546743","554330","549873","548331","554309","548410","549869","549872","550139","547651","549859"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","police","officer","motorcycle","traffic","vehicle","city","street","period","model"]}
