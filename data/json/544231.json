{"path":"544231.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a cheerful and lively scene where two young women are involved in washing dishes outdoors. They are positioned in a rustic wooden boat thatâ€™s filled with various kitchen utensils such as pots, pans, and bowls, some of which are submerged in water inside a large metal basin. The setting is sunny and appears to be by a body of water, suggested by the visible water surface in the background.\n\nOne of the women, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and a white shirt over a red-and-white bikini, is smiling broadly as she rinses a plate. The other woman, who has water-drenched hair, is wearing a blue swimsuit and actively washing a dish inside the basin. Both seem engaged in their task but also enjoying the moment, highlighted by their bright expressions and casual wear that suggests a warm, relaxed environment.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with vibrant colors and natural lighting, emphasizes an atmosphere of youthful energy and a sense of simple, outdoor living. The background is minimal, focusing attention on the activities and interactions of the women in the boat, enhancing the intimate and informal nature of the scene.","title":"Goose point fisherman's children","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["543952","553800","543944","551409","544197","553835","554904","548618","543943","552945","550823","554611","548503","549996","552123","552952"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["dish","basin","wash","woman","utensil","kitchen","bowl","pot","bikini","intimate"]}
