{"path":"551203.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view depicting an industrial setting near a body of water. At the center of the image, there seems to be an industrial facility with large structures, possibly for loading and unloading materials. The facility is directly adjacent to the water, with several docks visible extending into the water. Some boats can be seen near these docks, likely associated with the industrial operations.\n\nA road runs through the center of the image from the foreground into the distance, bordered by dense forests on either side. The road connects various parts of the industrial site, linking different buildings and structures. In the far background, the landscape is dominated by rolling hills and patches of cleared land, indicating other areas of development or land use beyond the immediate industrial site.\n\nThe overall setting appears remote, surrounded by natural landscapes, but significantly altered by industrial activity. The photograph captures a mixture of natural beauty and industrial development, showcasing human interaction with the environment in a specific geographical context.","title":"Conveyors, running far back into the hills, bring coal to the Valley Camp plant on the Kanawha River where it is loaded on barges and rail cars.","placename":"Charleston (W.
