{"path":"553732.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a man engaged in manual labor, specifically stacking boxes.\n\nThe man is partially visible; his face is obscured by a large cardboard box adorned with colorful imagery, including a large pineapple and the text “Hawaii.” He is wearing a dark cap and seems to be in the process of transferring the box from one stack to another or organizing them. His forearm muscles and some strain on his face indicate the physical effort involved.\n\nIn the foreground and forming a large part of the composition are stacks of white and gray boxes arranged neatly in rows. These boxes have visible inscriptions that read \"AERO\" and have images of small blue flowers. The construction of these boxes suggests they are designed for produce, possibly for items similar to what might be indicated by the pineapple box the man is handling.\n\nThe background is soft-focused but appears to include trees (likely palm trees given the fronds) and a partial view of a building with a plain, light-colored wall, suggesting a tropical or semi-tropical setting, compatible with the contents marked on the boxes.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment from everyday labor, emphasizing themes of agriculture and commerce, set in a possibly warm, agricultural region.","title":"Gift packs ready for shipment from Honolulu international airport","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["549084","557110","557687","554855","549048","555246","546918","555244","548790","554936","553612","549850","549050","554937","546914","554047"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["box","stack","labor","frond","transfer","imagery","inscription","cardboard","produce","commerce"]}
