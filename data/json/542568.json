{"path":"542568.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dense forest scene predominantly filled with towering sequoia trees. The perspective is from ground looking slightly upwards towards the canopy, which consists of multiple layers of branches causing a diffused filtering of sky and light, possibly indicative of mist or fog. Dominating the foreground is a rectangular wooden sign attached to a post, which reads “RESEARCH AREA ECOLOGY OF SEQUOIAS DO NOT DISTURB” in white painted, capital letters.\n\nThe mood of the image is serene and slightly mysterious due to the obscured light and dense forest backdrop. The trees surrounding are tall and straight, their bark rough and dark, stretching high out of frame. The atmospheric conditions, possibly mist, give the light a soft, ethereal quality, enhancing the sense of tranquility and seclusion. The forest floor is not visible, but the surrounding vegetation suggests a lush environment typical of a sequoia forest ecosystem.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the theme of conservation and research, emphasized by the presence of the sign which suggests that the area is protected for scientific study and should remain undisturbed. The towering trees enhance the feeling of being in a majestic and ancient natural environment.","title":"Heavy fog","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["542745","542575","554990","542750","542748","554966","555125","543447","542725","542569","553574","554968","545488","546947","542930","555051"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["forest","mist","capital","filtering","seclusion","conservation","fog","study","bark","research"]}
