{"path":"553882.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene under a bold, sunny sky. In the foreground, there's a person lying face down on a beach towel, enjoying the sun. Their skin glistens, suggesting sunscreen or water, enhancing the feeling of a hot day. Slightly to the right and further back, another person is walking along the beach, contributing to the dynamic of beach activities.\n\nThe beach is sandy with relatively gentle waves in the background, and a few more people can be seen near the water, perhaps paddling or playing. The sky is strikingly blue with minimal cloud coverage, and the sunlight is powerfully depicted, creating lens flares that add a vivid, almost picturesque quality to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition includes strong elements of leisure and relaxation typical of a beach setting, enhanced by the sparkling reflections on the water and a general sense of peacefulness.","title":"Miami beach.
