{"path":"548834.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a leisure scene at a natural water setting. In the foreground is a wooden dock extending into the frame from the bottom right corner, leading the eye towards the water. Near the center of the photo, an individual is captured in mid-air, executing a dive towards the water. This person is wearing patterned shorts and appears to be very close to the water's surface. Another person is visible in the water to the right, apparently having just emerged from a swim, looking towards the diver.\n\nThe background features a rocky hill that slopes down to the waterâ€™s edge. This landscape has sparse green vegetation. Electrical poles and lines are visible, stretching atop the hill, hinting at human development nearby. The calm water and clear skies suggest a serene, sunlit day, perfect for water activities.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on outdoor recreational activities in a natural setting, with an emphasis on the dynamics and movements of swimming and diving.","title":"Swimming in havasu lake","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["552227","551165","553444","553443","550838","544339","549088","546349","553439","551092","554007","550829","549030","548083","545229","544343"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","dive","diive","diver","swimming","dynamics","swim","hill","near","sunlit"]}
