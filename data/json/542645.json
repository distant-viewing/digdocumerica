{"path":"542645.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a vast, vibrant field of colorful flowers, predominantly in shades of white, orange, and yellow. The blossoms are densely packed, covering the entire visible area of the field which stretches towards a distant horizon under a blue sky. The upper part of the image shows a hilly terrain with sparse vegetation and a dirt trail running parallel to the flower field. Along the ridgeline, a fence is partially visible, and a few scattered trees can be seen in the distance. The overall image captures a lively pastoral scene, evoking a sense of tranquility and the beauty of nature in full bloom. The lighting suggests it's either morning or late afternoon, as the colors appear soft and the shadows are not harsh, adding a gentle warmth to the scene.","title":"Fields of daisies near vandenberg air force base","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["542641","544574","542642","550781","552503","543206","542704","544439","544443","549158","545723","553076","557541","557098","549229","554111"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["field","blossom","flowers","warmth","trail","bloom","scattered","parallel","evok","fence"]}
