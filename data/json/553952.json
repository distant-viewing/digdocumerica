{"path":"553952.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and lively scene at a beach. The setting appears to be a sunny day with clear skies and a few cumulus clouds. The beach is bordered by an ocean on one side, characterized by small waves lapping against the shore. A rocky outcrop, covered in dark volcanic rocks, divides sections of the beach and extends into the water.\n\nSeveral people are scattered across the frame. In the foreground and on the rocks, there are individuals of varying ages, mostly wearing casual, bright patterned clothing typical of beach settings; many are in shirts which might suggest a tropical location. Some people are looking into the ocean, possibly watching others who are swimming or involved in aquatic activities. There is also a man standing, camera in hand, perhaps capturing moments from the day.\n\nIn the midground, on the sandy part of the beach, there are more people engaging in different activities. A person can be seen bending over near the water's edgeâ€”potentially picking something up or playing in the sand. The beach extends into the background, leading to areas with more vegetation and trees, possibly palm trees, which enhance the tropical feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vivid colors, the texture of the rocks, the dynamic sky, and the variety of activities, portrays a pleasant day out at the beach, full of relaxation and leisure.","title":"Japanese tourists stand on rocks to watch the Hawaiian fishermen.","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["543322","547628","553686","557458","555923","553684","548541","547503","547482","546942","553685","553683","551931","546874","550932","550919"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","rock","ocean","cumulus","people","outcrop","palm","day","relaxation","midground"]}
