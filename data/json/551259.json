{"path":"551259.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a serene lakeside scene with several elements of interest. The image captures an array of covered boat slips, where multiple boats are docked under protective roofs with stripe-patterned awnings. The boat slips are arranged in a row, extending into the lake, creating an organized aquatic garage-like environment.\n\nIn the foreground, to the right of the slips, there's a parking lot adjacent to the lake, mostly empty but hosting a few cars and trailers suggesting some visitors or boat owners might be around. Next to the parking area, on the lake, are larger boats, including a houseboat anchored close to the shore and another couple of boats that seem ready for leisure activities.\n\nThe surrounding environment contributes a natural serene beauty to the setting, with tree-covered hills encircling the lake, providing a lush green backdrop. Also visible, to the far right across the lake, is a sandy beach area beside which further boat storage facilities can be seen, possibly indicating this as a popular spot for boating and lake activities.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a tranquil, recreational lakeside setting, likely intended for boating enthusiasts and visitors appreciating the calm and beauty of a natural landscape. The scene is relaxed, with no visible humans, emphasizing the peacefulness of the environment.","title":"On Route 5 marina, west of the bridge across the Niangua arm of the Lake of the Ozarks","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551258","543527","543579","557562","546856","544266","552297","551679","544126","547757","551219","554485","554610","552987","542908","554552"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["boat","lake","boating","visitor","parking","owner","enthusiast","awning","lakeside","garage"]}
