In the foreground, on the left side of the image, there is a prominent sign for the \"Honeymoon City Motel\" which indicates that guests can see \"The Falls from your motel room\" and mentions \"Off Season <\\\\> Rates.\" Below this is another advertisement for a restaurant claiming \"Moderately priced luncheon and dinner,\" which is air-conditioned and includes sightseeing tours.\n\nTo the right in the midground of the photograph, more colorful and eclectic signs are displayed. One particularly noticeable sign reads \"Louis Tussaud's Wax Museum\" with appended advertising of different attractions like \"Life,\" hinting it might be a part of the museum's exhibits. Various other signs with the names and logos of different businesses can be seen, including ones advertising a liquor store and a motel with ‘VACANCY’ displayed.\n\nIn the background, there's a large building, suggesting a multi-story hotel or residential block, adding to the urban setting of the image.\n\nThe street scene shows a couple, possibly tourists, walking along the sidewalk. The woman wears a white hat and carries a handbag, dressed in light colors, while the man beside her is in a darker, simple outfit. Their casual strolling and the way they observe the surroundings imply they are exploring the area, soaking in the touristic environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo captures a bustling tourist district, with a focus on commercial advertising and pedestrian activity, reflecting a lively atmosphere geared towards visitors.","title":"Amusement section of Center Street, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, offers lures on all sides for tourists and honeymooners.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["552406","554550","552411","550127","545154","549017","549536","553017","549014","552397","551125","551494","548402","550130","549113","549008"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["tourist","motel","attraction","advertising","sign","accommodation","rate","guest","sightseeing","museum"]}
