{"path":"542661.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged man operating several pieces of technical equipment outside of a two-story building. The man, dressed in a white short-sleeve shirt and dark tie, is focused on his task, holding a clipboard and pen as he interacts with the machines. The equipment includes a set of gray boxes with dials and screens, possibly pertaining to air monitoring or environmental data collection.\n\nThe setting appears to be a government or institutional building as indicated by the text \"STATEWIDE AIR POLLUTION RESEARCH CENTER\" prominently displayed on the facade above the man. The architecture of the building includes a simple, modern design with stairs leading up to a suspended walkway on the first floor, and white railings visible above.\n\nIn the background, there is a tall, thin pine tree and lush greenery indicating a well-maintained outdoor area, possibly in a suburban or campus environment. The sky is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day. This, along with the slightly bluish tint of the photograph, adds a vintage feel to the image, implying it might have been taken some years ago.\n\nOverall, the composition gives the sense of a professional engaged in scientific or environmental research, highlighting a moment of focused activity within a serene setting.","title":"Edgar Stephens, professor of environmental science at Statewise Air Pollution Research Center, using an optical particle counter","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542662","542663","549625","552371","551595","542659","553907","547740","542776","542765","544499","557829","552112","549628","557317","549364"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["campus","professional","screen","clipboard","government","datum","dial","pen","monitoring","equipment"]}
