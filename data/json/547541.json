{"path":"547541.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an aquatic scene focused on debris collected on the surface of a body of water. The image captures a mixture of organic materials, possibly reeds, sticks, and other plant detritus, gathered at the edge of the water. These elements are densely clustered and interwoven, appearing somewhat dark against the contrasting water.\n\nThe water itself appears dark and deep, hinting at significant depth beyond the immediate surface clutter. There are no visible reflections, suggesting the image might have been taken under direct sunlight or with a polarizing filter. Small glistening spots, likely caused by the sunlight reflecting off the water and the moist surfaces of the plant matter, add a textured and sparkling appearance to the debris.\n\nThe photo's composition focuses closely on the debris area, taking up the majority of the image, while a sliver of open water visible along the right edge provides context and contrast. The overall mood conveyed is one of natural, unstructured wilderness, possibly highlighting ecological interactions at the water's edge.","title":"Oil on Marsh Creek in Warwick","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551604","552054","551602","542582","550207","543558","550341","549311","549641","552046","545923","555784","552158","555626","550812","550834"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["water","debris","edge","detritus","matter","clutter","surface","filter","stick","majority"]}
