{"path":"544995.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a fishing environment, showing a pile of large, silvery-blue fish, possibly tuna, in the foreground. These fish are stacked in a haphazard manner on what appears to be a wooden surface, probably a dock or a part of a fish processing area. The fishes show signs of wear and some bruising on their bodies, indicative of recent capture and handling.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a partial view of a building that looks like a typical seaside shack or facility associated with fishing activities. It features a wooden structure with visible siding and a roof extending over a porch-like area where the fish are placed.\n\nIn the background, two individuals are visible. Both are wearing casual outdoor clothing, one in a blue jacket and the other in a tan or light-colored shirt. They are standing on what seems to be a gravel or sandy area, engaged in a conversation or observing something off-camera.\n\nThe environment in which these individuals stand is sparse and open, suggesting a remote or rural coastal location. In the distant background, an overcast sky and calm sea can be seen, creating a chilly and tranquil seaside atmosphere. \n\nOverall, the composition captures a typical moment in the life at a fishing dock or processing area, illustrating the aftermath of a fishing trip and the interactions of those involved.","title":"Fishing dock","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545063","547551","550297","551396","545178","554095","544987","545093","554098","545198","547562","545211","545193","550320","554200","545180"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fish","fishing","seaside","dock","processing","shack","capture","trip","handling","aftermath"]}
