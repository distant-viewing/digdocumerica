{"path":"547187.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a city skyline at sunset or sunrise, visible through a large net that fills much of the foreground. The net's mesh creates an overlay against the skyline, with large parts of the net stretching diagonally across the image. Several tall buildings are silhouetted against a softly glowing sky that fades from a warm pink at the horizon to a deep blue above. A body of water in the lower portion of the image mirrors the pink hues of the sky, suggesting the time of day when the sun is just below the horizon. There are no visible people or moving objects, creating a serene and calm atmosphere. The contrast between the urban buildings and the natural beauty of the sky and water adds a layer of tranquility and depth to the scene.","title":"Smelt nets hanging from lake Michigan seawall.
