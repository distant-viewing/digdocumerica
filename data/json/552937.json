{"path":"552937.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a desert landscape strewn with numerous discarded and rusted tin cans partially buried in the sand. The foreground is heavily covered with these cylindrical, metallic wastes, which progressively diminish in concentration towards the background. The cans vary slightly in size and shape, creating an uneven surface across the sandy terrain. Some of the cans have their tops exposed, showing signs of corrosion and wear.\n\nVisible in the middle ground are small sand dunes, their smooth curves contrasting with the rough texture of the littered cans. Sparse desert vegetation, consisting of a few low shrubs and dry grasses, appears intermittently across the scene, adding a touch of life to the otherwise barren environment. \n\nThe background of the image hints at a mountainous landscape under a bright, clear sky, suggesting a wide, open desert space. The lighting appears to be natural, contributing to the sharp detail and enhancing the contrast between the metallic sheen of the cans and the muted colors of the sandy desert. This composition showcases a striking scene of environmental degradation set in a natural, yet harsh, desert habitat.","title":"Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (35 miles west of the Salton Sea).
