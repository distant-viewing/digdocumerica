{"path":"545108.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a beach scene with several distinct elements. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of driftwood scattered along the sandy beach. These pieces of wood are of various sizes and shapes, ranging from small branches to large logs, some partially buried in sand.\n\nCentered in the middle ground is a large, multi-story building positioned right on the shoreline. This modern-looking structure has a series of balconies facing the sea, suggesting it might be a hotel or apartment complex. The design includes rectangular forms with moderate architectural detailing. Adjacent to this building, on the left side, there's what appears to be a staircase leading directly to the beach, indicating access for the residents or guests.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is visible with moderate waves crashing onto the shore, under a clear blue sky. There are a few people on the beach; some closer to the waves, possibly enjoying the seaside or walking along the shore.\n\nThe overall scene captures a juxtaposition of natural and man-made environments, highlighting human interaction with coastal landscapes. The presence of the driftwood suggests recent storm activity or a natural accumulation point for ocean debris. The photograph has a clear, bright quality, with natural light enhancing the textures and colors of the scene, from the rustic tones of the driftwood to the neutral colors of the building and the vibrant blues of the ocean and sky.","title":"Condominium on the beach","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["543069","544989","545111","542888","542973","542889","543052","545052","544617","555469","542886","542890","543075","545121","548051","548055"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["driftwood","beach","ocean","accumulation","guest","wave","shore","bury","seaside","hotel"]}
