{"path":"543817.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, eroded trench filled with mud and rocky debris, likely the aftermath of a landslide or erosion. The trench runs through the center of the image, showcasing its significant depth and the rough texture of its sides, where layers of earth and sediment are exposed. The ground is uneven and covered with scattered stones, small rocks, and patches of mud, reflecting a recent geological disturbance.\n\nThe surrounding landscape appears barren and devoid of vegetation, suggesting a severe environmental condition, possibly a quarry or a construction site impacted by natural forces. The sky overhead is cloudy, casting a dim, overcast light over the scene, enhancing the rugged, desolate appearance of the environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a striking image of natural devastation or significant land alteration, emphasizing themes of environmental change and the power of natural processes.","title":"Boulder County's landfill dump.
