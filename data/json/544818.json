{"path":"544818.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The image captures the interior of a large industrial or laboratory facility, characterized by its spacious and high-ceilinged design. A substantial portion of the photograph is dominated by a large, segmented cylindrical structure placed centrally on a platform. The segments of the cylinder are voluminous, and it features various protrusions and pipes on its surface, which suggest it may be some kind of machinery, possibly a part of a rocket, submarine, or other large piece of equipment. The cylinder is sleek, metallic, and colored in subdued shades of light gray and cream.\n\nIn the surrounding area, the floor is neatly paved with brick, which together with the sunlit conditions, creates an alternating pattern of light and shadows. The light penetrates the scene through the glass windows located high on the walls and from row of rectangular skylights from above, hinting that the photo was taken during daytime.\n\nTo the far right of the image, near the brick wall, there's a smaller, elevated platform with a rectangular, wooden table. A figure, possibly a technician or an engineer, is present there, seemingly engaged in examining or potentially repairing a device that sits on the table. Another table nearby holds what appears to be tools or other pieces of equipment.\n\nAlong the wall, there are a few mounted items like cabinets or control panels, which suggest that this facility is used for operations or experiments requiring precise control and monitoring. A few other items like what seem to be a dustbin and some sort of draped object or machinery can also be noted.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of industrial or scientific activity within a facility geared for significant technological or experimental functions. The presence of the people, though limited, confirms the scene's purpose involving human operation and showcases a working environment.","title":"Turbines at St. Urain nuclear power plant, which will supply power for 330,000 people","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["555330","555324","543158","546923","544153","555374","553329","546189","549684","544026","555332","557387","557388","552003","543997","544822"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["cylinder","table","control","wall","facility","platform","engineer","skylight","protrusion","brick"]}
