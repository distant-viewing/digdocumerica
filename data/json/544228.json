{"path":"544228.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a worn, white sign hanging on a metal grille, serving as the central subject of the image. The sign is stark against a blurred background, which seems to depict a harbor or waterfront area.\n\nThe sign reads, \"POSITIVELY NO FISHING BICYCLES PETS DOGS Allowed on Wharf\" in bold black and red letters. The capital and bold letters highlight the restrictions, while \"Allowed on Wharf\" is written in smaller black lettering at the bottom. The name \"FELIX L. CORINO HARBOR MANAGER\" is included at the signâ€™s bottom, identifying the author or enforcing authority.\n\nThe background of the sign is speckled with dirt, implying age and exposure to the elements. The metal grilles featuring in the foreground have peeling paint, predominantly off-white, confirming the outdoor and weathered setting. Below the railing, a slightly out-of-focus waterscape can be seen, suggesting that the sign is posted on a pier or a similar waterfront location.\n\nThe blurred background features faint outlines of buildings, masts of boats or ships, and a generally gray overcast sky, suggesting a chilly, possibly windy coastal environment. The overall color tone is cool, enhancing the sense of a damp, marine setting. The focus on the sign, with the background softly out of focus, emphasizes the prohibition message, possibly hinting at issues of adherence or controversy given the specificity of the bans listed.","title":"Lake Pontchartrain waterfront","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548846","547918","548836","554567","543168","547992","550664","548845","547850","547144","546966","547865","553749","554103","554119","552211"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","grille","letter","waterfront","bottom","waterscape","authority","restriction","capital","mast"]}
