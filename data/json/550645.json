{"path":"550645.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image portrays a dramatic and rugged mountain landscape. In the foreground, dark, jagged mountains with sharp peaks are prominently featured. These mountains have patches of snow and ice clinging to their slopes, accentuating their steep and uneven surfaces. The coloration of the mountains shifts from dark at the peaks to slightly lighter tones towards the base, suggesting the presence of vegetation or a difference in the geological makeup.\n\nIn the background, a larger mountain mass covered mostly in snow and ice can be seen. This section of the mountain is enveloped in thick, low-lying clouds, giving the scene a mystic and ethereal quality. The clouds obscure the top of the mountain, making it difficult to discern its full height and shape.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is moody and somber, enhanced by the overcast sky and the enveloping fog. The contrast between the dark rocky surfaces and the white snow adds to the dramatic visual impact. The image conveys a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty, typical of remote mountainous regions. This landscape could be part of a larger mountain range, likely situated in a colder climate given the presence of ice and snow.","title":"Glaciers guarding the entrance to thompson pass.
