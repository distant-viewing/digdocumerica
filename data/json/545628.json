{"path":"545628.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a panoramic view of large-scale salt evaporation ponds. The image captures a series of multicolored rectangular ponds arranged in parallel stripes. The colors of the ponds vary from shades of brown, pink, and white, attributed to the different stages of salt concentration and microorganism activity in the saltwater. A large body of water, appearing silvery under the light, borders the ponds on the foreground.\n\nIn the middle of the image, a vehicle, possibly involved in maintenance or salt collection, can be seen traversing one of the brown-colored paths separating the ponds. The background is dominated by a rocky, barren mountain, suggesting that this saline operation is located in a large flat area possibly near a coastal or desert region. The overall composition offers a mix of natural and industrial elements, highlighting human intervention in natural landscapes for resource extraction.","title":"Settling ponds of the Texas gulf sulphur company's potash division plant","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545627","544782","548601","548602","548600","544686","545623","548640","544685","555860","545619","553867","555865","552991","550405","548635"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pond","salt","attribute","traverse","extraction","intervention","resource","separate","concentration","collection"]}
