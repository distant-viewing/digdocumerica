{"path":"550184.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene characterized by multiple smokestacks emitting thick, dark smoke against a blue sky. The foreground is shaded, hinting at a late afternoon or evening time, which darkens the details of the industrial structures below. There are flags visible, suggesting some form of operational facility, likely a factory or plant, emphasized by the robust industrial activity evident from the smoke. Visible in the background, beyond the smokestacks, is a large spherical structure, possibly a storage tank or gas holder, partially illuminated by ambient sunlight. The composition strongly focuses on environmental impact, contrasting the dark smoke and industrial setting against a relatively clear sky.","title":"Ford foundry in brook park, just outside Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545491","550169","550981","557304","545994","545435","550983","548376","544691","543011","544173","545920","550871","544696","548377","546908"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","smokestack","holder","darken","emitte","gas","flag","factory","tank","evening"]}
