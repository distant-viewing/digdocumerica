{"path":"552892.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals biking on a gravel road that cuts through a rugged landscape dominated by dramatic rock formations. The prominent rock formation in the background stands tall with a pointed peak and a textured surface, composed of numerous boulder-sized rocks and outcroppings. The weather is clear and sunny, enhancing the deep blue of the sky and the varied grey tones of the rocks. The terrain surrounding the road is sparse with patches of grass, and the overall atmosphere suggests a remote, possibly arid environment. The bikers, dressed casually and with backpacks, seem to be enjoying a leisurely ride in this unique and natural setting.","title":"Tufa rock formations near the pinnacles on the south side of Pyramid Lake.
