{"path":"549007.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is a visually intriguing photograph that initially appears complex due to its composition and perspective. It features a person engaging in an everyday outdoor activity, but presented in an artistic manner. The photograph captures a scene reflected in a body of water, creating an intriguing visual flip of the world above it.\n\nThe main subject of the image is a man squatting near a water's edge. He is wearing a wide-brimmed hat and is in the process of either collecting water or performing some other task involving plastic containers. There are three visible plastic containers: one is in his hand, and two others are on the ground beside him. His attire includes a shirt and pants, suggesting a practical outfit suited for outdoor or work activities.\n\nThe background, or rather the reflection, includes delicate tree branches and leaves, creating a lace-like pattern across the sky, which is likely the surface of the water capturing this reflection. The trees appear to be softly blurred, likely due to the gentle movement of the water.\n\nThe unique artistic element of this photograph is the use of reflection, which not only inverts the image but also adds a layer of texture and depth through the interplay of focus and distortion. The colors in the image are muted, with a calming palette of blues and grays interspersed with the darker tones of the vegetation and the earthy colors of the man's attire and the containers.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a serene moment, blending human activity with natural elements in a setting that likely speaks to themes of sustainability, resource gathering, or daily life in a rural or natural environment.","title":"Epa technician collects water sample from pahranagat lake about 10 miles south of alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548972","542556","549012","546298","548956","546293","545940","550268","543829","554848","548831","550826","542981","545915","546922","546847"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["container","reflection","plastic","sustainability","lace","squat","water","collect","brim","perform"]}
