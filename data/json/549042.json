{"path":"549042.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man sitting on a large red agricultural machine, possibly a tractor or a combine. The man is dressed in a traditional rural American style: he wears a wide-brimmed beige cowboy hat, thick-rimmed glasses, a red bandana around his neck, a plaid shirt, and rugged blue denim jeans. His attire is functional and worn, suggesting regular outdoor work. His boots are dusty and worn. He holds his hands on his knees, and his legs are slightly apart. He gives a serious look, gazing off to the side.\n\nThe setting seems to be outdoors under a clear blue sky, indicative of good weather. The equipment he is seated on is prominently red with visible traces of dust and use, including faded and chipped paint, reinforcing the idea of regular use in a farming or agricultural context. The immediate background is minimal, focusing attention on the man and his immediate surroundings. The overall mood conveys a quiet, reflective moment, possibly a break or pause in his work.","title":"Harvesting wheat in the Palo Verde Valley, 200 yards from the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549051","548876","547734","547679","548874","549259","554203","549120","547416","553091","552561","544349","546068","545087","549054","547313"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["idea","bandana","trace","tractor","chip","cowboy","pause","knee","neck","brim"]}
