{"path":"544536.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a river canal with several key elements visible. On the left, a dense forest blankets the area, appearing lush and uninterrupted. The canal itself is relatively narrow and meanders through the landscape. To the right of the canal, the terrain is partly clear with a visible road running parallel to the canal.\n\nAlong the banks of the canal, a series of boats is docked. These boats vary in size and design, suggesting different uses, possibly fishing or transport. Notably, there is a cluster of structures at a section of the bank, likely docks or related facilities. This assembled area includes what appears to be a long concrete or metallic pier extending into the canal with boats moored alongside it. A few buildings are visible near the docking area, potentially serving as storage or operational bases for boating activities.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the canal and forest area is relatively flat, indicating a low-lying coastal or riverine environment. The color and clarity of the water suggest moderate clarity, which might be typical for a riverine habitat influenced by nearby terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nOverall, the picture showcases a peaceful yet active riverine setting, with human intervention evident in the form of boats and facilities intended for managing and utilizing the waterway. The juxtaposition of natural forested areas with developed boating infrastructure invites considerations of both environmental and economic activities.","title":"Drainage canal running into biscayne bay","placename":"Black Creek Canal Number C-1 (Fla.)","location":"Black Creek Canal Number C-1, Florida","nn1":["552733","548921","551218","544607","558047","558062","557972","551217","548076","547990","558016","558064","551993","556966","551067","548028"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canal","boat","clarity","forest","bank","dock","consideration","basis","assemble","docking"]}
