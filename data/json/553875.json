{"path":"553875.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a serene scene of multiple birds in flight against a dusky sky. The sky gradient is smooth and warm, with shades transitioning from a deep, near-black hue at the top to a soft blend of orange and peach closer to the horizon. The birds, likely a flock, are silhouetted in various stages of flight, their shapes and forms detailed enough to discern wingspans and the differing postures of flight or ascent.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows a dark, solid silhouette that could represent a distant tree line or a land horizon, forming a stark boundary between the earth and the sky. The focus and framing suggest that the primary subject of the image is the fleeting and dynamic movement of the birds, emphasized by their dark silhouettes against the lighter, vibrant sky. The overall composition evokes a calm yet dynamic end-of-day scenario, likely capturing the natural activity of birds at either dawn or dusk. The atmosphere is serene, highlighted by the natural beauty and simplicity of the setting.","title":"Choloskee rookery.  (from the sites exhibition.
