{"path":"545768.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts two individuals engaged in a hiking activity on a wide, sloping rock surface. The setting appears to be during late afternoon or early evening, as suggested by the warm, dim lighting and long shadows cast on the ground.\n\nThe person on the left is slightly behind and is carrying a large backpack, indicating preparedness for a significant outdoor trek. This individual appears to be a young woman with shoulder-length hair, dressed in a sleeveless top and shorts, suitable for warm weather hiking.\n\nThe individual on the right is walking ahead, also a young woman with long hair, wearing a tank top and pants. Her posture and stride suggest a relaxed yet steady pace.\n\nThe rock surface they are walking on is expansive and smooth with slight undulations and textures, indicative of natural erosion. There are no visible trees or bushes on the rock itself, but in the background, there are layers of hills or mountains, partially shrouded in shadows, adding to the depth of the landscape.\n\nThis photograph captures a moment of adventure and exploration in a natural, possibly remote setting. The vastness of the landscape and the solitary figures convey a sense of tranquility and the magnitude of the natural environment.","title":"Hikers terry mcgaw and glen denny on the trail to delicate arch in Arches National Park","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"Arches National Park, Utah","nn1":["545751","545772","544305","545758","545781","543248","544301","545785","554503","554504","545700","554513","554558","544903","554505","554508"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiking","rock","trek","magnitude","preparedness","undulation","pace","stride","walk","individual"]}
