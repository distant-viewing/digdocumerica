{"path":"546516.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph shows a large, abstract sculpture prominently displayed in an outdoor setting. The sculpture is made of bronze and has a weathered green patina finish. It appears to consist of three interconnected forms, each with a distinctive, fluid shape reminiscent of organic forms or twisted figures. \n\nThe sculpture is complex, with parts that loop and curve dramatically, creating an array of shadows and textures on its surface. There are hollow spaces within the interconnected segments, adding a sense of openness and lightness to the otherwise solid bronze structure.\n\nThe sculpture is situated on a brick-paved area, likely a public park or square. In the background, you can see a quiet street lined with trees and a few parked cars, suggesting this might be in a semi-urban area with green spaces integrated into the cityscape. The weather appears to be clear and sunny, contributing to the vibrant and detailed portrayal of the sculpture and its surroundings.","title":"Henry moore's sculpture \"large arch,\" which was installed near the rogers library in 1971","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546512","553278","557263","551662","551476","546520","546508","558132","553254","558259","553769","549980","553281","546457","551651","551646"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["sculpture","bronze","loop","twiste","interconnect","square","finish","portrayal","reminiscent","integrate"]}
