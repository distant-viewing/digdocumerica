{"path":"550102.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene that highlights a contrast between traditional and modern lifestyles. In the foreground, two Amish people, a man and a woman, are walking through a parking lot. The man wears a dark suit, a wide-brimmed hat, and a full beard, common among Amish men, while the woman is dressed in a plain, dark dress with a head covering, typical of Amish women. Next to them is a shopping cart filled with goods, suggesting they have been shopping.\n\nThe background features two traditional Amish buggies, each pulled by a horse. The buggies are black with orange reflective safety triangles on the back. Behind the buggies, an automobile parking area is visible, with several cars, highlighting the juxtaposition of Amish traditional transport with modern vehicles.\n\nAbove the buggies, there's a large sign that says \"AMISH BUGGY PARKING,\" indicating a designated parking area for the buggies. Another sign, partially seen at the top, reads \"BROS.\" which is part of a larger commercial sign possibly linked to a nearby supermarket or business.\n\nThe setting appears to be a commercial area, as the structure in the background features large store signs and the layout typical of a shopping center parking lot. The atmosphere suggests a rainy or misty day, given the overall gray lighting and wet ground. This photograph captures a moment where tradition meets contemporary life, reflected both through the activities and the surroundings.","title":"Buggies require parking space, too.
