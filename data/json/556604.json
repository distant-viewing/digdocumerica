{"path":"556604.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph shows two boys standing in an indoor setting that appears to be a kitchen. The boy on the left is dressed in a plaid button-up shirt, dark trousers, and is wearing a belt. He has light brown hair and is looking directly at the camera with a slight smile. The boy on the right is slightly slimmer, and shorter, wearing a tattered plaid helmet with a mounted light, a blue checkered short-sleeved shirt, and dark jeans. He's also holding a box, possibly a battery pack, connected by a wire to his helmet, and is smiling towards the camera. \n\nThe setting includes a white refrigerator with various items on top and beside it, including a large brown item and boxed items at the bottom left corner. The window frame visible in the top left corner has a wooden finish and the walls are paneled with wood. The curtains on the window have a vibrant floral pattern, adding a lively touch to the modest domestic atmosphere. The composition captures a moment of youthful playfulness, possibly themed around mining or exploration, accompanied by an aura of casual, everyday home life.","title":"Michael, 14, and Darrell, 13, are sons of Wayne Gipson, a miner and minister who lives near Gruetli, Tennessee, near Chattanooga. Darrell is shown in some of his father's mining gear. Their father arrives home promptly at 3:30 p.m. to shower and change clothes. He then feeds three cows, and some pigs and chickens with help from the boys. He keeps the animals to give his sons something to do after school.","placename":"Gruetli (Tenn.)","location":"Gruetli, Tennessee","nn1":["545953","557352","553147","546565","544217","545959","544368","552958","545757","555950","543991","549299","550249","556284","556362","553528"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["boy","item","plaid","helmet","corner","refrigerator","pack","playfulness","kitchen","aura"]}
