The sign appears to be made of a dark-colored material, possibly metal, with white lettering and borders that are punched-out, creating a dotted pattern around the text and edges. The sign has a rectangular shape with rounded corners.\n\nThe locations and distances listed on the sign are as follows:\n- Seeley 9\n- El Centro 17\n- Yuma 76\n- Clear Air 2\n\nThe letters and numbers are all capitalized and the distances are listed in miles, denoted by a symbol representing miles to the right of each number.\n\nThe background of the image is an even blue tone, suggesting a clear sky. The focus on the sign makes it the dominant subject in the composition, with no other objects or details visible. The condition of the sign shows minor wear and there are some slight irregularities in the paint, like minor scratches and spots, indicating it has been exposed to the elements.","title":"On State Highway near Plaster City.
