{"path":"543407.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts two identical, conical structures resting on wooden supports, with a vivid sunset sky in the backdrop. These unique structures are intricately woven out of what appears to be reeds or thin wood strips, creating a textured, basket-like surface. They are positioned on an open, dusty terrain filled with fragmented rocks and debris, indicative of a construction site or shipyard. Part of another similar structure can be seen emerging from the left edge of the frame, while an industrial building with visible stairs and platforms looms in the background to the right. The warm golden tones of the sky suggest the photo was taken during the golden hour, enhancing the rust-colored hues of the wooden constructions and the rough terrains. The image evokes a sense of industrial craftsmanship blended with traditional construction methods.","title":"Ship hull takes shape at boat works","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["544020","555321","558140","553923","546389","557335","546026","548851","555320","547102","543258","546114","543926","546203","544958","556390"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["construction","shipyard","strips","method","craftsmanship","basket","loom","stair","reed","emerge"]}
