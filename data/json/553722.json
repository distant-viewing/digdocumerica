{"path":"553722.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a multi-lane freeway with cars moving in both directions, framed against a backdrop of a city skyline and mountainous terrain. In the foreground, the freeway stretches from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, divided by a narrow, concrete median. The traffic includes a variety of cars from what appear to be the 1970s or 1980s, with some noticeable classic car models, exhibiting colors such as white, blue, green, and red.\n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a dense array of multi-storied buildings that constitute the city's skyline. These buildings, mostly modern in architecture with flat surfaces and rectangular designs, suggest a bustling urban area. \n\nThe backdrop features a landscape of rolling hills or mountains, which are lightly covered in haze, indicating either the distance from the viewer or air quality conditions typical of a city environment.\n\nBordered by lush greenery on one side and a city environment on the other, the composition contrasts nature with human-made structures, emphasizing the dual aspects of urban development. The image is bathed in daylight, suggesting it was taken during the late morning or early afternoon, under clear, sunny conditions.","title":"On H-1 (or Lunalilo) Freeway looking west toward downtown Honolulu.
