{"path":"550021.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial harbor scene bustling with activity. Prominently featured are multiple cargo ships docked alongside green-colored cranes which are presumably engaged in loading or unloading goods. The ship closest to the foreground is labeled \"FERMLAND.\"\n\nBeyond the immediate harbor area, a large industrial complex dominates the midground with several tall smokestacks from which white and gray smoke billows, suggesting heavy industrial operations, possibly a power plant or manufacturing facility. These smokestacks are set against a slightly hazy sky, hinting at air pollution.\n\nThe general area appears dense with structures related to heavy industry, including additional cranes, various buildings, and stacked containers or similar materials, contributing to a sense of bustling industrial activity.\n\nThe distant background reveals a glimpse of a hilly terrain, providing a natural contrast to the foreground's industrial features. Overall, the scene captures a dynamic interaction between maritime and industrial operations within an urban setting.","title":"Boston Harbor - seen from the top of Mystic River Bridge.
