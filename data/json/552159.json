{"path":"552159.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of industrial and natural landscapes. In the foreground, an industrial scene featuring a variety of man-made structures dominates the view. Prominent in this area are several cranes, a tall smokestack actively emitting smoke, and several buildings that appear functional in nature, possibly warehouses or factories. The industrial elements are mostly silhouetted and create a stark, dark outline against the more luminous background.\n\nThe background is dominated by an impressive and serene view of a snow-capped mountain, which in contrast to the foreground, exudes tranquility and natural beauty. The mountain is likely a volcano, given its symmetrical and conical shape, covered with snow that highlights its crevices and geological features. The sky above and around the mountain is tinged with orange and blue hues, suggesting either sunrise or sunset which adds a dramatic and beautiful lighting to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the harsh, man-made elements of the industrial foreground with the majestic, serene beauty of the natural mountain landscape in the background, likely prompting reflections on the relationship between human activity and nature. The image also subtly captures the element of water at the base, possibly a river or coastal body, lending a reflective quality to the scene and enhancing the depth between the foreground and the vast mountain in the distance.","title":"Mount Rainier and the Tacoma industrial waterfront","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548135","552349","545243","545013","552196","544736","543009","544039","543981","550821","545989","551062","550672","545354","545996","544735"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["mountain","snow","crevice","relationship","sunrise","warehouse","beauty","outline","smokestack","base"]}
