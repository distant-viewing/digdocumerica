{"path":"546208.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a vast expanse of flat terrain, which appears to be blanketed by a layer of salt or a similar white mineral. The foreground shows the cracked and textured surface of the ground, suggesting a harsh, dry environment.\n\nIn the distance, partially obscured by clouds of dust or vapor, industrial structures rise up. The structures, possibly part of a mining or processing facility, include towering silos and several buildings, some with discernible antennas or other equipment on top. A crane-like structure is also visible to the left of the image, contributing to the industrial feel. The dust clouds envelop these structures in a misty haze, softening their outlines and adding an air of mystery to the scene.\n\nThe color palette of the image is muted with shades of pale purple and gray dominating, punctuated by the stark white of the ground. This gives the landscape a somewhat eerie and desolate atmosphere. The image overall captures a moment of industrial activity within a vast and inhospitable environment.","title":"Steam escaping from a chemical plant obscures the shoreline.","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["552004","544068","545992","552427","549965","551555","546084","545998","544390","554764","552544","543642","546080","554811","546122","548316"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["dust","dominating","vapor","antenna","salt","overall","mystery","silo","cloud","mineral"]}
