{"path":"544590.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a vibrant yellow flower, likely a sunflower, with a dark brown and black center. A small, spotted insect, resembling a ladybug, is positioned on the edge of one of the flower petals, seemingly preparing to take flight. The petals of the flower radiate outward with a smooth and bright appearance. The background of the image features soft green and darker blurred colors, providing a calm, out of focus backdrop that accentuates the sharp detail of the flower and the insect. The natural lighting enhances the brightness of the flower's yellow hue, creating a warm, inviting tone across the scene. The image elegantly highlights the beauty and detail of nature, capturing the interaction between flora and fauna.","title":"Sunflowers","placename":"Ingram (Tex.)","location":"Ingram, Texas","nn1":["545699","554842","544579","544619","543596","549230","554580","543603","544479","547818","551380","548027","554840","544553","555189","557487"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","insect","petal","sunflower","fauna","radiate","flight","flora","brightness","detail"]}
