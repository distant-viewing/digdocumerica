{"path":"550144.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene featuring a large, dilapidated two-story house that shows considerable signs of neglect. The structure is predominantly wooden with a gabled roof. Many of the house's features, including windows and a side door, are visibly boarded up with plywood, suggesting vacancy or abandonment. Despite its condition, architectural details such as ornate wood trim and a covered front porch with decorative elements suggest the house once had a more illustrious past.\n\nIn front of the house, flowers in bloom add a contrasting touch of life and color to the otherwise grim scene. The front yard appears unkempt and overgrown, strewn with debris and random objects, which further emphasizes the state of disrepair.\n\nTo the left of the house, near the roadside, a person is lying on the ground among some trash and debris. This individual appears to be either resting or perhaps in distress, adding a complex human element to the image.\n\nA classic car, parked on the road directly in front of the house, adds to the historic feel of the scene, suggesting a time period possibly in the mid-20th century. The car looks well-maintained compared to the house, with a two-tone paint job and chrome details, typical of its era.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a stark juxtaposition between decay and lived life, possibly hinting at broader societal or economic issues impacting the neighborhood during the time the photo was taken.","title":"Old victorian house at 2904 clinton street is being restored as part of the Ohio city area renewal project","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550113","551115","552491","552494","557346","550279","557640","558110","554799","555632","554787","552455","556491","557633","554822","554818"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["house","front","random","boarde","job","distress","impacte","past","liv","gable"]}
