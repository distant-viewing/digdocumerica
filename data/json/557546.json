{"path":"557546.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a scenic view of a hilly landscape with a prominent sign in the foreground. The sign, mounted on a yellow post, is a circular, yellow warning sign featuring a black border and text. It reads \"WARNING PETROLEUM PIPELINE\" and includes additional text that indicates ownership by the \"Union Oil Company of California\" along with a contact phone number.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the sign is covered in dense, dry grass and shrubbery, typical of a semi-arid or Mediterranean climate. The hills roll gently and are dotted with various green and brown plants, suggesting a natural, undeveloped area.\n\nIn the background, the hills continue to extend, becoming more rugged in the distance. There appear to be paths or dirt roads snaking through the hills. The far background, under a hazy sky, shows a more flattened landscape that might indicate a valley, and the haze suggests either distance or pollution.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph places the warning sign off-center to the left, drawing attention to it while also providing a broad view of the natural surroundings. The lighting suggests it is midday, with bright sunlight casting natural tones over the landscape.","title":"Petroleum pipeline signals future development off Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains on the western edge of Los Angeles. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 mile of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552432","545949","552006","549129","545997","544227","546402","543641","543637","544845","553905","552005","549000","544245","549118","545746"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","sign","hill","text","ownership","flatten","contact","phone","become","shrubbery"]}
