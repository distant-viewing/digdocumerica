{"path":"545044.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features two men sitting closely together in front of a large pile of scattered objects that appear to be various types of waste or discarded items. The man on the left wears glasses and a light grey t-shirt, and is sporting a full beard and moustache. He has a hat with a distinct feather band around it. His posture and facial expression suggest a relaxed and friendly demeanor. The man on the right also wears glasses and a long-sleeve red shirt. He has shoulder-length hair and a welcoming smile.\n\nBehind them, there is a massive accumulation of what seems to be discarded metal items and various types of debris, creating a chaotic and cluttered background. The abundance of these items fills the space behind the subjects, extending across the entire scene, and adds a rustic or perhaps neglected ambiance to the setting.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is casual and positive, with the two individuals appearing amiable and content in each other's company amidst an unordered environment. The lighting in the photograph emphasizes the subjects, allowing for vivid colors and details to emerge, such as the textural qualities of their clothing and facial features.","title":"Lee Calvill and Larry Hurst organized Alameda Elementary School students to collect 8,000 pounds of tin cans.
