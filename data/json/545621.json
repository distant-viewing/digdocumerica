{"path":"545621.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a warning sign prominently positioned at the center. The sign is mounted on a two-legged, red wooden post. It is painted in a dark red hue with white lettering that reads, \"DANGER UNFENCED OVERLOOK PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION PARENTS â€“ CONTROL YOUR CHILDREN.\" The text is capitalized, enhancing the urgency and cautionary nature of the message.\n\nBehind the sign, the natural environment consists of rocky terrain and low desert shrubbery, typical for arid, canyon-like settings. The backdrop hints at the kind of rugged, potentially perilous terrain referenced by the sign's warning, emphasizing why such caution is necessary. The composition is such that the focus is drawn immediately to the sign due to its central positioning, vivid color contrast, and pointed message. The terrain and plant life in the background blur slightly into softer focus, directing the viewer's attention squarely on the warning sign.","title":"The park service is cutting down on the building of fences and other protective structures in the canyonlands in an attempt to keep the natural landscape as undisturbed as possible","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["548063","544227","544845","553905","554103","547123","549129","557546","545949","554250","549454","545004","546386","543645","546240","547836"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","sign","message","parent","capitalize","terrain","caution","danger","reference","urgency"]}
