{"path":"553402.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a team of rowers mid-stroke on a calm body of water. The rowing shell they are using is long and narrow, typical of competitive rowing boats. There are eight rowers in the boat, aligned in pairs, each handling a single oar. The rowers are synchronized in their movements, displaying a typical rowing posture with their bodies leaning back slightly and arms fully extended.\n\nEach rower is dressed in athletic attire; some wear tank tops while others wear T-shirts, in mixed shades of grey and red. Their expressions focus on their activity, highlighting the intensity and concentration this sport requires. The coxswain, located at the stern of the boat, appears to be guiding and motivating the team, though only part of their face is visible.\n\nThe setting is serene, with a lush green forest lining the banks of the waterway, reflecting off the waterâ€™s surface, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The lighting suggests it could be morning or afternoon, with ample natural light casting gentle highlights on the rowers and their surroundings. Overall, the image captures a moment of teamwork and determination against a peaceful natural backdrop.","title":"Visiting crew at Groton School on the Nashua River.
