{"path":"553929.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a hillside residential neighborhood with numerous houses scattered across a sloped terrain. The houses vary in design and size but predominantly feature styles typical of suburban American homes, with a few having flat roofs and others with slanted, shingled roofs. The exteriors appear to be a mix of light and dark shades.\n\nSurrounding the houses are lush green trees and vegetation, indicating a verdant, possibly tropical environment. The density of the greenery suggests that the neighborhood is in a region with abundant plant growth.\n\nIn the background, the sky is visible with a deep blue hue, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon. There are no visible commercial buildings or high rises, emphasizing the residential and possibly secluded nature of this area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a peaceful suburb nestled in nature, providing a panoramic view that accentuates the community's integration with its natural surroundings.","title":"Hillside homes on Honolulu's east side.
