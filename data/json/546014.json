{"path":"546014.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a diverse and lush garden scene featuring different species of plants, creating a layered texture and color palette. In the foreground, a large fan palm with long, arching fronds dominates the scene, its thick, pointy leaves radiating outward. Beneath the palm, varied foliage includes several other leafy plants and fallen leaves, suggesting the richness of an undergrowth layer.\n\nIn the middle ground, a small tree with slender branches holds leaves that are yellowing, suggesting that the photo was taken in the fall. The leaves of this tree are sparse, allowing visibility through to the background.\n\nThe background of the scene is less focused, contributing to the sense of depth. It features more foliage that blends into a mix of greens and yellows, with faint hints of other plants or trees that are not distinctly outlined. The overall lighting of the photograph is soft and diffuse, possibly due to overcast weather, which enhances the natural and serene atmosphere of the garden setting. No human figures or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the tranquility and isolation of this natural environment.","title":"Plant life in city park","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555368","546387","555192","554993","555093","555050","555040","554743","554744","555054","554957","555019","555043","554083","551356","555049"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["palm","yellow","leave","plant","fronds","radiat","fan","richness","fallen","focused"]}
