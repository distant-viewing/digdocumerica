{"path":"548396.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a densely packed urban area during twilight or under subdued lighting conditions, which brings out a moody and somber atmosphere. The photograph features several rows of old, rectangular buildings that are tightly lined up along narrow streets. The architecture suggests a historical area, possibly in a city with its compact and continuous urban fabric.\n\nOn one side of the image, there is a large open space that appears somewhat unkempt, with patches of bare earth and dense clusters of trees and shrubs, creating a contrast with the structured urban environment. The area seems partially used, perhaps under development or underutilized, adding a layer of mystery to the urban landscape.\n\nThe lighting conditions and the quality of the photograph give it a slightly grainy texture, which enhances the vintage feel of the scene. The rooftops of the buildings are flat and some have visible equipment or structures that might be related to building utilities. A few lights can be seen on the streets and within some buildings, suggesting the presence of activity despite the overarching dark tones. The image captures the essence of urban life, showing both the closeness of community living and the isolation that can come with it.","title":"Residential area","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548343","544090","548425","548374","548424","556180","547429","555736","545499","545406","547207","549971","552734","547445","549620","548417"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["closeness","rooftop","mystery","street","fabric","condition","twilight","essence","building","utility"]}
