{"path":"549896.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil yet intriguing scene on a body of water, presumably a lake or sea. The main focus is on a large piece of driftwood floating in the water. Resting atop this piece of wood is a bird, which appears to be a seagull based on its size and plumage. The bird is facing towards the camera, giving a clear view of its profile.\n\nThe water around the driftwood and seagull is a deep blue, indicative of either deep water or an overcast sky above which can affect the water's color reflection. The surface of the water is relatively calm but shows small ripples, suggesting a gentle movement.\n\nScattered around in the water are small debris and what seems to be minor litter, possibly leaves or small pieces of plastic, hinting at a natural water body possibly near human activity.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene, with a focus on the solitary figure of the seagull in a vast expanse of water, highlighting themes of nature and perhaps solitude or survival.","title":"Gull floats on driftwood in New York Harbor--seen from the Staten Island Ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542919","552992","546241","550388","543317","543285","543260","543918","543063","545991","544683","545142","551378","553347","548832","547008"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seagull","driftwood","water","piece","bird","survival","plumage","litter","plastic","profile"]}
