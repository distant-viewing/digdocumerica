{"path":"545156.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic maritime scene. The main subject is a sleek, white boat moving at a considerable speed on a body of water that appears to be a lake or sea. The boat, possibly a motor yacht or a similar pleasure vessel, is positioned in the right part of the image, moving from right to left. It has a streamlined cabin and possibly a flying bridge above.\n\nThe waters are choppy with small to medium waves, indicative of windy conditions, and are a deep shade of blue. Stretching across the foreground of the photo, from the lower left to the midpoint on the right, is a line of buoyant markers, possibly for a net or a demarcated pathway, each linked with a noticeable rope or line submerged periodically below the water's surface.\n\nThe background features a distant, panoramic view of a mountain range with peaks that might be capped with snow, suggesting this could be in a region like the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The skies above these mountains are partly cloudy, with some blue sky attempting to break through.\n\nOverall, the image gives a sense of movement and a vivid depiction of maritime activity, set against the picturesque backdrop of a mountainous region.","title":"Oregon--Depoe Bay","placename":"Depoe Bay (Or.)","location":"Depoe Bay, Oregon","nn1":["546049","545057","555693","548204","546317","550840","552157","549458","548520","552921","542697","549066","548202","547685","549117","552050"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["demarcate","yacht","pleasure","region","attempt","motor","boat","marker","move","mountain"]}
