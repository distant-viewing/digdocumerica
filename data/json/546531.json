{"path":"546531.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures a modern architectural scene, likely on a university or corporate campus. The focal point is a large, multi-story office or academic building made of concrete and glass. The building has a strong geometric structure, with a grid-like pattern of windows and balconies along its fa√ßade.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is another building with similar architectural styling, featuring prominent vertical and horizontal lines. Both buildings are connected by a high, enclosed walkway that spans across the center of the photograph, linking the two structures.\n\nIn the foreground, a well-maintained pathway leads straight towards the central building and the connecting walkway. The path is flanked by tall, spherical street lamps and is bordered by a neatly trimmed grass lawn. There are no people visible in the scene, adding a serene and somewhat austere mood to the setting.\n\nThe lighting indicates that the photo was taken on a bright, clear day as the sky is vividly blue and there are strong shadows cast by the buildings and street lamps. This contributes to a stark contrast between the well-lit areas and the shaded parts, highlighting the clean lines and minimalistic beauty of the architecture. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes symmetry and order, using the central pathway as a guide that draws the viewer's eye towards the buildings and the skywalk in the distance.","title":"Cummins engine company technical center, built in 1967","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546506","546464","546473","546539","546481","546702","546470","546415","546532","555318","546456","546543","546542","546521","546515","555449"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["lamps","walkway","building","pathway","austere","campus","styling","symmetry","order","shaded"]}
