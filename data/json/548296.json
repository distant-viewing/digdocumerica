{"path":"548296.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural farm scene featuring a vast field under cultivation. The field is marked by long, parallel rows that appear to have been freshly tilled or planted, stretching towards the background of the image. Some rows are covered with visible crops, while others show bare soil.\n\nIn the backdrop, there are several rustic structures: a large barn or farmhouse, which is somewhat dilapidated, and a smaller wooden shed, both typical of agricultural environments. These buildings are surrounded by lush green trees which suggest the season may be late spring or summer. To the right, beyond the cultivated rows, there's an area with taller, flowering plants, adding a contrast in vegetation height and texture.\n\nSeveral utility poles with electrical lines run alongside the right edge of the field, which hints at the presence of modern amenities despite the scene's overall quaint and aged appearance. There are also a few indistinct vehicles parked near the buildings, possibly indicating activity or the presence of workers or residents. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day, which casts vivid shadows and enhances the vibrant natural colors in the scene.","title":"Field in GRand Pointe ready for planting with the area's unique perique tobacco.
