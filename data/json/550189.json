{"path":"550189.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene with several key elements. In the foreground, a massive dark bridge arc looms overhead, occupying the top portion of the image and cutting across diagonally, contributing to a sense of enclosure and vastness. Just beneath this arc, we see another bridge, a truss bridge with intricate lattice work, suggestive of heavy industrial engineering typical of the mid-20th century.\n\nBeyond the bridges, in the middle ground, there are old industrial buildings and structures, including a tower emitting a large plume of dark smoke, which adds to the gritty, industrial ambiance of the scene. These buildings have a utilitarian architecture, marked by plain facades and minimal windows.\n\nThe scene is set near or over a body of water, evident from the reflections in the lower part of the image. The calm water mirrors the bridges and some of the vertical structures, adding an element of symmetry and contrast to the geometric sharpness of the industrial elements.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is slightly somber, amplified by the muted lighting and overcast sky, which suggests an early morning or a cloudy day. The dark tones and the presence of smoke might indicate ongoing industrial operations, typical of areas focused on heavy manufacturing and possibly linked to the transport capabilities provided by the waterway.","title":"Smoke is from freighter on the Cuyahoga River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550181","547586","550955","546076","546112","550966","547890","548207","550172","548321","550965","545988","548375","552441","550210","550185"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["bridge","arc","capability","sharpness","symmetry","smoke","amplify","lattice","enclosure","loom"]}
