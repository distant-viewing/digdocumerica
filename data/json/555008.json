{"path":"555008.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image depicts a natural scene primarily comprised of a moss-covered tree trunk angling diagonally across the frame. This tree trunk is heavily textured with a vibrant green moss, emphasizing its aged and weathered appearance. It appears partly submerged in a shallow, murky water body, reflecting the trunk and surrounding vegetation, which adds a serene and somewhat mystical quality to the scenery.\n\nThe background is densely packed with thin, bare branches, possibly from deciduous trees in a dormant state, which suggests that the photograph might have been taken in fall or winter. The branches crisscross haphazardly, creating a complex network that fills the upper part of the image and contrasts with the relatively smoother water surface below.\n\nNo people or man-made objects are visible; the focus is entirely on the natural elements. The lighting seems natural, possibly filtered through clouds or forest canopy, casting soft shadows and contributing to the overall tranquil and slightly somber mood of the photograph. The scene captures a moment of quiet and natural beauty, potentially in a forested or wetland area.","title":"Crabapple in a wet bottom meadow in the simpson sustained yield unit of olympic national timberland, Washington.
