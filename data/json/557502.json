{"path":"557502.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays an outdoor setting featuring a large billboard advertisement. The billboard, mounted on metal stilts, displays an advertisement for \"Dermatan,\" promoting the product with the taglines \"Clear skin. Dynamite tan.\" The design of the billboard is visually striking, including stylized images of what appears to be a red sun and mountain-like forms, as well as a graphical representation of a tanned face and a bottle labeled with \"TEN-O-SIX Dermatan.\"\n\nBeneath and in front of the billboard is a large puddle or small body of water reflecting the billboard's image and the surrounding environment. The reflection adds a symmetric quality to the image. The surroundings seem to be a somewhat muddy or marshy area with patches of grass and other vegetation scattered around. The lighting in the photo suggests it is either dawn or dusk, given the soft light and long shadows, creating a serene and slightly moody atmosphere.","title":"Botaquito Lagoon, is one of the last few Bodies of water of this type in the southern part of the state.
