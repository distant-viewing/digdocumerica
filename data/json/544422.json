{"path":"544422.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a night scene featuring a male figure riding a motorcycle. The rider is wearing a black leather jacket and a distinctive helmet adorned with white stars against a dark background. His helmet visor is up, revealing part of his face underneath, which appears to be lit, possibly by the motorcycle's light or an external light source. He is seated on a small motorcycle, gripping the handlebars which hold rear-view mirrors and possibly other controls.\n\nThe lighting mainly highlights the right side of the rider and the motorcycle, leaving much of the background and left side shrouded in darkness. Details of his clothing suggest a casual biker outfit, including gloves and a reflective stripe along the side of his pants, which catches the light. The motorcycle has visible features such as a headlight in front and chrome parts reflecting light, enhancing its metallic texture.\n\nThe environment surrounding the rider is obscure due to the low lighting but seems to be an outdoor setting at night, given the absence of visible structures in the background. The darkness enhances the focus on the illuminated parts of the motorcycle and rider, creating a striking contrast between the subject and the surroundings. The scene conveys a sense of solitude or a late-night journey, emphasizing the rider's engagement with his ride.","title":"Young Navajo cycle rider","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["554874","551382","548890","556206","547803","548690","553954","551120","545134","551237","543730","544844","554877","556442","545598","544840"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["motorcycle","rider","night","darkness","ride","helmet","handlebar","light","leather","grip"]}
