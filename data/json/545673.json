{"path":"545673.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene set in a vast and rugged landscape, possibly within a desert or semi-arid region given the red and orange hues of the terrain and distant cliffs under a cloudy sky. The focal point is a large, green farm vehicle—specifically a dump truck or manure spreader—in the process of offloading a heap of organic material, likely manure, onto the rich red soil. The ground shows evidence of heavy vehicle activity through parallel tire tracks, suggesting the land is used for farming or similar activities.\n\nThe backdrop features flat-topped mesas or cliffs, typical of sedimentary rock formations, adding a dramatic and scenic element typical of landscapes perhaps found in regions like the American Southwest. The overall atmosphere is overcast, with a soft diffused light that enhances the earthy tones of the red soil and the greens of the vehicle.\n\nThis setting indicates that the main activity here is related to farming—improving soil fertility through the addition of organic material, which is essential for agricultural productivity in environments that may be nutrient-poor or water-scarce. The image also conveys a sense of isolation and the scale of agricultural operations in expansive, open environments.","title":"Dumping oil laden debris; part of EPA supervised clean-up of the San Juan River oil spill. 285,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from burst pipeline and flowed 200 miles downstream before it was contained by a log boom. This disposal site was dug in a hilltop about a quarter mile from the boom.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["553662","545677","547436","555619","555874","554054","555879","547297","554015","547922","552577","544888","553698","555608","548820","553665"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["soil","farming","cliff","mesa","productivity","vehicle","evidence","dump","region","addition"]}
