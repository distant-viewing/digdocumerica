{"path":"544176.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a dry, cracked earth surface partially submerged under shallow water. The pattern of the earth is fragmented into various irregular shapes, resembling puzzle pieces with jagged edges. These dry areas appear rough and have a texture that suggests brittleness, possibly due to prolonged exposure to environmental conditions like sun and minimal moisture.\n\nThe spaces between these cracked segments are filled with water, reflecting a bit of light and creating a contrast between the dark, muddy color of the dry sections and the silver-gray appearance of the water. The water level is shallow, barely submerging some of the lower segments of the earth.\n\nThere is a subtle interplay of light and shadow across the surface, suggesting the photograph was taken during a time when the sunlight was not directly overhead, likely either in the early morning or late afternoon. This lighting adds depth to the image and highlights the textural details of the cracked earth and the smooth reflective quality of the water. The overall mood of the photograph communicates a sense of desolation and the harsh impact of natural elements on the landscape.","title":"Drainage of marsh leaves parquets of dry, cracked mud","placename":"Grand Isle (La. : Island)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["554347","544184","549201","544180","557417","545597","555545","550837","544992","552060","552053","550397","544733","544751","552420","552056"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["crack","earth","segment","submerge","water","fragment","communicate","moisture","desolation","exposure"]}
