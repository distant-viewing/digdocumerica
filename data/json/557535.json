{"path":"557535.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a unique and creative composition primarily focused around a bicycle, with elements of human presence and a natural backdrop. The central object in the frame is a bicycle, viewed from a low angle with the foreground dominated by the back wheel of the bike. The viewer sees through the spokes of the bicycle wheel which frames another bicycle or parts of the same bicycle in the background, along with a cyclist sitting on the ground.\n\nThe cyclist in the background is partially obscured by the wheel in the foreground. This person is wearing a light yellow long sleeve shirt, patterned shorts, and a cycling helmet. They appear to be inspecting or working on some element of the bicycle, perhaps engaged in a repair or adjustment.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, possibly in a mountainous area given the visible rocks and vegetation in the background, which include sparse green shrubs and hints of a rugged terrain typical to outdoor natural reserves or park areas.\n\nThe photo captures a candid moment reflecting the theme of cycling, adventure, and perhaps the necessity of maintenance and preparation in these activities, all set against a natural landscape that evokes a sense of solitude and immersion in nature. The lighting and colors suggest that the photo might have been taken during late afternoon hours, casting soft natural light that enhances the textures of the bike and surrounding elements.","title":"Bicyclist in the Malibu canyon area near Malibu, California which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county the santa monica mountains of which the canyon is a part contain some of the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county, but are threatened by development.
