{"path":"553052.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged man resting his head against his arm in an environment filled with industrial or mechanical equipment. He has a contemplative or tired expression on his face. The man is balding with some hair around the sides of his head and has a toothpick in his mouth. He is wearing a plaid, button-down shirt which suggests a casual or work-related setting.\n\nHis surroundings appear somewhat grimy or oily, indicative of a mechanical shop or a similar setting given the presence of what seems to be a hydraulic machine or piping near his head. The background is blurred and mostly obscured by shadows, focusing the viewer's attention on the manâ€™s face and upper body. There is a deep, reflective quality to his gaze, suggesting he might be deep in thought or taking a break from work.\n\nThe lighting is subdued with an emphasis on the man's face, highlighting his facial features and the reflective expression in his eyes. This lighting setup contributes to the intimate and introspective atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Uranium miner at lunch.
