{"path":"547234.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene on water during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the deep orange and amber tones in the water and sky. Three boats are present in the image, creating gentle ripples and waves on the water's surface as they move. The boat in the foreground is moving towards the left side of the frame, while the other two boats, further in the background, are moving towards the right. Each boat casts a distinct reflection on the glowing, rippled water surface, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and peaceful, highlighted by the warm hues of the water and the sky. The composition skillfully uses the water's texture and the boatsâ€™ placement to draw the viewer's eye across the scene, emphasizing the vastness and quiet beauty of the moment.","title":"Power boats on the polluted Potomac","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["543119","548247","550039","552310","552293","551215","543143","549417","547549","551209","548118","552292","545026","551220","550771","551214"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["boat","water","placement","sunrise","ripple","orange","sunset","vastness","surface","wave"]}
