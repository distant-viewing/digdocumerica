{"path":"544117.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny, outdoor setting at a gas station, featuring a man fueling a boat that is mounted on a trailer. The man, dressed in black and white checkered pants and a dark vest over a light shirt, is seen holding a fuel pump nozzle to the boat's tank. The boat is predominantly white, with an outboard motor visible at its rear and is attached to a screened trailer labeled \"Vanson\".\n\nThe background of the shot includes glimpses of commercial buildings; notably one with a sign that reads \"Trading Post,\" advertising Indian crafts and decorations. The gas station has several fuel pumps and other typical gas station equipment set on a paved area. The sky is clear and vividly blue, suggesting a bright sunny day, enhancing the sharpness and color saturation in the photograph. The overall setting indicates a routine activity of preparing for a boating trip, possibly near a town that caters to recreational or tourist activities.","title":"Preparing for cruise on Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["543934","551528","550841","555512","551228","552119","555502","544260","542875","546063","548525","544212","554683","554484","548054","544130"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["gas","fuel","pump","station","trailer","boat","nozzle","sharpness","motor","craft"]}
