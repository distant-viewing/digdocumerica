{"path":"554038.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of a rectangular, white sign with black text reading \"PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY TO BEACH\". The sign is mounted on a single metal pole, and appears somewhat weathered, with marks and slight discoloration visible on its surface suggesting it has been exposed to the elements for a considerable period. The background reveals a lush, shaded area that suggests a forested or woodland environment, rich with greenery and intertwined branches. There appears to be a potential pathway or trail leading into the distance, although it is largely obscured by the dense foliage. The natural lighting indicates daytime, with patches of sunlight filtering through the tree cover, creating a somewhat dappled effect on the surroundings. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of quietness and seclusion, likely located in a rural or semi-rural area.","title":"Sign created by developers as required by the county is the only one showing right of way for general public. Handling of access to beaches, as well as use of beach areas by developers, are drawing criticism on Molokai.","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["554119","545248","554168","548846","543108","543168","544245","543420","545109","544262","548670","554103","554060","548063","544220","548845"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["quietness","discoloration","mark","seclusion","daytime","trail","cover","way","pathway","sign"]}
