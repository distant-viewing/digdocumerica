{"path":"542793.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image shows a single-engine airplane, captured mid-flight against a cloudy sky. The airplane is emitting a stream of smoke, trailing behind it as it moves across the frame from right to left. The smoke line suggests that the airplane might be performing an aerobatic maneuver or possibly deploying smoke for visual effect.\n\nThe background is predominantly a soft, textured sky with varying tones of gray and white, suggesting either overcast weather or a high-altitude setting. The condition of the photo, characterized by noticeable grain, numerous small scratches, and spots, gives it a vintage or aged look, which could indicate that the photograph was taken with film and has deteriorated over time.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the airplane and its dramatic trail, set against a vast and subtly textured sky, conveying a sense of motion and the vastness of the atmosphere.","title":"California--Los Angeles","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542717","542500","542719","548883","542501","542718","542496","548884","549072","544491","548881","542577","548841","548215","542720","553873"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","smoke","deploy","traile","scratch","deteriorate","maneuver","grain","engine","trail"]}
