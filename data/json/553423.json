{"path":"553423.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban scene where a group of young people are engaged in gardening or landscaping work along a city street. The setting is sunny and lively, and the photograph appears to have been taken during a clear day.\n\nIn the foreground, several young adults and teenagers, both male and female, are actively working with gardening tools. They are digging and moving soil in an area that seems to be prepared for planting. The individuals are dressed casually suitable for physical work; some wear jeans and t-shirts, while others are shirtless, likely due to the warm weather.\n\nThe background features a city street lined with multi-storied, older buildings that have commercial establishments on the ground floor. Notable signs include \"Park Plaza\" and \"The Insurance Co.\" There are parked cars and a moving truck, emphasizing the urban setting. Pedestrians can be observed walking by, and traffic signals add to the urban infrastructure visible in the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a vivid depiction of community involvement in urban beautification or development, set against a backdrop of everyday city life with architecture from an earlier era signaling a well-established neighborhood.","title":"Contingent from the Youth Opportunities Corps builds a pocket park on Main Street.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553424","551633","551619","551738","551620","551623","551739","551618","551617","551621","550055","551632","551630","549268","551705","551780"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["gardening","city","teenager","signal","involvement","landscaping","work","street","establishment","depiction"]}
