{"path":"553847.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene at sunset. It features multiple tall smokestacks from which dark, dense smoke is billowing into the sky, silhouetted against the setting sun. The sun is prominent in the center background, glowing intensely with a golden hue that permeates the surrounding sky. The industrial complex, possibly a power plant or a factory, includes several other vertical structures that appear as dark silhouettes.\n\nNumerous power lines and utility poles are visible across the scene, adding to the industrial ambiance. The entire scene is backlit by the sun, which creates stark contrasts and highlights the smoke emissions distinctly against the sunset sky. This composition powerfully conveys themes of industry and environmental impact, juxtaposed with the natural beauty of a sunset.","title":"Birmingham steel plant. (From the sites exhibition.
