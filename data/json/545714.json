{"path":"545714.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and picturesque mountain landscape. In the foreground, a small stream meanders through a lush meadow dotted with a profusion of yellow dandelion flowers. The vegetation surrounding the stream appears verdant, indicating a healthy alpine ecosystem.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a dark line of coniferous trees, providing a contrasting backdrop to the bright yellow of the dandelions. These trees help to frame the meadow and add depth to the scene.\n\nIn the background, majestic, snow-capped mountains rise sharply against a partly cloudy sky. The mountains, rugged with sharp peaks and ridges, still carry remnants of winter snow in their crevices, suggesting the photograph was taken in late spring or early summer.\n\nThe composition of the photograph draws the viewer's eye along the path of the stream, leading from the blooming meadow up towards the dramatic mountain scenery. This scenery, combined with the vivid colors and natural setting, creates a serene yet powerful image that captures the wild beauty of a mountainous landscape.","title":"Maroon Lake campsite, 12 miles north of Aspen.
