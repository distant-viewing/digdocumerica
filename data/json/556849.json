{"path":"556849.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic railway route viewed from within a tunnel. The tunnel is formed through solid rock and has an uneven, natural arch shape. The inside of the tunnel is dark, contrasting with the bright, green world visible at the tunnel's far end where daylight shines through. \n\nThe railway tracks themselves are laid straight through the tunnel over gravel ballast, extending toward the light at the tunnel exit. Alongside the tracks, there's a rough path on the left side, possibly a maintenance or walking path. Small vegetation can be seen growing sporadically along the edges of the track and path. The atmosphere in the tunnel is somewhat moist and shadowy, drawing the viewer's attention from the dim interior to the brighter, verdant landscape visible outside the tunnel’s exit. \n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the contrast between the dark interior of the tunnel and the bright, lush greenery at its end, guiding the viewer’s eye along the tracks towards the promise of the landscape beyond.","title":"Amtrak passenger train enroute from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland, passes through a short tunnel.
