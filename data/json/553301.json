{"path":"553301.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a bustling city street, bustling with activity and diverse architectural styles. The image is taken from a high vantage point and looks directly down the street, providing a clear view of the road stretching towards the horizon, flanked on both sides by buildings of various designs and heights.\n\nThe street itself is busy, with multiple lanes filled with cars of different models and colors, suggesting a snapshot of everyday urban traffic. The cars are both parked on the side of the street and moving along the road. Visible road markings include pedestrian crossings and center lines that manage the flow of traffic.\n\nThe buildings lining the street are a mix of older architectural styles suggesting a densely populated urban area with a rich history. Many of these buildings feature signage on their facades advertising businesses like \"Barr's Loans\" and a \"Mutual Savings Bank.\" Other signs display products and services, contributing to a commercial and somewhat nostalgic urban atmosphere.\n\nMoreover, the assortment of signs and the visible wear on some buildings give a sense of age and mixed-use functionality to the area, indicative of many city districts combining retail, financial services, and possibly residential spaces in upper stories. The roofs of the buildings, visible in the photograph, show varied textures and states of repair, adding to the urban mosaic.\n\nThe lighting and the shadows suggest daylight conditions with good visibility, helping in highlighting details of the street scene below. The composition of the photograph with the street running vertically through the image creates a dynamic sense of depth, drawing the viewerâ€™s eye along the road towards the smaller, detailed elements in the distance.","title":"\"over the rhine\", an old residential neighborhood north of the business district, is being rehabilitated","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553845","552710","546716","551510","546745","556807","555450","548318","556681","555782","551478","551474","550111","555743","553276","553681"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["street","road","service","traffic","building","bustle","crossing","advertising","city","district"]}
