{"path":"554342.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a conference room or lecture hall. A woman is standing at a podium positioned to the right of the image, speaking (possibly in mid-sentence) as she gestures with her right hand. The podium has a logo that appears to be circular with a diagonal line or stripe, reminiscent of a simple stylized letter \"e.\"\n\nThe woman is wearing a dark outfit and her blonde hair frames her face as she looks intently towards the audience (not visible in the image). Her expression conveys engagement and possibly emphasis on the point she is making.\n\nTo the left, there is a table where two men are seated. The nearest man appears to be in deep thought, resting his head on his hand. He wears glasses and a dark suit. The other man, partially obscured and farther away, is facing forward, lending his attention either to the woman speaking or something in front of him on the table.\n\nThe room features a large white projection screen behind the speakers, filling most of the background and bisected by the shadow or silhouette of the speaker. The lighting is muted, focusing attention mostly on the speaker and the podium area. Decor includes dark wooden panels and a geometric structural design on the ceiling and walls, suggestive of modern architectural styling from the mid to late 20th century.","title":"Citizens meeting on transportation, a forum on \"Strategies for clean air\" proposed by the New York City EPA","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554337","554343","557703","554333","554344","546550","556451","543924","554338","543925","557704","556270","557027","554322","556253","556028"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["speaker","room","table","woman","styling","screen","hall","audience","attention","hand"]}
