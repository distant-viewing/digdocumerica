{"path":"543870.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of a young boy looking over his shoulder with a partially turned face towards the camera, giving a subtle, warm smile. His features include dark, tousled hair and expressive eyes that convey a friendly demeanor.\n\nHe is wearing a denim shirt with the collar slightly turned up. The shirt is visible up to his shoulders and part of his chest, suggesting it is a button-up style typical of casual wear.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus with a monotone light blue sky that lacks any distinguishing features. This allows the viewer's attention to remain solely focused on the boy, highlighting his facial expressions and the details of his attire.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph appears to be natural, likely sunlight, casting soft shadows on his face which accentuate his youthful features and enhance the overall intimate and pleasant atmosphere of the image. The angle of the shot, along with the blurred background, suggests that the photograph was taken outdoors during daylight.","title":"A child of migrant workers will receive very little schooling in his life. When this photograph was taken, this child's family and two other families (approximately 20 people) were living in a two-room shack. A hose from the farmer's barnyard comprised their entire water supply, and a portable toilet made up their entire sanitary facilities.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["556606","553170","558394","553147","553168","545219","549299","543476","556142","543688","556622","553494","552942","552872","554048","545307"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Portrait"],"terms":["shoulder","boy","feature","face","chest","collar","portrait","button","smile","denim"]}
