{"path":"554348.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large heap of compressed and crushed cars in a junkyard. The twisted and compacted metal structures have various colors like red, blue, white, and beige visible on their crumpled exteriors. Many pieces of the vehicles are barely recognizable due to the extensive damage and compression, though you can discern parts like panels, car doors, and perhaps parts of frames or wheels. The cars have been stacked on top of each other forming a somewhat chaotic yet structured mountain of metal debris.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors as indicated by the clear sky visible in the background. The ground is not fully visible but seems to be typical of an industrial area with probable asphalt or dirt terrain. This setting emphasizes the end-of-life phase for these vehicles, likely waiting to be recycled or further processed in a scrapyard environment. The photograph captures a stark perspective on the recycling process of automobiles, highlighting themes of waste, recycling, and possible environmental impacts.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["552738","554320","554352","553006","542656","545303","554311","546172","545545","551517","552739","553005","544819","545365","547476","552999"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","compress","twiste","junkyard","recycling","phase","scrapyard","recycl","process","asphalt"]}
