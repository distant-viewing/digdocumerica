{"path":"549518.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a view looking down a walkway on a bridge. In the foreground, the pavement of the walkway appears weathered with some discoloration and features faint traces of painted markings or lettering that are partially worn away. The walkway is bordered by metal railings on both sides. Prominent in the forefront are three flags mounted on flagpoles, fluttering in the breeze. From left to right, they are the flag of the United States, a light blue flag with a white circular emblem in the center, and the flag of Canada. The landscape beyond the bridge displays urban scenery with buildings scattered under a clear sky. On the far left, there's a notable tower structure that stands taller than the surrounding architecture. The bridge itself appears to be devoid of pedestrians at the moment the photo was taken, emphasizing the flags and the open walkway.","title":"Looking toward Canada on the Rainbow Bridge, which spans the Niagara River just below the falls.
