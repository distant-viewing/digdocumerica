{"path":"548078.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling marina or harbor from an elevated perspective. The body of water is densely populated with various boats, highlighting a busy boating scene. Several small boats and vessels, including motorboats, are scattered throughout the image, some moving while others are stationary. On the left side of the image, there is a pier extending into the water, lined with additional boats that are docked alongside. This pier is equipped with red-roofed structures, possibly boat sheds or storage facilities.\n\nThe water's surface is calm, reflecting a slight ripple effect, possibly from the movement of the boats. The overall atmosphere suggests a recreational or working waterfront area, likely taken during the daytime given the natural lighting conditions. The background and surrounding areas are not visible in the frame, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the water-based activities and the arrangement of the boats and pier. The composition uses a mix of colors with predominantly blues from the water and contrasting whites and muted colors of the boats, along with the red rooftops on the pier adding a splash of vibrant color.\n\nThe image provides no clear view of land beyond the immediate waterfront, creating a feeling of isolation or concentration on the maritime activities. It's a snapshot of maritime life, possibly reflecting a community dependent on or enjoying their access to waterways.","title":"Fishing craft on the willamette river at Oregon city, home of crown-zellerbach corporation and publisher's paper company.
