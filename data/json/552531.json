{"path":"552531.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a grassy area where a stone grave marker is prominently visible among tall wild grasses and vegetation. The headstone is engraved with the name \"MICHAEL FRAKER\" at the top and mentions that he died on January 11, 1848. Below his name, additional text probably tells more about him, but it's partially obscured by the overgrowth. The vegetation around the stone is dense and varied in height and type, suggesting a somewhat neglected or natural field setting.\n\nThe grave marker stands amidst these tall grasses that frame the headstone and slightly obscure its lower part. The background shows more greenery and a clear, blue sky, suggesting a sunny day with no visible buildings or other structures, emphasizing the solitude and peacefulness of the location. The overall composition highlights the isolation and somewhat forgotten state of the grave, surrounded by nature reclaiming the space.","title":"Grave of Michael Fraker, first white settler in La Fayette, northeast Knox County, Illinois 1833","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["547417","546098","555566","557941","550364","545314","546106","544259","550731","552683","545357","546147","549041","552451","554790","557942"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["headstone","grave","marker","name","overgrowth","stone","peacefulness","grass","height","vegetation"]}
