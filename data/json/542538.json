{"path":"542538.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene at a mining or construction site. The primary focus is on an aged, dusty articulated dump truck, colored in faded red and packed with a sandy material, positioned at the center. The truck looks operational, set against an industrial environment.\n\nIn the background, there is a large industrial structure, possibly a conveyor belt or processing facility, serving as the infrastructure for the material handling or production associated with the site. It has a grayish metallic appearance and stretches horizontally across much of the frame.\n\nThe environment is dominated by large piles of a similar sandy material, suggesting that the site's main operation might involve sand, gravel, or a related substance. The ground is compact and textured with tire tracks and footprints, illustrating the heavy use of the area by vehicles and workers.\n\nThe sky above portrays a dramatic mix of dark and lighter blue tones, possibly indicating gathering storm clouds or late afternoon light conditions, adding a somewhat stark, dynamic contrast to the ground operations.\n\nThe scene is expansive, exhibited by the openness and scale of the set-up and operations. There are no visible people in the shot, focusing entirely on mechanical operations and the industrial setup. The image captures an essence of robust activity amidst stillness, typical to many industrial or construction environments.","title":"Drying sulfur at plant","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["547922","557385","545677","547232","544135","550270","544138","555636","547243","544099","555638","554765","544161","555866","544169","549956"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["operation","site","material","truck","dump","footprint","construction","storm","substance","openness"]}
