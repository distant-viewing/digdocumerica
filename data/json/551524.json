{"path":"551524.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene featuring a large dredging boat moored at a sandy riverbank. The boat appears to be an old, rusted barge equipped with a crane-like apparatus on its deck, which is used for dredging operations. Small piles of sand on the riverbank suggest recent activity, possibly the deposit of dredged materials.\n\nThe river runs across the foreground with rippled water reflecting a bluish hue, indicating it's probably a sunny day. Surrounding the river and the dredging area is a lush, dense backdrop of green trees, forming a wall of foliage that contrasts with the industrial nature of the barge.\n\nThe overall setting feels quite secluded and peaceful, apart from the heavy machinery, with nature encroaching on a space marked by human activity. The composition focuses on the interplay between the man-made elements (the dredge and the cleared sand) and the natural environment surrounding them.","title":"Two barges at the site of an abandoned sand and gravel operation on the west side of the Mississippi river.
