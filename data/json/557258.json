{"path":"557258.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively urban scene, likely taken in an open public space such as a park or plaza. The setting shows a large fountain or pool in the center where water is gently rippling. Around the fountain, a diverse group of people can be seen engaging in various activities, contributing to the dynamic and public aspect of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, individuals are seated on what appears to be a low wall or ledge enclosing the water feature. They are primarily backlit, with their silhouettes outlined against the brighter background, suggesting this image was taken on a sunny day. These individuals are depicted in casual poses, some are interacting with one another, while others seem to be enjoying the moment quietly or observing the surroundings.\n\nThe background of the image is filled with trees providing shade, under which more people can be seen gathered, sitting or strolling around the area. The architecture surrounding the park is indicative of an urban environment. Tall buildings, including an older brick building and a modern high-rise, frame the park space. Notably, one of the buildings features signage for \"2nd Federal Savings & Loan\" and \"Grants\", suggesting commercial activity nearby.\n\nThe image captures the vivacity of city life, where people of different backgrounds come together in a shared space. The presence of food wrappers in the foreground hints at leisurely activities such as eating lunch outdoors. Overall, the photograph reflects a quintessential urban summer setting, featuring social interaction, relaxation, and the integration of natural and constructed elements.","title":"A lunchtime crowd enjoys the attractions of mellon square in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
