{"path":"556997.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image offers an aerial view of a verdant, rural landscape dominated by a mix of forested areas, open fields, and scattered homes. The perspective is taken from a high altitude, looking down on the terrain below, which shows a diverse mix of land usage.\n\nStarting from the foreground and moving towards the background, one can see various plots of land, some are cleared while others are densely wooded. The developed areas feature several buildings that vary in size, presumably residential houses and possibly some farm-related structures. The clearings around these buildings suggest a mixture of residential areas and small-scale agricultural or pastoral activities.\n\nA winding road is visible, snaking through the landscape and connecting clusters of homes, enhancing accessibility within this seemingly remote area. A prominent feature of the photograph is the extensive, dense forest that surrounds the residential and open areas, emphasizing a sense of privacy and seclusion.\n\nThe landscape is bordered by a large body of water in the middle distance, which is sandwiched by more forest-clad regions stretching into the horizon where mountain peaks are faintly visible, suggesting this area is near a coastal region possibly backed by a mountain range.\n\nThe photo conveys a picturesque, tranquil environment that is characterized by a harmonious blend of natural and human-modified landscapes. The vastness of the open and wooded areas alike indicates the sparsely populated nature of this region.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest at private Douglas fir re-growth land between Bangor Annex and Silverdale. This area and others like it will be affected by population growth when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is built.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556968","556937","556915","556972","556971","556994","558061","556969","556967","556981","553817","556955","556914","557003","556916","553978"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["region","home","sandwich","modify","privacy","accessibility","land","area","mix","start"]}
