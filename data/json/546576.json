{"path":"546576.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene characterized by a moody, atmospheric appearance. The image is taken in a long corridor with dim lighting, enhancing a sense of depth and perspective. The walls are lined with dark wood panels, and the floor is carpeted, which adds to the overall dark tone of the hallway.\n\nIn the distance, the corridor leads to a brightly lit area where a person stands silhouetted against vivid red curtains that flank an exit door, which is backlit with white light. The contrast between the dark hallway and the bright exit creates a focal point in the image. On the right side foreground, a framed picture depicting a serene landscape hangs on the wall, providing a small inset of color and detail against the darker surroundings.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a sense of solitude or expectation, also evoked by the lone figure at the end of the hall, positioned centrally, enhancing the symmetry and linear perspective of the composition. This setting might be inside a hotel, theater, or an institution hallway, given its structured and formal arrangement. Overall, the photo evokes a narrative quality, possibly suggesting themes of departure, transition, or contemplation.","title":"Interior of cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546558","546462","546475","546498","558322","556017","546471","555963","546510","544437","546580","543028","549670","552450","557391","546517"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["corridor","theater","institution","departure","symmetry","backlit","hotel","structured","hall","framed"]}
