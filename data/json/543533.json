{"path":"543533.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene lakeside scene with distinct natural features and elements hinting at cooler weather conditions. The foreground is dominated by an intriguing pattern of patchy, slushy ice formations on the lake's surface, reflecting the sunlight and appearing partly submerged in the clear water. These ice patches gradually lead into the open water of a vast lake, extending toward the background.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a small islet adorned with bare trees in the middle of the lake, contributing to the natural tranquility of the scene. The shoreline curves gently from the foreground on the right, moving into the background and providing a sense of depth and dimension. Along this sandy and gritty shore, a solitary canoe rests partially on land, indicative of human activity and recreational use of the lake.\n\nThe background features a row of mountains covered with snow, suggesting this photograph was taken in late winter or early spring. The sky is clear and bright blue, enhancing the picturesque quality of the setting with ample natural light that highlights textures and colors within the scene. This setting is peaceful yet vibrant, showing a blend of winter's remnants and the onset of warmer seasons.","title":"Scum along lake shore","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543532","543550","544031","547127","550674","552974","543547","554609","543522","543816","543531","551207","555703","555692","557571","543618"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","ice","winter","patchy","islet","onset","dimension","intriguing","canoe","mountains"]}
