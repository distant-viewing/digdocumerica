{"path":"543527.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene lakeside setting, with several components contributing to a calm and scenic ambiance. In the forefront, there is a wooden dock extending into the lake, lined with numerous empty boat slips suggesting a peaceful, off-peak moment. The water appears calm and reflective.\n\nOn the shore, there's a small beach area with coarse sand and rocks where two small boats—one an overturned rowboat and another a small sailboat—are resting. Near these boats, a cluster of boulders forms a natural boundary between the beach and a landscaped area.\n\nBehind this beach, set slightly up an incline and surrounded by natural flora, stands a row of rustic buildings. These buildings, likely lodges or cabins, have a uniform architectural style, featuring dark wooden exteriors and sloping roofs, each equipped with a balcony facing the lake. The balconies are supported by sturdy vertical beams, and large picture windows are visible, offering occupants a view of the lake and surrounding landscapes.\n\nThe background is densely forested with tall conifers that tower over the lodges, reinforcing the secluded and wooded feel of the location. This lush backdrop suggests the setting is in a region where such evergreen trees are common, possibly in a mountainous area. The overall atmosphere is quiet and idyllic, ideal for a retreat or relaxation by the water away from the bustle of city life.","title":"Condominiums on the lake","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552987","543579","543547","557562","544567","551259","554552","544266","551207","548034","553440","554635","547052","547027","550324","542908"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Waterfront Development"],"terms":["lodge","beach","balcony","lake","boat","incline","rowboat","bustle","retreat","occupant"]}
