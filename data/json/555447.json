{"path":"555447.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a state police car parked on the side of a highway. The car is a vintage sedan model, colored white with \"STATE POLICE\" and the registration number \"E117512\" visible. There are two red beacon lights mounted on the roof, and an open door reveals an officer seated inside, potentially operating a radar gun or similar device. She appears to be in her official uniform, including a peaked cap.\n\nThe environment provides clear evidence of an overcast day with cloudy skies, contributing to a slightly gloomy atmosphere. To the right of the scene is a road sign stating a speed limit of 55 miles per hour, with a lower limit for trucks set at 50 miles per hour.\n\nIn the background, a residential area with several houses and tall trees can be observed. The highway itself shows moderate traffic flow with several cars visible. The overall composition of the image sets a scene of routine traffic surveillance or speed monitoring conducted by law enforcement on a busy highway.","title":"Motorists were stopped by the state police when they exceeded the 55 mile an hour limit on highways which had a previous limit of 70.
