{"path":"553947.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a diverse landscape featuring infrastructure and natural land. Dominating the foreground is a complex, multilane highway intersection, with several loops and connecting ramps prominently displayed. The roads are bordered by patches of green grass and small structures, likely related to the road system.\n\nBeyond the intersection, the view opens into expanses of cultivated fields with varying shades of green and brown, indicating different types of crops or stages of growth. These fields are divided by dirt tracks and smaller roads that meander through the countryside.\n\nTo the right in the midground of the photo, there is a cluster of structures that could be part of an industrial or agricultural facility, visible due to their large, white roofs reflecting sunlight. This area marks the transition from rural to more urban environments.\n\nIn the background, the landscape transitions again into a residential area, where denser housing can be seen, gradually leading up to a mountainous region shrouded partially by clouds, suggesting either a coastal or highland region.\n\nThe sky above is slightly overcast, with clouds casting shadows over the land, adding to the dynamic lighting of the scene. The overall impression is of a region where agricultural, industrial, and residential areas coexist closely, likely near a major city or town optimized for accessibility via the featured highway system.","title":"Green sugar cane fields (some 620 acres) are a buffer between a heavily-developed area and a large agricultural area. In 1973 the Land Use Commission turned down a proposal to use it for low-cost housing.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553944","558055","551205","552719","548827","547770","553015","548411","553943","558049","557461","548092","546733","546612","546709","555630"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["intersection","region","highway","transition","system","multilane","road","loop","ramp","accessibility"]}
