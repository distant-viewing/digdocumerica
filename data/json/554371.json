{"path":"554371.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph shows a scene from a car show, possibly during the 1970s or 1980s, featuring two women presenting or modeling. Each woman is standing next to a luxury car seat, suggestive of a display of high-end car interiors. The two car seats are prominently placed in the foreground on a raised platform covered with a red carpet. Behind the car seats, there are partial views of automobiles, hinting that this is likely a car exhibition hall.\n\nThe women are dressed in elegant, floor-length white gowns with halter-neck designs, and both are holding microphones, implying they are either speaking about the products or engaging with an audience. Their attire and poise suggest they are models or presenters hired for the event. The background includes various exhibition elements like large mirrors, colorful panels, and other people who appear to be attendees of the show. The interior of the venue is spacious and lit with bright, artificial lighting typically used in exposition halls.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554385","554387","554372","554373","554374","554389","554390","554381","554375","554378","554383","554388","552782","554377","557918","554376"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","exhibition","hall","seat","interior","halter","gown","woman","luxury","microphone"]}
