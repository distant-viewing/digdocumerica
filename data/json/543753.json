{"path":"543753.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric scene of a lone individual engaged in fishing. The setting is a large body of water that appears still, reflecting the dim, ambient light which gives an overall moody and tranquil tone to the image. The person is situated towards the right of the frame, sitting in solitude in what looks like a small boat or similar watercraft.\n\nThe water's surface is textured, possibly indicating a gentle movement or the presence of slight ripples. The composition utilizes natural light, which, along with the water's reflections, creates areas of contrasting light and dark patches. This highlights the reflective quality of the water while providing a mysterious, almost ethereal look to the setting.\n\nThere is a subtle light source causing a shimmering patch on the water near the center of the photograph, drawing attention towards the lone figure and enhancing the sense of isolation. The background is minimally detailed, enveloped in shadows that fade into the distance, further emphasizing the focus on the person and their activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a quiet moment of solitude, with the person likely absorbed in the contemplative act of fishing, surrounded by the vastness of the water and the enveloping darkness of twilight or dawn.","title":"Early morning at the golden gate campground","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["552309","552314","550217","552308","551024","550666","544714","549933","554147","550313","557565","542651","543659","547555","547558","552313"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["envelop","fishing","person","water","solitude","watercraft","absorb","light","darkness","act"]}
