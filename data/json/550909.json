{"path":"550909.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a vast parking lot densely packed with numerous vehicles, predominantly featuring Volkswagen Beetles and Volkswagen Type 2 (Transporter) vans. The Beetle cars, noticeable for their distinctive rounded shapes and rear-engine layout, are arrayed in tightly organized rows, presenting a variety of colors mostly in subdued tones like blues, beiges, and greens. Mixed among these Beetles are several VW Type 2 vans, also known as VW buses, which have a more boxy shape compared to the Beetles.\n\nThe image displays no visible people or activities, suggesting the primary focus is on the multitude of parked vehicles. Most vehicles are oriented in the same direction, indicating an organized parking arrangement typical of car manufacturing plants or storage facilities before distribution. The sheer number of cars underscores the massive scale of production and storage for these popular models during their peak manufacturing era.\n\nThe background offers no distinctive features, merely additional layers of similarly parked cars fading into a blur, emphasizing the enormity of the car collection. The daylight and clear weather enhance visibility and color saturation, making the scene vivid despite the monotonous repetition of vehicle models. The composition of the photograph, with its rows upon rows of cars, creates a patterned texture and a testament to automotive history specific to Volkswagen's iconic designs.","title":"Shipment of autoMobiles on dock at the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["542634","550908","542637","546813","542635","542817","546879","542638","551912","554349","553896","547480","553303","546900","556721","558254"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","van","row","vehicle","parking","model","enormity","repetition","testament","storage"]}
