{"path":"551374.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a snake swimming in clear water. The snake is slender and appears dark, contrasting with the lighter green-blue color of the water. Its head is slightly lifted above the water surface, suggesting it may be looking ahead or taking in air. You can see the curvature of its body as it navigates through the water, creating gentle ripples around it. The water is relatively calm, with some reflections and minor disturbances on the surface, likely from the movement of the snake. Underwater, some darker areas suggest the presence of submerged plants or rocks. The overall atmosphere is serene yet intriguing, highlighting the snake's adaptation to an aquatic environment.","title":"Water snake (Natrix) in clear, spring waters of Ha Ha Tonka Lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544900","551375","544904","543286","555065","549459","544908","544528","544546","551363","543567","548713","552917","548835","554623","544347"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["snake","underwater","curvature","adaptation","water","disturbance","ripple","surface","head","air"]}
