{"path":"547501.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a long, narrow pier lined with large industrial pipes extending over a body of water. The perspective is taken from one end of the pier, looking straight down its length towards the other end. The pipes, various in size and some appearing weathered and rusted while others look newer and whiter, rest parallel to each other along the pier. They are supported by a structure consisting of metal and wooden beams.\n\nThe water glistens under the daylight, suggesting this photo was taken on a sunny day. Off to the sides of the pier, in the distance, there are additional industrial structures that resemble docks or mooring points, along with what appears to be a small boat moving away from the pier. The skyline is relatively clear with no significant buildings or natural features, emphasizing the industrial and utilitarian nature of the location. The focus on the pipes and their structural support conveys themes of industry, transportation, or utility management, such as oil or water.","title":"Pipelines from dock of Northeast Petroleum tanker terminal on Mt.
