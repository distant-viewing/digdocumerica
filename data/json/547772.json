{"path":"547772.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This image appears to capture a vibrant, sunlit day at an urban park setting. Three young women are seated closely together on a park bench, engaged in a casual conversation. They are dressed in typical casual attire, which suggests the photograph might be from around the 1970s given the style of their clothing. Each woman exhibits a relaxed posture, with one leaning forward attentively, another looking directly at one of her friends, and the third staring off into the distance.\n\nThe park itself is well-manicured, featuring neatly trimmed hedges and a scattering of tall, slender trees. The foliage is lush and green, indicating a warm season. In the background, a busy street scene unfolds. Vintage automobiles line the road and a delivery truck with visible branding (\"Central\") is parked by the curb. The architecture lining the street includes a notable building with bold signage that reads \"LENS\" and below, \"Leon's,” suggesting a commercial area with shops and possibly a restaurant or café.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph includes a foreground that is lightly blurred — possibly a leafy branch intruding into the frame on the right side, introducing a sense of depth and natural framing to the image. The main subjects— the three women—are positioned centrally, but the hustle of urban life and a sense of spacious outdoor atmosphere are equally emphasized by the lively background.","title":"Lunch in the park in downtown Tyler","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["548646","546855","557175","551444","551742","551466","554178","551815","551545","548626","551013","551472","551433","553205","550967","553208"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["park","woman","hedge","scattering","café","delivery","branding","restaurant","lens","hustle"]}
