{"path":"547885.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This is a vivid and dynamic photograph featuring a group of people sitting on benches along a waterfront setting. The scene is likely captured on a sunny day, as evidenced by the clear sky and the shadows cast by the individuals. The benches are arranged in a straight line parallel to the edge of the waterfront, separated from the water by a metal railing and a short distance of paved walkway.\n\nThe individuals, mostly elderly, display a variety of attire ranging from hats, jackets, and sweaters to more formal wear, suggesting the photo might have been taken during a mild weather season. Many of the people are engaging with each other in conversation, while others look out towards the water or are lost in thought.\n\nThe background includes a large brick building, indicating an urban setting. Subtly visible graffiti on the stone border of the waterfront adds an element of urban texture and history to the scene. Overall, the composition offers a snapshot of communal life and leisure in an urban park-like setting by the water.","title":"A small park on Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547870","548647","549926","552722","552727","551711","555945","555991","550228","555948","553158","550051","548625","546855","556296","555947"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["waterfront","bench","graffiti","border","history","thought","walkway","sweater","railing","snapshot"]}
