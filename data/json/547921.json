{"path":"547921.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking and somewhat desolate scene characterized by a contrast between urban development and discarded debris. In the foreground, strewn across a sandy and unkempt terrain, are numerous discarded appliances, including refrigerators and washers. These appliances are in various states of disrepair and abandonment, with open doors and parts scattered around them, hinting at a narrative of neglect or obsolescence.\n\nThe background features a large, unoccupied multistory building that appears unfinished or abandoned. It's a stark, modern construction, possibly a high-rise apartment or office building, with many visible balconies and empty window openings. The building dominates the skyline, standing incongruously in what seems to be an undeveloped or neglected area, marked by the absence of active human presence or vibrant activity.\n\nThe setting gives the impression of an urban fringe or a developing area that has seen stalled progress or economic downturns. The juxtaposition of modern architectural ambition with the foreground's scene of abandonment speaks volumes about environmental and possibly economic issues affecting the area. The overcast sky and lack of vegetation contribute to the bleak and forlorn atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Old refrigerators and shell of highrise at breezy point highrise construction was stopped by city in major battle to preserve area for public recreation","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553869","557283","549786","556640","549958","546400","544809","557350","549782","552757","549785","549777","550246","557345","550263","549766"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["appliance","abandonment","obsolescence","refrigerator","neglect","bleak","fringe","strew","stall","volume"]}
