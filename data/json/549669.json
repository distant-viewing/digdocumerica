{"path":"549669.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lively outdoor café scene, possibly taken in the 1970s or 1980s based on the style of clothing and overall ambiance. The scene is vibrant and colorful, centered around multiple groups of people gathered under bright yellow and red striped umbrellas at various small, round tables. Each table is surrounded by matching yellow chairs, contributing to a cheerful and cohesive look.\n\nThe café is set on a paved area, with pedestrians walking along a sidewalk that curves around the venue. Adding to the charm are several potted red flowers placed throughout the space, complementing the vivid colors of the umbrellas. A small sign with \"Bitburger\" on it is visible, suggesting that the café might serve beverages from this brewery.\n\nMen and women can be seen engaging in conversations, dining, and enjoying beverages. Their attire varies, with some wearing dresses, skirts, and suits, indicative of a casual yet slightly upscale setting. Overall, the photograph depicts a snapshot of social life and interaction in an outdoor European setting, filled with leisure and bustling activity. The background is slightly blurred due to the focus on the café, emphasizing the lively social gathering at the forefront.","title":"Outdoor cafes and clean air take the place of traffic congestion during those hours of the day when the Graben is closed to traffic.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549672","549677","549657","551846","551634","551650","553190","551848","550037","551637","551635","551803","551910","553319","553204","551847"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["café","beverage","umbrella","table","dining","venue","1980","skirt","charm","chair"]}
