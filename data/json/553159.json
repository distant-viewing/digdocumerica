{"path":"553159.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, social scene at an urban outdoor concrete structure, likely in the 1970s or 1980s based on the style of clothing and hair. The setting is a multi-level architectural environment composed predominantly of stark, grey concrete surfaces, featuring stairs, platforms, and slanted walls, which contribute to a dynamic and angular composition.\n\nThe image is bustling with people, including adults and children, who are engaged in various activities. On the multiple layers of the structure, groups of people can be seen sitting and interacting. Some individuals are having conversations, others are simply enjoying the sunny day, and a few appear to be walking or navigating the stairs. The presence of casual clothing along with the relaxed postures suggests a leisurely atmosphere, perhaps a break during a workday or a social gathering.\n\nThe environment is softened by patches of greenery, with small trees and plants visible in planters on the balconies, adding a touch of nature to the otherwise stark urban setting. The sunshine casts shadows and highlights that enhance the textures of the concrete and the casual, lively human activity. This multi-level, open-air gathering spot seems to be a public space designed for rest, social interaction, and perhaps transit between different areas or levels of a building or complex.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: school class takes a lunch break.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553319","553158","550751","549909","551651","550082","550083","553264","553183","546452","550075","553166","550076","551646","550759","546443"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["stair","gathering","sunshine","workday","clothing","planter","1980","transit","highlight","balcony"]}
