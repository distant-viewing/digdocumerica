{"path":"544918.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, wintry forest scene with multiple conifer trees. These trees, possibly pines or firs, stand tall against a backdrop of snow-covered ground. The trees have a relatively straight trunk structure, and the snow has settled lightly on the ground, suggesting light snowfall rather than a heavy storm. The trees have sparse branches, some of which are bare and without foliage, indicating possibly harsh conditions or the natural life cycle of the trees. The ground is uneven, and various patches appear more densely packed with snow than others. No human or animal activity is visible in the scene, adding to the sense of quiet isolation typical of a forest during winter. The lighting in the image is soft, possibly due to an overcast sky, which casts an even light and creates a moody atmosphere without strong shadows. This kind of landscape could be indicative of a mountainous region in late winter, where snow persists but does not completely blanket the landscape.","title":"Forest near Wolf Creek Pass","placename":"Wolfe Creek Pass (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543610","555123","557608","557613","545297","557020","557597","554589","555201","548744","557019","553574","555110","555071","542849","553579"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snow","winter","fir","snowfall","settle","tree","cycle","ground","forest","storm"]}
