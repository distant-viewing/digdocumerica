{"path":"552613.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly couple at what appears to be a yard or garage sale set in a grassy backyard. The couple stands close to the foreground, slightly off-center to the left, smiling at the camera. The woman is wearing glasses, a blue cardigan over a light blue blouse, with a patterned scarf around her neck, while the man, standing slightly behind her, wears glasses, a light blue shirt, and a brown cardigan.\n\nSurrounding them are various items scattered and displayed for sale, suggesting a homely and somewhat crowded setting. There are boxes filled with assorted household goods, such as dishes and glassware, visible in the foreground. Various items like a white microwave, furniture pieces, framed pictures, rugs, and assorted knick-knacks are also spread out across the area.\n\nIn the background, there's a red and beige building that likely serves as a garage or storage shed, adding to the residential feel of the scene. Off to the right in the background, more people can be seen browsing through the items, indicating that the sale is attended by more than just the couple. Trees and overcast skies suggest a cool, possibly autumn day. The overall mood is busy yet cheerful, capturing a moment of community and domestic life.","title":"Retiring dentist Dr. Blakely and his wife held a yard sale to clear out the accumulation of 35 years in one house.
