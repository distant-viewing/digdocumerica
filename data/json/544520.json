{"path":"544520.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The image features a close-up view of a colorful grasshopper perched on a striped wooden surface, possibly a deck or outdoor furniture. The grasshopper is facing left with its head turned slightly towards the camera, allowing a detailed view of its facial structure, segmented body, and detailed texture. Its body is adorned with intricate patterns mostly in shades of yellow, brown, and black, giving it excellent camouflage against natural backgrounds.\n\nThe insect's prominent features include long, segmented antennae, large compound eyes, powerful hind legs adapted for jumping, and short forelimbs used for gripping surfaces. The overall texture of the grasshopper is distinctly segmented, with a rough outer exoskeleton visible in the image.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurred natural setting in shades of green, likely vegetation, which provides a muted, contrasting backdrop to the vivid detail and coloration of the grasshopper. This focus on the grasshopper with a softened background emphasizes the subject and its unique physical traits. The lighting in the photograph highlights the textures and patterns on the grasshopper's body, enhancing the visual impact of its detailed exoskeleton.","title":"Grasshopper","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553872","557585","557102","544896","555196","555062","557544","549144","555064","544514","544517","544280","542957","544479","544518","555066"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["segment","antennae","compound","insect","texture","camouflage","grip","adapt","body","coloration"]}
