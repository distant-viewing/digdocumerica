{"path":"542596.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph prominently features a large pile of logs amassed outdoors. The logs are piled haphazardly yet densely, with their circular ends facing towards the viewer, showcasing various shades of brown wood interspersed with darker areas that suggest moisture or exposure elements. The ends of the logs reveal growth rings, texture, and natural decay marks, suggesting they have been cut down some time ago and have been sitting in this pile since.\n\nThe background is minimally visible at the top edge of the photo where a clear blue sky indicates it is a bright, sunny day, serving to enhance the natural, rugged texture of the wood with rich, well-defined shadows and highlights. This strong lighting gives depth to the pile and visually emphasizes the organic nuances of each piece.\n\nThe ground beneath the logs is littered with wood chips, small branches, and detritusâ€”presumedly bits that have fallen off from the stacked logs, mirroring the natural environment of a woody or forested area involved in logging activities. The absence of visible human or mechanical activity suggests this photo captures a moment of inactive repose in a setting dedicated to logging or wood storage.","title":"Ponderosa pine logs stacked at Pine Industry mill","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["550877","555144","542595","552203","552197","548155","553647","555507","545060","552547","550337","543489","552163","554416","555143","552199"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","wood","pile","end","detritus","chip","ring","mark","moisture","highlight"]}
