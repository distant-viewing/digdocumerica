{"path":"549281.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban scene captured from a pedestrian bridge. The main focus is a narrow pathway enclosed by chain-link fencing on both sides. At the forefront, two spherical-shaped street lamps are mounted on rusty poles, slightly leaning towards the path, and adding a vintage effect to the scene.\n\nIn the background, numerous details of urban life are visible. On the left side, an elevated highway extends into the distance, dotted with vehicles which suggest motion. Below this overpass, another road runs parallel, filled with parked cars and a few moving vehicles, all reflecting the hustle and bustle of city transport.\n\nBeyond the fencing, there are multiple structures. A multi-storey building occupies the mid-background directly ahead, and its architecture suggests a residential or commercial use, possibly apartments or offices. Other similar buildings surround this area, contributing to the urban density.\n\nThe horizon reveals a clear blue sky, scattered with a few clouds, which hints at a bright, sunny day. This natural lighting enriches the colors in the composition; especially the greenery that is interspersed between the architectural elements, providing a slight reprieve from the grey and metallic urban setup.","title":"Looking northeast from the step of a walkway over Route C1 elevated highway.
