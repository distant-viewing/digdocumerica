{"path":"550525.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph showcases a panoramic view of a valley surrounded by mountains. This landscape appears to be in a remote area, depicted by its pristine and natural environment. The foreground features a small community settled along a twisting river. The river is broad and silt-laden, meandering through the valley.\n\nIn the center-right of the image, there are visible clusters of houses and other buildings of modest structure, dispersed around an area that closely follows the contours of the river. A road winds its way through the settlement and along the riverbank, suggesting it as the primary thoroughfare for the community.\n\nThe background is dominated by various shades of green with dense vegetation covering the lower parts of the mountains, while the higher terrains and peaks are relatively barren and rocky. The mountains rise steeply from the valley floor, helping to frame the picturesque scene.\n\nThe image captures an overall serene and untouched atmosphere, typical of a rural, mountainous region, likely emphasizing nature's majesty and the small scale of human habitation within it. The lighting indicates that the photo was taken during the day under clear skies, enhancing the vividness of the natural colors in the scene.","title":"Wiseman, a former gold-mining center.
