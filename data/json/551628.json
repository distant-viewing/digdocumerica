{"path":"551628.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man participating in urban gardening on a rooftop. The man, dressed in a casual red long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans, is bending over to tend to some plants in a large, rectangular wooden container. He appears focused on his task, reaching out to handle the plants gently.\n\nThe container is filled with a rich assortment of leafy green plants, possibly varieties of lettuce or cabbage, indicative of a well-maintained garden. There are several similar planters around, suggesting a robust garden setup. In addition to the leafy greens, there is a lush tree with green foliage and red berries to the right of the man, emphasizing the diversity of the cultivation.\n\nThe background features a detailed view of a traditional brick building with multiple windows, some of which have air conditioning units. This setting indicates that the rooftop garden is likely in an urban environment, possibly in a residential area given the appearance of the building.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rich greens from the plants and the urban backdrop, highlights the contrast and harmony between nature and the built environment, showcasing how green spaces can be integrated into urban settings.","title":"Cherries, carrots, strawberries and roses are only some of the plants that flourish twenty floors up in Stuart Mott's penthouse garden.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551627","551625","551626","550059","551620","550764","551623","551490","550055","551617","551705","549298","544236","550760","551755","551704"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","rooftop","plant","container","conditioning","planter","harmony","green","gardening","addition"]}
