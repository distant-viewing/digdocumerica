{"path":"549890.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban highway scene, likely taken from an overpass or a high vantage point. The main focus is on a multilane highway that curves gently to the right through the frame. The road is filled with various vehicles from an older era, including sedans and station wagons, suggesting the photo might be several decades old based on auto styles.\n\nThe highway is partially divided by a concrete barrier, and there are multiple levels of roadway visible. An adjacent road layer is elevated, supported by concrete columns. Safety railings and light poles line the edges of these roads. The composition also features some infrastructure like exit signs, though specific details such as text are not clearly visible.\n\nThe traffic appears moderately congested, with cars and trucks maintaining minimal spacing between them as they travel in the same direction. No pedestrians or non-vehicular activity is observable in the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the colors are somewhat muted, and shadows are visible on the road surfaces. The overall ambiance reflects a typical bustling city environment, focused on transportation and roadways. The background beyond the highway is obscured mostly by the road structures and a lack of distinctive landmarks, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location without more context.","title":"Cross Bronx Expressway","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555437","547811","556194","542764","547785","546686","547823","553727","546681","545451","545432","556785","547569","549902","545884","546571"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","road","roadway","multilane","auto","overpass","elevate","exit","landmark","wagon"]}
