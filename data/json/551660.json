{"path":"551660.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant urban scene along a busy city street, most likely New York City given the visible signs including \"Radio City\" in the background. The image is taken during daytime with sunlight filtering through high-rise buildings, illuminating parts of the street and casting shadows.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent feature is a linear water feature with multiple fountains that appear like small geysers, creating a dynamic element in the photograph. This fountain aligns with the street, adding a peaceful contrast to the bustling scene.\n\nThe street is flanked by tall commercial buildings featuring a mix of modern and art deco architecture. The scene is lively, filled with pedestrians and vehicles that suggest the typical rhythm of a busy metropolitan area. People are seen walking, and some are sitting near the water feature, enjoying the day.\n\nThere are visible traffic elements like cars and iconic yellow cabs, which, along with the densely packed buildings and signage for landmarks such as Radio City Music Hall, evoke the essence of a bustling New York street scene.\n\nIn the distance, the street leads towards more high-rise buildings, and the perspective creates a sense of depth, drawing the viewer's eye along the length of the street converging towards the horizon. The color palette is rich with the blues of the sky and water contrasting with the varied hues of the urban environment.","title":"Rockefeller Center--6th Avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551661","555782","551663","551647","553845","557256","550747","552705","548399","551652","552726","551493","551643","553224","551772","553214"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["street","fountain","rhythm","cab","converge","rise","art","building","landmark","daytime"]}
