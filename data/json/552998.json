{"path":"552998.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph displays a haunting and somewhat desolate scene situated in a dry, desert-like environment. In the foreground, a prominent animal skull, perhaps of a cow or a similar large mammal, lies on the red, sandy soil. Just behind the skull, parts of a skeleton are partially unearthed with visible ribs and vertebrae. Further scattered elements such as rocks, small plant debris, and old fencing materials like wire add to the deserted and wild nature of the scene.\n\nMoving towards the mid-ground, there is an abandoned car, deteriorated and partially buried under the sand. The car, predominantly white with a rusted exterior, seems to be a classic model, suggesting it has been in this neglected state for a considerable period. The car adds a sense of abandonment and isolation to the landscape.\n\nIn the background, the terrain is marked by rolling sandy hills and shrub-dotted landscapes under a clear blue sky. The stark, rugged hill in the distance complements the overall arid and deserted feel of the area. The combination of these elements – the animal remains, the abandoned car, and the desolate landscape – together evoke a sense of past activity that has long since ended, leaving behind remnants that blend into the natural decay of the environment.","title":"Bony remains of dead cattle outside the Moab city dump (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
