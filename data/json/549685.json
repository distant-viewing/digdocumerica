{"path":"549685.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photo captures a scene on a residential street. The image shows an elderly woman standing in an overgrown lawn facing the street, depicted in silhouette due to the lighting. In front of her across the street is a vibrant, multi-colored mini-bus with its door open, suggesting it is either picking up or dropping off passengers. The bus prominently displays a phone number and some text on its side, possibly advertising a dial-a-ride service.\n\nOn the road near the mini-bus, there is a classic, blue two-door car, giving the scene a nostalgic feel that might indicate the photograph was taken in the mid to late 20th century. The scene is framed by lush green trees and a well-kept grass median, enhancing the peaceful suburban atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Minibus from ann arbor's dial-a-ride service about to pick up a passenger at her home","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["556744","556742","545385","547814","549686","546668","556752","551445","551021","556791","556757","547195","548608","549891","556799","551090"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","median","door","drop","phone","dial","pick","advertise","mid","keep"]}
