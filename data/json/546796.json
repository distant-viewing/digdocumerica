{"path":"546796.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy scene at a maritime location, likely a port, focusing on the activities related to cargo handling. In the foreground, a middle-aged man wearing a red hat and a dark t-shirt observes the scene. Only part of his face and body are visible as he is not the central subject of the image, suggesting he may be supervising or taking a break.\n\nIn the background, there's another man, appearing younger and dressed in a red tank top and shorts, standing casually with his hands by his sides. He looks toward a large ship named \"President Adams,\" which has its name painted on its hull. Given his attire and relaxed posture, he could be a worker or simply an onlooker.\n\nDominating the composition is a load of cargo, specifically wrapped and bundled tires, hanging from a crane. This load is being moved or loaded onto the ship, indicative of the kinds of operations typically seen in cargo ports. The crane's mechanical details and the rigging used to hoist the tires are partially visible against a light blue sky, scattered with clouds.\n\nOverall, the photograph highlights elements of maritime industrial activity, focusing on human elements and the mechanical process involved in cargo handling. The use of light and shadow, along with the positioning of the subjects against the gigantic scale of the ship, adds a dramatic effect to the everyday labor carried out in such environments.","title":"Longshoremen unload cargo from ships at Dundalk Terminal, a Maryland Port Authority facility.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546915","546881","546917","555261","555285","552303","546914","555270","555283","552148","546918","555797","546762","555260","546910","553739"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["cargo","ship","load","handling","port","tire","crane","subject","rigging","onlooker"]}
