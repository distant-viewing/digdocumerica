{"path":"546079.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures three men on a small motorboat engaged in fishing activities. The person at the stern of the boat, closer to the motor, is steering the boat and dressed casually in a jacket and cap. The other two men, located more towards the bow, are actively fishing; one is casting a line while standing, and the other, also standing, appears to be pointing towards something in the distance, possibly directing the boat's course or indicating a spot for fishing.\n\nThe background features a calm river or estuary setting with a large industrial structure, resembling a storage silo or tank, prominently placed on the right-hand side of the frame. This structure is situated on the riverbank amidst sparse vegetation. The landscape around the river is primarily flat with patches of tall, dry grass, suggesting a coastal or wetland environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is serene, focusing on a leisure activity in a somewhat industrial but natural setting. The water reflects a clear sky, hinting at good weather conditions for outdoor activities. This juxtaposition of industrial elements with recreational fishing adds a unique layer to the scene, possibly pointing to human interaction with industrialized landscapes.","title":"A natural gas installation behind fishermen on Lake GRande Ecaille","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546001","546053","548164","548132","552325","549935","552317","552282","554198","550841","548160","551350","542564","545093","546980","546972"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","industrialize","stern","steer","motor","motorboat","course","bow","silo"]}
