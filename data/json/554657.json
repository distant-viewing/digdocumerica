{"path":"554657.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque outdoor scene where multiple elements contribute to its vintage, leisurely charm. In the foreground, two individuals are seated on a stone structure by the waterfront, engaging in quiet conversation with their attention directed towards the camera. Both are dressed warmly, suggesting a cool weather setting.\n\nDominating the middle ground is the focal point of the image, a multi-deck paddle steamboat named \"Minne-Ha-Ha.\" The steamboat, appearing grand and ornate, is adorned with American flags and features prominent twin smokestacks from which white smoke billows against the sky. The decks of the vessel are crowded with passengers, indicating a popular recreational outing or tour. The design details on the boat suggest a connection to vintage or historical modes of transport.\n\nThe background consists of a calm body of water that extends to a gently sloping line of hills or low mountains, further enhancing the scenic quality of the image. The clear sky suggests a fair weather day, ideal for such water-based activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, from its subjects in the foreground to the impressive steamboat and serene natural backdrop, creates a vivid portrayal of leisurely waterfront activity in a possibly historical or touristic setting.","title":"Large sightseeing steamer \"minnehaha\" cruising on Lake George in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Lake George (N.Y.)","location":"Lake George, New York","nn1":["554658","545732","543958","545736","554190","545917","543962","550825","551147","543964","543955","543972","546856","549541","543935","543963"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["waterfront","mode","tour","paddle","portrayal","ideal","outing","weather","billow","charm"]}
