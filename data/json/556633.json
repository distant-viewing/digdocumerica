{"path":"556633.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph presents a man engaged in a woodworking activity, most likely crafting or assembling a piece of furniture outdoors. The man is shirtless and is bent over a wooden structure that appears to be a door or a large frame laid horizontally over sawhorses. His posture suggests concentration and physical effort as he uses a hammer to possibly drive or remove nails.\n\nHe has dark, shoulder-length hair tied back with a bandana, complementing his rustic and industrious appearance. His bodily expressions and bare back contribute to a sense of heat and labor intensity, implying a warm, outdoor environment.\n\nIn the background, a wire mesh fence is visible, perhaps part of a makeshift workshop or an outdoor area designated for projects like this. The focus and composition are primarily on the man and his immediate workspace, which includes various tools such as a tape measure, drill, and other woodworking tools scattered around him on the working surface.\n\nThe image captures a moment of manual labor, detailing an interaction with material and tool, showcasing a scene from a possibly DIY or craftsmanship scenario. The ambient lighting and clear visibility suggest it is midday or early afternoon, a time of day conducive to outdoor work.","title":"Handmade door being fitted by a carpenter for an experimental house made of empty steel beer and soft drink cans near Taos, New Mexico. When finished the house will have the solid natural, handcrafted feeling of a traditional adobe home in the South West. Using such construction, houses can be built for as much as 20% less than conventional structures, reports the designer. Conventional beams and posts also are used to satisfy the mortgage companies.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["555533","557115","557680","554432","553603","553614","553921","550251","542497","557945","553656","553642","553613","552572","553612","553648"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["tool","labor","tape","bandana","measure","craftsmanship","heat","mesh","furniture","workshop"]}
