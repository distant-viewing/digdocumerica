{"path":"544413.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy joyfully playing at the beach. He is seated on a bright yellow, inflatable boogie board that is floating in shallow, clear blue water. The boy, who appears to be around four or five years old, is celebrating a moment of delight, his arms energetically raised above his head and his mouth open as if he is cheering or laughing. He has blond hair and is wearing only a pair of brown and red swim trunks.\n\nThe environment around him is a typical beach setting under bright, sunny weather, enhancing the vivid colors in the scene. The water is calm with gentle ripples, and the background hints at a sandy beach that extends beyond the frame. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of carefree summer fun, evoking a sense of warmth and joy.","title":"Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544133","551544","550244","543689","553449","549105","543458","551160","544380","544218","547867","546397","544187","545218","543214","548805"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","boy","delight","fun","swim","warmth","joy","year","mouth","board"]}
