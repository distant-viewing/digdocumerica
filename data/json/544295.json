{"path":"544295.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an older man standing in what appears to be a vibrant garden. He is prominently featured on the right side of the image, gazing thoughtfully at a cluster of flowers. The man has a slender build and wears casual attire: a blue long-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, a brimmed black cap, and brown shoes. He also carries a clear plastic bag in his left hand.\n\nThe garden is lush with various plant life, predominantly colored in green with vivid, orange-red flowers thriving amongst the foliage. These flowers add a bright dash of color and appear in both the foreground and background of the scene. One large red flower in the lower left corner stands out prominently, slightly out of focus.\n\nThe background is softly focused, suggesting an open outdoor space under a bright, mostly clear sky with few clouds. There is a glimpse of an urban environment in the distant background, evident from the glimpses of building-like structures.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the interaction between the man and the natural environment, highlighting themes of leisure, nature, and perhaps contemplation or solitude. This scene could suggest a moment of peaceful respite or personal connection with nature amidst a possibly urban setting.","title":"Park maintenance","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["557681","544236","551825","550059","544240","550760","554797","551626","551698","551745","551625","551705","549298","545091","551940","551490"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["flower","garden","respite","like","glimpse","plastic","thrive","slender","man","colore"]}
