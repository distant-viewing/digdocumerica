{"path":"556375.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image captures a group of coal miners exiting a mining facility. The setting includes a heavy industrial environment with metal structural frameworks, various industrial equipment, and machinery parts typical of a mine's infrastructure. Most prominently, a large metal hoisting mechanism with cables is visible in the background, suggesting the miners are leaving an underground shaft.\n\nThe miners are coated in grime and dirt, indicative of a long shift. They wear typical mining gear which includes safety helmets with headlamps, heavy-duty clothing, and protective boots. Some carry metallic lunch pails and a milk jug, while one miner in the foreground is holding a respirator, underscoring the harsh and potentially hazardous conditions they work under. There is visible comradery and tiredness in their demeanor as they make their way out of the mine.\n\nThe environment is dimly lit with an overcast sky, adding to the effect of a gritty, industrial setting. The ground is puddled and muddy, reflecting the often tough and dirty conditions faced by workers in such industries.","title":"Miners who have just returned to the surface of Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia and have been replaced by the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. Both of these are working shifts with the miners digging coal and bringing it out of the mine. A midnight to morning or \"hoot-owl\" shift is involved in cleanup operations to ready the mine for the next two digging shifts.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556377","556392","556340","556393","556338","556374","556337","556372","556376","556365","556348","556359","556373","556363","556366","556511"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["miner","mine","mining","milk","jug","grime","shaft","lunch","headlamp","exit"]}
