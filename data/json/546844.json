{"path":"546844.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or utility facility in a winter setting. In the foreground, there's a snowy field scattered with patches of grass and dirt, suggesting recent snowfall that hasn't completely covered the ground.\n\nThe central focus of the image features two large dome-shaped structures. These domes are beige and have several features on their surfaces, such as vents or small round protrusions, likely for environmental management or structural integrity. These domes appear functional and are typical of storage buildings for materials like salt or sand, or possibly for environmental processing like wastewater treatment.\n\nBehind the domes, there is a rectangular building, taller than the domes, with a similar beige exterior. This building has minimal external features but includes what appears to be vents or exhaust structures on the top, hinting it might house machinery or equipment related to the domes' function.\n\nThe background includes a line of leafless trees, indicating that the photo was taken in the winter months. These trees appear thin and sparse, providing a natural boundary for the facility. The sky over the scene is mostly clear with soft lighting, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. Together, these elements present a quietly active industrial or utility site set in a chilly, rural or semi-rural landscape.","title":"Part of the back river sewage treatment facility, the primary treatment plant for the Baltimore area","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["545273","546160","545998","546148","543764","542587","543872","546189","549726","548599","552544","544179","555328","543570","546064","546122"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["dome","vent","winter","beige","wastewater","utility","protrusion","snowfall","month","chilly"]}
