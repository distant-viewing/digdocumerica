{"path":"553105.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of rural livestock herding in an expansive, arid landscape. The foreground prominently features a large herd of cattle, predominantly brown and white in color, grazing or meandering on a field covered with sparse, dry vegetation. There are also a few donkeys interspersed among the cattle. In the background, two individuals on horseback can be seen managing the herd. They appear to be dressed in traditional or practical riding attire, possibly indicating their roles as cowboys or herders.\n\nThe geographical setting is characterized by its semi-arid conditions, with a rolling hill dominating the background. The hill is mostly barren, accentuated by a few sparse bushes and a rocky outcrop at its summit, which adds a rugged touch to the scenery. The sky above is vast and partly cloudy, suggesting an expansive, open environment typical of pastoral or ranching areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures the essence of pastoral life and livestock management in a dry, rural setting, emphasizing the interaction between humans and animals within a natural landscape.","title":"Spring roundup of paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake indian reservation.
