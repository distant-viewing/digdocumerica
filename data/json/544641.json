{"path":"544641.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage car parked outdoors in a rural setting. The car is a classic coupe, painted in a light color, possibly white or a light grey. Notably, the trunk of the car is open, suggesting either loading or unloading of items, or perhaps maintenance or inspection. The car appears to be in good condition based on the visible exterior.\n\nThe setting is an open field with scattered tall trees primarily in the background. The sky is vividly blue with puffy, white cumulus clouds indicating fair weather. The ground is composed of rough gravel with patches of grass, typical of an unpaved rural road or pull-off area. To the left of the car, there is some debris and trash suggesting the area is not well-maintained.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the juxtaposition of a well-maintained vintage vehicle against a natural and somewhat neglected rural backdrop under a broad, expansive sky. This setting invokes a sense of isolation or a pause during a journey.","title":"Abandoned autoMobile along u.s.  27","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["554920","553008","548750","546230","551021","552995","554879","550797","552800","550683","547141","545540","553010","553002","557670","550005"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","cumulus","coupe","maintain","unload","vintage","off","invoke","inspection","pause"]}
