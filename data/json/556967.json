{"path":"556967.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a picturesque, rural landscape. The foreground features a small community with rows of houses, organized in a grid-like pattern, surrounded by lush green vegetation. There are several streets that run parallel and perpendicular to each other, with houses that appear to have ample yards. \n\nIn the middle ground, the vegetation becomes denser with what appears to be a large forested area interspersed with some open land and smaller buildings or structures.\n\nThe background dominates the scene with a stunning view of a mountain range. The mountains are heavily forested at their bases and show rocky and possibly snowy peaks, suggesting they could be part of a significant mountain range. Below these mountains, there's a substantial body of water, likely a lake or wide river, visible between the forest and the base of the mountains. This adds a serene and majestic quality to the landscape.\n\nThe overall impression is of a quiet, rural community nestled in a vast natural setting, highlighted by dramatic mountainous backdrops and lush forests. This setting suggests a peaceful coexistence with nature and a slower pace of life, away from urban hustle and bustle.","title":"Aerial view of the central valley quadrangle which is bounded by tracyton, illahee, brownsville and silverdale.
