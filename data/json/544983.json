{"path":"544983.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor cooking event, likely a barbecue or community gathering. Two men in white shirts are prominently featured. The man in the foreground, wearing glasses and using red gloves, is actively involved in cooking. He is turning large pieces of meat, possibly pork chops or beef steaks, on a flat metal grill using a pair of tongs. The pieces of meat are browned, suggesting they have been cooking for some time.\n\nThe man in the background, also in a white shirt, appears to be wearing a white apron and smoking a pipe, observing or waiting for his turn to engage in the cooking process. The setting is outdoors under a bright blue sky, and there are trees and a partial view of a building in the background, reflecting a casual, daylight event.\n\nThe atmosphere seems focused yet relaxed, with both men concentrating on the task of preparing food. The use of disposable gloves and an apron suggests attention to cleanliness and the handling of food. The grill is placed on a simple, portable stand, indicating the temporary and outdoor nature of the setup.","title":"Salmon bake, fund-raising affair for community of Browns Point","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550085","557801","546127","557934","544974","544986","545017","557793","544979","549451","551275","550081","554686","551276","543987","557700"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["meat","cook","cooking","apron","grill","glove","food","turn","chop","cleanliness"]}
