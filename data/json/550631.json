{"path":"550631.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph portrays a breathtaking natural landscape dominated by a large, rugged mountain partially covered in snow. The mountain slopes are steep and richly green, suggesting lush vegetation. Numerous waterfalls cascade down these slopes, originating from the melting snow above, and add a dynamic element to the serene scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a large, sediment-laden river spreads across the landscape. Its silty, grayish-white waters create intricate patterns as they meander and branch into numerous channels. This is likely a glacial river, fed by runoff from the melting snow and ice higher up in the mountains. The riverbanks are uneven and covered with what appears to be a combination of sand and sparse vegetation.\n\nThe background is dominated by the massive mountain which looms large over the scene. Its peak touches the cloudy sky, indicating considerable elevation. The sides of the mountain near the peak have patches of snow clinging to the ledges and crevices, showing the transition between the lush green lower elevations and the colder, harsher upper elevations.\n\nOverall, the composition powerfully captures the wild, untouched nature of this pristine wilderness area, emphasizing the vast scale and raw beauty of the mountainous landscape. The photograph could be useful in studies or presentations related to geology, environmental science, or discussions on natural environments and their conservation.","title":"Glaciated peaks of the Chugach Range tower some 7,000 feet above the pipeline route as it moves through the coastal barrier.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550518","550513","555690","550500","550441","550507","550592","550415","550523","550511","550609","550512","555660","550630","550497","550413"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["snow","elevation","mountain","peak","slope","geology","laden","runoff","science","presentation"]}
