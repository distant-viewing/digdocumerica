{"path":"550436.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a wild, pale-colored wolf standing alone in a rugged, natural landscape. The wolf is centered in the image, looking directly towards the camera with a cautious, focused gaze. Its light fur contrasts with the surrounding environment.\n\nThe terrain is a blend of various shrubs and small plants, showcasing a beautiful array of colors, including deep greens, muted yellows, and splashes of red and burgundy, suggesting it might be taken during autumn. The ground appears rocky and uneven, indicative of a mountainous or forested wilderness area.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is wild and untouched, with the lone wolf adding a sense of solitude and resilience. The natural lighting and dense plant life suggest this location is remote, possibly protected wilderness or a national park. The photograph offers a close look at wildlife in its natural habitat, emphasizing the beauty and the harsh reality of nature.","title":"White female wolf in the Atigun Valley.
