{"path":"544656.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an old, dilapidated industrial building with faded and peeling paint. The structure consists of large rectangular segments made out of what appears to be corrugated metal, tinged with rust and decay. The building has several rows of windows, most of which are broken or missing panes, suggesting long-term abandonment.\n\nPainted in large, worn-out letters across the front of the building are the words \"FOR SALE BLOCK\" along with additional information including an address \"559-151st ST\" and a phone number \"442-8205\". Below the \"FOR SALE\" text, patches of rusty orange and faded red paint are visible, displaying the building's exposure to elements over time.\n\nIn front of the building is an expansive puddle, perhaps resulting from recent rain or poor drainage, reflecting the building’s upper portions and creating a mirror-like effect on the ground. The sky appears clear and the lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the texture and color contrasts of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and the setting sun emphasize the feeling of decay and the passage of time, highlighting the building’s forlorn and forgotten state. No human activity is visible in the image, reinforcing a sense of abandonment. The surrounding area is not detailed, but the focus remains intensely on the structure itself and its reflections on the water.","title":"On the shore of San Francisco Bay","placename":"Oakland (Calif.)","location":"Oakland, California","nn1":["547894","546871","557344","553548","552534","557348","543171","554707","551586","547985","547969","550023","543330","544719","543344","547038"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["building","paint","abandonment","forget","decay","corrugate","drainage","phone","address","tinge"]}
