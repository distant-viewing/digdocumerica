{"path":"550161.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a neatly structured park and parking area. On the top portion of the image, there's a linear arrangement of parked cars in a spacious parking lot. The cars are tightly spaced with visible variety in colors, including shades of blue, red, white, and grey.\n\nRight below the parking lot is a wide path of green grass, accompanied by dense trees. The green area serves as a boundary between the parking lot and the central feature of the photograph.\n\nThe main focal point is a circular park area, meticulously designed with radial walkways converging toward a central fountain. The fountain features a simple, modern design with a round basin and a singular jet of water in the middle, which appears still in the captured moment.\n\nAround the fountain, the footpaths are laid in concentric circles with well-maintained flowering beds and shrubs in shades of green, adding a vibrant touch to the grey concrete paths. A few people can be seen enjoying the serene environment near the fountainâ€”some sitting on the benches placed around it, absorbing the calm atmosphere.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in sunlight suggesting a bright, clear day which enhances the vividness of the greenery and the orderly arrangement of the environment. The layout and design of the park area evoke a sense of tranquility and structured beauty, characteristic of well-planned urban public spaces.","title":"Willard park, near lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547784","546609","557257","550298","550075","550752","550165","551772","550052","549516","551793","544485","557262","544808","547228","557282"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["fountain","parking","lot","arrangement","park","grey","path","desig","spaces","structured"]}
