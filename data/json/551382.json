{"path":"551382.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a road that snakes through a narrow, rocky passage. There are motorcyclists performing stunts, with the closest biker prominently elevating the front wheel of his motorcycle in a wheelie maneuver. He is dressed in a vest, helmet, and sunglasses, exuding a sense of adventure and rebellion typical of biker culture. His motorcycle is heavily customized, showcasing chrome parts and a vertical orientation typical of chopper bikes.\n\nBehind him, another motorcyclist and several vehicles follow, including what appears to be a truck and a couple of vintage cars from the mid-20th century, hinting that the photo might have been taken during that era. The road is bordered on one side by a steep cliff face, covered with vegetation, suggesting a mountainous or rugged terrain.\n\nThe sky above is tumultuous with heavy clouds, adding a dramatic effect to the overall atmosphere of the setting. This picture not only captures a moment of thrill and skill on part of the bikers but also conveys a narrative of freedom and excitement that is often associated with road trips and motorcycle culture. The natural landscape juxtaposed with the human activity underscores a classic theme of man versus nature.","title":"Motorcyclists approaching Bagnell Dam on Memorial Day weekend.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544840","544844","545150","545598","554874","548890","556206","558232","553955","553954","549316","551237","551383","548690","543730","544422"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["motorcycle","culture","thrill","road","orientation","skill","bike","freedom","excitement","trip"]}
