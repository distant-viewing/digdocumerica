{"path":"555091.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a tree farm, specifically a pine or fir tree nursery. The image is taken during the day under an overcast sky, providing a soft, diffused light that casts no harsh shadows. The focus of the image is on a relatively young, conical-shaped pine tree in the foreground, appearing vibrant against the muted background.\n\nBehind the foreground, rows upon rows of similar, uniformly spaced trees cover the land, extending toward the horizon. These trees are smaller and denser as the distance increases, which creates a textured pattern across the landscape. The ground is covered in a mix of grass and fallen pine needles, suggesting it's either late fall or winter. The color tone of the ground is a mix of browns and muted greens, which contrasts subtly with the dark green hues of the pine trees.\n\nIn the distance, the tree line meets a gloomy, grey sky, creating a distinct horizon that encircles the photo. This backdrop adds a sense of depth and immensity to the scene, highlighting the extensive cultivation and scale of the tree farm. The overall mood of the image is serene and somewhat solitary, focusing on the cultivation and growth of these young trees in a quiet, rural setting.","title":"Dennie ahl seed orchard started in 1956.
