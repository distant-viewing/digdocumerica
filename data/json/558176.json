{"path":"558176.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an individual wearing medical scrubs, a matching cap, and a protective apron. The person is smiling broadly and holding a piglet, with the piglet's back feet in one hand and the snout being gripped by the mouth with the other hand, simulating a kiss. The piglet's body is slumped and appears relaxed or possibly sedated. \n\nThe background of the photo is a clinical environment, hinted at by the partial views of a desk and what appears to be medical equipment or supplies in the left background. The walls of the room are tiled in light tiles, suggesting a sterile or washable setup, which is characteristic of medical or veterinary settings. The lighting in the image is moderate, creating a clear view of the scene with some reflection visible on the shiny surfaces of the tiles. The image emits a sense of humor or light-hearted interaction between the man and the piglet within a professional or clinical context.","title":"Dr. Milton Kaiser, an associate of Dr. Howard Vogel and Dr. Ann Vogel, holds a newborn baby soon after its Caesarean delivery in Union Hospital in New Ulm, Minnesota. Since that time all births have been performed at Loretto Hospital. The town's two medical facilities divided their services to specialize and give more efficient service. The Vogels are descendants of the town's pioneer families. New Ulm was founded in 1854 by a group of German immigrants.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["557938","552663","556605","558171","553585","558167","552632","558172","558175","558173","556608","546954","553481","555531","558168","556556"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["tile","scrub","apron","desk","supply","foot","mouth","hand","room","setup"]}
