{"path":"542980.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of an old fishing boat named \"RENAY,\" docked in a harbor. The boat has a distinctive rusted yellow and white paint job on its bow, with the name \"RENAY\" clearly visible in black lettering against the yellow background. The hull shows signs of wear and neglect, including rust and discolored patches, indicating the boat has been exposed to the elements for an extended period.\n\nThe boat is tied to a dock with a thick, frayed rope that appears well-used, connecting to a large wooden piling partially visible on the left side of the frame. The water around the boat is dark and reflects the boat's bow and the dock's structure, adding a mirror-like quality to the lower section of the image.\n\nThe background reveals parts of other boats and maritime equipment, suggesting the setting is a busy working harbor. The sky is not visible, focusing the viewer's attention on the maritime details and the textures of the worn boat and water. The overall composition and lighting emphasize the aged and rugged character of the fishing boat and its environment, evoking a sense of maritime history and the tough conditions associated with fishing life.","title":"These fishing boats have produced the oil slick on which they ride","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542873","546939","543247","547961","549365","542911","544181","548689","548535","547965","547594","542905","542906","546040","544186","545061"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","dock","harbor","bow","name","piling","job","history","lettering"]}
