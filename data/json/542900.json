{"path":"542900.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant street scene likely from the mid-20th century, judging from the style of the cars and architecture. The image captures a line of low-rise buildings, each painted in different bright colors such as yellow, red, and beige. The facades of the buildings are adorned with various signage advertising local businesses, including a jewelry store, a clothes store named \"Clothes Rack,\" a business called \"Franklin,\" and several other indistinct signs.\n\nThe street is broad and appears relatively quiet with only a few cars parked along the curb. The cars are styled in typical mid-20th-century American designs, suggesting the photo was taken during that era. The road surface and sidewalks look clean and well-maintained.\n\nThe sky is strikingly blue, indicating that it was a clear, sunny day. There are no trees or much greenery visible in the scene, focusing attention on the urban setting and commercial establishments. A single street lamp is visible on the left edge of the image, hinting at the utilitarian aspects of the area.\n\nThe absence of people in the photograph lends a calm, possibly early-morning atmosphere to the street, allowing the viewer to focus more on the architectural and vehicular details. The overall composition conveys a sense of peaceful daily life in a mid-century American town.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["546428","545333","545216","551125","557155","552602","556225","545614","557805","556709","551135","557655","546427","546440","556224","542586"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","street","business","jewelry","car","call","century","stroot","curb","advertise"]}
