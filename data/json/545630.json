{"path":"545630.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a hand holding what appears to be a clump of oil-tarred sand or some similar petroleum-based material. The hand is covered in a dark, slick substance that extends partially up the arm, showing significant dirt and messiness. The texture of the material is rough, clotted, and thick, suggesting it might have a sticky or slimy consistency.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears slightly blurred, a characteristic common in macro photography which indicates the focus is distinctly on the object in the foreground. The background seems to be outdoors, possibly near an industrial or beach setting given the sandy quality of the material in hand and a vague hint of what might be barriers or equipment in a blurred, abstract form.\n\nOverall, the composition centers the viewerâ€™s attention on the interaction of the human element (the hand) with environmental or industrial impact, suggested by the substance being handled. This context might hint at themes like pollution, environmental work, or industrial operations, especially if connected to petroleum products or their repercussions on natural settings.","title":"In October 1972, a pipeline of the Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Company burst, releasing 285,000 gallons of crude oil into the San Juan River near Shiprock, New Mexico. The oil flowed some 200 miles downstream before being contained behind a log boom west of Piute Farms, in Monument Valley, Utah. An EPA official holds up a sample of oil-drenched mud at the boom site.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["546890","545644","546920","547545","543695","543811","548205","555867","545487","555855","545634","544390","544580","553848","544751","553582"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["substance","hand","material","clump","photography","product","oil","barrier","sand","arm"]}
