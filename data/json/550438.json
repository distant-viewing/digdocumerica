{"path":"550438.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph portrays a vivid and atmospheric mountainous landscape. It features a striking scene where a rainbow subtly emerges from the mist, gracing the middle foreground against a steep mountain slope. The slopes are barren, largely devoid of vegetation, suggesting a high altitude or harsh environments.\n\nThe mountains, captured in layers, exhibit deep, rugged ridges emphasizing their geological features. The foreground mountain is sharply captured with visible rock formations and a gradient of shadows suggesting angled sunlight, possibly during late afternoon hours or early morning. Beyond this, another mountain rises, darker and more shadowed, enhancing the depth and three-dimensional perception of the scene.\n\nThe sky overhead is subdued and appears overcast, with the rainbow providing a contrasting burst of color against the predominantly dark grey and brown tones of the mountains. The rainbow itself is quite defined, showing a spectrum from red to violet, lending a sense of hope or serenity to an otherwise stark landscape.\n\nThe overall framing and composition of the photograph direct the viewer's attention from the rugged terrain in the foreground to the ethereal beauty of the rainbow and then further into the depths of the mountain range in the background, creating a layered perspective on natural grandeur and the fleeting moments often presented by nature.","title":"A rainbow seems rooted in a rock wall that forms the north side of the Atigun Gorge, 5 miles east of the point where the pipeline will cross the Atigun River.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543124","543123","543128","550516","543023","543130","550415","544070","555378","544836","552173","550592","550497","554634","546764","554398"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["rainbow","mountain","slope","spectrum","violet","burst","overhead","serenity","framing","depth"]}
