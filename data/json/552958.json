{"path":"552958.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Heyman, Ken","caption":"This photograph features a group of four children standing in a narrow outdoor passageway alongside a blue wooden building. \n\nFrom left to right, the first child is a girl wearing a pink and beige patterned blouse paired with dark pants. She holds what appears to be a small toy or object in her hands and is looking away towards her left with a smile. Next to her, partially obscured by shadow, is a boy looking directly at the camera, wearing a yellow shirt. \n\nThe third child, also a boy, positioned slightly ahead of the others, is wearing a multi-colored striped shirt in yellow, red, blue, and white, as well as olive green pants. He is smiling broadly and covering his mouth with his hand as if slightly shy or giggling. The fourth child, farthest right and only partially visible, seems to be also dressed in a casual shirt and pants, standing closely to the wall.\n\nThe wooden wall of the building dominates the right side of the image, painted in a faded, peeling light blue with visible brush strokes and wear, suggesting a rustic setting. A narrow wooden plank serves as the flooring of the passageway, with its gray weathered appearance complementing the aged texture of the wall. \n\nIn the background, a soft light bulb illuminates the passageway dimly, casting gentle shadows and providing a warm ambient light, highlighting the informal and cozy atmosphere of the scene. The structure of the building and passageway indicates a residential area, possibly in a rural or semi-urban setting. The children's relaxed manners and comfortable interaction suggest a familiar environment, likely close to their home quarters.","title":"Martin-pena area of puerto Rico.
