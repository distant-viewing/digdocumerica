He is focused intently on his work, using a compass to draw precise circles or arcs on a piece of paper. The student has dark hair and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved button-down shirt.\n\nHe is leaning over his work, which rests on a light-colored tabletop, indicating a detail-oriented task. His hands are actively manipulating the compass, one hand adjusting the position while the other steadies the tool's pivot point.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred, but other students can be observed, suggesting that this activity takes place in a room with multiple pupils, likely a school or educational workshop environment. The overall lighting is soft and even, contributing to the focus on the student and his drafting task, with no harsh shadows or overly bright highlights.","title":"Students working intently in a drafting class at senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
