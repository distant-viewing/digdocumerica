{"path":"550209.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of four individuals navigating a cluttered stream or small river. It appears to be an outdoor setting with an emphasis on activity and natural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, one man, with his head bowed and hands clutched together, is cautiously balancing on a fallen log. Behind him, another individual is seen crouched, seemingly engaged in an activity or examining something in the water. Towards the center and right of the image, two other men stand in the water; one is gazing towards the fallen debris upstream, while the other has his back turned to the viewer.\n\nThe stream is strewn with numerous logs and branches crisscrossing the flowing water, suggesting recent overflow or a lack of maintenance. The presence of vigorous water flow and foamy edges around the logs indicate strong currents or swift movement of the water.\n\nIn the background, there's a bridge that spans over the stream, partially shaded by trees nearby. Rocks and foliage line the shores, further enhancing the rugged, natural environment captured here.\n\nThe lighting seems to be natural, likely midday, as evidenced by the clear visibility and shadows cast under the open sky. The composition of the image, with its diverse elements of water, wood, and human activity, creates a dynamic yet slightly chaotic scene reflecting an interaction with nature.","title":"Members of Columbia game club clean up Rocky River dam at sprague and Columbia roads, in Columbia township","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551538","553413","550213","551414","553414","546803","545531","546922","546880","551423","550222","554467","550980","551499","543692","550663"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["stream","log","fall","water","clutch","flow","overflow","crouch","bow","current"]}
