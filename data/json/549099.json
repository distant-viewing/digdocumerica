{"path":"549099.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a nocturnal scene by the water, likely a lake or a calm sea, where the focus is on a series of buildings and docks at the waterfront. These structures are illuminated, casting reflections on the water that create a shimmering pathway of light leading towards them. The buildings appear modern, with large windows and flat roofs, characteristic of contemporary architecture. Some smaller boats are moored by the docks next to the buildings.\n\nThe background features a range of rugged mountains which, under the night sky, provide a dark, almost silhouetted contrast to the brightly lit foreground activities. The overall mood of the scene is serene and picturesque, with the water's surface smooth and the lights providing a focal point and adding vibrancy to the image. The time of day and lighting suggest it might be late evening or night, creating a peaceful and somewhat solitary ambiance.","title":"Light reflections from homes on the Colorado River.
