He is dressed in a red long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, appearing focused on his task as he tends to the plants. The garden is lush with a variety of green plants and vegetables, flourishing in wooden planters that are prominently scattered throughout the space.\n\nThe rooftop itself is wooden, equipped with simple outdoor furniture such as a wooden bench, suggesting it's a space used not just for gardening but also for relaxation and enjoyment. The overall atmosphere is calm and green, contrasting with the urban backdrop.\n\nIn the background, a cityscape stretches out, characterized by various mid-rise and high-rise buildings, which indicate this setting is in an urban environment. Despite the cloudy sky, sufficient natural light illuminates the entire scene, enhancing the vibrant green colors of the garden. The juxtaposition of a natural, serene gardening space against an urban skyline highlights a blend of nature and city life within this image.","title":"Cherries, carrots, strawberries and roses are only some of the plants that flourish twenty floors up in Stuart Mott's penthouse garden.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551625","551628","551626","551755","550764","550059","550055","551620","555522","551623","555523","551630","551743","551777","549298","551705"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["gardening","rooftop","garden","flourish","space","vegetable","planter","tend","rise","furniture"]}
