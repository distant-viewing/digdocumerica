{"path":"542829.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a devastated forest area, presumably after a logging operation. The central focus of the image is a muddy path or trail, deeply rutted and surrounded by scattered debris. This pathway winds slightly as it moves through the frame from the foreground to the background.\n\nThe ground around the path is covered with bits of broken tree branches, stumps, and other remnants of forestry activity, giving the scene a chaotic, littered appearance. Patches of snow scattered unevenly across the area indicate the image was taken in a season where some snowfall is present but not predominant, possibly late winter or early spring.\n\nIn the backdrop, there's a dense, dark forest standing in stark contrast to the cleared area. This dark line of trees emphasizes the extent of the clearing in the foreground. The overall impression is one of environmental impact, highlighting the stark, raw aftermath of industrial logging operations. The scene is devoid of people or animals, focusing solely on the landscape and the effects of the activities performed there.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542850","555092","546060","555208","553468","555162","555221","555136","555148","545138","555230","555198","545272","542827","542949","550354"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["path","snowfall","extent","operation","stump","forestry","logging","forest","aftermath","perform"]}
