{"path":"547215.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a water dam engaged in a heavy release of water. The concrete structure of the dam, positioned at the center of the image, features a series of open gates from which muddy water flows forcefully, creating a turbulent white foam as it exits. The contrast between the calm, sediment-rich brown water on one side and the agitated, foamy white water on the other side is stark, illustrating the function of the dam in regulating water flow.\n\nThe dam itself is a large, somewhat weathered grey concrete facility with rectangular sections. Behind the dam, the water is relatively tranquil and covers a vast area, hinting at a significant reservoir. In the foreground, large accumulations of debris, including branches and logs, are visible in the water, indicating recent heavy inflows that have likely carried this material from upstream areas.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a road running parallel to the dam on one side, while the other sides are bordered by natural landscapes, possibly embankments or levees. There appears to be a small red vehicle parked near the top edge of the dam, providing a scale reference and suggesting ongoing monitoring or maintenance activity. \n\nOverall, the scene captures the powerful interaction between human-engineered structures and natural water dynamics, particularly during periods of heavy water flow.","title":"Little Falls filtration plant","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550743","543978","550654","553372","553654","553137","551580","548003","549497","548309","548016","548024","557247","552928","550701","543983"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","water","flow","reference","reservoir","embankment","gate","monitoring","dynamic","side"]}
