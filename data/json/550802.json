{"path":"550802.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"In this photograph, a young fawn stands on a gravel pathway set against a lush, forested background. The fawn has a reddish-brown coat dotted with white spots, typical of young deer, which help to camouflage them in their natural habitat. Its ears are upright and alert, and its body is turned slightly towards its left, giving the impression that it has paused mid-step to look back or listen to something in the distance.\n\nThe environment surrounding the fawn features dense greenery, including various shrubs, tall grasses, and a multitude of trees. The trees and plants are in full leaf, suggesting that the season is either late spring or summer. The foreground shows some grass and smaller plants along the pathway, adding texture to the scene. The natural light appears to be soft, possibly filtered through clouds or the canopy above, contributing to the serene and slightly mysterious atmosphere of the setting. This image captures a tranquil moment in nature, highlighting the delicate beauty of a young deer in its woodland home.","title":"Deer about to feed alongside Highway 107, south of TOmahawk.
