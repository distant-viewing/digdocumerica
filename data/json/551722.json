{"path":"551722.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque urban scene, likely in a historical neighborhood. Visible are three older multi-story buildings, closely situated next to each other, along a narrow street.\n\nThe building in the foreground is painted white and covered in ivy, which adds a touch of lush green to its facade. It features numerous windows with dark green shutters. A prominent fire escape, crafted of black metal, snakes down the front of the building, adding an intricate pattern against the white walls. The roof is accented with lush plants, adding a further natural element to the scene.\n\nTo the right, there are two adjacent buildings, one painted in red and the other in a darker, brownish hue. Both buildings also have external fire escapes, typical of older urban buildings, suggesting a setting that values both aesthetic and practical elements.\n\nThe street is paved and appears clean, bending slightly out of view and inviting curiosity about what lies beyond. The sky is a vivid blue, indicating a clear, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of old-world charm, architectural heritage, and the integration of nature within an urban environment, suggesting a neighborhood with history and character.","title":"Wisteria adds charm to house on Waverly Place, a quiet street just off Washington Square in lower Manhattan's famous Greenwich Village.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550107","543360","545356","558030","550035","550031","557140","551629","555902","556167","552968","551685","550115","555912","555920","546745"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["fire","neighborhood","building","escape","heritage","integration","shutter","snake","street","history"]}
