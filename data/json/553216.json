{"path":"553216.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph shows a young man in the process of watering plants with a hose. Dominating the central foreground, his back is toward the viewer. He is wearing a basic white T-shirt that fit loosely, and dark, slim-fit jeans. There is a distinct shadow of a tree on his shirt, indicating either sunset or a generally low light setting. His posture is slightly bent forward as he holds the hose, which is ejecting a strong stream of water onto green shrubbery below. He appears casual yet focused in his task.\n\nIn his right back pocket, there is a noticeable outline of a wallet, suggesting a busy, utilitarian lifestyle. An intimately close look reveals something that appears similar to a camera strap slung diagonally across his back; although this is partially blurry, it hints at additional tasks or hobbies.\n\nThe background features more foliage and part of what seems to be a blurred figure of another person, possibly indicating that he is not alone in his activity. Red flowers in the foreground add a small splash of color to an overall verdant scene. This photograph captures an everyday moment, yet portrays it with a sense of solitude and tranquility amidst what looks to be a lush, garden setting.","title":"Watering the shrubbery at noon in Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551490","544295","544240","551704","546286","557681","544236","551625","551491","549298","543781","551626","551630","548311","550760","551628"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["hose","back","hobby","task","strap","pocket","lifestyle","shrubbery","splash","garden"]}
