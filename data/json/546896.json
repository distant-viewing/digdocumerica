{"path":"546896.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene centered around a water body, presumably a creek or a small river. The image has a vertical orientation and focuses on the creek that meanders gently through the frame. The foreground features the partially frozen and muddy edges of the water, notable for its patchy surface that blends icy sections with muddy water. Areas of thin ice are scattered throughout, and frothy, light-colored organic material—possibly foam or algae—is visible, adding texture and highlighting environmental detail.\n\nThe creek reflects the trees and sky above, creating a peaceful, almost mirror-like effect in the calmer sections of the water. The reflections are slightly distorted by ripples on the water's surface. Further enhancing the scene, the water carries a gentle gradient of coloring, from darker at the edges to a luminescent glow in the center, probably influenced by the lighting conditions, possibly near dawn or dusk.\n\nThe background of the image reveals more of the creek's environment: a narrower channel bordered by natural wooded banks. The banks are cluttered with leafless shrubs and branches, some of which have fallen and partially submerged into the creek, suggestive of a late autumn or early spring season. The overall lighting is subdued, casting a soft illumination over the scene and emphasizing the tranquility and the slightly melancholic mood of a natural, untouched landscape.\n\nIn the far distance, a simple wooden structure, possibly a bridge, crosses the creek. This man-made element is subtle and blends well with the surroundings, indicating minimal human interference in this natural setting.\n\nThe photograph, rich in natural textures and a soothing color palette mainly consisting of earth tones, blues, and subtle greys, evokes a sense of calm and reflects an untouched, serene water ecosystem during a colder season.","title":"Oil soaked scum at stony run, the result of a delivery accident in which 4000 gallons were spilled","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546126","542526","547526","555211","545473","545923","551351","554775","553434","546963","554776","547487","550845","550341","554623","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["creek","water","season","melancholic","interference","calmer","distort","orientation","peaceful","coloring"]}
