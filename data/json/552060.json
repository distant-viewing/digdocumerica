{"path":"552060.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of dry, cracked earth, likely a result of drought or extensive dry weather. The foreground shows the ground covered in deep, wide cracks that create a jagged, rough texture. Scattered throughout the surface are remnants of dead plant stalks and roots, protruding in clusters and appearing brittle and dark against the pale, parched soil.\n\nIn addition to the dry ground, there are patches of greenery in the midground and background, suggesting that some vegetation still manages to survive despite the dry conditions. These plants are small, with some green leaves and stems visible, contrasting with the otherwise barren and desolate soil. The overall composition evokes a sense of aridity and environmental stress, yet also hints at resilience in nature amidst harsh conditions.","title":"Trees and brush uncovered by the receding waters of the Kansas River in the area of the 12th Street Bridge sewer outlet.
