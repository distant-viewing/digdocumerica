{"path":"548995.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people gathered on a pebbly beach beside a body of water, which could be a lake or a sea, with a range of mountains in the background under a clear blue sky. The setting appears to be in a remote or natural area due to the presence of mountains and lack of buildings or other man-made structures visible.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a man dressed in a white robe with red trim stands apart from the group, facing them. He might be leading the group in a ritual or ceremony. The rest of the group, comprised of several men and women, are turned towards the man in the white robe, attentively listening or participating. The people are dressed in a mix of formal and semi-formal attire, predominantly white shirts and contrasting darker pants or skirts. Some women are wearing headscarves.\n\nThe expressions and postures of the people suggest a serious engagement, possibly a religious or cultural ceremony. One man on the left appears to be singing or chanting. The overall atmosphere is solemn and communal.\n\nThe sun's position casts long shadows of the group onto the ground, emphasizing the time of day as either morning or late afternoon. This lighting adds a dramatic effect to the scene.\n\nOverall, this image is evocative of cultural or religious significance, possibly capturing a ritual or a communal gathering in a scenic outdoor setting.","title":"Baptism ceremony performed by members of North Las Vegas \"Church of God in Christ.\"","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["548988","548990","548992","542563","552286","543892","543234","544093","553758","547009","554672","554666","543998","543203","546026","556526"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["ceremony","robe","group","man","singe","headscarf","people","mountain","participate","listen"]}
