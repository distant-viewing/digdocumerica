{"path":"549574.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image depicts a vibrant and colorful scene from a parade or festival, featuring an ornately decorated horse-drawn carriage. Atop the carriage is a person dressed in a flamboyant and glittery pink costume, complete with a large bow and ruffled skirt. This person is seated on a small pedestal, striking a pose by waving their hand gracefully. Below this individual, a man dressed in a matching red and black uniform sits confidently, handling the reins of the horse.\n\nThe carriage itself is richly adorned with red and gold patterns, embellishments, and figurines, adding to its eye-catching appearance. Two dark horses, wearing ornate harnesses with golden accents and plumes, pull the carriage. In the background, the partially visible signs and the architecture suggest an urban setting, likely a city street lined with buildings.\n\nThe scene captures a festive atmosphere, likely part of a parade with spectators watching from the sides, although they are mostly out of the direct frame of the photo. The image encapsulates a moment of celebration, performance, and traditional parade elegance.","title":"Elaborately decorated old circus wagon, resplendent in new gilt, is part of the annual \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual circus parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549576","549566","557712","549583","553715","557716","552651","557058","549667","551717","553717","553716","546991","557050","552660","549581"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["carriage","parade","horse","ruffle","rein","matching","embellishment","pedestal","costume","harness"]}
