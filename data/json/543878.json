{"path":"543878.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The image depicts a busy roadside scene likely taken in the United States during the mid-to-late 20th century. The foreground shows a highway with several road signs, including a prominent green one that reads \"Nashville\" with an arrow pointing left, indicating the direction to Nashville on Interstate 24 West. Below this are smaller signs providing additional traffic instructions. Conspicuously displayed on the road is a classic Chevrolet truck driven by a person, showcasing the style of vehicles from that era.\n\nIn the background, there are numerous advertisements, primarily for fireworks, which dominate the scene with bold red and white signs offering \"LOWEST PRICES\" and claiming to be the \"BEST STOP\". These advertisements appear to be attached to and around a building labeled \"GIFT SHOP\", hinting that this location functions as a typical roadside stop that sells souvenirs and fireworks.\n\nThe overall ambience is cluttered and commercial, typical of roadside strips near highways meant to attract travelers. The setting is presumably rural or semi-rural given the visible landscape and the style of the signage. This image captures a vivid picture of mid-20th-century American road culture, highlighting elements of automotive travel, advertising strategies, and consumerism.","title":"Visual pollution along Interstate 24","placename":"South Pittsburg (Tenn.)","location":"South Pittsburg, Tennessee","nn1":["543874","553017","549224","549113","545618","555438","546184","554709","549014","555584","549008","550093","543887","550135","547021","548889"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["roadside","stop","advertisement","highway","road","instruction","pointing","arrow","traveler","sign"]}
