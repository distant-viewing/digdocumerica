{"path":"547492.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a beach scene at twilight or dusk, characterized by a muted, soft light bathing the landscape. The foreground of the image is filled with a sandy beach strewn with numerous rocks and pebbles of varying sizes and colors. The texture of the sand appears rough, mixed with gravel and small shell fragments, indicating a less trodden or rugged part of the beach.\n\nIn the middle ground, the beach continues but becomes interspersed with patches of green beach vegetation, that adds a small splash of color contrasted against the dominant earthy tones. This vegetation is sparse, suggesting harsh conditions for plant life, typical of many coastal environments.\n\nLooking deeper into the scene, towards the background, thereâ€™s a hint of a grass-covered dune that forms a barrier between the beach and the inland areas. In the far distance, there are silhouettes of hills or a headland fading into the hazy, dim sky, which suggests the beach might be part of a larger, secluded bay.\n\nThe sky above is overcast with gradations of pinkish-blue hues reflecting the low light conditions of either early morning or late evening. The overall mood of the image is serene and somewhat desolate, capturing the quiet beauty of a natural coastal setting. The photograph invites contemplation of the rugged textures and tranquil mood of this beachscape.","title":"Rocky beach of Rhode Island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547496","543091","542890","547483","557509","551554","543081","544985","547608","543244","550458","548221","543078","543142","547607","543054"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","gradation","dune","shell","pebble","fragment","bay","gravel","condition","strew"]}
