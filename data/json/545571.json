{"path":"545571.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a striking natural landscape featuring a large rock formation with intensely textured, wave-like patterns. The rock surface is predominantly gray with white lines that run in sweeping, curved patterns, mimicking the movement of turbulent water. The composition of the photo emphasizes the dramatic curvature and texture of the rock formation, which dominates the frame.\n\nAtop the rock formation, there is a lone individual positioned near the summit. This person is captured in a walking posture, wearing a red jacket, dark pants, and a backpack, suggesting they are engaged in outdoor hiking or exploring activities. Their presence provides a sense of scale and emphasizes the grandeur of the natural environment around them.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, expansive and uninterrupted, which contrasts sharply with the intricate details and darker tones of the rock. This provides a clean, minimalist backdrop that focuses the viewer's attention on the texture of the rock and the human element exploring it. The overall feel of the image is one of isolation, adventure, and the awe-inspiring power of natural geological processes.","title":"Crossbedded sandstone of Catler Formation.
