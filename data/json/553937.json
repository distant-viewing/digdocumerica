{"path":"553937.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a sprawling suburban area. The photo shows a diversity of residential and commercial structures with various roof colors primarily in shades of red, brown, and white. The layout of the area includes numerous streets that weave through the neighborhoods, creating a grid-like pattern in some areas and more irregular patterns in others. \n\nIn the foreground, the homes appear to be mostly single-story with neatly arranged yards, some of which have large green lawns. As the view extends toward the background, the density of buildings increases and the terrain rises into hilly areas, where homes are built closer together and appear to be nestled among the hills. These elevated areas display greener surroundings and more tree coverage.\n\nThere are also a few larger buildings in the photograph, likely commercial setups or public facilities, distinguished by their larger footprints and different architectural styles. The infrastructure is supported by visible roads that connect the various parts of the neighborhood, providing access and mobility. The overall setting suggests a well-developed suburban community.","title":"Pearl City, on the west side of Honolulu, is the fastest growing area in all of Hawaii. The state administration would like Oahu residents to consider moving to the neighboring islands, but meanwhile the Land Use Commission rezoned this land, adjoining an older development, as appropriate for urban designation.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["547435","549071","546399","553699","553934","558057","553939","553700","558112","551198","553940","544604","548824","547769","545914","548825"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["neighborhood","home","mobility","footprint","coverage","pattern","diversity","density","grid","yard"]}
