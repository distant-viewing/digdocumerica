{"path":"547909.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene. The main focus is a small, narrow stream of water that meanders through the beach, leading into a larger body of water. There are several areas in the stream that appear to be slightly pooled, reflecting a bright blue sky. The banks of the stream are lined with dark, wet sand and patches of vegetation, including tall grass and scattered small shrubs. \n\nAt the water’s edge to the right, a large clump of dense, long grass forms a distinctive feature. This clump is positioned almost centrally in the image, partially jutting into the water flow, creating a natural separation between two streams or parts of the beach meeting the larger water body.\n\nThe water in the background shines under strong sunlight, indicating it could be a sunny day. The background across the water shows a partially visible, low-lying landform—possibly a hill or a continuation of the beach landscape that adds depth to the scenery. \n\nOverall, the composition draws the viewer's eye along the flow of the stream towards the expansive view of the water and beyond, emphasizing the tranquility and the natural beauty of the coastal environment.","title":"Clear water flows from spermacetti cove nature center at Sandy Hook into bay.
