{"path":"552468.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features an unusual and eclectic collection of mailboxes and other objects arrayed on the side of a rural road. Several traditional metal and wooden mailboxes of various shapes and sizes are mounted on poles, with additional items seemingly repurposed as mail receptacles, including a microwave and a gas can. Some mailboxes bear handwritten labels with names and advertisements, presenting a personalized, if unconventional, community communication center.\n\nOne of the more curious features is a large object resembling a rocket or missile, placed vertically next to the mailboxes, adding to the quirky nature of this roadside display. Above the mailboxes, an array extends horizontally, holding even more varied items, such as a lantern, a license plate, and a small metal box, potentially another unconventional mailbox. The names and numbers on some mailboxes suggest functionality alongside their decorative appeal.\n\nIn the background, the scene is typically pastoral with vast open fields suggesting agricultural use, a clear sky with few clouds, and farm buildings visible in the distance, reflecting a rural American setting. A well-maintained lawn area and a paved road run parallel to the mailbox ensemble, indicating some level of care and regular human activity. This scene captures a distinctive slice of rural life, highlighting creativity and community spirit in everyday rural setups.","title":"Eccentric mailbox display","placename":"Cooksville (Ill.)","location":"Cooksville, Illinois","nn1":["549006","547290","554132","557759","557760","549005","557566","547296","556984","542702","557950","557756","557567","549196","553417","556370"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["mailbox","personalize","array","name","repurpose","lantern","ensemble","creativity","shapes","spirit"]}
