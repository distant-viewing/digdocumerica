{"path":"554295.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a crushed and mangled car in a state of severe destruction. The vehicle is no longer recognizable as a functional machine but rather a compacted mass of twisted metal and components. \n\nThe front section of the car is somewhat discernible; you can see remnants of what were once the headlights, now shattered and pushed into a chaotically folded metal frame. The car's hood is crumpled beyond recognition, folded onto itself with various metal parts protruding in different directions.\n\nAmid the wreckage, you can observe parts of the engine or perhaps the inner workings of the car's front, heavily compressed and exposed among the torn metal sheets. The color of the wreckage is predominantly dark with shades of gray, hinting at the metal's exposure to high forces and possibly temperatures.\n\nIn the background, there is more distorted and darkened metal, suggesting that this photo might have been taken at a scrapyard or after an intense vehicular accident. This backdrop contributes to the harsh and grim ambiance of the scene.\n\nNo human figures or other objects are visible in this image; the focus is entirely on the twisted remains of the vehicle. The composition emphasizes the chaotic and violent transformation of the car from a structured, functional entity to a mere shell of twisted metal.","title":"Flattened cars are ready for recycling.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554303","554302","554355","554305","554321","550020","554311","547476","553863","549107","552083","547484","552738","551517","544472","554536"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["metal","wreckage","car","fold","mangle","entity","shatter","accident","working","transformation"]}
