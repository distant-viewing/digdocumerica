{"path":"543507.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a scenic alpine landscape dominated by a large snow-covered slope on the left side, which descends steeply into the foreground. Traces of skier activity are visible on the snow slope, marked by numerous parallel lines indicating the tracks left by skiers. In the middle distance, the topography transitions into a series of rugged, pointed mountain peaks that rise sharply against the sky, suggesting a range of jagged, snow-capped mountains. The background showcases a cloudy sky, hinting at possible variable weather conditions typical in mountainous regions. The composition of the photo, which combines the element of the expansive snowfield in the foreground with the dramatic peaks in the background, gives a strong sense of the remote and challenging nature of high mountain environments.","title":"California -- mammoth mt","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["550408","542520","550501","550504","542519","550514","554253","550503","554249","550515","550645","550422","550419","550502","550628","543831"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","slope","alpine","skier","descend","peanks","trace","jag","transitions"]}
