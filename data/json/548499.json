{"path":"548499.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, nautical scene featuring two individuals fishing from a medium-sized, white motorboat on a large body of water. The boat, which harbors the registration \"MD 9831 DD,\" is oriented toward the right side of the frame, with the front of the boat angled slightly toward the camera. It has a cabin with windows, and itâ€™s equipped with several fishing rod holders on its roof alongside a radar or sonar dome.\n\nOn the back end of the boat, two people, a man and a woman, are enjoying fishing. The man wears a dark shirt while the woman is dressed in an orange sleeveless top. Both appear engaged in handling the fishing rods, looking into the water right beside the boat, possibly watching their lines or adjusting them.\n\nThe background reveals a very calm sea with barely any waves, suggesting good weather for fishing. Off into the distance, several other boats can be seen, including one with sails that is much further away.\n\nOverall, the scene is peaceful and recreational, depicting a moment of leisure and relaxation on the water.","title":"Fishermen find bass, flounder, shad and rock fish in Chesapeake Bay.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548735","552317","548160","552313","543222","552324","545178","546972","553081","552282","550851","547549","552123","552326","546001","548738"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","rod","holder","sleeveless","registration","motorboat","dome","harbor","orient"]}
