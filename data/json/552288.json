{"path":"552288.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a young man in an outdoor setting, standing on a muddy, watery surface near the water's edge. He has curly brown hair and is wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and brown boots. A red backpack hangs off one shoulder, adding a pop of color to his attire.\n\nHe is intently examining something in a black container resembling a bowl or pot, which he holds close to his face with his left hand. His right hand appears to be adjusting or touching his nose, suggesting he might be reacting to the smell or contents of the container.\n\nSurrounding him are several open oyster shells spread out on the ground along with a green bucket located near his feet, which may contain additional shells or related items. A small shovel lies next to the bucket, implying recent digging or shellfish collection.\n\nThe background features a large body of water with a visible coastline stretching across the horizon. Overcast skies and a tranquil setting give the scene a calm yet moody atmosphere, typical of coastal regions. There are two distant figures in the middle left of the frame, presumably also engaging in activities near the water.","title":"Jim poth of Seattle shucks and eats oysters on the public tidelands of the hood canal at brinnon, on the east coast of the olympic Peninsula.
