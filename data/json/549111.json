{"path":"549111.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an interesting display of blurred lights and colors, creating an abstract visual effect. The blur appears to move in a whirl or spiral pattern, with dominant red and white lights that are either oval-shaped or elongated. The long exposure likely captured movement through these illuminated areas, suggesting a motion blur technique was employed during the shot.\n\nThe setting or objects in the image are hard to identify precisely due to the significant amount of motion blur, but from whatâ€™s discernible, the environment might be an interior space, perhaps part of a public venue or transportation hub given the bright, artificial lighting and the semblance of structural elements. Several narrow, vertical beams of light convey an impression of depth, indicating the presence of multiple light sources, some of which are much brighter than others.\n\nAround the edges of the image, faint graphical elements or signs can be glimpsed, possibly commercial signage or public instructions, again contributing to the notion that the setting might be a public space like a mall or station.\n\nOverall, the image is characterized by vibrant patterns created through the use of light, blurred motion, and color, emphasizing an abstract aesthetic rather than clarity of objects or figures.","title":"Light patterns created by multicolored casino displays in downtown Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549623","553024","554360","551297","555213","555804","553883","557610","547763","542766","547270","547278","553822","555714","555431","550375"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["blur","motion","notion","instruction","technique","venue","light","object","hub","pattern"]}
