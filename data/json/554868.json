{"path":"554868.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, three adults are standing in front of a small, seemingly older building with a flat facade and signage that reads \"Brice's Market.\" The architecture is simple and utilitarian, painted mostly in white with slight wear visible. Multiple ads, including one for Coca-Cola, can be seen displayed on the building facade and at the entrance.\n\nThe two individuals on the left—a man and a woman—are standing close together, possibly a couple, and are smiling toward the camera. The man is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt paired with dark pants and a belt, while the woman beside him is dressed in a patterned blouse and a white skirt. The third person, a woman standing to the right, is wearing a light blue, collared, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe setting suggests a sunny day given the strong shadows cast on the ground, with a cloudless sky visible in the background. The street is depicted as quiet, with no signs of other people or active vehicles, giving the image a serene, unhurried feel. The area looks to be a commercial zone, evidenced not only by the market but by other structures and visible signage in the surroundings.","title":"Family in front of the grocery store they own in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550114","545317","544882","552454","551132","557382","557156","545327","545440","554036","546436","542900","543471","551116","552680","546428"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["market","signage","ad","woman","facade","sleeve","pant","skirt","belt","stand"]}
