{"path":"548259.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at a subway station. To the left of the image, there is a man standing on the platform, possibly waiting for a train or just having missed one. He is dressed formally in a suit and overcoat, wearing a top hat, and holding what appears to be a folded newspaper or a thin book under his arm. His attire gives a classic, timeless vibe to the scene.\n\nThe train is in motion as it passes through the station, blurring across the middle and right part of the image. It suggests a high-speed movement, with light smears and reflections visible on the side of the passing train. The motion of the train is captured with a long exposure, giving it a dynamic, ghostly appearance.\n\nThe station itself features structural elements typical of many subway systemsâ€”metal beams, exposed piping above, and electrical boxes fixed to poles. The platform is well-lit, and structural elements such as vertical metal support beams and overhead beams are visible. These elements frame the scene and provide a sense of depth and the often industrial aesthetic of urban transit systems.\n\nThe photograph's lighting leans on the darker side, reflecting the typical lighting conditions found in many subway stations, especially during night or early morning hours. The focus on the waiting man, juxtaposed with the blurry motion of the train, creates a narrative contrast between stillness and movement, possibly evoking themes of daily commute, urban life, or fleeting moments.","title":"Man backs away from roar of subway train","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551889","556821","556650","556660","556662","551895","556682","556109","556663","556021","556818","556823","556658","548263","548274","551894"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","subway","station","beam","motion","system","platform","overcoat","commute","movement"]}
