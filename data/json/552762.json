{"path":"552762.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a city street lined with a series of identical two-story brick row houses. Each house features a set of concrete steps leading up to a front door, accentuated by white handrails and small landings. The facades of the houses are red brick and adorned with regular intervals of white ornamental blocks under the windows. The street itself appears slightly unkempt with litter scattered along the sidewalk and roadside.\n\nThe scene is lively with several people visible. One person is walking along the sidewalk away from the camera, wearing a long coat. Another individual is climbing the stairs of one of the houses, while a couple more people are engaged in various activities further down the street. \n\nThe environment suggests a sunny day, casting shadows alongside the buildings and the people. At the end of the street, some signs and a partial view of a building with large windows can be seen, possibly indicating a commercial area nearby.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a typical urban residential area with elements of everyday life and hints of architectural uniformity in the housing structures.","title":"Row houses in north Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552761","557287","555912","555920","548470","549287","555900","557286","556170","553550","552742","552734","550107","555942","543360","556582"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["house","street","sidewalk","interval","brick","handrail","landing","uniformity","people","stair"]}
