{"path":"544997.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and slightly somber rural scene. In the foreground, there is an expansive field filled with vibrant yellow wildflowers, possibly tansy or a similar species. These flowers blanket the ground densely, creating a bright splash of color.\n\nIn the middle of this natural tapestry stands a solitary, weathered wooden shed or small house. The structure appears old and dilapidated, with peeling paint and a roof that seems to be in a state of decay. It has two visible windows and a door, all appearing aged and somewhat neglected. The building's rustic charm is highlighted against the natural backdrop, hinting at a history that is long and perhaps forgotten.\n\nBehind the house, serving as a backdrop, is a dense forest of tall, dark evergreen trees. These trees provide a stark color contrast to the bright yellow of the flowers in the foreground and the grayish tones of the wooden structure. The forest appears thick and impenetrable, adding a sense of isolation and wildness to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph presents a poignant mix of nature's vibrancy with the melancholic beauty of forgotten human structures, conjuring feelings of nostalgia and the relentless passage of time. The scene is peaceful yet evokes a subtle sadness, as it portrays the inevitable reclaiming of man-made objects by nature.","title":"Oregon--cape kiwanda","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["555632","554562","552515","557674","555577","543198","552522","554561","552673","555537","551329","542615","557997","554822","545040","556957"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["forget","flower","wildness","tapestry","nostalgia","house","forest","vibrancy","wildflower","history"]}
