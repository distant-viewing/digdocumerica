{"path":"543243.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic rugged coastline filled with sharp, jagged rocks and cliffs. The viewpoint is from a higher elevation looking downward onto a series of prominent, craggy rock formations that protrude from the water. The ocean is visible with a mild disturbance on the surface, creating white foam around the rocks which suggests some wave activity.\n\nThe coastline is a mix of jagged peaks and rough edges, tinted with shades of brown and gray. The plant life visible is sparsely distributed over the area, primarily consisting of low-lying green shrubs which suggests a harsh, possibly wind-swept environment. The sky is not visible in the frame, focussing all attention on the natural rock formations and the sea.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates a time of day when the sun is bright, casting clear and defined shadows which help to accentuate the rugged texture of the landscape. The overall mood is serene yet wild, portraying a natural untouched coastal ecosystem.","title":"Rocky shore","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543295","543297","543061","543291","545173","543306","543290","545230","553775","545125","545130","545122","543060","543184","543067","543307"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","coastline","formation","disturbance","foam","elevation","viewpoint","wind","ecosystem","cliff"]}
