{"path":"556641.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a surface covered in circular, dome-shaped objects set in a consistent pattern across the frame. The domes appear to be made of glass or a similar reflective material, as they exhibit varying degrees of translucency and light reflection. They are embedded in a dark, textured background that might be some type of mortar or dense material, surrounding each dome in a thick, rough setting. The overall pattern forms a grid, but the slight inconsistencies in the placement and size of the domes add an organic character to the composition. The image plays on the contrast between the smooth, reflective surfaces of the domes and the matte, rugged texture of the dark background. The lighting is subdued, with softer highlights and deep shadows accentuating the three-dimensional form of each dome.","title":"Detail of a wall in an experimental home built of aluminum beer and soft drink cans near Taos, New Mexico. For this wall the cans were laid horizontally in two thicknesses which are separated by a vertical sheet of foam insulation. The exterior will be a combination of glass, exposed can ends and unpainted concrete unskilled labor and the cheapness of materials will allow the structure to be built as much as 20% less than conventional housing.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["557314","546568","555314","555155","557311","556632","552980","544716","550606","546487","555353","557626","555837","555306","555838","547675"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dome","degree","placement","material","close","pattern","highlight","up","grid","character"]}
