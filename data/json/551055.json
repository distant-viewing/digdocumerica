{"path":"551055.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene nestled in a valley surrounded by dense, lush forest. The foreground features several large industrial buildings, characterized by metal and wooden structures with flat and slanted roofs. Several of these buildings are equipped with tall chimneys, one of which emits a thick, white smoke that blends into the overcast sky.\n\nThe smoke rises prominently against the backdrop of the green forest, highlighting the contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment. The trees behind the facility are in various shades of green, suggesting a deep, thick woodland. \n\nAdding to this industrial tableau, there is a visible communication or electrical tower constructed of metal, located on the right side of the frame, further emphasizing the blend of technology and nature evident in this setting. The overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat gloomy or overcast, possibly suggesting pollution or environmental impact of the industrial activity. Color saturation in the image suggests it may have been taken during the mid to late 20th century, giving it a historical feel.","title":"A portion of Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant as seen from across the Kanawha River at Montgomery Heights","placename":"Charleston (W.
