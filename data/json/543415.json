{"path":"543415.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph showcases a tranquil and picturesque sunset scene, likely in a natural setting with a vibrant display of nature's colors. The top half of the image is dominated by a cluster of tall trees, possibly cypress or pine, silhouetted against the colorful evening sky. The sunset casts warm hues of orange and red, visible between the dark silhouettes of the trees, suggesting the sun is partially below the horizon.\n\nBelow in the foreground, a reflection of this sunset can be seen in water, indicating the presence of a small river, creek, or body of water, adding a serene reflective element to the composition. The water surfaces as a narrow, albeit prominent feature due to its reflective quality that catches the light of the sunset.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a peaceful late evening atmosphere, emphasizing the interplay of natural light and landscape elements, primarily focused on the silhouetted trees against a vivid sky and the mirrored reflection in the water below. The scene is devoid of any human activity, which enhances its serene and untouched feel.","title":"Trees and sunset","placename":"Little Sur (Calif.)","location":"Little Sur, California","nn1":["554404","542618","557447","557497","554731","552338","552335","544711","543062","552294","547731","550646","554759","543137","554760","554397"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","evening","reflection","silhouette","pine","half","water","catch","orange","interplay"]}
