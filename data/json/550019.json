{"path":"550019.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene centered around a large red barn with multiple sections, featuring a prominent steep-pitched roof and a cupola atop the main section. The barn is painted in a bright red hue and is complemented by white trim around the doors and windows. There are additional buildings adjacent to the barn that share a similar rustic architectural style and color scheme. \n\nA gravel road leads the viewer's eye towards and past the barn, bordered by a rustic wooden fence on both sides. The fence is made of sturdy wooden posts and rails, enhancing the country feel of the scene.\n\nOn the left of the barn, there is another small structure, possibly a shed or a secondary barn, painted in red with visible white trim around a large sliding door. Vehicles, including a truck and a car, are parked beside this building, suggesting some sort of ongoing activity or occupancy.\n\nThe setting is rural, with bare trees suggesting late fall or early spring, as there are no leaves, and the grass and ground cover are sparse and not lushly green. The sky is overcast, giving the image a somewhat muted palette with soft, natural lighting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its focus on the large traditional barn and the inclusion of vehicles and fences, paints a picturesque image of rural farm life. The use of natural elements and structures in the scene evokes a sense of tranquility and timeless rural charm.","title":"This farm in City Mills is not far from the factories and the Charles River.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552537","557991","547128","554782","556963","555577","555571","552462","543343","549194","555635","554806","547304","548065","547307","556586"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","fence","door","country","section","inclusion","sort","scheme","shed","gravel"]}
