{"path":"556941.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a wide, abandoned airstrip showing signs of deterioration and neglect. The foreground prominently features a textured, cracked tarmac surface scattered with gravel and small debris. This damage to the surface adds a sense of decay to the scene.\n\nAs the viewer's gaze moves towards the middle ground, parallel lines can be seen running across the width of the airstrip, likely markings that once directed aircraft. The area is devoid of any human activity or vehicles, enhancing the feeling of abandonment.\n\nThe background is framed by a dense row of coniferous trees under a gloomy, overcast sky, suggesting a remote or secluded location. These trees line the horizon, further emphasizing the isolation of the airstrip. The overall atmosphere is somber, reinforced by the muted natural lighting and the expansive, empty setting.","title":"View of the brass yard, site of the proposed administration facilities for the navy's Trident submarine base at the navy's Bangor annex.
