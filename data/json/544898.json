{"path":"544898.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural scene inside what appears to be a canyon or cliff area. The main feature is a massive, curved rock formation with striking striations and variations in color, ranging from deep browns to reddish hues. This rock formation curves overhead, creating an impressive, semi-enclosed space.\n\nA path, possibly a hiking trail, runs along the base of this curving rock formation. The trail is composed of dusty, earthy terrain, indicative of a well-trodden path through a natural landscape. Along the trail, there is a person walking, seemingly exploring or hiking. This person is wearing shorts and a t-shirt, appropriate for active wear in a natural setting.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the environment opens slightly to reveal tall, straight trees, likely conifers, suggesting this location might be in a mountainous or forested area. The sky is visible at the top corner of the image, showing it to be a clear day.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the curving rock looming over the trail and the person, creates a sense of scale and grandeur, emphasizing the majesty of the natural environment and the relative smallness of the human figure within it. The lighting is somewhat muted, which could indicate either an early morning or late afternoon time, contributing to the serene and somewhat mystic quality of the scene.","title":"White Canyon, near the Sipapu Bridge, Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544903","545759","545697","544902","544931","545571","544341","558083","545805","544899","545550","544917","545305","545693","544363","550428"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["trail","rock","hiking","formation","person","path","striation","majesty","conifer","canyon"]}
