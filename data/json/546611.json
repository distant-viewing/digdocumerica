{"path":"546611.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment involving a police officer and a civilian in a car. The police officer, viewed from the back, is dressed in a light blue shirt with dark trousers, equipped with a duty belt that carries various items, including handcuffs. The officer is leaning slightly into the window of a vintage, light blue car, engaging with the driver who is partly visible.\n\nThe car's window is rolled down, allowing for the interaction. The driver appears to be a male, seen only from the side profile and partially obscured by the car's window frame and the police officer's body. The focus of the interaction seems calm, with the officer's posture casual and the driver facing forward.\n\nThe scene takes place in a daytime outdoor setting, possibly beside a park or a green space, hinted by blurry green areas and what appears to be a metal structure in the background, possibly part of a fence or urban park equipment. The setting has a somber tone, with overcast lighting, enhancing the seriousness of the interaction between the officer and the driver.","title":"Officer catches traffic violator","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546663","546654","546661","546637","557841","546657","557865","557868","546647","551941","557863","557872","546634","546658","546633","546631"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","driver","police","car","interaction","seriousness","window","viewed","duty","park"]}
