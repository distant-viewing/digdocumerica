{"path":"546304.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a person is partially submerged in a body of water, appearing only from the chest upwards. The individual is equipped for underwater activity, wearing a large pair of black goggles with a pair of breathing tubes extending upwards, presumably part of a snorkeling or diving mask. They also have on a wetsuit, indicating that the water may be cool, or that they are engaged in extended water activity.\n\nThe personâ€™s arms are raised slightly out of the water, and they are holding a clump of what appears to be oysters or some other form of marine life with both hands, slightly showcasing it towards the viewer. Their expression, visible through the goggles, seems focused and content with their find.\n\nThe water surrounding the person has a murky greenish color, typical of a freshwater or brackish environment, possibly a river or coastal area where oyster beds are common. The light in the scene is natural, suggesting this activity is taking place during the day under clear conditions. There is no visible shoreline or other objects, just the calm expanse of water which blurs into the background, putting the entire focus on the person and their activity. The overall tone of the photo has a muted, vintage quality, giving it a timeless feel in depicting a moment of aquatic exploration.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory.
