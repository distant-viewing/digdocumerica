{"path":"551827.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts two people, presumably a man and a woman, sitting relaxed in a lush garden setting. They are partially obscured by a foreground thick with varied types of plants, adding a sense of depth and intimacy to the scene.\n\nThe man, on the left, appears to be reading a newspaper or some sheets of paper, while dressed in a casual white outfit with sleeves rolled up, conveying a leisurely and comfortable mood. He is turned slightly towards the other person, suggesting a shared moment though engaged in separate activities.\n\nThe woman, on the right, is focused on reading a book. She is wearing a red jacket over a light-colored blouse and appears to be engrossed in her reading material.\n\nThe background is rich with vivid flora, including various types of flowers in reds, yellows, and purples, as well as lush greenery. This vibrant backdrop not only enhances the peacefulness of the activity but also highlights the beauty of a cultivated garden. The setting seems likely to be either a personal garden or possibly a public botanical environment, suggested by the well-maintained and diverse plant life.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
