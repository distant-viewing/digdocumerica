{"path":"557150.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up side view of a balding man looking away from the camera with a cheerful expression. He is wearing large, brown-tinted glasses and has visible hair on the sides and back of his head. The man is dressed in a collared shirt with a vertical striped pattern, layered under a dark zip-up jacket.\n\nThe background shows an expansive outdoor scene under a clear blue sky. A bare tree branch is faintly visible at the top left corner of the frame, suggesting it might be fall or winter as there are no leaves. Bright sunlight illuminates the scene, casting a warm glow on the man's face and highlighting the contours of his facial features.\n\nIn the distant background, there are parked cars and what looks like people gathered in a field, possibly indicating the location could be a public park or an outdoor event area. The overall mood conveyed by the image is light-hearted and pleasant, capturing a moment of quiet contentment or observation.","title":"John bright, planning and design consultant of the Denver service center of the national park service, attended the second annual tallgrass prairie national park conference held at Elmdale, Kansas, near Emporia.
