{"path":"551903.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a control room setting, possibly related to transportation or network operations. The room has an elongated layout with high ceilings; the architecture suggests it might be located within a historical or traditional building due to the arches along the side walls, which add an element of classical design.\n\nThree individuals, all men appearing to wear white shirts and dark ties, are seated at a long desk equipped with maps, documents, and various operational instruments, focusing on their tasks. The desk stretches across the middle foreground to the background, filled with switches, buttons, and telecommunication devices, suggesting complex operational control activities.\n\nOn the right side of the room, there is a large wall map showing some sort of network — potentially railway or electrical — and next to it, a grid-like panel possibly used for monitoring or controlling the network. Additionally, there is a standalone computer terminal with a small monitor and keyboard, which indicates technology used for operations management.\n\nThe background includes a large open door and several windows which are integrated into another wall full of equipments, parallel to the large map. The artificial lighting from above provides a clear view of all elements in the room. On the left far background, various scenes (likely paintings) are hanging on the wall, adding a decorative element to the otherwise utilitarian space.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of focused work, with a blend of traditional architecture and specialized technical equipment, suggesting a setting where careful monitoring and control of operations are crucial.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day controls all traffic lights.
