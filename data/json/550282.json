{"path":"550282.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features an intricate network of elevated highways and ramps. Multiple concrete roads, supported by numerous concrete pillars of varying heights, criss-cross over each other, forming a complex transportation junction. These roads vary in width, but each consists of multiple lanes, designed for heavy traffic flow.\n\nThere are several levels of highway visible, with ramps facilitating the movement of vehicles between these levels. Some of the highways curve gently, suggesting smooth traffic transitions. A couple of vehicles are visible on different roads, which appear lightly trafficked at the moment when the photo was taken.\n\nThe surroundings of the highway are minimally featured. However, from what is visible, there are no significant buildings or trees immediately next to the roads, giving a somewhat industrial or peripheral urban area impression. The sky is largely clear, suggesting a sunny day, enhancing visibility and providing bright, natural lighting to the entire scene.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph is taken from an elevated point, looking slightly downwards onto the highways, giving a comprehensive overview of this complex transportation network. This angle allows for a detailed visualization of the layout and structural design of the highways and supporting infrastructure.","title":"Interstate 90--under construction for several years","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548332","544642","546709","547770","552719","548333","553475","547762","553838","553015","547780","546714","546713","558049","555745","546686"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","roads","ramp","elevated","network","complex","transportation","traffic","level","concrete"]}
