{"path":"551478.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban street scene, likely taken from an elevated vantage point. The image features a multi-lane road with vehicles including cars and buses. The cars appear to be from a variety of eras, suggesting a vintage or historical photo, with designs typical of mid-20th century automotive styles.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a large building with a modern façade, featuring expansive glass windows that reflect the surrounding urban environment. Adjoining this on the right side, a pedestrian area with trees, benches, and people walking or sitting creates a lively public space. This area is distinctly separated from the traffic by a curb, enhancing the pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.\n\nAbove the street level, there appears to be a partially visible pedestrian bridge or walkway, connecting buildings on either side of the street, indicative of an integrated urban planning design to facilitate pedestrian movement and safety.\n\nThe overall composition captures an effective contrast between the bustling vehicular traffic and the calmer, more serene pedestrian zones, providing a dynamic snapshot of urban life. The lighting and shadows suggest daytime, and the general activity level indicates a busy time of day in a densely populated city center.","title":"Skyway of nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552711","556807","548388","551474","551471","555782","553681","555450","549662","549857","546743","556681","553301","549886","549849","548369"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["pedestrian","street","adjoin","level","traffic","curb","planning","facilitate","integrate","façade"]}
