{"path":"545305.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a narrow canyon with textured, curved sandstone walls that tower around a central figure. The setting is quite dramaticâ€”characterized by rich, warm tones of red and orange in the rock that contrast strikingly with areas of deep shadow and bright sunlight filtering through the openings above.\n\nThe central figure, a man, is positioned near the middle of the frame. He stands on a sandy floor, dressed in a long-sleeve burgundy top and blue jeans, accessorized with a belt and hiking boots. His presence adds a sense of scale and human element to the majestic landscape. He appears to be looking slightly upwards, possibly admiring the natural beauty of the rocky walls or looking towards the source of the light.\n\nThe sunlight illuminates parts of the canyon floor, creating patterns of light and shadow that add to the visual interest of the scene. The light entry points suggest openings in the canyon above, providing a glimpse into the world outside this narrow passageway.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its interplay of light, shadow, and rugged textures, alongside the human element, evokes a sense of adventure and exploration in an awe-inspiring natural environment.","title":"Escalante river gorge","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["544895","544899","545697","544917","545693","544931","544898","544903","545750","545759","545592","545758","550481","545762","545705","545550"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","opening","admire","floor","burgundy","sandstone","inspire","entry","accessorize","figure"]}
