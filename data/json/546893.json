{"path":"546893.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows an expansive outdoor storage area densely packed with numerous large, black tires. The scene is industrial in nature, characterized by the sheer volume of tires which are primarily arranged in upright positions, creating rows upon rows that fill the entire visible space. These tires vary slightly in size and are seemingly organized in different sections.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, a railroad track runs horizontally across the scene, upon which several train cars are parked. The most prominent of these is marked \"Penn Central,\" and is loaded with several large metal coils, possibly wire or cable, secured tightly with bands. This suggests that the area may be a hub for both the production and transportation of industrial goods.\n\nThe background further underscores the industrial ambiance, featuring various structures related to manufacturing or processing, including large tanks and constructions with visible piping. There are also additional storage areas in the distance that seem to contain more tires and industrial supplies.\n\nThere are no visible people in the photograph, emphasizing the focus on the industrial elements and materials being stored and transported in this location. The environment appears busy yet orderly, indicative of a well-maintained industrial operation. The overall atmosphere is one of organized industrial activity.","title":"Power cables ready for shipment at the Western Electric facility near Colgate Creek","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555521","542531","547986","555779","547528","547140","555777","549776","546719","552765","554356","556382","547050","555564","552189","547054"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["tire","storage","row","volume","piping","supply","band","railroad","hub","production"]}
