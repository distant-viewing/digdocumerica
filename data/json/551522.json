{"path":"551522.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph presents a cityscape viewed from an aerial perspective. The central focus of the image is a tall, dark-colored skyscraper towering over the surrounding area. This building features a reflective glass facade and appears to be under construction or renovation, as part of its side seems unfinished or damaged. A straight, broad avenue runs directly towards the skyscraper, lined with rows of smaller buildings that include a mix of both modern and older architectural styles.\n\nTo the left foreground, a notable building with a pyramid-shaped roof is visible, possibly a hotel, given the clarity and size of the signage that reads \"Sheraton-Ritz.\" Surrounding buildings vary in height and design, comprising hotels, office buildings, and commercial structures. A visible absence of significant green space in the vicinity emphasizes the urban density. In the background, the city transitions into a more open area with trees and possibly a large body of water, under a clear sky. The overall composition directs the viewer's attention down the main avenue and up to the dominant skyscraper, suggesting it as a prominent landmark in this city.","title":"Nicollet Mall from the air.
