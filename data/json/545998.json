{"path":"545998.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial scene with elements suggesting a factory or processing facility in a grassy or field-like environment. In the foreground, there's an expanse of tall dry grass which dominates the bottom half of the image, presented in tones that range from beige to golden, signaling a possible late season or dry weather conditions.\n\nThe middle and background prominently feature industrial structures. There are two main buildings visible. The building on the left is somewhat obscured by what appears to be fumes or smoke rising in front of it; this could potentially be emissions from the facility or a controlled burn nearby. This structure is basic in design, grayish in color, resembling a warehouse or storage facility. It has a flat roof lined with minimal structural elements protruding vertically, possibly vents or minor chimneys.\n\nTo the right is a more complex array of industrial tanks and piping, possibly part of a chemical processing or energy production facility. Multiple vertical pipes extend above the tanks and smaller structures, hinting at processes involving gases or liquids. The colors here are muted, with metallic and gray hues, suggestive of steel or similar industrial materials.\n\nThere is no discernible sign of human activity in the photograph; the focus is solely on the industrial elements and their surrounding natural environment. The colors and general haziness in the image contribute to a feeling of isolation or desolation, possibly underscoring the environmental impact of industrial activities. The lighting and composition give it a somewhat surreal, time-capsule quality, capturing a moment in industrial operations amid a natural landscape.","title":"A natural gas installation burns its petro waste.
