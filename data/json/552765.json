{"path":"552765.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph likely captures a scene at a railroad junkyard, focusing on environmental and industrial themes. In the foreground, there are multiple railway tracks curving gently towards the right. The ground around the tracks is comprised of dirt, gravel, and some sparse vegetation, indicative of a typically rugged industrial outdoor setting.\n\nDominating the background is a massive, towering heap of compressed and stacked scrap metal, primarily consisting of automobiles. This mountain of scrapped cars displays various colors but mostly appears faded and dusty, emphasizing their discarded and derelict state. The cars are crushed and piled on top of each other, taking up nearly the entire background of the photograph. The sky is clear, indicating perhaps a bright sunny day, which casts ample light on the scene, enhancing the metallic textures and the complex contours of the crushed vehicles.\n\nThe photograph captures a sharp contrast between the linear, organized tracks in the foreground and the chaotic, mangled heap of cars in the background, possibly making a statement on industrialization, waste, and recycling. The scene is devoid of human presence, which might further underline the isolation and abandonment of the materials depicted.","title":"North Philadelphia junkyard stacked with cars for scrap metal","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["554356","554353","546172","545545","554320","542660","554357","542590","553011","554301","554352","554348","547621","542656","554311","551517"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["track","heap","statement","car","junkyard","industrialization","recycling","scrap","railroad","automobile"]}
