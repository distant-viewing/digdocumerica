{"path":"550146.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a candid urban scene likely from a residential or semi-industrial area. On the left, a man is depicted performing a sanitation worker's duties, dressed in work overalls and a cap, carrying a metal garbage can overflowing with refuse and a large plastic bag. He appears to be unloading or preparing to load the trash onto a garbage truck partially visible on the far left edge of the frame.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a young boy plays outside. He is dressed casually in a striped red, white, and blue long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans, focusing intently on catching or throwing a basketball. An attentive German Shepherd stands close by, watching the boy's actions, suggesting a relationship or familiarity between the dog and the child.\n\nThe background features a large garage or storage building with closed double doors, constructed of brick and reflective of a utilitarian design. The area is paved, and shadows indicate bright sunshine casting down, creating a contrast between light and shaded areas.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a slice of daily life, juxtaposing work and leisure, with elements that speak to routine urban existence. The presence of both human and animal adds dynamic layers to the scene, suggesting themes of community and companionship.","title":"Sanitation department at work near East 125th Street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550162","545348","550147","549842","550154","549839","556158","552754","550150","549844","544087","553526","550151","552228","548372","553040"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["garbage","boy","existence","sanitation","basketball","familiarity","sunshine","companionship","refuse","relationship"]}
