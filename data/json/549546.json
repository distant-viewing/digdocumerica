{"path":"549546.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a group of tourists overlooking a large waterfall, likely Niagara Falls, given the recognizable landscape and water flow. The scene is taken from a viewpoint that allows the tourists to safely observe and photograph the natural wonder.\n\nIn the foreground, four individuals are shown from behind, facing the falls. From left to right:\n1. A person, appearing to be an adult female, seen partially, primarily showing her left side as she looks towards the waterfall.\n2. An adult male in the center, wearing a dark jacket and light-colored pants, is using a camera to photograph the scene. He is standing and holding the camera up to his face.\n3. A younger individual, possibly a boy, stands between the adult male and another figure. This boy, wearing a casual jacket and jeans, also gazes out at the waterfall.\n4. Another younger person, this time a girl, is dressed in a red jacket with a large cartoon character (resembling Winnie the Pooh) on the back. She wears a dark cap and stands looking forward, with her hands up near the rim of the cap, possibly adjusting it or shielding her eyes from the sun.\n\nThe background features the expansive, partially sunlit waterfall, cascading forcefully into a river. The mist from the waterfall rises into the air, creating a dramatic and picturesque view. To the left, a bridge spans the river, connecting the two sides, and several buildings can be prominently seen in the distance, including a tower structure, likely part of the surrounding tourist facilities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with a clear foreground of onlookers and the majestic falls in the background, emphasizes the scale and beauty of the natural landscape, capturing a typical tourist experience at this famous location.","title":"Tourists on Rainbow Bridge which spans the Niagara River just below the falls.
