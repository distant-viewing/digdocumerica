{"path":"549965.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph presents an industrial landscape under what appears to be dusk or heavy atmospheric conditions that bathe the scene in muted, dark tones. The foreground prominently features large, rectangular slabs or structures—likely parts of a construction or manufacturing setup—with visible steam or smoke rising from them, suggesting ongoing industrial operations.\n\nThe middle ground shows a more expansive view of the area, crisscrossed by multiple dirt tracks and standing water in various places, possibly ponds or water retention areas. This setup indicates either a process involving significant water use or the aftermath of substantial ground disturbance, typical of heavy industry or construction sites.\n\nIn the background, several more industrial facilities can be seen stretching toward the horizon, interspersed with patches of open land. Sparse vegetation is visible, which along with the extensive industrial activity, paints a picture of a environmental heavy industry impact. The overall setting is somewhat bleak, with an overcast sky and a smoky or foggy haze enveloping the scene, enhancing the industrial feel of the photograph.","title":"U.S. Steel Fairless Works on the Delaware River","placename":"Bucks County (Pa.)","location":"Bucks County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["547539","551555","550181","545447","546084","542999","557220","545239","546080","545268","550343","557374","544173","546122","546108","557375"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["industry","setup","slab","construction","disturbance","aftermath","pond","manufacturing","steam","haze"]}
