{"path":"552857.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a flooded residential area, featuring a large white house surrounded by extensive floodwaters. The house has a light gray roof, with multiple sections, including a prominent section with a large window resembling an attic or dormer window. There are several trees submerged in the water around the house, suggesting the area was heavily vegetated before being inundated. The leaves of the trees are dense and green, indicating that the photo was taken in a season when trees are fully leafed out.\n\nAdjacent to the house, a thin strip of road or path is partially visible, suggesting the normal layout of the area might include accessible pathways now covered by water. The surrounding water appears calm, reflecting some of the greenery and parts of the house, enhancing the sense of depth and isolation of the structure.\n\nThis scene likely illustrates the impact of a severe flooding event, capturing the isolation caused by the water and the disruption to normal residential life. The overall mood could be interpreted as serene yet somber, given the beauty of the landscape contrasted against the apparent disaster.","title":"In the spring of 1973, the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
