{"path":"552846.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a long bridge extending across a wide body of water. The bridge appears to be a straightforward, multi-span structure with regular supporting piers visible beneath it, creating a series of ripples and disturbances in the water as it flows past. The bridge connects two land masses, with one end anchored on a small, more developed piece of land that hosts several small buildings and possibly a parking lot, suggesting this might be a rest area or a toll station.\n\nThe water surrounding the bridge is calm, with mild ripples, indicating a serene setting, possibly early morning or late evening, as inferred from the soft, diffused light. The background features a line of trees and what seems to be a distant shoreline, adding a sense of spaciousness and tranquility to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image impresses with its quiet and orderly composition, focusing on infrastructure within a natural landscape. The photograph likely aims to showcase either the engineering feat of the bridge or the serene environment in which it is set.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
