{"path":"553676.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a dense, urban cityscape leading into a vast ocean with a prominent volcanic ridge in the background. In the foreground, numerous high-rise buildings dominate the scene, indicating a possibly populous and modern city center. These buildings vary in height but are closely packed, suggesting a bustling metropolis. The architecture primarily consists of modern styles, with rectangular and cuboid shapes predominantly visible.\n\nIn the midground, slightly lighter and smaller buildings are interspersed amongst the towering skyscrapers, likely residential or smaller commercial structures. A few green spaces or trees can be seen, but they are sparse, overshadowed by the urban development.\n\nThe backdrop features a majestic, craggy volcanic ridge that stretches horizontally across the photograph, seemingly overlooking the city. This ridge is likely a famous landmark, providing a stark, natural contrast to the man-made environment in the foreground. The ocean is visible at the base of the volcanic ridge and to the side of the city, hinting at the city's coastal location.\n\nThe sky above shows a mix of possibly late afternoon or dusk lighting, casting shadows and highlighting the tops of the buildings and the ridge subtly. The overall tone and mood conveyed by the photograph are of a dynamic, urban center nestled dramatically against natural, historic geography, suggesting a blend of progress and tradition.","title":"Aerial view of Honolulu looking east toward diamond head the extinct volcano which is the island's best-known landmark buildings in foreground are mostly apartments.
