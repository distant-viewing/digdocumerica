{"path":"549553.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, outdoor river scene. The river is flowing vigorously with visible white ripples, indicating rapid water movement. In the river, there are a few ducks swimming calmly despite the fast currents. A prominent feature in the foreground is a large, fallen tree trunk lying diagonally across the frame. Its surface appears aged and is textured with bark, moss, or algae, giving it a rough and weathered look.\n\nIn the midground, several large rocks protrude from the water, around which the river water splashes slightly, creating small waves. These rocks also have some vegetation and perhaps moss growing on them, illustrating a natural river ecosystem.\n\nThe background is densely populated with lush green trees, suggesting this scene is located in a wooded area or near a forest. No human structures or activity is visible, emphasizing the undisturbed natural environment. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either a cloudy day or the area is well-shaded by the trees, casting diffuse light across the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its elements of wildlife, flowing water, and dense flora, portray a serene yet dynamic river landscape.","title":"Niagara river above the falls, seen from goat island","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["542557","550658","549550","550682","546171","545068","542537","548156","542743","553855","544861","555075","545861","542523","555076","542844"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","moss","splashe","duck","flow","protrude","alga","swimm","rock","current"]}
