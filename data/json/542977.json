{"path":"542977.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph portrays a car junkyard scene surrounded by a natural environment. The foreground prominently features multiple vintage cars in various states of disrepair and decomposition, piled atop and beside each other. One of the nearest cars, perhaps from the 1950s or 1960s, has a recognizable front grille and is painted in faded blue and white. The vehicle's license plate is visible and reads “KFS 433 Oregon.”\n\nThe cars exhibit significant damage: rust, dents, broken or missing windows, and detached parts that are scattered around. They are stacked in a haphazard manner, suggesting they have been discarded over time without much organization. The various car colors—metallic blues, reds, whites, and more—are faded and peeling, reflective of long-term exposure to the elements.\n\nBehind this chaotic assemblage of vehicles, a thick and lush forest serves as the backdrop, reinforcing the contrast between human industrial waste and natural beauty. The trees are dense and appear to be predominantly evergreens, common in many parts of Oregon, which supply a dense, green backdrop to the metal and rust of the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a strong message about the environmental impact of discarded automobiles and possibly the changing eras of automotive technology. The setting and the condition of the cars tell a story of neglect and abandonment in what might otherwise be a pristine natural environment.","title":"California--near Redwood National Forest, Humboldt County","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543166","545340","545365","553004","546268","555491","555492","542590","543680","552999","545743","552739","546249","545303","542656","553006"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","rust","dent","1950","evergreen","junkyard","grille","license","organization","automobile"]}
