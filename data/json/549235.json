{"path":"549235.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape, featuring a long, unpaved road that stretches through the image from the foreground into the distant horizon. The road is surrounded by verdant grassy fields and scattered conifer trees, hinting at a temperate to cool climate.\n\nOn either side of the road, there are fenced areas possibly used for grazing, as indicated by small clusters of animals that may be either sheep or cows. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills, with a gentle rise towards the center where a unique hill with a small rocky outcrop can be seen. This outcrop gives a distinct character to the landscape, standing out amidst the otherwise smooth hills.\n\nThe background of the image stretches out to wide open fields and a hint of flatter, agricultural lands under cultivation, which provide a diverse texture to the rural scene. A small collection of buildings, likely farm buildings, can be seen midway along the road. These buildings, along with a silo, evoke a farming community.\n\nThe picture is marked by a clear sky with fluffy cumulus clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day which casts soft shadows on the ground enhancing the tranquil rural feel of the setting. Electricity poles run beside the road, indicating some level of rural development.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its winding road leading into the distance, invites the viewer's eye to wander through the varied landscape, exploring the peaceful, pastoral setting. It evokes a sense of quiet and space, characteristic of rural areas.","title":"Ranch road near colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["547300","547354","549236","549261","549182","555818","549257","557087","555635","547316","549222","557748","549142","549256","554819","556462"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","outcrop","hill","cumulus","sheep","electricity","cow","cultivation","graze","stretch"]}
