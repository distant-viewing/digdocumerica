{"path":"549885.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a densely packed parking lot filled with various cars, predominantly from the 1970s or early 1980s era, given their boxy and angular design. The cars feature a variety of colors, mainly earth tones like browns and beiges, with touches of white and darker colors. Each car has glossy, metallic surfaces that reflect the sunlight.\n\nIn the midst of this sea of cars, a man is visible. He appears to be middle-aged, dressed in a business outfit that includes a dark suit and a striped tie. He also wears a hat, typical of the era's fashion. He is walking between the cars, likely navigating through the parking lot, perhaps towards or away from his own vehicle. His posture and the way he carries himself suggest a purposeful stride.\n\nThe overall lighting is natural and bright, indicating that the photograph was taken during the day. The sunlight creates high contrast between light and shadow areas, highlighting the gleaming metallic surfaces of the cars and casting sharp shadows beneath them, while also enhancing the textures of the surfaces.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the man slightly off-center, draws focus towards him amidst the repetitive pattern of cars. This setup evokes a feeling of a busy day and the routine hustle of going back to one's car, possibly after a day's work.","title":"Parking area outside Shea Stadium in Flushing Meadow Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549858","556196","553833","556773","556201","556736","546879","556790","556204","547826","546599","547480","547954","554349","546813","546731"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","lot","parking","era","gleam","stride","surface","hustle","1980","beige"]}
