{"path":"550662.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape dominated by a mountain in the background under a clear blue sky dotted with few clouds. The mountain is characterized by its lush greenery and a distinctive rounded peak. In the foreground, a reflective river courses gently through the scene, flanked by dense, vibrant green foliage on both banks. The surface of the river sparkles with reflections of sunlight, enhancing the sense of tranquility.\n\nThe midground is occupied by a thick growth of bushes or small plants, covered extensively in white flowers, contributing an element of texture and color contrast to the predominant greenery. The entire scene communicates a peaceful and untouched natural environment, ideal for appreciating outdoor beauty and perhaps suggesting a setting away from urban areas.","title":"Magalloway river below aziscohos dam in the mountains of western Maine","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["544940","555692","550656","543582","550513","552600","550691","550680","543569","555658","555682","554527","550509","555696","550700","550441"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["rounded","banks","appreciate","sparkle","course","mountain","flowers","communicate","flanke","ideal"]}
