{"path":"544526.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The image provides an exquisite close-up view of a garden spider positioned at the center of its intricate web. The spider, which is fairly large, features a pattern of vivid yellow and black stripes across its body, complemented by long, banded legs that are well spread out and cling delicately to the silky threads.\n\nThe web itself is a marvel of natural engineering, notably featuring a distinct zigzag pattern of silk, known as the stabilimentum, running vertically through the web. This adds a striking element to the composition. The web is seemingly complex, composed of numerous fine, radial threads spanning out from the center where the spider holds its stance.\n\nIn the background, there is a soft blur of green and brown, indicating a natural habitat likely dense with foliage, which casts delicate shadows and hues across the scene, highlighting the spider with natural backlighting. The focus is sharply on the spider and parts of its web, making other elements gently fade into bokeh, providing an almost ethereal quality to the surrounding environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the delicate yet robust nature of the spider and its web, set against a serene, softly lit natural backdrop that accentuates the details and craftsmanship of the spiderâ€™s silk construction.","title":"Spider making his web","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553874","555195","544518","555021","557620","557585","555196","557544","555064","544619","555083","549144","553872","543623","557625","543603"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["web","thread","marvel","backlighting","craftsmanship","stance","blur","engineering","pattern","habitat"]}
