He is focused on writing on a clipboard that rests on his lap. The man wears a white shirt and dark pants. Notably, he has a tattoo on his left forearm and wears dark-rimmed glasses.\n\nThe driver's environment includes various controls indicative of an older model bus. The dashboard in front of him holds numerous dials and switches, along with a large steering wheel. A metal thermos sits next to him, suggesting that he might be preparing for a long shift or recording details during a break.\n\nIn the background, visible through the front windshield and the open door of the bus, is a sunny day with a clear view of a road lined by green trees, hinting at a suburban setting. The external view suggests it's daytime with fair weather conditions, providing a serene backdrop to the specifics of the bus interior. The bus appears to be parked as indicated by the views through the windows and the relaxed demeanor of the man.","title":"Driver for the dial a rider radio dispatched door-to-door bus service in Haddonfield, New Jersey, writes down his next pickup point.
