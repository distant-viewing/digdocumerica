{"path":"547747.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a dilapidated car overgrown with vegetation. The image focuses on the open driver's side of a vintage automobile, showcasing both the interior and the broken state of the vehicle. The car's door is ajar, and we can see that the side mirror is still attached but the window glass is shattered. Inside, the steering wheel and dashboard are visible, but they display signs of significant wear and neglect, including debris accumulation and discoloration.\n\nThe upholstery, particularly on the driver's side door, appears torn and faded. The car seems to have been abandoned in a thick bush, as evidenced by the intrusive plants weaving through the open windows and around the car's structure. Notably, green leaves and branches fill the space, suggesting that nature is reclaiming the area where the car rests.\n\nThe surroundings indicate a rural setting, with dense vegetation visible in the soft focus background. The overall composition of the photograph highlights themes of decay and the passage of time, emphasizing how man-made objects eventually succumb to the natural environment when left unattended.","title":"Nature reclaims abandoned car along the Mineola highway leading into Tyler in northeastern Texas.","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546405","553008","545540","550797","553002","550795","548751","549107","553007","553010","548750","546318","547024","547883","545304","547587"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","driver","shatter","door","dashboard","discoloration","reclaim","tear","steering","leave"]}
