{"path":"556521.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph shows what appears to be a mining or excavation site. In the foreground, a prominent feature is a wooden frame structure that likely serves as a support or reinforcement for an entrance to a tunnel. The frame is constructed from large, heavy, wooden planks and is rectangular in shape. It has a flat top and an open entrance which leads into the darker interior, suggesting that it is the entrance to a cave or a mine shaft.\n\nThe background of the image comprises a massive, exposed rock face with horizontal layers visible, indicating geological stratification. The rock is varied in color, predominantly in shades of gray and brown, with some areas appearing moist or darker, possibly due to mineral deposits or weathering effects.\n\nThe ground around the wooden structure is uneven, covered with small rocks, debris, and dust, typical of an excavation site. There is a distinct lack of vegetation, implying an arid or harsh environment, possibly a quarry or a mining area that has been extensively worked.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the interface of human-made structures within a natural geological setting, highlighting the interaction between human activities and earth materials.","title":"Entrance to a new opening at a mine owned by the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company near Jasper and Chattanooga. The wood frame will be placed in the entrance. It is a progressive and non-union mine, and sells most of its metallurgical (high grade) coal to Japan.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552545","543848","543861","549148","544056","556329","552686","552422","543822","555622","555634","545529","556940","556322","554766","556398"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["entrance","excavation","mining","rock","reinforcement","stratification","cave","shaft","quarry","interface"]}
