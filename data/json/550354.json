{"path":"550354.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast forested area that has been extensively logged. The landscape is cluttered with numerous fallen trees and stumps, indicating recent logging activity. Scattered patches of standing trees remain, mostly on the outskirts and interspersed throughout the scene. The terrain is uneven and shows signs of disturbance, possibly from heavy machinery.\n\nTowards the bottom right of the image, a dirt road or path is visible, with several pieces of heavy logging equipment parked alongside or moving through the area. These machines include a couple of large trucks and what seems to be an excavator or a bulldozer. The presence of these machines suggests ongoing logging operations.\n\nThe general appearance of the landscape is rugged and somewhat desolate due to the extensive removal of trees. The remaining vegetation and trees around the edges and in isolated patches offer a stark contrast to the areas stripped bare.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dense collection of trees, indicating that the logging may be part of a larger, continuous forest. The overall composition of the photograph displays a stark reality of human impact on natural landscapes, emphasizing the scale and intensity of forestry operations.","title":"Clear cutting operation of the Georgia pacific paper co","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["542827","542828","542947","542949","542851","542824","545138","542840","553468","542823","555208","545272","555198","542834","545143","555221"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["logging","machine","removal","stripp","tree","excavator","reality","fallen","operation","stump"]}
