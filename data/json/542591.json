{"path":"542591.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene, primarily featuring a large, towering structure which appears to be a blast furnace or a similar type of industrial smelting equipment. Shot from a low angle looking upwards against a light sky, the silhouette of the structure dominates the frame. The sky behind it is a bright cerulean blue near the top, gradually fading into white towards the bottom, likely due to light exposure or haze.\n\nThe structure itself has a conical top and is surrounded by a faint halo of light, outlining its upper edge. This suggests either sunlight peering from behind it or some form of backlighting. The body of the structure is darker and textured, indicative of metal, with visible signs of wear or corrosion. A ladder or stairway wraps around part of its silhouette, enhancing the industrial feel.\n\nAdjacent to the main structure, connecting and supporting elements are visible, including what might be conveyor belts or walkways. These are slim and linear, contrasting sharply against the broad, curved outlines of the furnace.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo conveys a sense of vastness and the grit associated with heavy industry. Despite the simplicity in color and detail, the image dramatically captures the essence of industrial work and infrastructure.","title":"Converted \"wigwam\" burner at pine industry mill which recycles heat, reducing smoke and increasing efficiency","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542545","557397","547060","557387","545446","557380","557231","552190","546757","547468","556390","550195","545992","543258","544958","550344"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["furnace","outline","halo","stairway","corrosion","backlighting","silhouette","structure","ladder","peer"]}
