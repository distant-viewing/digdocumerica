{"path":"553340.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a cascading waterfall with frothy white water pouring over a smooth, curved ledge into a calm pool below. The scene is set against an industrial backdrop, which includes a long, brick building with large windows and a taller structure that appears to be some sort of factory, marked by a tall, slender smokestack.\n\nThis industrial setting is partly framed by barren trees and the hint of a clear, blue sky. There's also a smaller red brick building visible to the left side of the frame with what looks like a chimney. The water and its movements are the central focus in the foreground, while the built environment suggests a likely integration of water power in an industrial setting.\n\nNo people are visible in this image, allowing the viewer to focus entirely on the contrast between the natural force of the waterfall and the man-made structures surrounding it. The overall composition captures a blend of nature and industry, characteristic of many towns where water bodies have been harnessed for manufacturing and other industrial uses.","title":"Groton leatherboard company and dam across the squannacook river","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550669","550857","550736","553386","553389","553354","550738","553387","548061","553349","544796","557745","542594","550697","549540","553372"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","brick","harness","pour","integration","ledge","cascade","force","water","pool"]}
