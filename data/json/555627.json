{"path":"555627.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, weathered barn set in a rural landscape. The barn is primarily constructed from vertical wooden planks, which are faded and have a patina that suggests long exposure to the elements. The wood exhibits various shades of gray and hints of the original paint. The roof of the barn appears to be made of corrugated metal, some of which is rusted and showing signs of deterioration, including a visible sag near the top.\n\nThe barn has several features that draw attention: the large black opening, presumably a door, is set without a door to close it, directly in the center of the image. This opening is framed with darker wood, contrasting with the lighter facade. Above this main door is a track for a sliding door, now absent. There are also smaller openings â€“ a square window to the left and another small, rectangular opening on the right side of the barn, both lacking any glass or closure.\n\nIn the foreground, the barn is surrounded by tall grasses and weeds, indicating that the area is not regularly maintained. The vegetation is lush and reaches almost halfway up the barn in some places. Behind and around the barn, the natural scenery includes trees with dense green foliage, suggesting that this barn is situated in a wooded area.\n\nThe photograph captures a sense of abandonment and decay but also the enduring character of rural, architectural structures that have weathered through time. This barn, despite its dilapidation, stands as a reminder of past agricultural practices and rural life.","title":"Abandoned barn weathered by the elements off Route #800 near Barnesville in southeastern Ohio.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["550693","554821","554782","555612","552537","543343","552536","552515","552448","552462","555577","555571","550019","552494","547307","554561"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["barn","opening","door","wood","reminder","deterioration","weed","practice","plank","character"]}
