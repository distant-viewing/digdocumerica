{"path":"553792.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a dynamic landscape where urban development meets natural water bodies. On the left side of the image, a highway bridge spans across the foreground, leading the eye toward an industrial area characterized by large tanks and other structures, suggesting it might be a water treatment facility or similar utility. Below this infrastructure, a brown-colored river cuts through the landscape, emptying into a dark blue body of water, likely a bay or inlet, visible on the right side of the image.\n\nThe body of water shimmers with reflections and has a darker center, possibly indicating depth or sediment. Along its shores to the lower right, a patch of red earth hints at either natural terrain or environmental impact. To the left and behind the industrial facilities, there is a densely packed residential area consisting of numerous small houses arranged closely together, suggesting a suburban neighborhood. The area is sandwiched between green hills in the background and the industrial-urban landscape in the foreground, creating a contrast between nature and human development.\n\nCloudy skies above hint at variable weather, casting dramatic shadows and adding a dynamic quality to the lighting over the scene. The photograph captures the interaction between human activity and the natural environment, highlighting themes of urban expansion and ecological interface.","title":"Siltation in Pearl Harbor comes from housing development above the harbor.","placename":"Pearl City (Hawaii)","location":"Pearl City, Hawaii","nn1":["551174","550861","551176","555758","555765","550553","557420","550548","556949","551188","553945","547098","555744","557421","557501","550549"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["development","interface","inlet","expansion","facility","cut","body","hint","treatment","water"]}
