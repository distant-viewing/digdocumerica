{"path":"548816.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene featuring a large stone bridge with multiple arches extending over a waterway, framed by vibrant pink blossoms in the foreground. The setting appears to be a sunny day, complemented by a clear blue sky.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's an old-fashioned black car parked on a paved area, which gives a vintage or historical feel to the composition. Looking beyond the car, there are neatly maintained green areas with some trees and well-kept grass, enhancing the park-like setting near the bridge.\n\nUnder the bridge and moving toward the right of the photo, there are several people who appear to be enjoying the day. They are walking and cycling along a path that runs parallel to the waterway.\n\nThe bridge itself shows considerable architectural detail and seems to be a significant structural element in the photograph. Flags are visible on the top of the bridge, adding a festive or ceremonial touch to the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph seems to convey a serene and leisurely atmosphere, inviting viewers to appreciate both the historical elements and the natural beauty present in the scene.","title":"England's London Bridge, \"at home\" in Lake Havasu City since 1971","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["557969","548087","557959","548064","557096","557658","544542","549068","546810","557974","552598","545227","543313","542734","549469","549547"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","waterway","blossom","arch","car","vintage","flag","stone","path","touch"]}
