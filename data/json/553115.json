{"path":"553115.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up side profile of a man facing right, with a thoughtful or contemplative expression. He is wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, which has a detailed texture that is visible in the light. The man has dark hair and mustache and is dressed in a light-colored, striped button-down shirt. The background of the image is a soft focus blend of earthy and sky tones, mostly in shades of blue and beige, suggesting an open outdoor environment. The lighting is subtle, casting gentle shadows on his face which highlight his facial features, particularly around his nose and lips. The composition of the photo is focused tightly on the head and shoulders of the man, giving a personal and intimate feel to the image.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
