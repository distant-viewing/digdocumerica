{"path":"542786.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of manual labor in a forest setting. It features a man who is in the process of cutting a large tree using a chainsaw. The man is wearing safety gear, including a hard hat, and dressed in a dark long-sleeve shirt with suspenders over his pants, indicating that he is prepared for physical and potentially hazardous work.\n\nThe tree itself is very thick with rough, deeply grooved bark, suggesting that it may be an old and large specimen, possibly a type of conifer given the forest setting. There is a significant amount of sawdust being ejected from where the chainsaw is cutting into the tree, indicating the intensity and force of the activity.\n\nThe background shows a dense forest with variety of trees, some light coming through the canopy above. The forest floor is covered with small branches, pine needles, and other natural debris, typical of a wild forest environment.\n\nThis photo not only documents forest work, often related to logging or tree management, but also emphasizes the scale of the trees in comparison to the human figure, highlighting the physical demands and the environment in which these activities occur.","title":"Logger Gibson Alee","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542787","553604","553608","542785","553602","542788","542773","542769","554414","553614","542771","554415","555472","542770","553643","553601"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["forest","chainsaw","tree","sawdust","cut","specimen","demand","groove","comparison","suspender"]}
