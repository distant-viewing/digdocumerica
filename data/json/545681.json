{"path":"545681.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a somber scene with a wrecked helicopter on a sandy, reddish terrain. The helicopter is fragmented into several large pieces scattered across the ground, showing significant damage. The main body is twisted and disfigured, with parts of the frame and skin peeled away exposing the internal components. Some pieces, like the tail, appear almost detached, lying nearby.\n\nOn the ground around the wreckage, various objects are strewn about, including papers, a backpack, a camera bag, and pieces of helicopter equipment. Notable among these items is a white hard hat with a logo on it, which lies on the ground close to the camera's viewpoint.\n\nA male figure stands to the right side of the wreckage, dressed in a suit and hat, observing the catastrophic scene. His presence adds a human element to the scene, suggesting investigation or oversight.\n\nThe background is sparse, with a subdued and overcast sky suggesting an isolated, open desert environment, enhancing the sense of desolation and calamity in the image. There is a hint of sparse vegetation and a structure in the far distance, but they are relatively indistinct. The overall mood is grim and reflective, marked by the chaotic aftermath of the crash and the vivid, contrasting red sand.","title":"Wreckage of an army helicopter assigned to clean-up of the San Juan River oil spill","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545685","545670","545642","545637","544754","547982","545638","544591","544741","544766","553863","551089","552393","544737","555872","551088"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","wreckage","piece","oversight","lie","investigation","hat","crash","tail","backpack"]}
