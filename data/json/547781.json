{"path":"547781.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene of a group of sailboats on a large body of water on a bright, sunny day. The viewpoint is from a shaded area, most likely under the canopy of trees, looking out onto the water. The foreground of the image features the silhouetted outlines of three people sitting, observing the scene. Their specific features are not discernible due to the backlighting, but their presence adds a human element to the image, suggesting leisure and relaxation.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by numerous sailboats gliding on the calm water. Each boat has sails fully deployed, capturing the breeze, and appears to be engaged in a casual sailing activity rather than a race, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere of the image. The boats are small, single-hulled with one sail each, suggesting they are used for recreation.\n\nThe background features a distant shoreline lined with greenery, and lightly scattered buildings can be faintly seen, which do not dominate the view but hint at a populated waterfront area. The sky above is clear and blue, suggesting a perfect day for sailing and outdoor activities. The overall composition, with the framing of tree branches partially visible at the top, focuses the viewer's eye onto the water and boats, enhancing the peaceful and leisurely vibe of the photograph.","title":"Sailing at White Rock Lake, a popular weekend playground for citizens of Dallas.","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552345","544021","543059","547757","543936","547754","552355","548555","543305","543994","544669","548247","552351","548510","542903","544667"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sailboat","sail","boat","deploy","glide","race","backlighting","breeze","recreation"]}
