{"path":"554946.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image features a vivid scene from what appears to be a rural or farm environment. Centered in the photo is a striking rooster with vibrant plumage, including a rich red and orange head, deep green and blue tail feathers, and a black-and-white body. To the right of the rooster, there are two hens that are predominantly white with light brown patches. The hens are facing each other, suggesting some interaction or communication between them.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly to the left, there is a traditional wire chicken feeder that is turned upside down, with some feed scattered around on the ground. Nearby, there's an old, rusty watering trough which is adding to the rustic charm of the setting.\n\nThe background consists of a vertical metal sheet wall, which looks weathered and corrugated, typical for farm outbuildings or barns. This simple yet textured background complements the central activity of the chickens, focusing the viewer's attention on them. The ground is covered in gravel and dirt, which is typical of a yard used for keeping poultry.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a typical moment in the daily life of domesticated fowl, set against a backdrop that emphasizes a rustic and slightly neglected farm atmosphere. The composition effectively uses the colorful appearance of the rooster as a visual focal point, contrasting with the more subdued colors of the surroundings.","title":"Gamecocks on a farm near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554914","554927","554947","551326","547406","543117","546759","549115","547394","557202","544484","546376","547039","546954","544492","543779"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["farm","trough","plumage","outbuilding","feed","feather","tail","sheet","communication","barn"]}
