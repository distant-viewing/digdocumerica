In the foreground, an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat, red vest, and blue long-sleeve shirt is standing next to a young boy dressed in a brown jacket. The man is holding up a sign that says \"WE BUY HIDES,\" indicating a business that deals in animal hides. Beside them, thereâ€™s a cardboard box on the ground containing what appears to be pelts, suggesting that they might be selling or showcasing these items.\n\nBehind the figures is an open area with grass and some leafless trees, with a couple of turkeys visible in the background, emphasizing the rural setting. In the distance, there are buildings that look like farm or rural community structures, painted white, enhancing the countryside feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition captures a moment that likely relates to rural commerce and daily life, highlighting elements of traditional rural industries and lifestyles, possibly in a farming community.","title":"A skinned possum shown by one of the oldest trappers in Texas, the town of Leakey, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554925","545980","543686","554934","554922","554924","549019","552677","552575","543779","552664","546380","552581","552090","549198","549051"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["deal","hide","sell","countryside","community","say","cardboard","lifestyle","commerce","vest"]}
