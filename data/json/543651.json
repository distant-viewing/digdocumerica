{"path":"543651.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two older men who appear to be workers at an industrial site. Both are smiling and looking directly at the camera, suggesting a candid and friendly moment captured during a break or casual interaction.\n\nThe man on the left is wearing a yellow jacket over a light-coloured shirt, blue denim overalls, glasses, and a green hard hat. His jacket is visibly worn and stained, implying frequent use in a rugged environment. He also has a pair of glasses on, which together with his cheerful expression, give him an approachable look.\n\nThe man on the right is dressed in a dark shirt under blue denim overalls. He is also wearing a green hard hat and glasses. Additionally, he carries a bunch of tools—like pliers and screwdrivers—in his pocket, and holds a pair of gloves, enhancing the impression that they are in the midst of their workday.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but shows the dark outlines of what might be large industrial containers or machinery, hinting at the nature of their work environment which seems to be some kind of factory or heavy machinery depot.\n\nThis image captures a moment of camaraderie and represents a snapshot of industrial working life. The setting and attire suggest that they work in a field requiring manual labor and safety precautions, as indicated by their hard hats and rugged clothing. Their friendly demeanors and the casual way they stand close to each other also suggest they may share a good working relationship or friendship.","title":"Workers at the Union Carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["556868","549947","547160","556339","553606","547987","556391","546036","546824","542783","556866","556335","544969","553802","556903","553025"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["overall","denim","glass","hat","pair","precaution","depot","friendship","work","workday"]}
