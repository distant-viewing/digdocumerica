{"path":"544223.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor leisure and fishing by a water body, likely a lake or a river, surrounded by lush vegetation. In the foreground, a wooden platform extends into the water, where a group of seven people, both adults and children, are engaged in activities such as fishing and sitting. Some of them are poised with fishing rods, aiming into the water, while others either observe or manage their equipment. A large bucket and various other items, possibly fishing gear or personal belongings, are scattered around the platform.\n\nIn the background, the shore is lined with dense trees and bushes. Prominently visible are also three parked vehicles: two sedans and a truck, suggesting that this is a popular spot for local visitors who likely traveled by car. The cars, by their designs, indicate that the photograph may have been taken several decades ago.\n\nThe overall setting appears relaxed and informal, with participants dressed in casual clothing suitable for a day at the lake. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day, which adds a muted tone to the colors in the image.\n\nThis scene depicts a typical recreational fishing day, highlighting a common social and family activity that provides a glimpse into leisure practices in natural settings possibly in a rural or semi-rural American location.","title":"On the banks of the bayou","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549935","546811","543164","548737","548188","548190","542560","550848","551430","550850","552283","554517","553081","546800","542648","550776"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","platform","leisure","lake","belonging","participant","practice","rod","day","bucket"]}
