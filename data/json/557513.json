{"path":"557513.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elevated railway bridge extending across the frame, illuminated by the warm hues of what appears to be late afternoon or early evening sunlight. The bridge features a series of large, arch-shaped supports providing structural integrity, and the railway track on top suggests it is in use, evidenced by a train that seems to be crossing at the moment the photo was taken.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by tall, wild grass or reeds, which are bathed in the same warm light, giving them a glowing, almost ethereal appearance. This plant life partially obscures and frames the bridge, adding depth and a sense of being situated within a natural environment.\n\nThe surrounding area appears semi-rural or possibly part of a large park, with sporadic trees and shrubs visible beside and around the structure. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and slightly nostalgic, emphasized by the lighting and the naturalistic setting. The sky is visible in the top portion of the photograph, suggesting a clear day.","title":"Bridge on Highway #101 in Santa Barbara County, California, north of Los Angeles. This and other coastal highways are heavily traveled. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressures. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage in November, 1972, of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557975","557096","557959","556769","557962","548064","552598","557090","545378","545227","547703","555749","544732","544724","558015","557970"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","railway","reed","support","train","frame","shrub","evening","track","portion"]}
