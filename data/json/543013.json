{"path":"543013.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking contrast between nature and industrial activity. In the foreground, lush vegetation covers the main area of the image, dominated by a variety of plants that include flowering bushes with yellow flowers and dark green leaves. The flora looks dense and forms a kind of natural bushy barrier, which adds a wild and unmanaged natural beauty to the scene.\n\nIn the background, centered and partly obscured by the bushes, is a large industrial chimney emitting a plume of white smoke that blends into the cloudy sky above. The chimney is tall, cylindrical, and bears a red band with white lettering near the top, though the text is not clear. The smoke from the chimney forms a significant visual element, contrasting sharply with the natural elements in the foreground by its color and the symbolic impact of industrial emissions.\n\nThe overall composition suggests a narrative of industrial encroachment into natural spaces or a juxtaposition of industrial development versus natureâ€™s persisting presence. The lighting in the photograph gives a somewhat moody ambiance, emphasizing both the vibrancy of the natural foreground and the imposing, somewhat stark industrial background. This image captures a moment that reflects environmental themes often discussed in the context of human impact on natural landscapes.","title":"California--Humboldt coast","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["550997","545247","550998","546141","545989","545113","542997","543813","543009","551059","557299","551026","546394","546363","551054","545239"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","bush","flower","encroachment","smoke","impact","discuss","band","kind","vibrancy"]}
