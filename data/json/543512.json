{"path":"543512.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene set in a unique environment where different seasons seem to blend. In the foreground, a sand-covered area features two individuals playing volleyball. One of them, a shirtless man, is energetically leaping to hit the ball, while another person, also competing, is partly visible on the left.\n\nThe background contrasts sharply with the sandy foreground, showcasing a snowy landscape on a hill that retains patches of white despite signs of melting. Several other individuals can be seen enjoying snow activities; a group appears to be skiing or snowboarding down the gentle slopes.\n\nAdding an institutional touch, a yellow old-fashioned truck is parked on the side of the hill, likely indicating some maintenance or security presence in the area.\n\nOverall, the composition splits the frame into two distinct seasonal activitiesâ€”sand volleyball in the front and snow sports in the back, unified by a shared enthusiasm for outdoor activities. The scenario is further enriched by the partially overcast sky and the tall, green conifer trees that punctuate the snowy hillside. This image captures the essence of a community making the most of its natural surroundings, regardless of the season.","title":"California -- mammoth mt","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["549102","545701","554292","554257","550017","554236","550004","548575","558199","554251","543998","543606","554242","554235","548576","554850"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["sand","season","snow","enthusiasm","security","hit","retain","ball","ski","split"]}
