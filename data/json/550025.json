{"path":"550025.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph depicts an interesting juxtaposition of maritime and urban elements. In the foreground, we can see parts of a ship, including ropes, rigging, and a lifebuoy. The lifebuoy is prominently displayed, painted in red and white, hanging on the ship's structure, which includes metal beams and railings painted in black. The riggings are dense and complex, consisting of numerous ropes and cable wires, creating a grid-like network of lines that contrast strongly against the sky.\n\nThrough this marine framework, the view extends towards a modern cityscape in the background. There are two tall buildings, possibly skyscrapers, dominating the view. They appear to be twin towers, closely placed next to each other, with a large number of windows that reflect the bright daylight. Between and behind these buildings, other shorter buildings can be seen, suggesting a dense urban center.\n\nThe overall composition uses the industrial maritime elements in the foreground as a framing device for the urban architecture in the background, highlighting a blend of nautical and city life. The clear blue sky suggests a bright, sunny day, which enhances the visibility and crispness of the buildingsâ€™ details. The scene lacks any visible human presence, focusing entirely on the interaction between human-made structures and their purposes.","title":"New apartment towers seen through life preserver of sailing vessel, \"westward\", on long wharf in Boston harbor","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549892","555800","550034","555721","552265","550910","555722","556190","544657","548393","553790","555731","552268","555799","547224","547147"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["rigging","rope","ship","black","building","paint","framing","cable","skyscraper","grid"]}
