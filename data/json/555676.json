{"path":"555676.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures a striking landscape evidently situated in a mountainous region. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, perhaps a hilltop or a nearby peak, overlooking a valley that cuts deeply between steep, sloped terrain.\n\nThe valley’s formation features rugged terrain predominantly devoid of dense vegetation, showcasing broad slopes that descend into the valley floor. Several winding, white streams or rivers can be identified snaking their way through the valley, appearing to originate from the mountains, potentially as meltwater from higher elevations.\n\nIn the distance, majestic mountains crowned with snow create a dramatic backdrop. These mountains are imposing, with sharp, jagged peaks indicating young or relatively unweathered geological features. The snowcaps suggest that the photo might have been taken in a region where temperatures permit such glaciation – possibly in spring when snow still lingers on the taller ranges.\n\nNo manmade structures or people are discernible in this natural setting, emphasizing the pristine, untouched aspect of the landscape. The vastness of the area, combined with the serene flow of the rivers and the ruggedness of the mountains, provides a perspective of natural solitude and rugged beauty. The overall composition of the photograph, with the valley leading the eye toward the distant mountains, creates a sense of depth and scale, underlining the grandeur of the natural world.","title":"View south across Keystone Canyon, a narrow two-mile defile to be skirted by the pipeline. After crossing the Lowe River, the pipeline will ascend the hill at the lower left. Once through the dark green spruce in the middle left of the frame, it will traverse the hillside for four miles before turning west and dropping back to river level.
