{"path":"544545.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and natural swamp scene. The focus of the image is on Spanish moss, shown in fine detail, hanging from tree branches. The moss strands are long and thin, with a distinctive grayish-white color that contrasts with the darker, green-toned backdrop. Below the hanging moss, there is a body of still water reflecting the surrounding foliage and bits of the sky.\n\nThe background is filled with a dense growth of trees and shrubs, predominantly in various shades of green. Among these, some broad-leafed plants at the water's edge stand out due to their larger, more vivid green leaves, which differ from the more muted tones of the other vegetation. The trees in the background appear to be relatively slender and are spaced in a way that offers a slightly cluttered yet harmonious natural pattern. The sky is not distinctly visible but provides a bright background light that subtly illuminates the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a tranquil and slightly mystic atmosphere typical of swamp environments, showcasing the intricate details of the natural elements prominently. The image has a calm and enveloping feel, drawing attention to the ecological beauty and quiet solitude found in such wetland areas.","title":"TaMiami canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["546059","544549","544595","546057","546181","544585","544589","544241","555008","544593","550789","544602","546985","554717","550788","546205"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["moss","swamp","hang","strand","differ","wetland","detail","calm","find","bit"]}
