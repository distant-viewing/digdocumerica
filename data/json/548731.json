{"path":"548731.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene featuring a single white heron standing in a grassy area. The heron is captured on the right side of the image, standing tall with a sharp, elongated beak, a slender neck, and pronounced white plumage, providing a contrasting focal point against the softer background.\n\nThe background consists of a blurred landscape with soft hues of blues and muted earthy tones, suggesting a large body of water like a lake or quiet bay, and possibly a low hill or distant landform barely visible through a hazy atmosphere. The foreground shows bits of grass or reeds sparsely distributed at the bottom corners of the image, colored in shades of light brown and green.\n\nThe composition utilizes a shallow depth of field, making the heron the clear subject with a soft, dream-like quality to the surroundings due to the blurring. The overall mood of the image is tranquil and somewhat mystical, evoking a sense of quiet isolation and the beauty of nature. The light appears to be diffused, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the gentle, subdued color palette.","title":"White heron near Marathon in the central Florida keys","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["547630","545142","544484","544480","557604","544489","550388","543063","547593","551378","544543","545967","548729","544842","543922","557495"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["heron","beak","plumage","pronounce","landform","distribute","reed","neck","bay","utilize"]}
