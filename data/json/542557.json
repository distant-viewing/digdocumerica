{"path":"542557.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a gently flowing river with distinctive features and varied textures. In the foreground, you see calmer water where some remnants of old wooden posts protrude, suggesting a previous structure or boundary that has since decayed or been removed. These posts are uneven in height and appear weathered, surrounded by still water that reflects a subtle greenish hue possibly due to algae or sediment.\n\nThe mid-section of the river presents a more dynamic scene where the water rushes over and around rocks, creating ripples and white water indicative of a slight descent or rapids. Notably, there are three prominent rocks in the river, creating natural interruptions in the water's path and enhancing the rippling effect.\n\nOn either side of the river, the shores are visible with various flora including grasses and small shrubs, adding a touch of greenery to the scene. The riverbanks are composed of smaller stones and some scattered vegetation, contributing to the natural, somewhat rugged landscape of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition combines tranquil water elements with the dynamic movement of the river's flow, framed by natural vegetation and hints of human touch through the wooden posts. The setting suggests a peaceful, natural environment, possibly in a rural or less urbanized area.","title":"A silt-laden stream joins the Merced River at this point.
