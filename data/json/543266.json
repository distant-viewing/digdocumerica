{"path":"543266.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a solitary mourning dove perched atop a rugged, rocky outcrop. The environment seems stark and somewhat barren, suggestive of a desert-like landscape. The rocks upon which the dove sits are textured with holes and irregularities, shaded in tones of orange and brown, which indicate either the time of day being either dawn or dusk, or simply the natural coloration of these geological features.\n\nThe bird is caught in a sharp, contemplative pose, looking to the side, its feathers blending subtly in color with its perch. The background comprises a dramatic sky, deep blue in color with soft, blurry clouds, suggesting a low light condition, either early morning or late evening. The foreground and the primary subject are highlighted and warm, contrasting against the cooler tones in the background. The composition focuses attention on the mourning dove, making it a striking focal point amidst the desolate, yet poignantly beautiful, setting.","title":"California--Point Lobos State Park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544547","557628","547318","553777","557204","550387","548832","552992","547947","551378","547196","547322","543595","548885","549115","555010"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["perch","hole","feather","outcrop","coloration","comprise","bird","pose","dawn","tone"]}
