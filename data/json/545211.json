{"path":"545211.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in active fish handling, likely part of a fishing or aquaculture operation. The scene takes place under what appears to be a large, dark canopy, possibly a netted structure designed to contain or protect the aquaculture area.\n\nThe foreground prominently features a young man staring directly at the camera with a focused, somewhat stern expression. He is dressed in a wet, dark rain jacket and is actively involved in managing a fish, which he holds with both hands as it dangles from a rod or instrument he is gripping. The fish, appearing to be a sizable and possibly quite heavy specimen, shows signs of movement, indicated by the splashing water around it.\n\nIn the background, another individual, also in a similar dark rain jacket, is partially visible. He seems to be observing or assisting in the task, positioned slightly lower and behind the first man, partially obscured from view.\n\nThe environment suggested by the backdrop and visible sides includes structures that are part of the operational setup, like the netting which domes across the top of the frame. This adds a textural and contextual layer, indicating the controlled setting of the activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of rugged, manual work, taking place within a specialized, possibly industrial, marine setting. The elements of water, fish, and protective clothing all underscore the nature of the task and environment: wet, labor-intensive, and exposed to elements typical of fish farming or a similar commercial fishing activity.","title":"In the research station on pollution and supersaturation (of the national environmental research center,) jerry bouck and don stevens examine chinook salmon for eggs and sperm","placename":"Corvallis (Or.)","location":"Corvallis, Oregon","nn1":["545202","545198","545206","545210","551412","552273","553095","551396","554200","545178","545185","546758","545093","552298","553657","550047"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","aquaculture","rain","fishing","far","specimen","task","specialized","grip","jacket"]}
