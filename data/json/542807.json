{"path":"542807.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a compelling aerial view during either sunrise or sunset, showcasing the Golden Gate Bridge immersed in a sea of fog. In the foreground, the ocean glistens under the sunlight, which perhaps is either rising or setting, casting a radiant glow on the water. The bridge appears almost ethereal as only the top portions of its iconic towers protrude above the dense fog covering the lower aspects and the bridge deck.\n\nBehind the bridge, rolling hills or mountains fade into the background, enveloped partially by the mist and adding depth to the scenery. The silhouette of the mountains forms gentle contours on the horizon, and the landscape gradually melts into the hazy, illuminated sky.\n\nThe composition highlights the natural beauty and dramatic interactions between light, water, and fog, creating a serene and almost otherworldly scene. The color palette features cool blues and silvers, contrasting with the darker, shadowed areas of the hills and the deep fog. This photograph effectively captures a moment of tranquil majesty and the impressive scale of both the man-made structure and its natural surroundings.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542798","543050","542804","548415","544722","548335","545022","547703","543436","546810","547669","544713","555937","543087","555725","549547"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["fog","bridge","melt","immerse","mountain","silver","glisten","hill","sunrise","protrude"]}
