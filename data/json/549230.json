{"path":"549230.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and detailed view of a wildflower scenery. In the fore, a prominent white flower with a visible interior structure, possibly a stigma or stamens, draws attention. This flower, featuring white petals and a deep reddish-brown center, is slightly off-center to the left and stands out against a background of dense greenery.\n\nSurrounding the white flower are numerous smaller, yellow blossoms arranged along vertical green stems. These yellow flowers have a compact, fluffy appearance and add a bright contrast to the lush green leaves that fill the frame. The greenery is comprised of various shapes and shades of leaves, indicating a diversity of plant species.\n\nThe composition uses natural sunlight that casts vivid highlights and deep shadows on the plants, enhancing the texture and depth of the foliage and flowers. Altogether, the photograph portrays a natural, undisturbed environment, likely a field or meadow, bursting with the vibrant life of wildflowers.","title":"Flowers amid the prairie grasses on the Crow Indian Reservation","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["553368","547642","544875","550781","543596","554574","545695","544876","557167","545291","544443","544574","555186","553076","543197","554576"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","wildflower","stamen","burst","blossom","meadow","petal","leave","stem","plant"]}
