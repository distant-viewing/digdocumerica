{"path":"552295.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph shows a peaceful outdoor scene with three people walking on a pebbly beach beside a large body of water. The composition is framed by the dark silhouettes of trees and leaves in the foreground, which create a natural border and a sense of looking in on a hidden moment.\n\nFrom the left, there is a woman wearing a black, long-sleeved top and lighter trousers, carrying a child in her arm who is dressed in blue. Towards the center, there's a young child in a bright yellow jacket and red trousers, walking alongside a man appearing to the right. This man is dressed in a casual plaid shirt and jeans. He seems to be in mid-conversation or perhaps looking towards the woman and child.\n\nThe background features calm, possibly hazy, water stretching across the horizon under an overcast sky, enhancing the serene mood of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and mild adventure, typical of a family outing in a natural setting.","title":"Kopachuck State Park beach at Gig Harbor in southern Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543499","543462","544230","543530","552975","550234","548695","548700","548794","548696","547009","547877","547676","543493","554506","553377"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","trouser","walk","outing","woman","adventure","plaid","family","arm","beach"]}
