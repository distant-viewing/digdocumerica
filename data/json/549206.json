{"path":"549206.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a row of dark, weathered wooden railroad ties laid out on a rough, red-brown gravel surface, which appears to be a construction or repair site for a railway line. The railroad ties extend into the distance along a straight pathway that cuts through a barren landscape. The landscape on either side of the rail ties is mostly flat and features sparse vegetation, suggesting a semi-arid or desert-like environment.\n\nThe scene is set under a dynamic sky filled with large, fluffy white clouds against a bright blue background, suggesting a somewhat unsettled but predominantly sunny weather condition. The perspective taken by the photographer offers a view from the ground level, close to the ties, leading the viewerâ€™s eye along the pathway of ties stretching towards the horizon. The scene conveys a sense of desolation and the magnitude of infrastructure projects in expansive natural settings.","title":"A railroad is being constructed through the Sarpy Basin area to transport coal from the Westmoreland Coal Company.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["552532","544324","544677","556873","555887","549131","556888","556902","554356","547940","556877","544706","547050","555882","550790","543725"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["tie","railroad","pathway","magnitude","photographer","repair","desolation","gravel","weather","project"]}
