{"path":"549466.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and visually busy scene centered around a large, cascading waterfall, possibly a section of Niagara Falls. The image prominently features multiple layers of infrastructure, including a foreground with a high observation tower that exhibits a geometric lattice structure, leading up to an enclosed viewing platform. This platform is crowded with people observing the scene.\n\nBehind this tower, there is a complex arrangement of bridges at various elevations connecting different landmasses or parts of a city. Each bridge spans over the river, densely packed as if in a multi-layered formation. The nearest bridge supports pedestrian traffic, with numerous spectators lined along its railings, taking in the view of the water. Further in the background, another bridge accommodates vehicular traffic.\n\nThe waterfall itself is powerful and majestic, with white water thundering down into the river below, which shows signs of turbulence and frothy water, indicative of the force of the falls. The surrounding environment is lush, with patches of green vegetation visible in areas not dominated by urban structures.\n\nCollectively, the image is a vivid portrayal of natural beauty juxtaposed with human-made structures, highlighting a popular tourist destination known for its scenic views and engineering marvels. The photograph, likely taken from a significant elevation, offers a panoramic perspective that emphasizes the scale and grandeur of both the natural and constructed elements within the scene.","title":"A view of american Niagara Falls from goat island, showing a portion of the prospect point observation tower and rainbow bridge in the background","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549563","549536","549530","549557","549548","549540","549535","549537","549546","549545","549549","549534","549562","549560","549558","549467"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["bridge","waterfall","elevation","tower","platform","marvel","traffic","turbulence","cascading","accommodate"]}
