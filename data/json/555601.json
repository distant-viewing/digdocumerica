{"path":"555601.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a large yellow bulldozer engaged in earthmoving activities. The bulldozer is on a dirt terrain, pushing a mound of earth to its right. There are two individuals involved with the bulldozer. One person is standing on the ground, leaning on the left side of the bulldozer, while the other appears to be either climbing onto or operating the bulldozer. Both are wearing casual work attire, which includes jeans and shirts.\n\nThe background consists of lush green trees under a clear blue sky, suggesting that the photo is taken on a bright and sunny day. To the left of the frame, there's a visible dirt path or road leading to or from the site of activity. The setting appears to be a rural or semi-rural area, given the abundance of greenery and the type of activity depicted.","title":"A bulldozer is used by the coal companies to clear trees to ready the land for strip mining.
