{"path":"557826.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene dominated by a large, curved asphalt area, likely a parking lot or a service area. Prominent in the foreground is a large white arrow painted on the asphalt, pointing to the left. The curve of the road lines seems to follow the direction indicated by the arrow, suggesting it is a navigational guide for vehicles.\n\nIn the background, there is a building that appears to be a large garage or workshop. It features multiple wide, open bays that might be used for vehicular maintenance or storage. The structure has an industrial feel, with a flat roof and block construction, and is painted white. A fenced area with several bright orange traffic cones is visible outside the garage, which might be indicating a restricted or hazardous area or used for organizing an outdoor activity.\n\nThe scene is framed by a clear blue sky and some lush green trees to the left and right of the workshop, adding some natural elements to the industrial setting. The photograph has a quiet, uninhabited feel, with no visible people, suggesting a focus on the layout and use of the space rather than any human activity at the moment of capture.","title":"Hamilton county auto emission inspection station in the village of Newtown, Ohio.
