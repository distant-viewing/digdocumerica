{"path":"543823.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat industrial or utility scene under a brightly lit sky with scattered clouds. The main focus is on three tall power line poles made of wood, leading into the distance. These poles support multiple suspended electrical lines, accentuated with glass or ceramic insulators at various connection points. The wires stretch across the frame, partially framing the sky and clouds above.\n\nIn the background, there is an area emitting significant amounts of white or light gray smoke or steam, which adds a dynamic and somewhat gritty character to the scene. The smoke rises against the backdrop of a hill or a slight ridge, possibly suggesting the presence of a factory, power plant, or some other industrial facility in a valley or low-lying area. This setting combines elements of nature and human-made structures, providing a contrast between the technology represented by the power lines and the more organic forms of the landscape and clouds overhead.","title":"Power lines at Rural Electric Administration power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["544277","550982","544613","557977","557298","543007","550183","549190","549110","543728","550168","544355","551030","550867","555574","557374"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["power","cloud","line","pole","smoke","technology","ridge","amount","connection","character"]}
