{"path":"557977.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape featuring a variety of electrical transmission towers and power lines, set against a backdrop of wooded hills and a clear sky. In the foreground, three different types of electrical towers are present. On the left, there are two tall metal pylons supporting a high-voltage power line. These pylons have a narrow, lattice structure, extending vertically with four crossarm beams for support. In the center of the image, there is a smaller utility pole, featuring multiple crossbeams and hosting a denser network of wires compared to the larger structures.\n\nThe composition includes a view of utility poles with several slightly sagging electric lines stretched between them. The entire scene is framed by abundant vegetation, with bushes and trees partially obscuring the base of the pylons and utility poles.\n\nThe landscape behind features open fields which appear to be used for agriculture, as suggested by the visible sections of cleared land and the presence of trees lining the fields, typical of farmland boundaries. These elements collectively depict a calm, rural setting where technology and nature intersect. The photograph's muted color palette, with dominant greens and blues, adds a serene and somewhat dated feel to the image, suggesting it might have been taken during the late summer or early autumn months.","title":"New and old types of utility support structures near the Kurtz archeological site at Riverview and Snowville roads near Boston Mills and Cleveland, Ohio. The site is privately owned and much of the topsoil has been removed. The area is part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which contains most of the undeveloped land located between the metropolitan area of Cleveland and Akron. The valley is heavily wooded and steeply sloped.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555574","549110","544355","557978","548136","543728","544277","544613","542643","553028","543903","555609","542524","546054","543823","553830"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["pylon","utility","pole","power","tower","voltage","line","month","lattice","transmission"]}
