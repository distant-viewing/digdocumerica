{"path":"549019.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, an elderly man stands in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left. He is smiling, wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, and dressed in a blue and red plaid shirt with denim overalls. Notably, his overalls feature numerous pins or badges on the bib, suggesting a characterful or personal touch. Behind him, the background is dominated by the facade of M.K. Stewart Alamo Mercantile, a small, quaint building with a classic Western architectural style characterized by a white, textured exterior and a prominent nameplate above the entrance. The large front windows are divided into small panes, with one displaying various posters and signs, which are not clearly legible but add to the rustic, community-centered feel of the setting.\n\nThe details on the building include a corrugated metal awning at the top, underlain by a decorative trim. To the right side of the scene, partially visible, is a modern gasoline pump, which juxtaposes the old-fashioned look of the building, bringing an element of modern functionality to a seemingly historic setting.\n\nThe photograph has a clear blue sky and strong sunlight, suggesting a warm, pleasant day. Overall, the image captures a blend of tradition and contemporary utility, evoking a sense of local history and day-to-day life in a small town.","title":"Owner in front of his general store in Alamo.
