{"path":"547237.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and leisurely scene at an airport viewing area. In the foreground, various groups of people are engaged in different activities on a grassy field. Some are sitting on the ground or on portable chairs, enjoying the outdoors and watching airplanes. There are individuals and small groups casually scattered across the grass, suggesting a relaxed, communal atmosphere.\n\nIn the middle ground, a few people stand near the edge of the field, directly observing the airport activities. One individual is on a bicycle, pausing to look towards the runway, adding a sense of movement and casual observation to the scene.\n\nThe central focus of the photograph is the aircraft in the background. It is positioned on the runway, seemingly preparing for takeoff or having just landed. The plane is a small, commercial jet, identifiable by its rounded nose and slim body, with the tail marked prominently.\n\nThe background features a glimpse of an airport environment with infrastructure visible, including lights and distant buildings. The sky is clear, contributing to the bright and visibly calm conditions of the day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo blends elements of recreation and technology, showing how people enjoy watching aircraft at close range, which turns an ordinary field into a place of shared interest and activity.","title":"Bicycling and picnicking along george Washington parkway which is in the glide path to national airport","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547247","548487","554092","547678","548464","547231","548485","548467","548428","544963","548468","550104","544606","548430","548447","548469"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airport","runway","aircraft","watch","field","nose","jet","plane","airplane","people"]}
