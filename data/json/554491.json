{"path":"554491.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque scene overlooking a vast landscape with multiple layers of interest. In the foreground, there is a group of people standing on a wooden observation deck situated on a rocky outcrop. The deck includes a metal handrail and a viewing telescope mounted on a pedestal, directed towards the panoramic vista.\n\nThe group consists of four individuals: two adults and two children. The adults appear to be wearing jackets, one in red and the other in a pale color, possibly yellow. The childrenâ€™s outfits are less distinct but casual, fitting for an outing. They all seem to be engaged with the viewing telescope, perhaps taking turns to look at the scenery.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a lush, dense forest that undulates over rolling hills, stretching as far as the eyes can see. This greenery is broken intermittently by a large lake or river that mirrors the sky, adding a serene blue to the predominantly verdant landscape.\n\nIn the background, there are distant mountains under a partially cloudy sky. The mountains rise gently, with their outlines softened by a haze that conveys depth and distance. Their color transitions from the green of the forest to a bluish-grey tint that correlates with the sky, indicating the vastness and the untouched nature of this scenic wilderness.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph is tranquil and inviting, capturing a moment of exploration and appreciation of natural beauty. The inclusion of the viewing deck and the group adds a human element to the otherwise wild and expansive outdoors, suggesting a narrative of travel, discovery, or familial bonding.","title":"Viewing platform atop McCauley Mountain, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, has a telescope for tourists to use on the Fulton Chain of Lakes.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554673","545710","554672","545689","548963","545001","554695","543443","548025","542732","544483","545780","557985","554137","551929","545293"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["deck","group","bonding","adult","handrail","discovery","pedestal","child","appreciation","inclusion"]}
