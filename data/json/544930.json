{"path":"544930.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a section of a shrub or small tree that is densely covered with green leaves and adorned with small white flowers. A prominent feature in the image is a silk cocoon or tent-like structure attached to the branches of the plant. Inside this silky web, several caterpillars can be observed, indicating a tent caterpillar infestation. The caterpillars are gathered together, likely for protection or communal living, which is typical behavior for many types of tent caterpillars.\n\nThe backdrop of the image is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the details of the cocoon and its inhabitants. The leaves are oval-shaped and appear to be alternating along the branches. This setup suggests that the photo was taken in a natural environment, possibly during spring when flowers bloom and caterpillars are active. The lighting is natural, casting clear and detailed visibility on the subjects in focus. The overall composition highlights an instance of natural insect behavior and plant life interaction.","title":"Caterpillars in flowering tree","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555196","542957","544896","557102","557620","554745","555007","554587","544553","555053","544618","551356","544514","555046","544479","554842"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["tent","behavior","web","instance","flower","inhabitant","insect","branch","leave","protection"]}
