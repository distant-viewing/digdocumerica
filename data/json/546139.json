{"path":"546139.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene focused on a large, metal truss bridge in the background. This bridge, constructed of interconnected steel beams, spans across the frame with visible architectural details emphasizing its robust structure. It also has utilitarian elements like the road deck and supporting piers underneath, suggesting its function as a transport link.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a massive heap of ground material, possibly gravel or crushed stone, creating a diagonal line that dissects the photo and adds to the industrial aesthetic. The texture of the heap is quite pronounced with different shades of gray, emphasizing its granularity. There's another smaller pile of similar material closer to the bottom of the image.\n\nThe overall environment appears devoid of vegetation, and the sky is neutral, enhancing the focus on the bridge and the piles of material. The composition uses the contrast between the organic forms of the piled material and the geometric rigidity of the bridge to create a stark, man-made landscape. There are no visible human figures in the scene, highlighting the focus on the structural and industrial elements.","title":"Louisiana--New Orleans","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552064","552247","548207","550189","550966","546112","550066","555730","550965","550954","557979","550955","545988","544304","548375","550986"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","material","heap","pile","dissect","truss","crush","pronounce","link","gravel"]}
