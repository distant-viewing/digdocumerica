{"path":"553610.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a person, presumably a worker given the gear they are wearing. The central focal point of the image is a white hard hat, slightly worn and scuffed, indicating it has seen substantial use. Attached to the hard hat is a set of goggles with a black strap and dark, semi-transparent lenses, which are pushed up onto the top of the helmet rather than being worn over the eyes.\n\nOnly part of the person's face is visible from a profile view. The person appears to be mature, with visible lines or wrinkles, and a serious expression. The natural lighting suggests this could be an outdoor setting.\n\nThe background is softly blurred with a mix of darker shades that could suggest a forested or wooded area, giving an indication that this might be a setting involving outdoor or natural resource-based work.\n\nOverall, the photograph emphasizes themes of labor and protection, with a focus on the personal protective equipment used in potentially hazardous environments.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
