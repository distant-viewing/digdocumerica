{"path":"551669.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at an urban park fountain. The setting includes a water fountain featuring a statue of a sea lion, around which several young people are gathered. Two boys are directly interacting with the fountain; one in a red shirt and another in a red and white striped shirt are playing with the water as it sprays from the sea lion's mouth. They appear to be cooling off or perhaps adjusting the flow of the water. Another boy in a blue tank top and shorts walks along the concrete border of the fountain, looking on.\n\nThe background features a row of townhouses with traditional facades and large windows, partially obscured by lush green trees and a bush in full bloom with white flowers. There are also two park benches near the fountain, painted red and blue, adding a splash of color to the verdant environment. The weather seems sunny, judging from the brightness and shadows cast on the ground, enhancing the playfulness and vividness of the scene.","title":"A vacant lot at 22nd street and 10th avenue was transformed by the chelsea neighborhood association into this charming playground","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551667","551449","552737","551638","551772","552706","550752","552539","557258","550747","551857","552703","553229","552540","549982","553289"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","boy","playfulness","townhouse","sea","cool","statue","vividness","mouth","spray"]}
