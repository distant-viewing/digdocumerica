{"path":"545661.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene on a vast, muddy landscape. In the foreground, the ground is cluttered with rugged, dark organic material that appears to be debris or dredged matter. Several pieces of heavy machinery are dispersed throughout the area, including a large crane on tracks and a yellow bulldozer. The crane, positioned near the center, extends an arm over a piled area, possibly engaged in moving materials. Several workers in safety gear, like hard hats, are visible around this machinery. They are engaged in various activities, potentially coordinating or conducting the operations.\n\nThe background features a dramatic and mountainous landscape with dark, overcast skies, suggesting either early morning or inclement weather. The mountains, partially obscured by low clouds or fog, emphasize a remote or wilderness setting, which, along with the water body visible in the midground, presents a juxtaposition of natural environment and industrial activity.\n\nThe overall mood is one of rugged activity, with man-made elements intruding into a natural landscape, under a broad, moody sky.","title":"Log boom near northeast tip of lake powell, site of clean-up operation following massive oil-spill into the San Juan river dragline scoops up oil-soaked debris.
