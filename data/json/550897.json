{"path":"550897.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the bow of a large ship. The ship's hull is divided into a two-color scheme, with the upper portion in a dark navy blue and the lower part painted red. Prominently visible on the shipâ€™s bow are two large anchors, positioned on either side. The front of the ship has a slightly rusted and worn appearance, suggesting that it may have seen considerable service.\n\nAlong the side of the bow, draft marks are visible, numbered from 29 to 42, which are used to measure the ship's draft in water. This detail indicates that the ship is probably a cargo or container vessel, likely used in significant maritime trade routes.\n\nIn the background, industrial structures, possibly part of a shipyard or a loading dock, are discernible, featuring several silhouetted outlines of cranes and other facilities typical of a marine industrial environment.\n\nThe scene is captured with a focus on the textural and color contrasts between the dark blue and rust-red of the ship, and the muted, industrial tones of the background facilities. The photograph evokes a strong sense of maritime industry and the scale of naval engineering.","title":"The tanker \"Exxon Baltimore\" in the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550891","544657","546040","551581","549618","551558","547474","549365","551990","546012","546934","553740","548127","545147","548393","546828"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","bow","anchor","shipyard","trade","navy","facility","loading","mark","scheme"]}
