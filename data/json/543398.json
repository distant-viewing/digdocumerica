{"path":"543398.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene that combines leisure and artistry. Here, a group of seven people, mostly women, are gathered on a sandy beach engaged in painting from easels, while observing and discussing their work. This serene group is artistically dressed, with most wearing wide-brimmed hats to shield themselves from the sun.\n\nIn the foreground, two women are seated beside each other, intently focusing on their paintings placed on easels. The woman on the left is wearing a straw hat and a red top, and the other woman has on a white hat and a dark sweater over a light-colored shirt. Next to them stands a man, partially turned away from the camera, dressed in a striped shirt.\n\nTo the right, four more women are positioned around a single easel, observing and discussing the artwork or perhaps receiving instructions. They are all wearing hats, with the second woman from the right also having sunglasses. Their expressions and gestures indicate an engaged, lively interaction.\n\nThe background features a stunning natural rock arch formation that towers over the beach, suggesting a dramatic coastal location. Other beachgoers can be seen in the distance, enjoying the sunny beach setting.\n\nOverall, the composition skillfully mixes a casual yet constructive beach day with a picturesque natural landscape, fostering a sense of creative community among the subjects.","title":"Southern California -- natural bridges beach, near Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543534","543216","547009","545162","543322","543072","550936","546874","543333","546768","548541","543225","547503","553952","555923","556297"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","woman","painting","hat","discuss","artistry","foster","beachgoer","instruction","receive"]}
