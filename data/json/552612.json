{"path":"552612.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, intimate family moment around a round table featuring a bold red, white, and blue striped design, possibly referencing an American flag motif. Four individuals are discernible in this warmly lit environment, suggesting a casual indoor setting, perhaps a home or a community space.\n\nOn the left, there appears to be a teenage boy wearing a black jacket adorned with stars on the collar; he looks on with an expression of subdued interest or contemplation. Adjacent to him, at the table, is a smiling woman (likely the mother) holding a young toddler. The toddler, dressed in a light-colored outfit with horizontal stripes, is animatedly reaching out to a young woman seated opposite. \n\nThe young woman, who is possibly a sibling or family friend, has long, straight hair and is dressed in a light-colored shirt. She engages joyfully with the toddler, covering her mouth in a delighted response to the child's gesture.\n\nThe background hints at a cosy, domestic atmosphere, filled mostly with subdued lighting and shelves that might contain household or personal items, adding to the casual, intimate feel of the scene.\n\nThis depiction is evocative of familial warmth and the simple joy of everyday moments shared between loved ones.","title":"Young people of the Pentecostal church after a meeting","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["556173","556611","544356","556235","548439","557353","556593","553523","553500","556531","545985","556609","543041","554861","553496","556525"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["toddler","family","table","woman","mother","response","round","motif","household","collar"]}
