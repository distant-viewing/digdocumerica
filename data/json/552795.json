{"path":"552795.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene centered on a vintage white sedan which appears to be from the 1970s. The car boasts a distinctive frontal design with rectangular headlights and a prominent grille. The vehicle bears a license plate reading \"EPA-364\". It is in motion, slightly turned to the viewerâ€™s left, indicative of either entering or preparing to park.\n\nIn the background, three men are visible. Two of them, further back, are engaged in a conversation and stand near a brown brick building that may be a commercial or public building given its large glass doors and a flag visible on the wall above them. The third man, who is closer to the car, is walking and dressed in semi-formal attire with a blazer. The attire and style suggest a business or semi-formal setting, possibly related to the event or location the car is approaching.\n\nThe setting is a paved area, likely a parking lot or a driveway, and due to the clarity and upkeep of the surroundings, along with the style of the building and the demeanor of the people, it appears to be a location of some importance, potentially a business or governmental facility. The overall ambiance is one of a calm, everyday moment captured, with a focus on the motion and functional design of the car within a seemingly mundane setting.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
