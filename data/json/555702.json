{"path":"555702.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showing a vibrant, wooded landscape. The prominent feature of the image is a large body of water that glistens under bright sunlight, suggesting the photo was taken on a clear day. The water, sparkling with numerous specks of reflected sunlight, is fragmented by several land protrusions covered densely with evergreen trees. These trees display deep green hues, indicating they are likely coniferous, and envelop the water body, emphasizing its secluded and natural setting.\n\nThe shoreline of the lake or river is irregular, with jutting peninsulas and small nooks creating a varied and interesting boundary. In one part of the water body, there appears to be a small, irregularly shaped clearing on the shoreline, perhaps a sandy or rocky beach. This clearing provides a visual break in the otherwise unbroken line of dense forest encircling the water. The composition and isolation suggest a tranquil and pristine natural environment, possibly located in a mountainous or forested region far from urban areas. No signs of human activity or habitation are immediately apparent from this vantage point, adding to the overall feel of untouched wilderness.","title":"Typical prince william sound coastline.
