{"path":"546645.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene likely in Washington D.C., given the distant view of the United States Capitol Building. The perspective is from behind a large motorcycle, which is parked on the side of a multi-lane urban road. The motorcycle is equipped with a windshield, and it has white storage compartments on either side. A radio device and various controls are noticeable on the motorcycle, suggesting it is a police or security vehicle.\n\nIn the foreground, directly in front of the motorcycle, are two figures dressed in long dark coats, white helmets with visors up, and dark pants. The left figure stands slightly in front of the motorcycle facing towards the right of the image, looking either at the other figure or something out of frame. The second figure stands at an angle, more to the left side of the photo, facing the first figure, clearly engaged in a discussion or observation of the scene.\n\nThe background shows a view down a busy road lined with trees and lamp posts, leading directly to the Capitol, visible and centered in a haze in the distance. Both sides of the road are lined with parked cars, and there are various buildings, possibly governmental or commercial, that frame the street. The overall ambiance reflects an overcast day, lending a soft light to the vivid colors of the scene.","title":"Motorcycle police at scene of accident on Pennsylvania avenue, nw","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546634","546641","546638","551383","551237","556719","546993","548890","554293","556206","546743","554874","555461","554354","545134","546637"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["motorcycle","figure","road","radio","security","police","windshield","compartment","front","side"]}
