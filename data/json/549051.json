{"path":"549051.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, a mature man is prominently depicted standing outdoors, with a noticeable agricultural background. The man, dressed in a manner that reflects rural Americana, sports a wide-brimmed cowboy hat atop his head, likely made of a light-colored felt material. He wears a plaid button-up shirt in a muted palette of blue, white, and light red stripes, complemented by a vivid red bandana tied around his neck. Rectangular eyeglasses frame his focused expression, which emerges over a strong facial feature set.\n\nProminently hooked onto his shirt is a sizable camera, suggesting a hobby or profession related to photography. His attire is rounded off by what appears to be denim jeans, and his posture and expression give off an air of rugged determination mixed with experienced calm.\n\nBehind him, a large red agricultural combine harvester is positioned, indicating that the setting is likely a farm or crop field. The machine, branded \"CASE,\" sits in a field of harvested crop, with dry golden stalks littering the ground around itâ€”a typical scene in a harvesting period. This agricultural setting is illuminated by bright sunlight, casting natural light that highlights the textures of both the man's clothing and the machinery at work. The background, aside from the harvester, suggests a vast, open rural landscape under a clear blue sky. This combination of elements portrays an atmosphere of hard work and the rural agrarian lifestyle.","title":"It's wheat harvesting time in the Palo Verde Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547734","548876","548874","549042","547679","549120","554203","547416","545087","549259","549046","544250","546068","552678","549054","549036"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvester","crop","determination","harvested","hobby","profession","eyeglass","bandana","hook","stalk"]}
