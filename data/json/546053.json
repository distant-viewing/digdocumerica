{"path":"546053.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures three individuals involved in a fishing activity on a boat. The boat, appearing sturdy and utilitarian, floats gently on a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The backdrop features a clear sky with a hazy horizon and dense, dry vegetation, likely tall grass or reeds, characteristic of a marshy or waterfront ecosystem.\n\nThe subjects on the boat are engaged distinctively in their roles. On the left side of the boat, a figure, dressed in dark clothes, is standing and appears to be managing a net or examining a catch. In the center, another individual is seated, seemingly taking a break or overseeing the activity, and might be holding something like a fishing rod or a part of the boat. The right side of the boat shows a person in a hat who is actively working, possibly throwing or pulling on a net or line, focused on the water beside the boat.\n\nAll individuals are equipped with gear appropriate for fishing, indicating a day likely planned for such an activity. The overall ambiance suggests a calm, productive day aimed at fishing, set in a serene natural environment distant from urban settings.","title":"Fisherman and his family pull in shrimp net on Lake Salvador","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["554198","546001","552325","546079","548164","548132","551410","545093","552317","552324","552326","554200","545178","548735","552283","552282"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","net","catch","individual","reed","rod","clothe","break","role"]}
