{"path":"546333.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural scene with a focus on two children engaging in outdoor activities beside a body of water. The setting is framed by the silhouette of Spanish moss-draped trees, which contribute to a sense of Southern charm and tranquility.\n\nIn the foreground, the shoreline is partially visible with small patches of grass and scattered debris adding a raw touch to the natural landscape. The foreground is dominated by the shadowy outlines of the trees and Spanish moss, creating a natural frame that directs the viewerâ€™s attention towards the center of the image.\n\nIn the middle ground, two children, both wearing shorts and light-colored shirts, can be seen wading into the water. One of the children steps deeper into the water, towards the left side of the image, using a large net to interact with the environment, perhaps attempting to catch fish or other aquatic creatures. The second child, slightly behind, also holds a net and looks on, observing or waiting to take a turn.\n\nIn the background, the waterbody stretches out, reflecting the sky and flanked by more greenery. A small, white boat is docked ashore, far in the background, adding to the recreational theme of the scene. The sky, though mostly obscured by the dense tree canopy, appears bright and suggests a sunny day, affecting the lighting and mood of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph utilizes natural elements and a child-centered activity to depict a peaceful outdoor experience, emphasizing themes of childhood exploration and a connection with nature.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel are dip netting for non-contaminated female shrimp.
