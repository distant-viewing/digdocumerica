{"path":"554741.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures the intricate details of a tamarack tree, specifically highlighting its slender branches and fine, needle-like leaves. The tamarack is depicted in a vibrant golden yellow color, suggesting it might be autumn, which is when this deciduous conifer changes color before shedding its needles. The branches intersect at various angles, creating a dense and tangled appearance.\n\nThe focus is sharp on some clusters of needles while others softly blend into the background, providing a sense of depth and texture. The background is a blurred wash of light blue, likely the sky, which contrasts beautifully with the vivid yellow of the needles. The lighting is soft yet bright, illuminating the needles and enhancing their golden hue.\n\nOverall, the composition is natural and somewhat abstract, drawing the viewer's attention to the color and form of the tamarack's foliage against the serene sky. This image captures a specific seasonal moment, emphasizing the transient beauty of autumnal foliage.","title":"Closeup view of tamarack needles and branches at Moose River Plains","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554735","554739","555003","552693","554736","557592","554988","550603","544731","550703","546011","554954","554727","551365","557542","557602"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["needle","branch","wash","foliage","conifer","shed","intersect","yellow","autumn","change"]}
