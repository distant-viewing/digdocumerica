{"path":"542766.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a mysterious and slightly abstract scene, primarily illuminated in green and blue tones. The main focus is on vertical lines that dominate the image. These lines are likely the slats of a blind or screen, either interior or exterior, covering a window. Through the gaps in these slats, the blurry shapes of buildings, windows, and possibly other urban structures are faintly visible, suggesting an urban environment at night.\n\nThe lighting casts a strong green hue on the scene, perhaps from a neon light or similar artificial source, which gives the photo a cool, surreal atmosphere. The lines are sharp and well-defined in the foreground, becoming hazier as they extend towards the edges of the image. The background is dark and obscure, contributing to the enigmatic and moody quality of the photograph. The overall composition is minimalistic, focusing on the interplay of light, shadow, and geometric shapes created by the slatted structure.","title":"Air pollution control center","placename":"Los Angeles County (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles County, California","nn1":["549880","553255","544012","549623","553024","549835","557391","553883","548072","557631","555213","545428","549111","546546","543028","555020"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["slat","screen","shapes","gap","abstract","neon","become","line","night","source"]}
