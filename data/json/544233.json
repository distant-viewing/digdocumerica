{"path":"544233.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid and somewhat edgy interior scene featuring three individuals in what appears to be a kitchen. In the foreground, a woman with a playful or intense expression is pointing a gun directly towards the viewer; the gun is large, black, and has the appearance of a semi-automatic pistol. She is seated and sports a dark, tousled hairstyle and a white top with narrow, colorful stripes. The focus on her face and the gun draws immediate attention.\n\nTo the left, a shirtless man with an easygoing or humorous demeanor stands leaning slightly forward. He has dark hair and a mustache, and he holds his blue jeans slightly pulled down by his thumb, revealing his hips. His relaxed posture and the contrast of his bare torso grab attention.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, only the profile of another womanâ€™s face is visible. She has a short haircut and is turned away, looking at something or someone outside of the camera's view.\n\nThe background reveals a typical kitchen environment, with a sink, window, and shelves filled with various domestic items. Natural light filters in through the large window, adding a soft glow to the room. The atmosphere contains a playful yet tense dynamic, enhanced by the contrast between everyday domesticity and the apparent threat implied by the gun.\n\nOverall, the image captures a provocative moment, blending casual, everyday life with elements of dramatic tension or dark humor. The setting and composition give it a candid, snapshot feel.","title":"Fisherman's sons","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["546136","545970","556824","557353","553523","544198","546144","557038","543041","554896","553544","553531","544356","548439","557898","551482"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["gun","kitchen","haircut","grab","sink","torso","reveal","hip","tension","mustache"]}
