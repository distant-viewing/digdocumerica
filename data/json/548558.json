{"path":"548558.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site during what appears to be the building of a multi-unit residential or commercial structure. The building under construction has a partial framework of what seems like concrete block walls; the hollow block structure is visible and open, lacking both windows and doors at this stage. Wooden roof trusses are partially installed on top of the structure.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there's a single palm tree, relatively young and swaying slightly, which suggests a breezy day. The environment around the site is sparse, with a ground cover that suggests cleared land typical of development areas, with some loose soil and small piles of debris around.\n\nA prominent feature in the image is a large crane to the right, indicating heavy lifting work, possibly related to placing roofing materials or other heavy building elements. The crane's arm extends across the sky, pointing upwards and slightly toward the building.\n\nThe background offers little detail; it is relatively flat and nondescript, enhancing the focus on the construction activity. The sky appears slightly overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene which suggests either an early morning or late afternoon timeframe.","title":"Condominium under construction at the century village retirement community.
