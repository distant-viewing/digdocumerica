{"path":"543271.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal environment, prominently featuring a sign that reads \"PROTECTED Monarch Butterflies MAY NOT BE MOLESTED $500 FINE.\" The sign is affixed to a stone pillar surrounded by an abundance of wildflowers and plants, which are lush and vividly colored, with hues ranging from yellow to purple. In the background, there is a rocky beach extending towards a calm sea, which stretches along the horizon.\n\nOn the left part of the image, the flora predominantly consists of taller plants with slender leaves, some of them reaching up against the sign. To the right, the ground is covered in a carpet of purple flowers, suggesting it might be a favored spot for the mentioned butterflies. The stones and pebbles around the sign add a rugged texture to the scene, complementing the natural, untamed beauty of the setting.\n\nIn the distance, there are hints of a residential area with houses nestled just beyond the coastline, partially obscured by the dense vegetation. The overall composition of the photograph, with its naturalistic elements and the warning sign, highlights human efforts to protect and preserve the natural habitat, specifically for the monarch butterflies in this picturesque location. The lighting, probably taken late in the day, casts a warm glow and enhances the rich colors of the landscape.","title":"California--Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543270","543420","543399","543401","542984","543066","543168","553997","545248","545109","547592","557489","551381","543199","543196","545101"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["butterfly","sign","stone","affix","abundance","carpet","pebble","mention","warning","pillar"]}
