{"path":"549580.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant and intriguing scene likely from a parade or public performance. Center stage in the image is a large, ornately decorated float featuring gothic-style architectural elements with gold and blue detailing. Atop the float, a live tiger stands prominently beside a woman who is dressed in a costume that suggests she might be a performer or dancer. She is wearing a white costume with embellished details that glint under the sunlight, contributing a sense of theatricality and spectacle.\n\nThe float itself includes golden poles and decorative motifs that resemble traditional European royal crests, accentuating a theme of regality and elegance. The intricate blue and gold color scheme of the float provides a stunning contrast against the rich natural colors of the tiger.\n\nIn the background, there are spectators gathered, evidently watching the parade, and behind them are some urban structures, including what appears to be a tall modern building, indicating that the event is taking place in a city setting under a clear sky with few clouds.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of theatrical public entertainment, blending elements of wild nature with human artistry and historical decorative styles, all under a bright blue sky.","title":"Trained tiger, tethered by a rope, is one of various live animals featured in the \"Old Milwaukee Days\" circus parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549566","549568","556280","549583","549574","556274","549576","549585","552657","553234","552653","549567","557710","553294","552660","553239"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["float","costume","parade","gold","dancer","glint","artistry","performer","entertainment","spectacle"]}
