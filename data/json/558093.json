{"path":"558093.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene centered around a large body of water, possibly a lake or a slow-flowing river. The image portrays an expansive and well-maintained grassy area in the foreground, stretching towards the water, creating a vibrant green field that contrasts with the darker tones of the water.\n\nThe background features a dense array of trees displaying a mix of autumn colors, including shades of green, yellow, orange, and red. These fall colors suggest the photo was taken in a temperate climate during the autumn season. The reflection of the colorful foliage on the water surface adds a tranquil and picturesque quality to the scene.\n\nAt the edge of the water, on the right side of the image, there are reeds and other aquatic plants growing, which add texture and a sense of the natural ecosystem surrounding the lake.\n\nIn the distance, near the edge of the water, there are several figures that appear to be engaged in activities by the lake. These people seem to be enjoying the outdoor space, contributing a sense of life and leisure to the otherwise calm and still natural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its layering from the grassy foreground through the reflective lake to the vibrant, tree-lined background, offers a compelling depiction of an idyllic and peaceful natural environment.","title":"Couple taking a quiet stroll during a weekday in the fall in Virginia Kendall park which is a part of the Akron, Ohio metropolitan park system.
