{"path":"547193.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures two children running on a textured, plowed field. The children, one dressed in red and the other in green, are roughly in the center of the image, running along a curved dirt path. The ground is uneven and marked by various patterns of ridges and furrows, indicative of recent plowing or farming activity.\n\nThe landscape around them appears barren and vast, extending towards a horizon that meets a clear, cloudless sky. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as it casts long shadows and gives a warm tone to the dirt. There are no visible plants or trees in the immediate area, highlighting the expanse of the worked field.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the children positioned along the curving path, directs the viewer's eye through the scene, emphasizing the expanse and the repetitive texture of the earth. The children's dynamic poses and the openness around them convey a sense of freedom and the simplicity of play in a rustic setting.","title":"Rogers Park on Lake Michigan shore.
