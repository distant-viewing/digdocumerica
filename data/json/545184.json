{"path":"545184.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is a vivid and bustling photograph of a group of people at an outdoor wooden observation or walkway structure, seemingly built into a hillside or cliff. The structure, possibly part of a tourist attraction given its commercial signage, is filled with a diverse assortment of individuals possibly waiting to participate in or returning from an activity.\n\nThe staircase is constructed from wood and includes a railing on the open side which faces a natural, earthy backdrop of hillside with some vegetation. It is sloped and curves out of sight at both ends, suggesting it leads to different levels or areas of the attraction.\n\nThe photo captures a variety of people wearing casual and outdoor clothing typical of a sightseeing atmosphere, including jackets, hats, and a mix of 70s-style attire. The crowd appears engaged and lively, with some looking at the camera, others deep in conversation, while few are preparing to ascend or descend the stairs. Noteworthy is a child in the center, wearing a green jacket and jeans, who holds a camera – capturing the moment or shooting a scenic view.\n\nThere are wordings on the wall of the structure reading “TROUT”, “NO FISHING PLEASE”, and “GASPERS”, indicating the place might be close to a water body where trout fishing is popular but perhaps restricted in this area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of a leisurely day out, likely during a weekend or holiday, with people of all ages gathered to explore or enjoy the natural surroundings provided by this venue.","title":"Crowd waits to rent boats","placename":"Depoe Bay (Or.)","location":"Depoe Bay, Oregon","nn1":["551712","546529","549536","557985","551929","549537","544483","553963","549314","553965","544529","557178","553159","556165","554491","549467"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["attraction","hillside","fishing","sightseeing","holiday","70","jacket","sight","venue","people"]}
