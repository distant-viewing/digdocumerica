{"path":"549678.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures two young women dressed in similar outfits consisting of white blouses, dark skirts, and matching white hats adorned with a circular insignia. The woman on the left is smiling while looking slightly towards her right, revealing a joyful facial expression. The woman on the right, who appears more serious or focused, is holding what looks like a small book or notepad in her right hand and gesturing with her left hand, possibly explaining something. Her attention is directed towards something out of the frame.\n\nBoth women are accessorized with simple jewelry; the woman on the left wears stud earrings and a bracelet, while the woman on the right sports a watch and multiple bracelets on her left wrist. They both have long hair, with the left woman's hair lightly curled and falling over her shoulders.\n\nThe background of the image is softly out of focus but shows a street scene with automobiles parked along the side, indicating an urban setting. The faded colors and setting suggest a time period that could be from the 1970s or 1980s, based on the style of clothing and cars. This setting adds a dynamic undertone to the photograph, suggesting a day of activity or an event in which these women are participants or attendees.","title":"Vienna's pedestrian-only zones are guarded by police women.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551937","551436","555896","551466","549290","556176","551817","557039","556281","545231","547379","551923","543036","554909","553709","553164"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","bracelet","undertone","insignia","jewelry","earring","wrist","watch","hair","attendee"]}
