{"path":"554208.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photo depicts a traditional white church situated in a grassy setting under a clear blue sky. The church features a prominent, steeply pitched roof and a sharp, pointed steeple with a cross at the top, characteristic of Christian religious architecture. The church's main body is rectangular with an extension on the side that possibly functions as additional seating or utilities space. At the front, there are steps leading to two visible doors under the steeple.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a well-maintained lawn with several blooming rose bushes and at least one visible gravestone, suggesting this might be a churchyard with a small cemetery. To the left foreground, there's a shadow cast by a nearby tree not fully visible in the frame, which adds a natural, serene element to the setting.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere conveyed is peaceful and tranquil, typical of a rural religious community. The photograph composition focuses on placing the church slightly off-center while using the roses and grave marker to add depth and context to the foreground.","title":"St. Pietro's Lutheran Church and graveyard at Grygla.
