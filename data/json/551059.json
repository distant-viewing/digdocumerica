{"path":"551059.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, likely a factory, located in a valley surrounded by forested hills. The most prominent feature of the image is a thick plume of white smoke ascending from a tall smokestack against a backdrop of dense, green foliage. The factory has multiple buildings, which are utilitarian in design, painted in light gray, and feature various structural elements such as roofs at different levels, visible air ducts, and other industrial fittings.\n\nThe foreground of the image is partially obscured by the dark silhouette of tree leaves, adding a natural frame to the industrial scene. This contrast between nature and industrial activity is striking, emphasizing the intrusion of manufacturing processes into a natural landscape. The atmosphere appears slightly hazy, possibly due to the moisture or smoke in the air, which gives the surrounding forest a mystic quality, further enhancing the visual impact of the smoke emission. The overall composition elicits a narrative about industrial impact on natural environments, captured from a perspective that balances both elements within the frame.","title":"Union carbide's ferroAlloy plant seen from across the kanawha river at montgomery heights","placename":"Charleston (W.
