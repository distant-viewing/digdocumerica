{"path":"557831.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a vehicle service station or a similar location. In the image, two individuals, a man and a woman, are interacting beside a white car. The man is dressed in a white shirt and glasses, observing the woman pensively as she writes or fills out a form on a clipboard. The woman wears a light blue uniform shirt with a name badge and dark pants, indicating her role possibly as an attendant or service person.\n\nThe backdrop shows the interior of a garage or service area which seems partially open to the outdoors, observed on the left side of the frame, and a visible 'Service' sign within what appears to be an open bay of the garage. The lighting is bright, suggestive of a sunny day.\n\nThe car is notable for its clean and well-maintained appearance, with reflections visible on its glossy surface. An American flag is affixed to the window, adding a patriotic touch to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures an everyday interaction, likely related to car maintenance or service, set against the functional environment of a garage. The expressions and body language suggest a professional exchange taking place, highlighting both service and customer roles.","title":"Employee at the Hamilton County auto emission inspection station at Newtown, Ohio.
