{"path":"554529.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In this photograph, a serene woodland scene is captured featuring a calm body of freshwater positioned in the foreground. The water reflects small fragments of the sky and surrounding foliage, subtly echoing the clear blue sky above. Bordering the lake, lush greenery including bushes and undergrowth abounds, with a few small patches of red-brown earth visible where the vegetation is thinner.\n\nProminently, the background is dominated by dense growth of conifer trees, mostly evergreens, which rise uniformly in height and create a continuous line against the sky. The trees' dark green needles contrast strikingly with the bright blue of the sky, devoid of clouds and suggesting a sunny day.\n\nThere are no people or man-made structures visible in the scene, underscoring its natural and untouched character. The overall composition of the image, with water at the base, followed by lush greenery and capped by towering trees and open sky, suggests a peaceful, isolated setting typical of a forested area likely aimed at highlighting the beauty of an untouched natural environment. The lighting is ample and bright, indicating the photograph was taken during the day under clear conditions.","title":"Typical riverbank vegetation in the southwestern part of the Adirondack Forest Preserve, on the north branch of the moose river, near Old Forge, New York.
