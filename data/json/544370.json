{"path":"544370.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene with a vintage blue truck parked in what appears to be a dusty, open outdoor lot. The truck has a streamlined, mid-20th-century design, characteristic of vehicles from the 1950s or early 1960s. On the side of the truck, there's an advertisement for \"Rand Land Car Wash\" located in Page, Arizona, offering services for trucks, boats, trailers, and campers, including mechanical bays available by the hour or on a monthly basis.\n\nIn front of the truck, there are two wooden poles with signs attached to them providing various pieces of information. One sign is an arrow labeled \"RODEO\" pointing towards the left, suggesting that a rodeo event might be taking place nearby. The other sign advertises \"Stores for Lease\" with a note that they will build to suit tenants, providing contact phone numbers for Page and Flagstaff.\n\nThe truck is positioned under a clear blue sky with barely any clouds, indicating a sunny day, and the ground is largely barren and sandy, indicative of the arid environments typical of the American Southwest. The elements in the image, such as the truck's vintage style and the rustic signs, contribute to an overall old-fashioned, rugged American ambiance.","title":"Arizona--near Page","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544399","544767","555817","548980","544720","542803","546104","544061","548275","552513","544641","557667","544292","554924","552087","555875"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","sign","campers","basis","1950","arrow","vintage","contact","phone","dusty"]}
