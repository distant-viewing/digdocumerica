{"path":"548542.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows a vibrant aquatic scene featuring a group of ducks, primarily focused on an Asian male duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) up-close in the foreground. The duck appears in motion, capturing a dynamic moment with its head turned slightly to the side, possibly searching for food or interacting with its surroundings. Its distinctive markings and bright plumage, combining deep reds and browns with hints of white, are prominent.\n\nIn the background, there is a small floating objectâ€”identifiable as a duck with its head peeking out from the water surface. The duck seems to be in a relatively still posture compared to the foreground duck, adding a calm contrast to the movement depicted in the front.\n\nThe water surface is laden with green aquatic plants and some debris, indicating a possibly rich, though somewhat cluttered, natural habitat. This dense layer of vegetation in the water could suggest a thriving ecosystem, but also highlights potential challenges like pollution, as evinced by visible waste materials.\n\nThe lighting is natural, with what appears to be sunlight illuminating the scene, enhancing the vibrancy of the ducks' plumage and creating a play of light and shadow that adds depth to the visual composition. The overall effect is a vivid capture of wildlife in their natural aquatic environment, characterized by movement, color, and a hint of human impact.","title":"Souvenir seashells for sale at the southernmost point of the United States","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["552993","543663","552221","555551","551501","551377","553408","558092","543918","547753","557490","557121","557122","553346","557126","544838"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","plumage","head","movement","capture","hint","challenge","close","vibrancy","marking"]}
