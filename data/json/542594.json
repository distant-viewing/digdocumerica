{"path":"542594.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene with a waterfall cascading down a rocky terrain. The waterfall, partially nestled among thick green vegetation, flows through multiple tiers, creating small pools at each level before descending further. The backdrop features rugged, smooth stone surfaces, suggesting a mountainous or highland environment. Dense forest of tall coniferous trees frames the waterfall, enhancing the sense of seclusion and wilderness.\n\nOf distinct interest, at the upper right part of the rockface, there appears to be a structure resembling a small building or shelter, perhaps a cabin or an observation point, integrated into the landscape. This adds a hint of human element to the otherwise natural scene, indicating the area might be accessible or monitored for conservation or tourism purposes.\n\nThe light in the image suggests midday, with clear skies as indicated by the bright lighting and shadows cast on the rocks, enhancing the textural details of the environment. The overall composition strikes an impressive balance between rugged natural beauty and subtle human presence, inviting contemplation of nature's scale and the interaction between man-made structures and the environment.","title":"California--Big Creek","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["550979","554409","554408","545878","558087","555220","555073","557820","544348","545839","542698","548021","542699","544344","545874","557745"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","tourism","tier","seclusion","shelter","conservation","midday","balance","observation","pool"]}
