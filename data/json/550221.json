{"path":"550221.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene focused on a variety of activities near a body of water. In the foreground on the left side, there is a small motorboat on the water carrying several individuals: a man wearing a blue cap steering the boat, and two others, one of whom is a blond lady looking towards the camera. The boat is a vibrant blue and white, with a registration mark visible on its side.\n\nIn the background central to the image, there are people scattered along a rocky breakwater or jetty. Some are standing and looking out to the water, and others appear to be engaged in fishing or similar leisure activities. The people vary in age, and are dressed in casual clothing suitable for a day outdoors.\n\nTo the right and far across the water, there is a significant visual element of industrial activity. A large vessel or structure is emitting substantial smoke which is billowing into the sky, creating a sharp contrast with the clear day.\n\nThe overall setting seems to be a recreational area near an industrial port, showcasing a blend of leisure activities (boating and fishing) close to an industrial backdrop. The serene atmosphere of the recreational activities contrasts with the environmental impact suggested by the smoke in the background. The photograph plays with a juxtaposition of nature, leisure, and industrial activity.","title":"Smoking freighter (in background) awaits permission to use launch ramp.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552051","543156","550941","543155","550870","550937","546079","552139","544260","549934","546145","546892","551959","546063","552347","547033"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["leisure","fishing","breakwater","registration","smoke","jetty","activity","motorboat","boat","other"]}
