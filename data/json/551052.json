{"path":"551052.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts a large-scale industrial scene dominated by a massive, billowing cloud of purple-tinted smoke or steam emerging high into the air. This thick column of smoke appears to originate from a collection of industrial buildings nestled at the base of a mountain or large hill, which fills the background of the image. The facilities include various structures such as buildings with different roof levels, large cylindrical tanks, and stacks, all contributing to the smoke emission. Some machinery and smaller structures can be seen scattered among the larger buildings, suggesting a complex industrial operation.\n\nThe skyline features the silhouette of a densely wooded hill, which looms over the scene, casting the industrial complex in a kind of muted light that adds a somber tone to the photograph. The lighting and color tones of the image are subdued, with a general overcast appearance, lending a sense of haziness that matches the theme of pollution. There is no visible human activity in the photograph, which focuses exclusively on the environmental impact of the industrial setting. It's a powerful representation of industry juxtaposed against nature, portrayed through the dramatic contrast of industrial emissions and natural landscape.","title":"Looking up the kanawha river valley from deep water toward Alloy where smoke from union carbide's ferroAlloy plant rises high into the air","placename":"Charleston (W.
