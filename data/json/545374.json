The man appears to be middle-aged, with short brown hair and is wearing a light-striped, long-sleeved shirt. He is focused on writing with chalk and seems to be explaining or working out concepts, possibly in an academic or research setting.\n\nThe chalkboard is filled with handwritten text and numbers which include various scientific or mathematical terms and statements. For instance, the phrases visible include \"Response number on Requests,\" \"Liver function - Stability - 90days,\" among others, suggesting topics possibly related to biology, medicine, or environmental science.\n\nThe background is a wooden panel wall, commonly found in classrooms or lecture spaces. The setting gives an overall impression of an educational or professional environment, where knowledge-sharing or learning is taking place. The detailed and methodical layout of the chalkboard content indicates a structured lesson or presentation is being carried out.","title":"Dr.  Peter peacock, project director of chess (community health environmental surveillance studies) which measures effects of pollution on area residents","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["555392","546285","552368","548893","558214","555249","552377","555280","555391","557317","555256","556573","545002","546281","552391","543834"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["number","concept","topic","biology","handwritten","instance","science","statement","classroom","stability"]}
