{"path":"554829.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image captures a rural or semi-industrialized landscape, mainly featuring a large strip mining operation in the background, characterized by noticeable earth disturbances and heavy machinery, possibly a dragline excavator, which stands tall against the somewhat barren horizon. This machinery is situated on a massive pile of earth or spoil heap, suggesting ongoing mining activities.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple winding roads intertwine, surrounded by patches of green grass and sporadic shrubbery. These roads appear to be less traveled, with only a couple of visible vehicles, which underscores the probable isolation or low traffic nature of the area. Alongside the roads, there are several wooden utility poles, each carrying power lines stretching across the scene and following the road's curvature, suggesting electricity supply to nearby areas or the mine itself.\n\nThe landscape beyond the immediate mining area and roads is gently undulating, with patches of trees and greenery that add a slight contrast to the otherwise disrupted land. The overall atmosphere and color tone of the image have a muted quality, perhaps indicative of the season or the time of day. The background also shows a clear sky with a hint of gradient, likely during early morning or late afternoon hours, providing a calm yet industrial ambiance to the photograph.","title":"The \"silver spade,\" one of the larger shovels owned by the hanna coal company, dominates the horizon at route 9, near Cadiz Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["554765","554769","555590","554764","554836","554816","554812","555588","544139","555633","552416","554811","555634","543857","554815","554826"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","roads","supply","earth","curvature","machinery","electricity","excavator","mine","heap"]}
