{"path":"547843.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a train running along a track that extends over a body of water, likely a river or a coastal inlet. The train consists of multiple cars, and its front car appears on the left side of the image. The side of each car is embellished with a series of horizontal stripes or ribs. The train moves over a trestle bridge, made visible by the multiple support pillars partially submerged under the water.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a coastal shoreline visible, strewn with sizable rocks and a small amount of debris, including timber. A tall metal fence, topped with barbed wire, runs parallel to the shoreline and the train track, although it doesnâ€™t obstruct the view of the train. The scene suggests a clear day as the sky is bright and has minimal cloud coverage, which casts good natural light over the entire scene.\n\nThe photograph captures a sense of tranquil but industrious movement, combining elements of technology and nature. The resolution and quality suggest it might be a film photograph from an earlier time, judging by the color saturation and graininess typical of older film media.","title":"New York subway is above ground when it crosses Jamaica Bay area.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556759","545378","550966","557962","556857","556029","556009","556058","556769","556111","556106","557965","549131","555749","557967","556837"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["train","film","shoreline","graininess","track","medium","car","inlet","coverage","timber"]}
