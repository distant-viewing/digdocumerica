{"path":"548584.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of joyful expression of a woman in a swimming pool. The woman appears to be middle-aged and is wearing a white chef's hat and a floral-patterned swimsuit with dark shades of blue and purple. She has her eyes closed in a moment of unguarded laughter, creating an infectious sense of happiness.\n\nThe scene around her includes several other people engaged in leisure activities in the pool, though mostly out of focus or partially visible. The water splashes around gently, reflecting the sunlight and intensifying the summery feel of the image. The background is slightly blurred due to the focus on the woman in the foreground, enhancing the spontaneity and candidness of the photograph.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed is one of lighthearted fun and enjoyment, typical of a hot day spent cooling off in a pool amongst friends or community members. The choice of the white hat, uncommon for swimming, adds a quirky and playful element to the image.","title":"Organized daily exercises at the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548583","548550","555649","556295","549103","548549","556293","552012","558144","544339","548585","555891","552702","548113","551093","553449"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pool","swimming","woman","spontaneity","laughter","fun","happiness","intensify","swimsuit","cool"]}
