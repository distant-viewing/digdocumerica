{"path":"555636.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling construction or landfill scene filled with large machinery and activity. In the foreground, there's a red and white dump truck, which appears to be unloading or waiting to be loaded with dirt or debris. On top of this truck, a man stands confidently with his hands at his sides, overseeing the operation or possibly directing the machinery.\n\nTo the immediate right of the truck, a large yellow wheel loader, branded as a \"Pay Loader 950,\" is captured in the middle of an action, lifting a big scoop filled with dirt. The loader is positioned such that its bucket is near the dump truck, suggesting that it is either preparing to unload dirt into the truck or has just done so.\n\nThe setting appears dusty and industrial, with swirling dust partially obscuring the clarity of the scene, lending a gritty texture to the atmosphere. The background is filled with greenery, indicative of a possibly rural or semi-rural setting where such operations might not uncommonly take place alongside natural landscapes.\n\nThroughout, the scene is bathed in the bright light of what seems to be a sunny day, casting stark shadows and highlighting the dusty air, the rugged tires of the loader, and the practical work attire of the individual standing on the truck.","title":"Coal company equipment is used to load trucks at a strip mining site west of Barnesville, Ohio, in the southeastern part of the state.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["547922","549956","555638","542539","542538","550270","547232","544138","547243","549740","554837","550266","553378","544099","546257","544083"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["loader","truck","unload","dump","dirt","scoop","fill","machinery","do","landfill"]}
