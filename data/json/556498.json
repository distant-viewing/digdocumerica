{"path":"556498.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In this photograph, an older woman is depicted sitting on a ledge of what appears to be a semi-enclosed or sheltered outdoor area. She has short, curly hair, wears glasses, and is dressed in a floral-print blouse layered over a bright, orange-yellow T-shirt, paired with navy blue trousers. Her feet are clad in red socks and black loafers. Her arms are crossed, and she has a contemplative or reserved expression on her face.\n\nBeside her and filling much of the lower right corner of the frame are numerous large, gray plastic containers with red caps, likely used for storing liquids (possibly water or chemicals). A dilapidated brown door or wall, showing signs of wear and sun fading, forms the background behind her. The overall setting suggests a utilitarian or work-oriented environment, subtly hinting at rural or semi-rural life. The mood is quiet and somewhat somber, focusing on everyday life and the lived experience of the individual featured.","title":"Alice thompson, Besoco, West Virginia, is shown with milk bottles her neighbors furnish her water with after her water lines were cut off.
