{"path":"542566.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a perspective view along a fence line, which features a chain-link fence topped with coils of barbed wire. The focus is on sections of the fence where there are circular signs with the text “CHEMAGRO” visible. Alongside some of the signs, cylindrical containers, possibly holding chemicals or pesticides, labeled with the same “CHEMAGRO” branding, are stacked within the confines of the fenced area.\n\nThe setting appears industrial or agricultural, given the containing and labeling of commercial products. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting it might be a sunny day. The composition cleverly uses the fence to guide the viewer's eye along the pathway that it encloses, creating a feeling of depth and leading towards a vanishing point in the background. The cylindrical barrels and signs disrupt the uniformity of the fence pattern, adding interest and focus points in the image. The ground within the enclosed area is not clearly visible but seems to be made of concrete or another solid surface.","title":"Chemical containers stored behind fence.
