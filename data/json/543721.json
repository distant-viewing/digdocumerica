{"path":"543721.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a rugged and dramatic natural landscape, likely in a mountainous area. The focal point of the image is a massive rockslide or debris flow cascading down the side of a steep hill or mountain. The heap of rocks appears somewhat fresh, indicating a relatively recent geological event.\n\nIn the foreground, a stream or small river composed of similar rocky debris flows from the right to the left of the frame. The water in the stream is murky and partially obscured by the abundant rocks and pebbles covering its bed. Sparse vegetation, including a few grasses and shrubs, can be seen edging the stream, providing a bit of greenery against the predominantly rocky terrain.\n\nThe middle ground shows the continuation of the rocky landscape, extending up towards the hillside. This part of the image reveals layers and variations in rock composition, with striations and different colorations suggesting diverse geological processes at work.\n\nIn the background, the higher elevation of the hill or mountain hosts a thin line of coniferous trees along the ridgeline, contrasting with the barren rock below. The sky above the mountain is somewhat overcast, with dark clouds suggesting a moody or stormy weather condition looming overhead.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a sense of desolation and the raw power of natural geological activity, providing a stark, almost otherworldly view of the earthâ€™s changing surface.","title":"Colorado Fuel and Iron Company feldspar mine on Monarch Pass.
