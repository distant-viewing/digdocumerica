{"path":"550120.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features an ornate, Victorian-style house characterized by its detailed architectural elements. The house is constructed with dark brickwork, and the roof includes several decorative gables and a central circular window which adds to the grandeur of the facade. The house also features white-framed windows, enhancing the contrast against the dark bricks.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a porch that spans the width of the house, supported by elegant white columns with intricate lace-like balustrades that create a delicate appearance against the robust structure of the house. On the porch, there are three people seated on lawn chairs, casually dressed suggesting a warm day. They seem to be engaged in a relaxed conversation, enjoying the outdoors.\n\nLeading up to the porch, a set of concrete steps flanked by an overgrown grass lawn and a low fence frames the entrance. The house shows signs of wear and mild disrepair, indicated by the slightly unkempt aspect of the lawn and some visible aging of the building materials, adding a lived-in and historical feel to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and gives a glimpse into a leisurely moment in a residential setting, possibly capturing everyday life in a historical or older neighborhood.","title":"Well maintained old Victorian house at 40th and Cedar streets.
