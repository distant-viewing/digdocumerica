{"path":"546236.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene, predominantly showcasing elements of a lumber mill or processing facility. In the foreground, there is a large pile of scattered wood and logs, showing signs of processing such as being cut to different lengths and stripped of bark. The middle ground consists of industrial machinery and structures, which include a tall, prominent white smokestack emitting no visible emissions. Beside it, there are other smaller industrial buildings and silos, likely part of the mill's operational infrastructure. There are numerous cables, possibly electrical or for material handling, running around and between these structures.\n\nThe background is formed by a picturesque landscape with a hill covered in sparse vegetation, under a wide, mostly clear sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds. This setting indicates the facility might be located in a rural or semi-rural area, designed to minimize its impact on the natural surroundings.\n\nThe overall composition stresses the contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment, depicted under a vivid and expansive sky, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light with shadows that are not overly harsh or pronounced.","title":"Cedar mill, Leakey's only industry","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["545260","543749","545256","557374","545910","543011","550340","543009","550876","550343","552190","554630","550349","550350","555617","550716"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["mill","processing","minimize","stress","lumber","pronounce","facility","handling","silo","cable"]}
