{"path":"545991.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural wetland scene, possibly taken during late afternoon given the golden hue of the light and long shadows. The primary focus is a body of water that reflects a gentle ripple, suggesting a light breeze. In and above the water, several birds, which appear to be seagulls, are engaged in various activities; one is flying just above the surface, showcasing its broad wings, another is in the act of landing or possibly catching prey, and a third sits tranquilly on the water.\n\nThe background features a thick stretch of tall, dense reeds and grasses extending horizontally across the image. These plants are lush and colored in shades of golden-brown and green, hinting at either a seasonal change or the natural coloration of a wetland habitat. Above this natural barrier, the sky presents a clear, pale blue without clouds, contributing to the overall calm and isolated feel of the landscape.\n\nThe composition of the image uses a natural horizon line created by the meeting of the water and the reeds, further emphasizing the horizontal expanse of the wetlands. The placement of the birds and their reflection in the water adds a dynamic element to an otherwise still and peaceful vista. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of quietude and the unspoiled beauty of a natural ecosystem at a moment of daily animal activity.","title":"Wildlife in the marshlands along the Freeport Sulphur Co.'s pipeline canal","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544838","544620","547489","550388","547589","547744","545967","547488","547547","544683","548729","547630","553856","557121","550341","552910"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wetland","reed","bird","landing","seagull","water","meeting","vista","quietude","act"]}
