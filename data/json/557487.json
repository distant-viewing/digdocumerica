{"path":"557487.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a dandelion flower. The flower is captured in intricate detail, emphasizing its delicate structure and vibrant texture. It has numerous thin, spiky petals radiating outward from the center, which holds a dense cluster of stamens and pistils, rendering a sense of lushness and intricate biological design. The petals exhibit a gradient of colors, from a brighter yellow at the tips to a more subdued hue near the center, adding depth and contrast to the visual. The background of the image is deeply out of focus, appearing as a plain, dark, almost black void that enhances the flower's brightness and makes it the sole point of visual interest in the frame. This composition effectively isolates the dandelion, highlighting its natural beauty and complexity.","title":"Closeup of a flower growing at buena vista lagoon.  One of the last lagoons in southern California, it suffers from erosion septic tank seePage and other ills.  The body of water is an excellent bird refuge, but is becoming surrounded by freeways and developments.  Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900.
