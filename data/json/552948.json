{"path":"552948.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of six individuals, primarily young adults, engaged in a cleanup activity in an outdoor setting. The scene is lush and green, pointing to a semi-rural or natural environment. All six are actively participating in gathering debris and waste, placing it into large black plastic garbage bags.\n\nRegarding their attire, the individuals wear casual clothing suitable for outdoor work: jeans, t-shirts, and casual shirts predominantly. Some of them wear wristwatches and belts, accessories typical for an era that suggests the 1970s or 1980s based on the style of clothes and hair.\n\nThe background showcases dense greenery, including tall trees and an abundance of shrubs or brushes under a slightly overcast sky. This setting suggests the activity takes place during a warmer season. The focus is on environmental conservation or a community clean-up drive.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of active participation and cooperation among the group, emphasizing environmental care and teamwork.","title":"Young people filling bags with litter.
