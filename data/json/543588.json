{"path":"543588.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic, outdoor scene involving a person engaged in activity near an old building and a truck. The setting is a wooded area, with tall pine trees visible in the background that contribute to a serene natural environment. The lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and the soft glow of sunlight.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a huge pile of chopped firewood neatly stacked against the side of a brown, two-story building, which appears to be a cabin or a small lodge. The architecture of the building is simple and practical, with visible windows and what looks like a metal chimney pipe extending from the roof.\n\nTo the right, a person is actively loading or unloading firewood into or from the bed of an older model, two-tone pickup truck. The truck, primarily white with a contrasting trim, is parked next to the woodpile. The person, dressed casually in blue jeans and a dark shirt, is caught mid-motion, contributing to the dynamic feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and elements in the image convey a sense of rural life and the chores associated with preparation for colder seasons, possibly evoking themes of self-sufficiency and the simplicity of country living. The presence of the truck and the large quantity of firewood suggests that this activity is a significant aspect of daily life in this setting.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["554412","554411","544767","554413","555454","554942","552583","555470","554694","547159","542609","555154","558315","542596","553648","553631"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["truck","person","lodge","chop","self","quantity","country","unload","pickup","pine"]}
