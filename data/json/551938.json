{"path":"551938.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a protest scene in front of a large commercial building. Signage on the building indicates it's a \"Jewel Food Store\" flanked by an \"Osco Drug\" outlet. The architecture is typical of mid-20th century commercial design with large, bold lettering, flat roofs, and a straightforward fa√ßade.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of protesters is assembled across a street. They are holding large banners that read \"BOYCOTT Jewel Osco\" and other partially obscured messages advocating for boycotts. The presence of these banners suggests that the group is protesting against the practices or policies of the stores shown. Among the protesters, a variety of individuals can be seen, suggesting a diverse group in terms of age and gender.\n\nAdding a further layer of interest to the scene, several vintage-style motorcycles and scooters, including one with an attached sidecar, are parked in front of the protesters, possibly belonging to some of them. These prominent vintage vehicles lend an era-specific feel to the photograph.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is one of organized dissent, highlighted by the act of protest in a public, urban setting against corporate entities. The presence of flags in the image showcases a likely sense of unity or solidarity among the protesters.","title":"Grape/lettuce boycotters picket the jewel food store","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551939","551968","545253","553143","553140","556256","553237","556255","547205","551383","551936","549806","543032","546993","550142","546743"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["protest","store","group","entity","outlet","unity","gender","assemble","vintage","motorcycle"]}
