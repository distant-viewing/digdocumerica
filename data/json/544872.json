{"path":"544872.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense stand of aspen trees. The trees are tall, slender, and display characteristic white bark with black knots and scars, which are typical markings for this species. The forest floor is lightly covered with fallen branches, leaves, and some undergrowth, indicative of a natural woodland area. The trees are closely spaced, suggesting a relatively young or regenerating area of the forest. The image captures a perspective looking slightly upwards through the trees, which enhances the vertical lines formed by the trunks and creates a dense, textured look. The lighting appears to be soft, likely due to an overcast sky or the canopy overhead, casting an even light across the scene without harsh shadows. The colors in the image mostly consist of the grays and browns of the tree bark and the muted greens and browns of the forest floor, conveying a serene and natural woodland environment.","title":"Forest of Aspens at Owl Creek Pass","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["552694","544909","555117","555121","542725","554528","553574","555108","555096","546947","554967","543442","555114","554990","550603","554984"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["woodland","bark","forest","floor","brown","tree","undergrowth","stand","marking","specie"]}
