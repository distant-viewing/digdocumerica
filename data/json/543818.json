{"path":"543818.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil, yet somewhat industrial landscape featuring a large pond with turquoise-blue water surrounded by a rugged, mountainous backdrop. The pond is outlined by stony shores that exhibit a mixture of sand and small to medium-sized rocks. On the left side of the image, the terrain gently slopes into the water, forming a natural shoreline.\n\nIn the distance, on the far side of the pond, there is a small industrial settlement. A number of rectangular, presumably metal or wooden buildings, which appear somewhat dilapidated, are scattered across the area. The structures and the scattered debris around them suggest this might be a mining camp or a similar industrial operation. There are no visible figures or animals, enhancing a sense of isolation and the focus on the interaction between nature and human activity.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is characterized by steep, barren hills devoid of significant vegetation, indicating either a high altitude environment or the aftermath of industrial impact. The sky above is mostly clear with a few fluffy, white clouds, suggesting a fair weather day.\n\nOverall, the scene exudes a sense of quiet resilience and the stark juxtaposition between the natural beauty of the pond and the intrusive, albeit small-scale, human development on the landscape.","title":"Settling pond from the now-closed Rico-Argentine Sulphuric Acid Mill.
