{"path":"546142.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic outdoor scene featuring a small log-built structure with a slanted, shingled roof. The structure stands in a grassy field and appears simplistic in architecture, primarily serving as a shelter for materials or perhaps animals. To the left of the structure, there is an old, rusty plow with metal wheels, partially obscured by tall grass, suggesting it hasn't been used in quite some time.\n\nTo the right, partially under the shelter, is an old-fashioned wooden wagon with large, spoked wheels. It contains what appears to be either logs or large stones, indicating it might have been used for farming or construction in a bygone era. The wagon, exposed to elements under the partial cover of the shelter's roof, contributes to the antique feel of the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a lush, tree-lined landscape with a gentle hill, indicating that this area is in a valley or a similarly sheltered location. The blue sky overhead is clear, suggesting a fine weather day when the photograph was taken.\n\nCollectively, the elements in this photograph—a log shelter, an old plow, and a wooden wagon—evoke a sense of rural life from the past, most likely centered around farming and agricultural activities. The surrounding landscape and bright weather add a serene and timeless quality to the scene.","title":"Buzzard's roost schoolhouse dates back to 1879.
