{"path":"542891.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and picturesque scene on a beach at sunset. The image is taken in silhouette, primarily showcasing a horse-drawn carriage riding along the shoreline. The horse and carriage are in motion, kicking up sprays of water from the shallow waves as they trot along the wet sand.\n\nThe silhouette of at least one person is visible riding in the carriage, a figure made more striking against the backdrop of the setting sun. The sun, positioned low on the horizon, casts a warm, golden glow, which illuminates the horizon in hues of deep orange and yellow.\n\nThe sky above the horizon transitions from a warm golden color near the sun to darker shades of blue and purple as it stretches upward. The upper portion of the sky displays a gradient as the day fades into twilight.\n\nThe beach itself is relatively featureless in detail due to the silhouette style of the photograph, with the focus being on the interaction between the light, the water, and the moving carriage. The composition of the photo, with its strong backlighting and contrast between light and dark, evokes a sense of calm and mystery, emphasizing the tranquility and beauty of a quiet beachscape at dusk. The scratches and specks apparent in the photo add a vintage or timeless quality to the image.","title":"Foggy morning","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["543014","542800","542885","542806","547479","554075","550288","542966","543146","542956","547624","542810","548222","542890","557509","557186"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["carriage","riding","horse","sun","silhouette","beach","horizon","kick","scratch","backlighting"]}
