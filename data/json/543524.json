{"path":"543524.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene at a water treatment facility or a similar type of industrial setting. The main focus is a large circular concrete water basin filled with still water that reflects the clouds in the sky above. The striking reflection adds a sense of depth and tranquility to the image.\n\nAround the basin, thereâ€™s a curved walkway enclosed by metal railings, and several poles, possibly lampposts, line the edge of the walkway. In the background, a dense forest of tall, slender trees can be seen, which suggests the facility is located in a rural or semi-rural area. Beyond the trees, mountain peaks dusted with snow rise against the sky, enhancing the natural beauty and secluded feel of the location.\n\nThe sky is partially cloudy, suggesting a dynamic weather pattern, and the overall lighting in the photograph is soft, likely indicative of either early morning or late afternoon. The facility itself includes some visible infrastructure like pipelines and a building with a flat, angular roof on the left side, which might house operational equipment or offices.\n\nOverall, the composition balances industrial human-made elements and the natural environment, creating a compelling and picturesque setting.","title":"Water treatment plant","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552984","549635","543568","543573","543570","542982","552040","547568","543572","549636","543571","557249","546899","548151","542979","542987"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["basin","walkway","facility","lamppost","pipeline","treatment","office","railing","peak","snow"]}
