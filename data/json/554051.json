{"path":"554051.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases an elderly woman, standing outdoors, possibly in a rural or agricultural setting. She is wearing large, traditional attire that includes a broad-rimmed, woven hat decorated with a blue and white fabric that hangs down protecting her neck and shoulders from sun exposure. Her clothing consists of a long-sleeved, light grey or taupe robe-like garment, which is practical and comfortable for outdoor work.\n\nThe woman is standing with her arms crossed, suggesting a moment of rest or contemplation. She holds a light brown paper bag under one arm, and there is a noticeable strap over her shoulder, which might be attached to another item not fully visible in the frame. Her facial expression is serene, reflecting experience and perhaps a connection to the environment around her.\n\nThe background is quite muted and out of focus, emphasizing the subject. It appears to be an open field with soil and remnants of harvested or tilled crops, creating a sense of space and rural life. The lighting is soft and natural, indicating either an overcast sky or diffused sunlight, contributing to the calm and gentle atmosphere of the scene. The focus and composition of the photograph draw the viewer’s attention primarily to the woman’s facial expression and the textures of her clothing and the natural environment surrounding her.","title":"Sugarcane worker in bonnet of a kind customarily worn by the japanese who labored here a quarter of a century earlier workers are now mostly filipinos","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["543864","555530","557157","547385","551439","544321","557039","556487","544311","547281","554923","556594","552398","558319","544404","543853"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["shoulder","arm","woman","robe","till","clothing","rim","strap","garment","harvest"]}
