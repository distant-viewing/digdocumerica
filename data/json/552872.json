{"path":"552872.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of an older man, seemingly taken outdoors during daylight. The man has a robust build and mature features, including curly, graying hair and a noteworthy, solemn expression. He has a ruddy complexion with visible signs of aging such as wrinkles and sunspots. His eyes look directly at the camera, conveying a sense of intensity or contemplation.\n\nHe is wearing a collared, button-up shirt with vertical stripes in various shades of blue, gray, and white, which adds a casual yet neat appearance. The shirt is slightly unbuttoned at the top, suggesting a relaxed setting.\n\nThe background is overexposed and thus appears almost entirely white, providing no additional context or distractions from the subject's facial expression and upper body. This compositional choice places full focus on the man, highlighting his facial features and expression.","title":"Lake borgne oysterman","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["556452","556563","543701","552871","557035","552103","554846","547179","553055","557144","556443","547282","557648","548616","556540","542784"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["expression","unbutton","complexion","distraction","wrinkle","choice","aging","intensity","button","man"]}
