{"path":"553810.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image captures an expansive agricultural field covered densely with tall, ripe wheat under a clear sky. The wheat bears a golden-brown hue, indicating it is ready for harvesting. Each stalk is slightly bending under the weight of the grains, and the field is unbroken in its uniformity, stretching across a large area.\n\nIn the background, a panoramic mountain range can be seen, which adds a dramatic backdrop to the otherwise flat landscape. The mountains appear rugged and are faintly bluish in color, suggesting they are some distance away. The sky above is a deep blue with minimal cloud cover, emphasizing the vastness and open nature of the scene.\n\nThe photograph is taken during daytime, as indicated by the abundant daylight and the distinct shadows cast on the ground. The light afternoon or early evening sun enriches the colors of the wheat field and highlights the texture of the wheat stalks. This serene rural setting does not show any human activity or man-made structures, focusing solely on the natural beauty and agricultural significance of the scene.","title":"Farm near Thatcher.
