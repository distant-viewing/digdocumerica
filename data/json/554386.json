{"path":"554386.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photo captures a scene from what appears to be an expo or trade show. Most notably, the setting features a large, curved archway with the words \"WONDERFUL WORLD OF COLOUR\" emblazoned across it in bold, white letters against a red background. This overarching banner sets a vibrant, lively mood. Beneath the archway, red and white striped vertical banners and panels enhance this colorful display.\n\nThe central figure in the photo is a woman standing in what seems to be a small stage or presentation area. She is wearing a white, spaghetti strap gown that is elegant and elaborate, with layers of ruffled fabric, possibly feathers or a similar fluffy material, from the waist down. The woman is holding a microphone and appears to be either singing or speaking.\n\nThe area around her includes stylish, modern furnishings. A luxurious red chair with a contemporary design is visible alongside a sleek, white side table. The flooring is carpeted in rich red, complementing the overall color scheme of the setup. The ambience is both stylish and engaging, suggesting an event related to fashion or similarly themed presentations. \n\nThe architectural and design elements in the photograph, such as sharp lines, reflective surfaces, and bold color contrasts, establish a mid-20th-century modern aesthetic, indicative of creative and forward-thinking environments of the time.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554383","554382","554378","556695","554337","545868","543925","554387","556694","556703","543924","551774","556019","553267","552769","551320"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["archway","presentation","banner","gown","singe","furnishing","flooring","microphone","trade","strap"]}
