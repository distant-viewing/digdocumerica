{"path":"555838.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph features a deep blue background, which could be either the sky or a deep body of water. Set against this backdrop are several clusters of what appear to be small, shining particles or objects. The largest cluster, located toward the top-right quadrant of the image, resembles a dispersed, irregular shape with sparkling points varying in intensity and color from bright white to shades of yellow and orange. There are smaller similar clusters toward the bottom of the image, including some solitary specks scattered across the view, shining less brightly than the main cluster but mirroring its color and luminosity.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a sense of depth and scattering in a vast, uniform space, suggesting a celestial or underwater scene involving illuminated particles or objects, perhaps simulating stars, bioluminescent organisms, or reflective materials. The image conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility, emphasized by the distribution of clusters and the expansive background.","title":"Particle of detritus photographed at the Atlantic Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Heavy metals and coliforms are associated with detritus, where they get picked up by small organisms and are transferred along the food chain. Research is now being done on detritus as a means of studying pollution impact.
