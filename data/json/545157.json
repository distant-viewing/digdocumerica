{"path":"545157.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a large fish being held in a human hand. The fish, which appears to be a species of ray or skate given its distinctive snout and flat body, has a shimmering, silvery body with a skin texture that looks somewhat slippery and smooth. Its eye is prominent and bulbous, adding a striking detail to the image.\n\nThe fishâ€™s mouth is open, displaying a unique structure that seems to be adapted for suction feeding or handling prey at the ocean bottom. The human hand gripping the fish has dark-toned skin and is partially visible, supporting the fish from beneath, indicating the fish's considerable size relative to the hand.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dark and offers no distinct details, focusing all attention on the fish itself. The image shows a detailed capture of this marine creature's anatomical features, highlighting its eye, the texture of its skin, and the shape of its mouth and snout.","title":"Close-up of sockeye salmon.
