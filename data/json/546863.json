{"path":"546863.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of individuals engaged in a roadside clean-up activity. The setting is an outdoor area beside a road, showing a grassy verge strewn with litter, such as cans and crumpled papers. There are five people visible, all wearing red jackets, black pants, and sturdy shoes; they look equipped for outdoor work. Each person carries a white bucket, presumably to collect the refuse. They are walking in a line formation, heading away from the viewer towards a parked vehicle at the rear; this vehicle is a large yellow truck with an open back, potentially used for hauling the collected garbage. In the background, the road extends parallel to the scene, with a clear sky and thin trees visible, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The focus and orientation of the subjects suggest a coordinated effort in a communal or volunteer environmental clean-up activity.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550060","551427","543927","552948","550056","548191","544800","551391","548198","542655","551421","545535","552951","545531","543176","550154"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["collect","haul","crumple","orientation","refuse","rear","garbage","can","strew","bucket"]}
