{"path":"552255.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat melancholic scene centered around a body of water, likely a pond or a swamp. The main focus is an old, circular concrete object, resembling a well cover or a similar cylindrical structure, submerged partially in the water. The texture of the concrete is gritty, accentuated by moss and stains that suggest weathering and age.\n\nSprouting from the middle of this concrete structure are tall, thin reeds or grasses, which appear to have grown through an opening in the center. These plants add a touch of life and a bit of a wild, untamed element to the scene.\n\nThe water surrounding the concrete structure is dark and still, reflecting the subdued light and shadows of the surroundings, possibly indicating that this photo was taken during the twilight hours or on an overcast day. The surface of the water is dotted with small debris and leaves, emphasizing a natural and undisturbed environment.\n\nIn the background, the edges of the pond are lined with additional vegetation, mostly obscured by the darkness but contributing to the overall feel of isolation and abandonment. The scene is peaceful yet somber, with strong natural elements and a hint of human presence through the concrete structure.","title":"Discarded tire frames reeds in a backwater of the duwamish river","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["546066","557997","544281","545008","552254","544674","550788","550834","551352","554717","554603","558006","546109","546754","551533","558007"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["pond","sprout","swamp","reed","stain","weathering","opening","darkness","grow","water"]}
