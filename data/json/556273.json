{"path":"556273.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment during a parade or public event, featuring two men riding in an open, classic convertible car. The car is decorated with signs that read \"CONG. RALPH H. METCALFE\" and a phone number \"324-3900\", which suggests it is part of an election campaign or a civic event related to Congressman Ralph H. Metcalfe.\n\nThe man on the left wears a patterned, light-colored jacket over a dark shirt, waving at a crowd with his right hand. The man on the right, who appears to be Metcalfe, wears a white jacket and is also waving to the crowd with a very cheerful demeanor.\n\nAround them, a diverse group of bystanders, including adults and children of various ages, watches and interacts with the procession. The crowd is casual, with some people standing and others seated; their expressions show interest and amusement.\n\nThe scene is set in a city street environment, featuring typical urban architecture of the time, with trees and residential buildings lining the street. The overall atmosphere is lively and festive, typical of a parade or public gathering.","title":"Illinois Congressman Ralph H.
