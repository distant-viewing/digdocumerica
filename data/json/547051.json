{"path":"547051.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an urban night scene, likely from a vehicle perspective on a busy road. The time appears to be either dusk or night based on the sky's deep blue hue and the illuminated lights from the buildings and vehicles.\n\nThe composition of the photo focuses on several high-rise buildings flanking the left and right side of the frame. These skyscrapers, lit by numerous windows glowing softly against the evening sky, create a canyon of luminosity, suggesting a densely populated metropolitan area.\n\nIn the foreground, the traffic is composed of various vehicles, including a prominent vintage car, possibly from the 1960s or 70s, noticeable due to its unique tail lights and body shape. The taillights of this car and others glow brightly, casting red light onto the wet road, hinting at recent rain.\n\nThe photograph has a motion blur effect, particularly noticeable with the moving car on the right-hand side of the frame, conveying the speed of the busy city life. The street itself is visible with wet surfaces reflecting the car lights, enhancing the atmospheric condition of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a mood of hustle and dynamic urban life, combined with the tranquil yet isolating effect of the towering buildings and the vast night sky.","title":"Evening traffic on Lake Shore Drive","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555446","546744","555418","555425","553845","546684","556681","546575","546739","555406","546610","549543","546644","555782","546591","556983"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["night","car","luminosity","glow","vehicle","light","70","effect","hustle","tail"]}
