{"path":"552289.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"In this photograph, an individual, likely a young man, is engaging in an activity on a muddy tidal flat. He is dressed in outdoor, casual clothing: a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt, darker pants, and sturdy shoes. His pants are visibly muddied at the hems, suggesting that he has been walking through the wet area for some time. The man wears a red backpack slung over one shoulder, and appears focused on a black, glove-like object that he is holding closely for inspection.\n\nThe setting is a wide expanse of tidal flat, with shallow pools of water and scattered clumps of oysters or similar shellfish, evident from their clustered, uneven surfaces and varied coloring. Nearby items include a green bucket and a tool with a red handle, possibly used for prying or collecting oysters.\n\nIn the background, the flat landscape stretches towards a distant shoreline under an overcast sky. The horizon shows a faint view of hills or landforms across the water, contributing to a sense of openness and isolation in the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of exploration or scientific fieldwork, likely related to marine biology or environmental studies given the equipment and the man's focused examination of his surroundings and the collected samples. The image conveys a sense of rugged outdoors activity, enhanced by the muddy terrain and practical attire of the individual.","title":"Jim poth of Seattle shucks and eats oysters on the public tidelands of the hood canal at brinnon, on the east coast of the olympic Peninsula.
