{"path":"550191.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban industrial activity captured in a somewhat hazy atmosphere, suggesting pollution or smog, which is further evidenced by the large billowing clouds of dark smoke in the background. The setting appears to be in an area heavily influenced by industrial outputs, encircled by various buildings that look like factories or power plants. Several large chimneys or stacks are visible, releasing thick smoke high into the air, significantly impacting the quality of the air and possibly the local environment.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is a bridge or overpass where traffic is visible, indicative of a busy urban environment. Vehicles from the 1970s era, including a prominently featured white sedan in the center with a damaged front, alongside a pickup truck and another smaller car, are seen on what looks like a busy road. Visibility is partially reduced due to the air quality, and a slightly overcast sky adds to the murkiness of the scene.\n\nLarge electrical pylons are also visible, stretching into the distance across the image, hinting at the heavy use of electricity in this area. This photograph serves not only as a snapshot of 1970s vehicle styles and city infrastructure but also significantly highlights environmental and industrial pollution issues.","title":"Factory smoke blankets Clark Avenue","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550171","550175","550185","550173","545443","550179","548326","545455","546074","551069","551034","550172","551057","551083","545507","551033"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["air","output","pollution","1970","pylon","smoke","smog","electricity","overpass","pickup"]}
