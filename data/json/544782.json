{"path":"544782.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This aerial photograph features an expansive view of salt evaporation ponds intersected by a network of water channels and roads. The layout is complex, with numerous winding water paths creating a patchwork of variously sized sections throughout the image. \n\nThe ponds are a mix of different shades and colors, mostly in earthy tones ranging from white and gray to streaks of pink and brown, suggesting different stages of salinity or mineral content. Vegetation, appearing as darker green patches, is scattered throughout the vicinity, primarily at the boundaries and along the narrower channels.\n\nThe backdrop of the image includes broad, flat landscapes and a glimpse of a water body running parallel to the horizon. The skies are relatively clear, casting sharp light that enhances the textures and details of the ponds and the surrounding terrains.\n\nThe photo depicts no visible human activity or buildings, emphasizing the area's industrial and perhaps uninhabited nature, focused solely on salt extraction or a related industry. The man-made structures, primarily roads and channels, suggest a well-planned operation designed to manage water flow effectively and maximize the use of space in salt production.","title":"Eastern shore","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["548601","548602","545628","548600","545627","548640","544686","550405","552991","555860","548635","555865","555844","555880","548631","555863"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["salt","channel","pond","patchwork","streak","extraction","mineral","production","water","vicinity"]}
