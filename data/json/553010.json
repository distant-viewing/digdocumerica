{"path":"553010.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a dry, bushy landscape under a bright sky with sparse clouds. In the center of the image, an old car from approximately the 1950s appears abandoned and is in a state of disrepair. The car's paint is teal but heavily faded and chipped, and the vehicle is riddled with bullet holes throughout the body, including the door, roof, and trunk area.\n\nThe car is surrounded by semi-arid vegetation, primarily low bushes and sparse grass, indicative of a dry climate region. There are a few scattered trees in the background that add a bit of depth to the scene. The terrain is mostly flat and covered with dirt and patches of grass.\n\nThis scene evokes a sense of abandonment and decay, highlighting the contrast between man-made objects and the natural environment reclaiming its space. There's no human activity visible in the photograph, emphasizing the solitude and stillness of the location.","title":"Abandoned auto. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
