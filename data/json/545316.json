{"path":"545316.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts an intriguing scene of a young woman sitting inside a yellow car that appears vintage in style, possibly from the 1950s or 1960s. The view is framed through the windshield covered with wire mesh, adding a textured, almost barrier-like effect between the viewer and the subject, enhancing a sense of voyeurism or restricted access.\n\nThe car's interior is somewhat worn, with notable details like a basic gray bench style seat that is slightly dirty and textured fabric that has seen much use. The door of the car is open, indicating either preparation to exit or recent entry.\n\nThe woman, seating in a relaxed, somewhat contemplative posture, has her body turned to the side while her gaze is directed straight ahead, possibly out of the car, suggesting she is either waiting for someone or possibly taking a quiet moment to herself. She appears to be dressed casually, suitable for a warm day, and her expression suggests introspection or mild distress.\n\nBeside her, on the car floor, thereâ€™s an empty bottle, hinting at recent consumption of a beverage, which adds an element of everyday life and personal narrative. The textured, somewhat blurred foreground of the wire mesh dramatically frames the entire scene, offering an artistic quality to the photograph, emphasizing themes of separation and a peek into a private moment.","title":"Teenager in second ward, Chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["556728","557871","557908","546667","557847","546849","557866","557863","548958","557874","545342","557896","557923","556800","545337","552780"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["mesh","car","wire","consumption","distress","1950","restrict","separation","introspection","entry"]}
