{"path":"546148.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting with a focus on a large, dome-shaped building that serves as the central element in the image. The building has a gray, metallic exterior with several features such as vents, small windows, and external supports that provide a robust and functional look.\n\nIn the foreground and around the building, various industrial items and equipment are visible, contributing to the sense of an active work environment. To the left of the frame, horizontally stacked metal pipes create a lead-in line towards the building. These pipes are cylindrical and have a weathered appearance, suggesting heavy usage or exposure to outdoor conditions.\n\nIn front of the dome, there are neatly arranged piles of what appear to be spherical metal objects, possibly used for industrial purposes. These objects are stacked symmetrically and span much of the photograph's width. Next to these, a yellow forklift is positioned, adding a splash of color to the otherwise muted palette. This forklift, which is facing away from the viewer, is apparently in use or ready for operation, emphasizing the ongoing activity in this setting.\n\nTo the right side of the building, a large wooden structure, possibly a storage or shipping container, complements the industrial theme. This structure is tall and has visible slats, allowing a glimpse inside the dark interior.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is one of organization and industry, underscored by a clear sky that suggests an absence of recent outdoor activity or disturbances. The choice of colors, predominantly grays and earth tones, along with the machinery and organized metal objects, reinforces the industrial and utilitarian essence of the scene.","title":"Le tourneau Marathon ammunition plant","placename":"Longview (Tex.)","location":"Longview, Texas","nn1":["546189","546160","545273","557387","556390","545992","557386","542545","546085","557390","552003","546866","546757","542587","546108","542591"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipe","stack","metal","gray","building","slat","vent","choice","objects","dome"]}
