{"path":"557909.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in what appears to be a train station. In the foreground, a man and a woman are engaged in a conversation. The man, slightly left of center, is dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, and has a weathered look with neatly combed dark hair and sideburns. He appears to be listening attentively to the woman standing opposite him.\n\nThe woman, positioned on the right, wears a horizontally striped, sleeveless blue and white top, blue jeans, and is carrying a large, colorful tote bag adorned with what appears to be travel labels. She is holding a piece of paper, perhaps a ticket or a document, which she seems to be discussing with the man.\n\nIn the background, another woman can be seen observing the interaction. She is dressed in a light-colored outfit, adding a visual balance to the scene. The setting is marked by industrial features, including red ceiling pipes and diffuse sunlight filtering through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm glow. This contributes to a vivid, yet somewhat melancholic atmosphere often found in transit locations. The overall composition, including the placement of the figures and the interplay of light and shadow, lends the photo a dynamic yet intimate feel.","title":"Unhappy motorist, right, talks to a city employee at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Since January, 1975, all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and be given a safety check. All other vehicles in the city must undergo only the safety test. The Cincinnati air agency has added four emissions officers to the staff to look for vehicles with visible emissions and outdated stickers.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556678","556089","556830","556706","556648","556041","556042","551482","556092","555966","556054","556680","557898","556091","549897","556827"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["woman","comb","ticket","discuss","placement","listen","transit","document","man","ceiling"]}
