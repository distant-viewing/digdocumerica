{"path":"545522.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The image features a row of modest, one-story houses, possibly a form of low-income housing or workers' quarters. These houses have slanted, gabled roofs with red and brown shingles, and their exterior walls are covered with weather-worn wooden siding, painted in muted colors such as beige, blue, and green.\n\nEach house has a small front porch, several of which are occupied by individuals, likely residents. The people vary in age and are engaged in casual activities, including sitting and talking. The porches are simply constructed with wooden railings, and one can see various household items and decorations around the entryways.\n\nIn the foreground, the area is slightly overgrown with grass and weeds, suggesting somewhat neglected upkeep of the surroundings. A telephone pole stands prominently near the row of houses, and dense trees in the background suggest a semi-rural setting. On the left side of the image, the front end of an older model car, possibly from the 1950s or 1960s, is visible, hinting at the era of the photograph. \n\nOverall, the setting evokes a sense of community and simplicity, albeit marked by signs of economic hardship. The atmosphere is calm, and the presence of people on their porches adds a lively human element to the otherwise still and quiet scene.","title":"In many areas of the city blacks live in substandard housing this is a scene in \"little Korea\", in south Birmingham, a prime example of this continued blight.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["551164","556578","556332","556438","556582","550117","556333","556542","551102","556580","557641","556436","551091","547433","557638","556601"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","hardship","income","quarter","1950","entryway","upkeep","row","telephone"]}
