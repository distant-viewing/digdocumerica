{"path":"543547.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil lakeside setting nestled in a lush forested area. The foreground prominently displays the calm, reflective waters of a lake. On the far shore, a cluster of buildings, probably a lakeside resort or cabins, line the water's edge, with several piers or docks jutting into the lake. These structures appear modest and constructed with materials that blend into the natural surroundings, such as wood.\n\nBehind these buildings, a dense forest of tall coniferous trees rises, giving a vibrant background of greens. This dense treeline serves as a middle ground before giving way to a dramatic, mountainous backdrop, which features high peaks covered in snow, suggesting possibly alpine conditions or a season when higher elevations still retain snow.\n\nAbove, a bright blue sky complements the natural palette, enhancing the serene and pristine atmosphere of the setting. The overall composition of the photograph, with its layering of water, developed land, forest, and mountains, creates a balanced and peaceful scene, suggesting an ideal spot for relaxation and nature enjoyment.","title":"Condominiums on Lake Shore","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["543546","543816","550579","555692","554526","552974","543579","557769","554761","543527","552987","554527","554635","555695","551207","554529"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lakeside","forest","snow","layering","lake","treeline","retain","resort","jut","elevation"]}
