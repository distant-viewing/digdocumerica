{"path":"548464.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a juxtaposition of a serene, leisurely scene in the foreground and a symbol of technology and travel in the background. In the foreground, there is a grassy field where a couple is seen enjoying a relaxed moment together. The man is lying on his back with his head resting on a small bag, possibly a backpack, while the woman, sitting beside him, is leaning over him, seemingly engaged in a conversation or a gentle interaction. They are casually dressed suited for a warm day outdoors, with the man in shorts and the woman in a sleeveless top and shorts.\n\nIn the sharply contrasting background, slightly out of focus, are two large aircraft, indicating proximity to an airport. These planes seem to be either taxiing on the runway or parked. The scene captures a broad, open landscape that includes patches of water and stretches of flat land, suggesting an expansive outdoor environment near the airport.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its focus on the intimacy and tranquility of the couple contrasted with the massive, mechanical presence of the airplanes, creates a thoughtful narrative on the intrusion or coexistence of technological advancement in natural or personal spaces. The soft, natural lighting suggests that this might be late afternoon or early evening, adding a serene, golden hue to the scene.","title":"Constitution beach--within sight and sound of Logan airport's takeoff runway 22r","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548467","544963","547237","548465","548468","548469","544606","554901","548833","544967","547247","551945","549283","548485","548466","549755"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airport","couple","advancement","sharply","sui","runway","intrusion","intimacy","plane","airplane"]}
