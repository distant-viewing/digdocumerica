{"path":"543503.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a striking natural scene. A person sits on a large, strikingly unique rock formation featuring parallel grooves running vertically down its surface. The rock has a curved, smooth appearance and is dark gray with lines of mustard yellow lichen scattered across it. Some small patches of green vegetation are visible in the cracks of the rock. \n\nThe person, appearing pensive and relaxed, is dressed casually in a light-colored long sleeve shirt and dark pants. They are sitting on a boulder, supporting themselves with one hand behind them, while the other hand is raised to their chin, suggesting a moment of thought or contemplation.\n\nThe background features several tall pine trees standing at the top of the rock formation, suggesting that this scene could be in a mountainous or high altitude area. The sky above is slightly overcast, hinting at a cool or temperate climate. The overall ambience is serene and somewhat isolated, emphasizing a connection with nature and solitude.","title":"California -- Yosemite Park","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["554460","545753","544341","557118","545300","545571","558083","549335","543505","557986","545696","545767","544902","544363","544946","544898"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rock","formation","mustard","groove","lichen","chin","sit","ambience","boulder","pine"]}
