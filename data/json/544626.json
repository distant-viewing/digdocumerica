{"path":"544626.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph shows an individual, likely a wildlife professional or biologist, engaging in a field activity at night. The person is a middle-aged man wearing glasses and a light yellow shirt with dark shoulder patches and a circular patch on the left chest, suggesting a uniform possibly related to conservation or park services. He is kneeling on the ground beside a cluster of turtle eggs laid in the sand, indicating a process of examining or monitoring a turtle nesting site.\n\nThe man is intently looking at a group of spherical, pale-colored turtle eggs placed in a fairly uniform pattern in the sandy ground, partially uncovered. His right hand appears to be gently touching or assessing the eggs. He holds a small lantern with a handle in his left hand, providing light for his work, emphasizing the nighttime setting of the activity.\n\nThe background of the photograph is predominantly dark, indicating it is taken outdoors at night. The minimal visible vegetation and the composition of the ground suggest a sandy environment typical of beach areas where turtles might lay their eggs. The entire scene gives a sense of careful, scientific study or conservation effort, likely focused on the protection or research of sea turtles.","title":"Jim Walter, naturalist with Everglades National Park counts loggerhead turtle eggs and re-sets the nest.","placename":"East Cape (Fla.)","location":"East Cape, Florida","nn1":["544615","544630","558108","543802","546362","552289","552290","546350","546270","546308","551401","545190","555235","547504","546364","546345"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["conservation","night","lantern","nighttime","handle","chest","protection","ground","hand","study"]}
