{"path":"554871.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a candid and bustling roadside scene presumably from a vintage era as suggested by the style of clothing and vehicles. The setting is a street lined with small businesses, including a prominent Mobil gas station sign. The street is busy with both vintage and contemporary cars suggesting a broad time frame.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of six people and one dog congregates around a motorcycle. The individuals appear to be engaged in conversation and enjoying a casual meeting. From left to right: a young man with long hair wearing a red-checked shirt and torn blue jeans; next to him, three younger individuals, possibly teenagers, one of whom is wearing a \"Boston\" t-shirt and jeans, stand closely. Another young man with shoulder-length hair, wearing a black shirt and jeans, sits on the motorcycle. Finally, on the far right, thereâ€™s a tall man dressed in a gray t-shirt and blue jeans, who is engaged with the dog, a medium-sized German Shepherd, which appears to be sniffing or getting pets.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is relaxed and social, with a hint of a communal or small-town vibe. The background reveals more of the rural or small-town setting with additional signage and a relatively tranquil road scene, suggesting a snapshot of everyday life from an era that's not contemporary, given the visual cues from fashion and automobile design.","title":"Motorcyclist showing off his possession to his friends in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554875","551383","546993","554872","554874","556206","554898","557684","554873","554482","543471","557705","554481","556214","551070","554178"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["jean","motorcycle","dog","shirt","town","pet","era","teenager","meeting","hair"]}
