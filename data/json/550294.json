{"path":"550294.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an interior scene of a grand, historic shopping arcade. The arcade features a long, narrow central walkway flanked by multiple levels of ornate balconies filled with shops and boutiques. Some key elements include:\n\n1. **Architecture**: The structure showcases elaborate ironwork with detailed filigree patterns and a glass roof that allows natural light to illuminate the entire space. Its architectural style suggests a late 19th or early 20th century design, likely influenced by the industrial age and Art Nouveau or Victorian styles.\n\n2. **Central Feature**: Dominating the view is a large American flag hanging vertically from the roof, adding a patriotic touch to the setting and drawing the eye upward to the intricate roof design.\n\n3. **People**: The scene is moderately populated with people engaged in various activities. Individuals and groups, including families with children, are seen walking, conversing, or observing the architecture and shop windows. Some people are positioned on the ground floor while others are on the balconies, looking down at the activities below.\n\n4. **Flooring**: The flooring is composed of what appears to be mosaic tiles, contributing to the elegant and historic feel of the environment.\n\n5. **Ambiance**: The overall atmosphere is one of leisure and commerce, combining the elegance of traditional architecture with the bustle of a shopping center.\n\nThis setting likely serves as a social and commercial hub in an urban area, emphasizing both the aesthetic and functional aspects of late 19th or early 20th century public spaces.","title":"The arcade--enclosed shopping area in downtown Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550286","550290","556069","556679","551786","556276","549974","557635","551493","556067","549681","553320","549659","556674","546428","550107"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["flooring","shopping","balcony","shop","architecture","roof","19th","elegance","bustle","century"]}
