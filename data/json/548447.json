{"path":"548447.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene combining urban living with air travel. It features a large, dual-engine airplane, seemingly coming in for a landing or just taking off, depicted from behind and below, highlighting its large tail and extended rear landing gear. The airplane appears to be very close to the ground and is framed by the foreground of old, weathered multi-story wooden buildings, possibly residential apartments.\n\nThe buildings in the foreground include features like exposed balconies and external fire escapes, characterized by a bit of disrepair and utilitarian construction. The buildings are clad in aged, darkened wood siding, and have multiple visible balconies. On one balcony, there is laundry hanging out to dry, which includes items like shirts and pants, fluttering slightly.\n\nThese buildings give the scene an urban, densely packed feeling and suggest a community living very close to an airport, dealing with the regular proximity of large aircraft. The sky is relatively clear, with a light blue color, which contrasts starkly with the dark, muted tones of the building and the metallic gray of the airplane. This photographic composition creates a blend of everyday life with the extraordinary proximity of air travel, evoking themes of urban development, technological progress, and human adaptation to industrial landscapes.","title":"Near Logan Airport--airplane coming in for a landing over Neptune Road backyards","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548448","548446","548485","548486","548484","547824","548469","553888","542672","544606","548487","546178","548445","544610","542673","542720"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["airplane","balcony","landing","travel","proximity","air","building","adaptation","airport","tail"]}
