{"path":"545069.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a scene dominated by tall grasses or reeds, highlighted against a softly blurred background that appears to transition from a deeper blue at the top to a lighter, almost white or grey near the bottom, suggesting a sky with either morning or evening light. The focus is on the grass, which is bathed in a warm, golden hue, likely from the sunlight shining through or reflected at sunrise or sunset. The stems and leaves of the grass are slender, and the tips are slightly bending, adding a gentle sense of movement to the image. The field of grass fills the frame from edge to edge, creating a dense texture of vertical lines. The overall mood of the photo is serene, characterized by natural colors and a tranquil setting, free from any human presence or man-made objects. This simplicity emphasizes the beauty of the natural environment.","title":"Fill land for sale at Pony Slough","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["557559","545495","552312","557104","546154","551370","557191","552485","549233","553084","552504","549251","557111","549232","557442","544884"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","shine","tip","reed","stem","sunrise","edge","simplicity","bathe","bend"]}
