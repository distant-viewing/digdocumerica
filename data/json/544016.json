{"path":"544016.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged desert landscape dominated by dry, rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The image shows a wide view of a valley surrounded by rocky hills and mountains. The foreground consists of rough, uneven ground with scattered shrubs and small, dry bushes. The hills that surround the valley are steep and have a brownish color, indicative of a dry environment with minimal vegetation cover.\n\nIn the center of the valley, there appears to be a dirt road or a dry riverbed winding through the landscape, suggesting occasional human activity or natural water flow during certain seasons. The horizon is vast and flat, suggesting that the photograph was taken in a region with expansive plains.\n\nAbove, the sky is moderately cloudy, with white clouds dispersed across a bright blue backdrop, adding a sense of depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition portrays a desolate yet naturally sculpted environment typical of arid desert regions, highlighting the stark beauty and the expansive openness of such landscapes.","title":"Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.'s electrowinning refining plant.
