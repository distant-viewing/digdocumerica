{"path":"544078.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic weather phenomenon over a sprawling urban area, observed from a high vantage point on a hillside. A massive haboob (dust storm) dominates the scenery, illustrated by a dense wall of sand sweeping across the landscape. The dust storm casts a large shadow over part of the city, while an intense orange glow from the setting sun illuminates the other part, creating a stark contrast between light and shadow.\n\nThe cityscape itself is densely packed with buildings of various sizes and types, from residential structures to larger commercial roofs. The arrangement of the buildings suggests a fairly flat topography, enhanced by broad, organized streets. Visible roads and open spaces between groups of buildings provide a clear view of the urban grid pattern below.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the hillside is rocky and sparsely vegetated, sporting dry desert vegetation typical of arid climates. This foreground of rough terrain helps frame the vast urban expanse under the dramatic sky, reinforcing the feeling of an imminent natural event about to envelop the city. The overall atmosphere in the image is intense and ominous due to the impending dust storm and the rich, vibrant colors of the sunset.","title":"Dust storm rises over Phoenix on Labor Day, 1972.
