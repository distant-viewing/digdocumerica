{"path":"553838.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is a high-altitude aerial view of a city with a focus on its sprawling highway system and dense urban environment. In the foreground, a complex interchange of several major highways is evident, with multiple lanes and ramps intertwining, facilitating the flow of traffic in various directions. The highways are dotted with moving cars, emphasizing the scale and usage of the infrastructure.\n\nBeyond the highways, the urban landscape is densely packed with a mixture of residential and commercial buildings. These buildings vary in height, with some tall skyscrapers dominating the skyline further in the background, suggesting the central business district of the city. These skyscrapers are modern and have reflective surfaces, and they stand out against the relatively flatter landscape of smaller structures around them.\n\nThe city extends toward the horizon, fading slightly in detail due to the atmospheric perspective, which adds a sense of depth to the photograph. The sky above is mostly clear with only a few clouds, suggesting a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the details of the buildings and highways.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its sweeping view of both the highways in the foreground and the skyscrapers in the background, provides a vivid portrayal of urban development and transportation in a large, bustling city.","title":"Photograph of the central expressway in Dallas, Texas","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547755","553015","553001","549478","547764","547765","547780","553016","547770","552719","549476","555743","546617","546707","546709","546678"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","skyscraper","city","interchange","ramp","portrayal","usage","district","detail","altitude"]}
