{"path":"556465.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This aerial photograph displays a curved roadway meandering through a hilly landscape. To the left of the image, the road appears to be more of a highway with multiple lanes, whereas on the right, the road narrows into a single lane. There are three dark, tunnel-like structures beneath the road, likely underpasses or short tunnels allowing another path to intersect or pass beneath. Surrounding the road is a terrain that looks semi-arid, with sparse, bushy vegetation and a scattering of small rocks or boulders across the hillsides. The colors in the image suggest it might be late winter or early spring, as the foliage is quite muted with no vivid greenery visible. There are no obvious signs of human activity or vehicles on the road, giving the area a quiet and isolated appearance. The overall topography and composition suggest a landscape that could be used for both transport and perhaps hiking or walking trails around the tunnels and underpasses.","title":"Water which has been used in cleaning coal is then placed in settling ponds. It will be purified and returned to the stream from which it was taken. This pond is near Williamson, West Virginia which has the largest train coal yard in the world.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557528","550614","542838","547298","554566","548100","550600","554154","547302","548099","542836","555630","551240","548144","553785","554146"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["tunnel","road","lane","scattering","boulder","topography","trail","roadway","hillside","transport"]}
