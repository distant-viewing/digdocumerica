{"path":"545073.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a large, dark-colored tugboat named \"Mary Rose Brusco\" prominently in the foreground, navigating through a water body. The tugboat is equipped with a prominent wheelhouse and multiple antennas on top, and it is flying an American flag at the stern. The background shows a lush, densely wooded hill with what appears to be residential housing subtly visible on the hilltop.\n\nTo the right of the image, a shoreline is visible with a pile of driftwood and logs scattered across it. A lone person is standing on this rocky, log-strewn shoreline, looking towards the advancing tugboat. The person is wearing dark clothing and is distantly positioned, providing a sense of scale against the vast natural landscape.\n\nThe overall environment suggests a serene, perhaps Pacific Northwestern setting, with overcast skies and calm waters reflecting a sense of quiet industry and natural beauty. The tugboat, possibly engaged in a routine task, hints at human activity and commerce occurring within this tranquil scene.","title":"Fishing on the Columbia River near weyerhauser pulp mill outfall","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550872","550892","548067","548059","546938","546845","550901","550893","547694","546832","550913","546834","551179","550894","551008","550951"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","log","shoreline","hilltop","antenna","driftwood","commerce","fly","occur","housing"]}
