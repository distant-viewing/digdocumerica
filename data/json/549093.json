{"path":"549093.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene where a man is performing a task that involves carrying a large, clear water jug on his shoulder. The man is wearing a red shirt and dark pants. Behind him is a wooden cart loaded with several similar water jugs, indicating that he may be involved in water delivery or collection. The cart is hitched to a donkey, which is standing next to it.\n\nThe setting appears to be a dusty open area, with a small structure visible in the background that could be a simple shack or storage building. The ground is arid, underlining the rural and possibly harsh environmental conditions. The overall sense of the photo reflects a moment in daily life, possibly in a remote or underserved community where such water transportation is necessary.","title":"A vendor delivers bottled water from a nearby spring to a home in mexicali, mexico.
