{"path":"544774.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large, expansive landscape, most likely a salt flat, characterized by vast stretches of white, salt-encrusted ground which reflects the sky above. The scene includes a water body that mirrors the sky, creating an effect where the horizon blurs with the reflection. The water is calm, with a brilliant, almost blinding reflection of sunlight visible as a glittering streak on its surface, suggesting it is either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe landscape is surrounded by distant mountains, which are faint and covered by haze, adding a sense of immense scale and isolation. The ground is textured with patterns of salt deposition and areas of darker soil, indicating variations in mineral content and moisture levels.\n\nThere is no visible vegetation or wildlife; the scene conveys a stark, serene, and somewhat barren environment. The overall composition of the photograph, with its reflections, vast open spaces, and subtle color variations, evokes a quiet and contemplative mood.","title":"Sun reflection","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["543644","548703","544721","552902","544778","550397","555864","555863","544683","555865","545623","553867","544733","550598","555845","544679"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["salt","reflection","variation","deposition","glitter","blind","streak","moisture","mineral","content"]}
