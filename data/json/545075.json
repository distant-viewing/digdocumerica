{"path":"545075.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a close-up look inside a bulging fishing net filled with freshly caught fish. The net, woven from thick, coarse material with varying shades of brown and beige, is bursting with an abundance of fish, their bodies slick and shiny, indicating they are still wet from the sea. The fish, which appear to be small and possibly types of sardines or similar species, display a mix of silver and dark blue colors with white underbellies, and some have visible black spots along their sides.\n\nThe contents of the net spill towards the viewer, creating a dynamic sense of movement and abundance. Tiny particles and bits of debris from the ocean, possibly sand or crushed shells, cling to the fish and net, adding a gritty texture to the scene. The background of the photograph is obscured by the fullness of the net and the closeness of the shot, focusing all attention on the catch and the details of the netting. The lighting in the image highlights the wet sheen on the fish and enhances the details of the rough, fibrous texture of the net.","title":"Smelts netted for commercial sale","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["542892","545063","546319","547551","546214","546792","547848","546784","544995","544987","552271","552274","543076","548142","543189","547563"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["net","fish","abundance","catch","closeness","burst","spill","particle","shell","crush"]}
