{"path":"554844.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a yellow cactus flower, with part of the cactus visible showing its green pads and sharp spines. The flower itself seems to be in full bloom, with delicate, layered petals that exhibit a rich, golden color with a waxy texture. Small droplets of moisture or nectar can be seen on the petals, adding to the texture and detail of the image.\n\nTo the right of the flower, the cactus pad extends into the frame, showcasing a typical cactus morphology with smaller buds and emergent spines at its nodes. These nodes are red and seem juvenile compared to the rest of the plant, indicating new growth.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, with hints of other vegetation and possibly some flowers, though these details are indistinct due to the shallow depth of field focused primarily on the flower and the adjacent pad. The lighting in the photo appears natural, subtly highlighting the flower’s curves and the sharpness of the spines, creating a contrast between the softness of the petals and the harsh potential threat of the thorns.\n\nOverall, the composition centers the cactus flower in the frame, drawing attention to its intricate structure and vibrant color, while the background remains unobtrusive, ensuring that attention remains on the flower and the plant’s detailed features.","title":"Yellow rose of Texas cactus in bloom in the countryside (note the bug), near San Antonio.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544582","544891","544885","545709","545727","555370","545712","545722","544877","554580","545699","545309","554840","557545","544875","545718"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cactus","flower","spine","pad","petal","sharpness","bud","softness","droplet","attention"]}
