{"path":"554007.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive water body in the foreground, with a hint of turquoise and pronounced water ripples, suggesting a gentle breeze or current. Partially sunken into the water near the bottom of the frame is a person wearing a diving gear, recognizable by the snorkel or breathing apparatus visible just above the water's surface. The person appears to be engaged in either snorkeling or scuba diving.\n\nIn the background, a series of mountains or hills rise in the distance, their hues alternating between shades of blue and brown, possibly due to atmospheric conditions, such as haze or distance from the viewer. The sky above the mountains is a lighter blue, indicating clear weather conditions. The mountainous backdrop and the broad, open water suggest a coastal or lakeside setting, which could be popular for water sports and recreation. The overall composition and color palette convey a sense of calm and vastness, emphasizing the grandeur of the natural landscape juxtaposed with the lone figure in the expansive water body.","title":"On saturday, schoolboys from Lanai city go out to dive for octopus--a delicacy which represents good money if sold to local markets.
