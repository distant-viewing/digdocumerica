{"path":"544304.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a large steel bridge spanning a deep canyon. The bridge is constructed with a network of silver-gray steel girders forming a solid deck above and an elaborate truss structure beneath. This design appears to provide substantial support, likely necessary for spanning such a wide canyon.\n\nThe bridge deck is flat and carries multiple lanes for vehicular traffic, though only one vehicle is visible, suggesting the bridge isn't very busy at the moment captured in the photo. On the right side of the bridge, tall metal towers are seen, possibly part of a dam or similar structure, and they are outfitted with multiple levels of cross bracing and are connected by numerous wires or cables.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features steep, rugged cliffs of reddish-brown rock, typical of canyon terrains in arid regions. Below the bridge, the canyon floor is visible and shows sparse vegetation. The sky above is a clear, deep blue, indicating that the photo was taken on a bright, clear day.\n\nOverall, the scene is a dramatic display of engineering achievement integrated into a stark and imposing natural environment.","title":"Arizona--near Red Rock","placename":"Red Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Red Rock, Arizona","nn1":["542734","546810","546870","547703","546139","552247","548207","552052","549469","558048","550954","543313","549547","544542","548870","558051"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","canyon","steel","deck","span","girder","achievement","truss","dam","engineering"]}
