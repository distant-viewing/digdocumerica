{"path":"551723.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet urban scene depicting an older woman walking along a sidewalk beside a white brick building. The building features traditional architecture with dark green shutters and a fire escape covered in climbing green vines, which add a touch of lushness to the urban environment. Several blooming wisteria vines cascade down the side of the building, introducing flashes of purple to the predominantly green and white tableau.\n\nThe woman, wearing a long dark skirt and coat with a white scarf or shawl over her head, carries what appears to be a white bag or purse. Her attire suggests a scene from an earlier era, given the conservative and modest style. A metal fence, simple and rather ornate, lines the sidewalk, separating the pedestrian space from the building's small front garden area, which also features some greenery.\n\nThe scene is lit by natural sunlight, casting defined shadows of the woman, fire escape, and fence onto the building and ground, indicating a time of day when the sun is relatively high. Overall, the atmosphere conjured by the image is one of quiet daily life in a city setting, possibly in a neighborhood with a longstanding community feel.","title":"Wisteria adds charm to house on Waverly Place, a quiet street just off Washington Square in lower Manhattan's famous Greenwich Village.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546431","551824","546493","552401","550035","551722","547816","549916","551742","546423","553486","557837","553474","551744","551828","557039"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["vine","escape","fire","sidewalk","shawl","woman","fence","building","lushness","purse"]}
