{"path":"548215.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image depicts a dramatic and atmospheric scene featuring a plane captured in mid-flight against a deeply red sky. The plane, shown in silhouette which highlights its shape and design details like the wings and tail, is positioned toward the left side of the frame. To the right, there is a luminous, orange-yellow orb visible through the red haze, likely representing the sun or another light source, contributing to the image's surreal and striking ambiance.\n\nThe entire photograph is bathed in a rich, red tone, which might suggest the presence of smoke, pollution, or a particular time of day such as sunrise or sunset. This monochrome red filter intensifies the mood of the scene, casting everything in a one-note color that dominates the composition. There's very little variation in color across the field of the image, emphasizing the simplicity and starkness of the scene. The aesthetic might be described as minimalist yet powerful, focusing viewer attention on the lone flying plane and the mysterious glowing orb.","title":"Over Portland airport","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["542500","553832","555164","542717","548841","548884","542501","549811","542679","542506","549075","554139","542793","542577","542720","549072"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","orb","describe","starkness","intensify","tail","wing","fly","note","flight"]}
