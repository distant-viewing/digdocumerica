{"path":"554861.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a lively family gathering or communal meal, likely at an outdoor or semi-outdoor setting, potentially on a porch next to a building made of red bricks. The scene includes several people engaging in various activities predominantly centered around dining and food preparation.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there is an older man wearing a light-colored cowboy hat and shirt. He holds a striped cup, possibly containing a drink, and appears to be in conversation or interacting with others around the table. Next to him, a younger man also wearing a cowboy hat looks on, sitting slightly back from the table.\n\nIn the middle and right of the photograph, two women are busy with food preparation. One of them, dressed in a white blouse and dark skirt, is deeply engaged in adding toppings or seasonings to the food, using what looks like a spoon. The other woman, who is wearing glasses and a white nurse-like uniform, is also focused on preparing or arranging the food, which includes various plates and bowls on the kitchen cart.\n\nAt the far right, a young boy with his hair neatly combed is preoccupied with eating or examining food before him, providing a snapshot of childlike curiosity and participation in the family meal.\n\nForeground elements include several colorful striped cups lined along the table and a plate with food residue, hinting at a meal either underway or just concluded. The atmosphere appears casual and familial, with a focus on togetherness and the meal. The outdoor setting is underscored by the natural light illuminating the scene and the casual dress of the individuals involved.","title":"Ranch family in the Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio area eating on the porch of the bunkhouse.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551276","544990","549444","551277","548439","556611","557664","544975","558188","552612","545738","557934","554866","556530","543631","553186"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["food","meal","table","cup","plate","preparation","family","residue","kitchen","bowl"]}
