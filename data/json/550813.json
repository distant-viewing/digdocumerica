{"path":"550813.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph portrays an aerial view of a rugged landscape, presumably part of a volcanic region. The central feature is a large, complex volcanic crater with scorched, irregular textures that hint at geological processes such as lava flow and erosion. The landscape around the crater is mostly barren, with dark, rocky surfaces and minimal vegetation visible. The crater itself is surrounded by layers that might be solidified lava or sediment deposition, displaying a variety of darker and lighter shades of gray and brown. The overall terrain is rough and uneven, with various patterns formed by natural geological activity. The image is captured from a high altitude, which covers a broad area, giving a comprehensive view of the natural textures and formations of this volcanic terrain. There are no signs of human activity or any other life forms visible in this harsh environment. The image quality includes some grain, suggesting it might be taken with a film camera or in low light conditions.","title":"Scum forms along banks of the Wisconsin river near a county park in merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551284","544694","554140","552424","543148","555793","555158","552426","555553","552423","555885","555029","554141","554090","552420","550395"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lava","deposition","grain","form","sediment","film","altitude","terrain","erosion","texture"]}
