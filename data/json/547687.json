{"path":"547687.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a somber, environmental scene showing a multitude of dead fish scattered across a water surface and some spilling onto a muddy, littered riverbank. In the water, a makeshift raft constructed from old wooden planks and buoyed by barrels is visible. This raft appears dilapidated and is partially submerged, indicating it might have been abandoned or is seldom used.\n\nThe surface of the water around the raft is densely covered with dead fish, their white bellies upturned, shining slightly as they catch light. This dense congregation of fish carcasses suggests a mass fish die-off, potentially due to pollution or a sudden depletion of oxygen in the water. Various pieces of debris and litter, including leaves and small trash items, are interspersed among the fish both in the water and on the muddy shore, further emphasizing the degraded environmental condition reflected here.\n\nThe background is dimly lit and somewhat obscured by the shadows, focusing the viewer's attention on the immediate tragedy unfolding in the foreground. The overall composition and the elements within the frame collectively convey a strong message on environmental crisis and the urgent need for attention to water ecosystems.","title":"Dead fish washed up on the middle branch of Baltimore harbor near port covington","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546898","546930","555560","547737","552067","546846","546782","542985","547704","546185","546784","552158","550812","550878","546779","550950"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","raft","off","water","crisis","die","congregation","shine","spill","buoy"]}
