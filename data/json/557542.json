{"path":"557542.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of pine branches filled with several emerging pine cones and pine needles. The pine cones are variably sized and predominantly green with some showing reddish-brown at the tips of their scales, indicating growth or maturation. The needles are thin, elongated, and densely packed around the branches, presenting a deep green color that contrasts sharply against the soft-focused dark background. The selective focus on the subject highlights the texture and intricate details of the cones and needles, enhancing their natural beauty. The lighting appears natural, shedding sufficient light on the pine cones and needles to emphasize their details and colors against the out-of-focus, darker backdrop.","title":"Plantlife in the Malibu canyon area of the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["554988","555003","554987","555099","555004","557592","555100","549226","557020","557602","554588","555194","555108","557607","554960","554589"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cone","needle","branch","tip","emerge","shed","close","detail","up","growth"]}
