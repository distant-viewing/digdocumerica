{"path":"546572.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This image provides a view through a doorway into a dimly lit room where a solitary figure, a man, is seated at a long rectangular table littered with various papers and materials suggesting a working environment. He is bent forward, resting his head in one hand in a posture that suggests deep concentration or perhaps fatigue.\n\nAbove the table hangs an elaborate light fixture composed of multiple arms, each ending in a glowing bulb, providing an interesting juxtaposition of bright modernity against the otherwise dark, understated tones of the room. At the far end of the room, behind the seated man, hangs a large red curtain, partially drawn, adding a rich dash of color to the subdued ambiance.\n\nThe framing of the image, seen from what appears to be a darker room or hallway through an open door, adds a layer of intimacy, suggesting the viewer as an unobtrusive observer to this quiet, reflective moment. The walls around the doorframe are plainly adorned, and the slight graininess of the image gives it a textured, film-like quality, enhancing its candid, almost voyeuristic viewpoint.","title":"Interior of cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546580","552619","546486","546471","555297","552647","544326","542690","553517","547366","546550","546500","555430","551897","548864","556250"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","end","table","graininess","modernity","hang","bulb","rectangular","observer","intimacy"]}
