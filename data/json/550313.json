{"path":"550313.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural setting involving a man engaged in the activity of fishing. He is standing waist-deep in a body of water, presumably a lake or a river, holding a fishing rod which is slightly bent, suggesting that either he has caught something or is ready to cast.\n\nThe man is dressed in a casual, comfortable outfit suitable for outdoor activities, wearing a long-sleeve shirt and what appears to be dark pants or waders. His attire and posture indicate a focused and leisurely attempt at fishing.\n\nThe surrounding environment enhances the mood of peaceful solitude. The background shows a densely wooded area, with tall, slender trees mainly consisting of pines, and brushwood covering the understorey. The bank across the water is natural and largely undisturbed, indicating that this scene is set in a secluded or lightly visited location.\n\nThe surface of the water is calm with minor ripples and some reflections from the sky and surrounding vegetation, creating a textured effect on the water.\n\nOverall, the composition and natural lighting of the photograph evoke a sense of tranquility and connection with nature, highlighting the theme of outdoor and recreational sports like fishing in a serene, woodland environment.","title":"Fly fisherman casting for salmon in GRand Lake stream, part of the east branch of the st.
