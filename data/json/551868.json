{"path":"551868.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a rainy urban street scene. The ground is wet, reflecting the somber, overcast sky which imparts a glossy sheen to the cobblestone street. Centered in the frame is a classic Volkswagen Type 2 (T2) van, often associated with the 1960s and 70s, painted in a pale color and parked right on the street.\n\nTo the left, there are commercial establishments with bright interiors visible through large glass windows. One shop prominently displays the name \"SCHWAB.\" Beside it is a colorful umbrella covering what appears to be a market stall, partially obscuring a person standing behind it. The right side of the photograph features more modern architecture with large sections of stone or concrete and broad lit store windows showcasing displays.\n\nPeople, possibly shoppers, are scattered along the sidewalk, some under umbrellas. The environment suggests an active, albeit wet, day in a bustling city area with a mix of traditional and modern architectural elements. The mood is somewhat subdued yet vibrant due to the reflections and illumination from the stores.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
