{"path":"553678.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a stunning aerial view of a coastal city during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm and dim lighting. The city is densely packed with high-rise buildings, predominantly white or light-colored, which starkly contrast against the darker hues of the surrounding landscape. To the left of the image, the city transitions into a green area, likely a park or a less urbanized zone, leading up to a prominent ridge or mountain range that adds a dramatic backdrop to the scene.\n\nOn the right side, the city meets the ocean, with the coastline curving gently. The waters are vast and relatively calm, reflecting the sky above, partially dotted with clouds, contributing to the serene yet dynamic ambiance of the setting. The composition of the photo, with natural landscapes framing the urban environment on either side, highlights the interaction between human settlements and natural geography.\n\nThe lighting plays a significant role in the mood of the image, casting some parts of the city in shadows while others catch the light, creating a sense of depth and volume in the photograph. This interplay of light and shadow, along with the vastness of the ocean and the commanding presence of the mountain, gives the viewer a sense of both the human scale and the grandeur of nature.","title":"Popular Waikiki Beach area seen from helicopter","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553677","553679","553680","553790","552231","553748","553672","553676","553675","553778","552171","552133","548384","555756","552252","549480"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["city","ocean","geography","command","volume","mountain","settlement","sunrise","ridge","grandeur"]}
