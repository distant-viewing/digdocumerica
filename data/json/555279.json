{"path":"555279.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a woman in an industrial or shipping environment. She is dressed in professional work attire suitable for such an environment, which includes a black jacket and a yellow hard hat with goggles perched on top. She is carrying a briefcase-like item in her left hand, which appears to be an instrument or inspection toolkit, and holds a clipboard or similar document holder in her right hand, suggesting she is either inspecting, supervising, or recording data about the operations.\n\nShe stands by a doorway, with a partial view of industrial containers stacked in the background, including a large container marked with the text \"ACL,\" indicating a setting near shipping docks or a container yard. The environment is bright, suggesting a sunny day.\n\nAround her, various industrial equipments such as cables and hooks are visible. Close to the ground, there are cylindrical objects, possibly drums or similar storage containers, labeled for what seems to be specifications or shipment details.\n\nThe woman is gazing away from the camera, possibly towards someone or something off-camera, which might be of interest or relevance to her work at that moment. The image effectively captures a moment of a professional task in an industrial setting, highlighting an aspect of commercial or industrial operations.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspector checks containers on the docks at the Port of Newark, New Jersey.
