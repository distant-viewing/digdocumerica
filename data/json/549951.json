{"path":"549951.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a landfill scene set against a backdrop of a serene water body. In the foreground, two seagulls are prominently visible, positioned on heaps of multicolored garbage that include items like discarded bags, papers, and unidentifiable debris. One seagull stands upright looking off to the side, while the other appears to be rummaging through the trash.\n\nTowards the middle ground, a male figure is seen walking away from the camera towards the piles of waste. He is dressed casually in a gray t-shirt and dark trousers, potentially suggesting a worker or someone exploring the site. Around him, other birds—possibly crows or more seagulls—are spotted scattered across the ground, likely in search of food.\n\nIn the background, a calm, expansive water body is visible, adding a contrasting natural beauty to the otherwise polluted and chaotic landfill environment. The body of water is framed by a clear sky and distant landforms, hinting at the broader ecological impact settings like these may imply.","title":"Seagulls scavenge at croton landfill operation along the Hudson River","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549952","549737","549748","547983","549953","549946","549758","549745","549754","547971","554542","549741","549744","549742","543832","549747"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["seagull","landfill","positio","search","discarded","landform","body","explore","heap","garbage"]}
