{"path":"544248.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph provides a view from a timber-framed structure over a marina filled with sailboats. The foreground features a geometric pattern created by the beams of a structure, possibly a pier or a part of a maritime building, with rectangular shapes framing the scene. Through these geometrical wooden frames, numerous masts from the docked sailboats are visible, extending vertically toward the sky. The color tones suggest either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThe sailboats differ in size and design; some have their sails covered or docked, while at least one displays a blue and white sail partially unfolded. The docks are crowded, indicating either a popular marina or a special gathering or event. The water is calm, showing light reflections of the boats and masts, enhancing the tranquil maritime ambiance.\n\nIn the mid-ground, thereâ€™s a glimpse of lush greenery, which suggests that the marina might be located near a coastal wooded area or within a sheltered cove. The sky appears clear, hinting that the weather is likely fair, providing a pleasant day for boaters and visitors. One individual is discernible, seated on one of the boats nearer to the center, contributing to the lived-in, active feel of the marina scene.","title":"Mandeville boat harbor","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["546877","542904","543246","556191","542871","542902","543545","544661","548515","549407","546853","542912","548078","547781","557450","546388"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","sailboat","mast","dock","differ","fram","cove","sails","liv","boat"]}
