{"path":"546165.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image displays an intriguing magnified view of what appears to be a thin section of rock, potentially examined under polarized light to highlight its mineral structure and composition. The photograph is filled with rich textures and contrasting tones that appear due to the variation in mineral content and grain structure.\n\nAt the center and spreading outward in a radial pattern are regions that exhibit black and white bands that swirl in a spiral-like formation, reminiscent of fluid motion patterns or perhaps indicative of mineral alignment during the rock's formation process. These patterns create a dynamic and almost hypnotic visual effect.\n\nThe surrounding areas present a more chaotic and less ordered assembly of materials, with textures that suggest a mix of different minerals. These regions display a range of colors from grays and whites to browns, suggesting a compositional variety. Some areas look somewhat translucent while others are more opaque.\n\nOverall, the image is an excellent representation of geological forms under magnification, showcasing natural patterns that speak to the geological history and environmental conditions that impacted the rock's formation. It provides a close-up view that might typically be seen in geological studies or educational settings to explore and explain the Earthâ€™s mineralogical diversity.","title":"The contaminated water of mill creek, waste from the calcasieu paper mill in Elizabeth, la.
