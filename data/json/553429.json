{"path":"553429.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts three young children wading in a body of water, presumably a river or lake. The scene is captured from a shaded perspective, likely under tree branches which frame the upper part of the image, providing a natural border and adding a feel of seclusion. The children are positioned towards the center and left side of the frame, facing away from the camera. They appear to be engaged in casual play or exploration, indicated by their relaxed postures and the way two of them seem to interact with each other.\n\nThe water is calm with reflections and slight ripples around the children, suggesting gentle movement. The background features lush, dense greenery and additional water vegetation, hinting at a serene, possibly secluded location. There is a hint of a structure or a bridge in the far background, partially obscured by the foliage, adding depth to the scene. The lighting of the photograph is subdued, possibly taken during late afternoon or under heavy tree cover, contributing to a mood of tranquility and timeless summer days.","title":"Swimming hole on the squannacook river near groton.
