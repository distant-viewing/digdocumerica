{"path":"549882.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant street scene, presumably from an American city, evident from the architecture and vehicles. In the foreground, there is a prominent, large, shiny, black luxury car (possibly from the 1970s based on its style). Its imposing figure and polished finish stand out amidst the busy urban environment.\n\nThe street is bustling with activity; several people are crossing the street or walking along the sidewalks. Men and women are dressed in typical mid-20th-century fashion, with men in suits and overcoats and women in long coats. The individuals all appear to be adults and are engaged in their own activities, either walking purposefully or entering and exiting vehicles.\n\nIn the background, there are other vehicles that suggest a typical busy city day - trucks, vans, and cars, including a yellow van marked with \"PENNZOIL\" and other vehicles with commercial branding. The eclectic nature of the signage, including ads for \"Schaefer Beer\" on the side of a truck, adds to the commercial vibe of the scene.\n\nThe architecture includes tall buildings with commercial entities on the ground floor, advertising various products and services. Street signs and traffic lights are also visible, indicating a well-organized city grid.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a slice of urban life, likely captured in the 1970s, showcasing a mix of daily commerce, busy pedestrians, and typical city traffic alongside striking architectural features.","title":"In Manhattan's Garment District, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549872","554297","550139","556709","556724","548388","554310","545216","548369","551135","548331","546626","556225","556710","548410","554314"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["city","van","street","vehicle","entity","ad","overcoat","luxury","1970","traffic"]}
