{"path":"557877.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a line of cars parked in a narrow, urban alleyway. The vehicles are vintage, as evidenced by their design and shape, showcasing models that appear to be from the 1960s or 1970s. The cars have distinctively long bodies and large rear windows, typical of American automotive design from that era. The color palette of the vehicles includes metallic hues such as gold, bronze, and a faded blue.\n\nThe setting seems to be within a city, hinted at by other structures and cars visible in the blurred background beyond the alley. The alley itself is surrounded by buildings with dark exteriors, possibly of brick material, contributing to an enclosed and somewhat dim environment. A \"STOP\" sign is integrated into the scene, attached to a building on the left side, indicating the presence of some regulation within the area, possibly a private parking lot.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image, combined with the style of the cars and the architectural features, suggests a snapshot from an earlier era, capturing a quiet moment in a typical urban setting. The lighting is subdued, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, further enhancing the nostalgic feel of the image. There are no visible people, focusing attention entirely on the arrangement and style of the cars and their surroundings.","title":"Motorists in line at the safety lane at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
