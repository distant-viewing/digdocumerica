{"path":"554845.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting in front of a building, possibly a small storefront or rural shop. The man is wearing a light-colored fedora style hat and a striped button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled slightly up. He also sports a tie, and there's a pen and possibly a pair of glasses tucked into his shirt pocket, suggesting he might be used to paperwork or administrative tasks. The expression on his face is gentle and contemplative.\n\nBehind the man, there's a faded and peeling white wooden window frame that seems aged, indicative of a building that has seen better days. There is a sign that reads \"Paymaster F.F.\" hanging in the window, possibly indicating the name or brand associated with the building.\n\nThe window glass reflects an outdoor scene that appears quite bright, possibly indicating a sunny day outside. The overall color tone of the image is a bit muted with a vintage feel, reflecting the era when the photo was likely taken. The background is slightly blurred, drawing the focus mainly to the man in the foreground.","title":"An elderly resident in front of the feedstore in Leakey Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554857","552523","547313","554926","544276","556084","558330","547179","556149","556133","553090","554858","552871","547416","549019","552648"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["paperwork","window","fedora","man","glass","tuck","pocket","pen","brand","button"]}
