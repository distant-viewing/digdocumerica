{"path":"545957.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a group of children and a dog on a weathered boat named \"LINDA ANN\" which is moored in a calm water setting. The boat appears to be old and somewhat derelict, with its paint peeling and parts of the structure looking worn out. This adds a rustic charm to the scene.\n\nThere are four children on the boat. On the left, two boys are seen seated and standing at the front of the boat; they are dressed in winter clothing, suggesting a cooler season. On the right, a younger girl and another boy are sitting closer to the middle of the boat, partially obscured by the elements of the boat. The children are engaged in casual, relaxed postures, indicating they are comfortable in this environment.\n\nA medium-sized black and brown dog is also present on the boat, positioning itself near one of the boys towards the center. The surroundings hint at a rural or natural landscape, with clear skies, calm water, and sparse vegetation visible in the background.\n\nThe presence of Spanish moss hanging from the upper parts of the boat suggests a setting possibly in a southern US location, commonly associated with this type of flora.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on a group of children enjoying a leisurely day on an old boat surrounded by nature, evokes a sense of adventure and childhood freedom.","title":"Children of fishermen play on seldom-used boat.","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["545961","545972","547004","549410","547879","553510","546333","549373","543915","549954","554199","546812","548511","543485","554177","544195"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","child","boy","dog","freedom","childhood","group","flora","moss","charm"]}
