{"path":"552559.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene winter scene in which a group of bison are grazing on a snow-covered landscape. The ground is mostly white due to the thick snow, dotted with patches of dry, tall grass sticking out. The bison are dispersed across the field, each one busy feeding on the sparse vegetation available beneath the snow.\n\nThe background features gently rolling hills, also covered in snow, which add depth to the scenery. There is a sense of solitude and quiet, emphasized by the overcast sky and the soft, muted colors of the environment. The bison, dark and robust, contrast against the bright and monochromatic background of whites and faded browns. This photograph captures the tough, enduring nature of bison living in a harsh, wintry ecosystem.","title":"Sheep and cattle ranching is the chief occupation of the Piceance Basin. The large ranches are based on private lands in the valley bottoms. Surrounding Bureau of Land Management holdings are leased for grazing.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552558","546099","546123","546095","546091","552557","543732","546129","557192","552697","550379","557194","557195","550380","555068","557196"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["snow","one","white","ecosystem","scenery","winter","solitude","brown","field","group"]}
