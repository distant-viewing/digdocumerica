{"path":"553588.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a delicate plant with small, pink flowers sprouting along its slender, vertical stem. The foreground prominently highlights the plant, showing detailed textures of the blossoms and leaves against a largely blurred background. The flowers have multiple layers of petals, which present a soft and intricate appearance. \n\nThe background of the image is dominantly dark and moody, consisting of a deep, blurred forest setting. Silhouettes of pine trees or a similar type of coniferous forest can be faintly seen at the top of the image, suggesting that the photograph was taken in a mountainous or woodland area during low light conditions or possibly at dusk. The overall dark tones of the background contrast strikingly with the pale pink of the flowers, making them stand out as the focal point of the photo. The image evokes a sense of solitude and the natural beauty of a serene, untouched environment.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora Granite Creek section.
