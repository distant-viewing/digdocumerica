{"path":"551390.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in a fishing activity by a muddy riverbank. In the foreground, there are piles of small, silvery fish scattered on the wet soil, and two white buckets are also filled with these fish, indicating a successful catch.\n\nIn terms of human activity, one man, standing in the river wears a green cap and waders, and is handling a long, slender pole, possibly used for fishing or navigating the muddy river. Another individual, also in waders and a green cap, is interacting with a third person on the riverbank. This third person is leaning over a bucket, seemingly inspecting or sorting the fish.\n\nAdditionally, another person, partially obscured and standing on the riverbank, is wearing a blue jacket and black pants.\n\nThe background features a gently flowing muddy river with eroded and steep muddy banks under an overcast sky, enhancing the sense of a chilly, damp environment often associated with fishing in such conditions. The environment and attire of the individuals suggest this activity is taking place in a cooler climate or season.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City. In mid-April thousands of fishermen gather at Whitney Drain, a manmade canal on Lake Huron, to dipnet for these small fish.
