{"path":"551644.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively urban scene set in what appears to be a small park or plaza. The image shows rich, flourishing plant life including a variety of flowers in bloom, primarily hydrangeas showcasing a mix of pink and white hues, along with verdant green trees. Black circular planters hold the hydrangeas and add contrast to the colorful flowers and lush foliage. In the background, large, imposing skyscrapers provide a stark urban backdrop that contrasts with the natural elements in the foreground.\n\nThe composition also includes people who are enjoying this small oasis within the city. There are two individuals visibleâ€”in the mid-ground, a woman dressed in black appears engaged in either entering or leaving the park, while another person is seen farther back. Both add a human element to the setting, dovetailing the urban and natural elements.\n\nThe overall scene suggests this photo was taken on a bright day, given the light shadows and the clear visibility of the details and colors in the environment. Adding a sense of depth, the trees nearby and far structures frame the photo. The cars lined up along the curb also denote the city landscape and busy environment surrounding this serene park.","title":"Rockefeller center--6th avenue side--a green, cool resting place for passersby","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557257","551652","551743","551653","551705","551746","557266","551685","549516","550298","551781","557262","551775","551756","551739","550755"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["oasis","flourish","park","flower","denote","planter","plaza","city","curb","enter"]}
