{"path":"554009.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts two young men standing in shallow ocean water under a blue sky scattered with clouds. The young man on the left is smiling broadly and holds up an octopus that dangles from a spear; he is wet and shirtless, wearing brightly colored red board shorts. On the right, another young man stands turned slightly away from the camera with his back partially visible. He holds a traditional three-pronged fishing spear angled over his shoulder. Both individuals appear to be engaged in spearfishing. Behind them, the vast ocean stretches to a horizon marked by a distinct mountainous landscape, suggesting a tropical or subtropical setting. The overall mood is lively and suggests a moment of success or joy in a natural, coastal environment.","title":"On saturday, schoolboys from Lanai city go out to dive for octopus--a delicacy which represents good money if sold to local markets","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["548734","557481","546330","554008","552118","554006","548738","553953","544204","546306","546334","546290","545180","548770","549363","543065"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["ocean","dangle","joy","man","hold","board","shoulder","turn","smile","short"]}
