{"path":"550465.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a rugged natural scene, focusing on a large hole in the ground, possibly an animal burrow, which prominently occupies the foreground. The hole is surrounded by clumped and disturbed soil, with patches of green grass and small plants scattered around the dirt. This suggests a recent digging activity, possibly by an animal or for environmental research purposes.\n\nBehind the hole, the landscape gradually slopes upward, forming a grass-covered bank. This terrain is interrupted by another similar body of water or perhaps a continuation of what is seen in the background. The background prominently features a curved waterway, possibly a river or stream, effectively creating a serene, yet slightly isolated wetland or riparian scene. The sky is overcast, suggesting a gloomy or cloudy day, which casts an even, diffuse light across the scene without harsh shadows.\n\nThe absence of people or large animals in the visible area adds a sense of solitude and untouched nature to the photograph. The overall composition, with its focus on the foreground and the natural curve leading to the background, draws the viewerâ€™s attention from the intricacy of the disturbed earth to the broader, tranquil waterway and beyond, suggesting a narrative of natural activity and environmental interaction.","title":"A parka squirrel burrows near the west bank of the Sagavanirktok River.
