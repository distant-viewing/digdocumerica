{"path":"549571.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a group of spectators at a daytime event, possibly a parade, given the presence of an American flag. The setting appears to be an urban street, suggested by the partial view of buildings and a section of road in the background.\n\nCentral to the image is a boy holding up an American flag itself. He is young, perhaps around 7 to 9 years of age, and sports a striped shirt. To his left, another boy, slightly older, sits distractedly, looking away from the camera, and appears deep in thought or perhaps tired, resting his chin on his hand.\n\nThree females are also visible in the image. To the right, there is a young woman wearing a tank top and a sun hat, seated in a relaxed posture with what looks like a book or pamphlet in her lap. Behind the boys, another woman wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat, watches the event intently. A teenage girl is seated on the left edge of the frame; she wears a red and white outfit, and her facial expression conveys a sense of seriousness or concentration.\n\nThe overall atmosphere seems relaxed yet attentive, as the group engages with the event. Their attire suggests a warm, sunny day, and their positions hint at a casual yet engrossed audience at a public gathering. The urban setting, casual clothing styles, and the American flag collectively suggest a patriotic holiday or community celebration in the United States.","title":"Boy waves flag as circus performers and marching units pass by in the \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual parade","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557715","552589","557710","554450","543482","552654","549579","551810","551811","557054","550086","553237","547285","553280","549577","557714"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["flag","boy","event","pamphlet","seriousness","female","holiday","chin","parade","audience"]}
