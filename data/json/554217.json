{"path":"554217.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a wooden food vendor stall labeled \"Shaffer's Popcorn.\" The stall features a rustic aesthetic with dark wood and visible grain, highlighted by white painted text and borders. At the front, the stall has two large open windows with glass panels showing the inside of the stall where food items like popcorn seem to be sold. There is a display inside the window listing items such as hot dogs for 50 cents, and various types of popcorn like buttered, caramel, and cheese, priced between 35 and 75 cents.\n\nIn the scene, two people are visible. On the left, there is a person wearing a heavy brown jacket and a red and white striped winter hat who is facing the stall, appearing to be ordering or looking at the options available. On the right, another person with short dark hair and wearing a dark jacket is seen from the side, seemingly passing by the stall without stopping.\n\nAtop the stall, a series of small lamps is visible, likely used for lighting the stall during darker hours. Additionally, thereâ€™s a metal kettle and some condiment bottles (probably ketchup and mustard) on the counter.\n\nThe surroundings of the stall give off a chilly, possibly winter atmosphere, indicated by the attire of the people in the photograph, which includes warm jackets and hats. The background is out of focus but suggests an outdoor setting possibly in a public place like a park or near a street given the casual and transient nature reflected by the passing individual.","title":"Popcorn wagon at Snowmass Mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["558136","558135","554708","551888","551485","554216","551513","546979","551731","554495","551840","545457","556215","551844","554187","551838"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["stall","food","jacket","winter","condiment","mustard","inside","option","item","vendor"]}
