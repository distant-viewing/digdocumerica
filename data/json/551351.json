{"path":"551351.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene of a forest creek. The creek is surrounded by lush greenery, with dense foliage on both sides. The water appears calm and partly transparent, revealing the rocky bed beneath in certain areas while in others it reflects the surrounding greenery, creating a bluish-green hue.\n\nTwo main fallen tree trunks cross the creek, adding an element of ruggedness to the scene. These trunks are partly submerged in water and covered with patches of moss, indicating they have been there for some time. Small branches and leaves float around and on these logs, intertwining with the natural flow of the creek.\n\nThe forefront of the image is dominated by dense leaves and branches of nearby bushes, which are vividly green and appear fresh, suggesting it might be spring or summer. The leaves are of various sizes and shapes, indicating a variety of plant life which adds to the biodiversity presented in the scene. There appears to be no human activity, emphasizing the untouched, tranquil aspect of this natural setting. The lighting is soft and appears to be natural sunlight, filtered through the canopy above, casting gentle patterns of light and shadow on the water and foliage.","title":"Channel between two lakes formed by Gunter's Big Spring in the Ha Ha Tonka region.
