{"path":"544382.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a smiling man wearing a work outfit and a hard hat. The man appears to be middle-aged with a round face, prominent cheekbones, and a warm, welcoming smile. His skin is lightly textured, possibly indicating a life of physical labor, and he has a dark complexion. His eyes are kindly and expressive, adding to the affable impression he projects.\n\nHe is dressed in a rugged dark-colored work shirt that seems stained and worn from hard work, suggesting that he might be involved in a labor-intensive occupation such as construction or mining. His white hard hat looks well-used but sturdy, further supporting the idea of a work environment.\n\nThe background is soft and out of focus, rendered in a blend of neutral grey tones that highlight the subject without distraction. This blurred effect helps to bring the viewer's focus immediately to the man's facial features and expression. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures a strong sense of character, resilience, and warmth, portrayed through the subjectâ€™s attire, expression, and the photograph's composition.","title":"Navajo truck driver","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["542783","542779","558312","547163","553609","554441","556343","554953","556345","553605","553618","547282","554846","549120","547179","556563"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["work","labor","occupation","subject","complexion","idea","distraction","hat","portrait","expression"]}
