{"path":"547869.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph illustrates a vibrant yet somewhat desolate scene set on a beach. In the foreground, a focal point is a severely damaged red convertible car, abandoned and filled with debris; it missing its windshield and several other parts exposing the interior. The sandy ground around the car shows marks and litter, emphasizing a neglected condition.\n\nFurther in the middle ground, a woman sits on a suitcase or small chest, looking off into the distance. She is dressed in clothes (likely a dress or skirt and blouse) suitable for warmer weather. Behind her, a man wearing pants and a light-colored shirt walks away from her, heading toward the beach where some people are visible in the far background.\n\nIn the background, one can also see the expansive sandy beach stretching out towards a water body, with an industrial setting faintly visible across the shoreline. This includes tall structures which could be factory towers, suggesting the beach might be close to an industrial area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo captures a sense of abandonment and contemplation against an industrial coastal setting, juxtaposing personal human moments with broader environmental and industrial themes.","title":"Plum Beach on Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548752","543163","544617","547035","545849","547923","547484","546393","548698","546406","547587","547041","547481","544809","544060","548051"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","suitcase","windshield","chest","mark","litter","skirt","clothe","car","contemplation"]}
