{"path":"545166.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a busy harbor under clear blue skies. In the foreground, two people can be seen from behind, observing the scene from an elevated viewpoint, possibly a deck or a pier. The person on the left is wearing a colorful, patterned blouse, and the person on the right is dressed in a yellow shirt. Both are looking out towards the water.\n\nThe harbor is bustling with activity, with several boats and yachts of various sizes moving through the water or docked at nearby piers. A notable element in the frame is a small powerboat moving swiftly, creating a white wake behind it as it travels through the harbor. The water is relatively calm, and the clarity of the sky suggests a breezy yet sunny day, ideal for boating.\n\nIn the background, further details of the harbor infrastructure can be seen, including more docking areas filled with boats and some built structures possibly related to harbor operations. The horizon is clear, and the distant coastline is visible, hinting at a vast and open seascape. This setting creates a lively and enjoyable marine environment, likely a popular spot for maritime activities and enjoying the outdoors.","title":"Salmon fishing","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546937","548078","547700","542871","543358","542905","542872","542904","542912","552050","544248","542876","542878","548235","555800","552000"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["harbor","pier","boat","yacht","docking","seascape","move","ideal","wake","person"]}
