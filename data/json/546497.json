{"path":"546497.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph focuses on a natural and architectural scene. The image features fresh young green leaves prominently in the foreground, attached to thin, spindly branches of a tree. The leaves are dappled in sunlight and shadows, suggesting either a time of day when the sun is angled or the presence of intermittent clouds.\n\nIn the background, there is a building constructed of red bricks. The brick structure is visible between and behind the leafy branches and seems to comprise a series of tall, narrow windows or doorways, which create a pattern through their repetition. These windows or openings are void of any glass, suggesting the building might be in a state of disrepair or under construction.\n\nThe focus and lighting of the image draw the viewer's attention primarily to the contrast between the organic, delicate texture of the tree leaves and the rigid, orderly structure of the brick building. This juxtaposition creates a layered depth in the composition, adding a sense of tranquility mixed with a slight undertone of abandonment or change.","title":"In front of Cleo Rogers Memorial Library, designed by I.
