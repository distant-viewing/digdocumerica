{"path":"554457.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph features a colorful and vibrant building front, prominently advertising as \"Home of 1000 Animals\" in Lake Placid, NY, indicating a likely tourist attraction or exhibit. The architecture captures a playful, fairytale-like design with spire-tipped towers and festive decorations. Front and center above the building, there is a large, whimsical sign with caricatures of two men and an animal, which adds to the fun and inviting atmosphere.\n\nDirectly below the sign, various animal figures like elephants and a lion are painted, supporting the theme of a zoo or animal exhibition. The building also features signs for \"Furs,\" \"Novelties,\" \"Souvenirs,\" and \"Gifts,\" suggesting a mix of entertainment and shopping facilities. \n\nIn the foreground, a manicured grass lawn and a stone-lined pathway are visible, which subtly frames the photograph and leads the eye towards the attraction. Parked to the right side of the image is a classic car, hinting at the era the photo was taken, likely mid 20th-century.\n\nOverall, the scene provides a nostalgic glimpse into past recreational sites, capturing the essence of tourist attractions of the time, with its focus on themed entertainment and retail.","title":"Home of thousand animals tourist attraction near Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545221","554458","554454","552406","556766","557660","554550","543094","557654","543580","554184","554699","546440","546488","554456","549113"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["attraction","animal","entertainment","tourist","playful","retail","fun","the","manicured","exhibition"]}
