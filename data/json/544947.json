{"path":"544947.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural scene composed of several distinct elements. The main focus is an ancient, small, rectangular tower built of rough stone, perched atop a rugged outcrop. The tower's simple, almost austere architectural style suggests it may be of historical or cultural significance.\n\nThe tower is situated in a scenic landscape that features rolling hills densely covered with lush greenery, primarily shrubs and small trees, contributing a rich texture and vibrant color to the foreground. Behind the tower and vegetation, majestic mountains loom in the distance, their silhouettes softened by atmospheric haze, enhancing the depth of the scene.\n\nThe light in the photograph seems to be that of early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle shadows and enriching the colors of the natural landscape. This lighting adds a serene and somewhat mystical quality to the image, inviting contemplation of this peaceful yet desolate location.\n\nOverall, the composition balances the man-made structure with the overwhelming natural beauty surrounding it, creating a harmonious and evocative scene that highlights both the fragility and the endurance of human endeavors within the vastness of the natural world.","title":"Ancient indian dwelling seen in early morning light Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["544392","554452","546463","546480","544951","544421","551520","556628","549135","555397","545550","546490","543431","551263","547518","557519"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tower","loom","outcrop","endeavor","perch","enrich","soften","significance","world","contemplation"]}
