{"path":"546739.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy multilane highway during what appears to be evening or night time. The scene is vivid with the glow of numerous vehicle lights; headlights illuminate the road while tail lights create a stream of red along the flow of traffic.\n\nThe highway itself is slightly wet, likely from recent rain, as reflected light gives the road a glossy, shimmering effect. Traffic is dense, filled mostly with cars and a visible bus in the foreground driving in the opposite lane. The bus has a distinct set of white lights on top, possibly indicating it is a public transit vehicle or it carries important information like route numbers or destinations.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment as suggested by lighting and infrastructure visible beyond the immediate vicinity of the road. The time period hinted at by the styles of the vehicles looks to be from the late 20th century. The atmosphere is dynamic yet commonplace, depicting a typical rush hour where commuters are likely heading home or towards other nightly engagements. The photograph communicates a sense of motion and urban bustle, emblematic of city life during peak traffic hours.","title":"Shirley highway during evening rush hour","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546644","553894","546747","546629","546591","546586","542764","553726","547811","545884","556194","546610","555437","549902","547051","546571"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["bus","hour","highway","road","traffic","vehicle","rush","commuter","bustle","tail"]}
