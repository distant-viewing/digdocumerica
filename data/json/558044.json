{"path":"558044.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rural landscape, vividly capturing a mix of agricultural fields, dense woodlands, and settled areas. Here's a detailed description:\n\n1. **Agricultural Fields**: The most prominent feature of the image includes large agricultural fields, some of which appear freshly plowed, showing dark soil contrasting with fields that are more green, likely planted with crops.\n\n2. **Woodlands**: The area is framed by dense forests that delineate the cultivated areas from the more natural, wild spaces. These woodlands are lush, suggesting the photo was taken during a growing season.\n\n3. **Waterways**: A serpentine river or stream runs through the scene, surrounded by thick vegetation, which likely offers a natural habitat for local wildlife.\n\n4. **Houses and Structures**: Scattered across the image are various residential houses and farm buildings. These structures appear small from the aerial perspective, often grouped together, forming tight-knit rural communities or farm compounds.\n\n5. **Roads**: A network of roads can be seen meandering through the landscape, connecting the different properties and fields. The roads curve around the natural contours of the terrain.\n\n6. **Overall Layout**: The orientation and layout of the fields, roads, and houses suggest a well-established rural area that blends agricultural use with residential living.\n\nThe photograph provides a snapshot of rural life, emphasizing the balance between agriculture and natural vegetation. The aerial view puts into perspective the human influence on the landscape and the ongoing relationship between people and the natural environment.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal and Canal Road are seen to the left as the Cuyahoga River veers to the right in a scene near Cleveland, Ohio farmland and residences, and the waterways are located within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area situated in a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The canal was heavily used for commerce between 1833 and 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553817","556968","553694","558045","558414","542730","547684","556969","549260","553695","552858","556971","556994","547426","557726","545842"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["field","woodland","road","farm","description","compound","put","settle","delineate","plow"]}
