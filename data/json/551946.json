{"path":"551946.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a solitary figure sitting on a rugged, graffiti-covered concrete platform by the sea, possibly at dusk due to the low light and rich blue tones dominating the scene. The expansive body of water stretches to the horizon, meeting a subtly graduated sky, hinting at a sunset or sunrise with its pink hues.\n\nThe person is seen from behind, looking out over the sea. They are wrapped in a coat or blanket that covers them entirely, adding an element of introspection or solitude to the scene. The platform on which they sit is right at the water's edge, with other similarly broken and graffiti-strewn blocks visible in the foreground, which suggests an urban coastal area.\n\nForeground details include a specific piece of graffiti that reads \"MOLES,\" and the concrete's textured, cracked surface gives the space a neglected, weathered look. This setting, combined with the solitary figure, evokes a mood of contemplation and solitude, accentuated by the vastness of the sea and the broad open space. The overall dusky lighting and coloration add a quiet, melancholy atmosphere to the image.","title":"On the seawall in Lincoln Park","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553772","554004","545753","549471","543081","550268","542976","545940","545095","549322","550826","543025","550940","557470","543078","554002"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["graffiti","sea","platform","solitude","introspection","sit","figure","coloration","wrap","crack"]}
