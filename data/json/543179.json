{"path":"543179.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a young woman standing in a shallow fountain or pool. She is holding a sea creature, specifically a sea hare, in her hands, suggesting an educational or interactive marine exhibit. She wears waders, a black turtleneck, and a checkered shirt, accessorized with a name tag identifying her as \"Sherri Swenson.\" Her expression is focused and attentive as she looks slightly off-camera, perhaps engaging with an audience or explaining characteristics of the marine creature she's holding.\n\nIn the background, various individuals, including children and adults, are gathered around and inside the fountain area, suggesting a public or community event. Some are observing the interaction, while others are more engaged in their own activities. The setting appears to be outdoors, in a sunny environment indicated by the bright lighting and shadows, with some greenery and a built structure partially visible in the distant background.\n\nThis scene likely takes place in an educational context, possibly a museum, aquarium, or science fair, where the main focus seems to be on marine biology and hands-on learning experiences. The composition captures a moment of learning and curiosity, emphasized by the interactions and attention of the people in the image towards the marine life being shown.","title":"Open house at Hopkins Marine Institute (Stanford)","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543180","543181","543178","546308","551596","552943","546335","552941","551283","544833","552304","546312","546350","553657","546354","552700"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["creature","fountain","biology","museum","turtleneck","science","learn","sea","learning","accessorize"]}
