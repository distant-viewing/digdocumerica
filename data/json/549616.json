{"path":"549616.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts three individuals on board a boat, engaged in what appears to be a scientific or marine research operation. The setting is outdoors, and the image shows a large body of calm, blue water indicating it might be taken on a sunny day at sea.\n\nOne key focus of the image is a person dressed in a bright orange-red jacket. This individual is standing on the edge of the deck, actively interacting with a vertical cylindrical device, possibly a piece of sampling or measuring equipment used for marine or environmental studies. They are holding onto a clear plastic container attached to the device, possibly collecting samples or monitoring equipment readings.\n\nTo the right of the photograph stands another person dressed in a dark jacket and pants, observing or assisting in the operation. This person appears to be focused on the equipment or the process being conducted by the individual in the orange-red jacket.\n\nFurther back, partially obscured, another crew member or participant stands, also observing the work at hand. This person adds a sense of depth to the scene, emphasizing the group activity involved in the operation.\n\nThe boat itself is equipped with various maritime tools and equipment. There's a sturdy metallic structure with ropes and possibly nets or tarpaulin, indicative of the research or fishing-related nature of the boat's undertakings. The deck where they are stationing is visible with a weather-beaten look, painted in red and having metallic surfaces, all typical for a vessel used in such environments.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of active marine research or sampling, highlighting teamwork and the use of specialized equipment in a maritime setting.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
