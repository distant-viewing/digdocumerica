{"path":"551486.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a young man seated on a large, rough-textured stone block. He is dressed smartly in a brown plaid suit, a yellow tie, and a white shirt, and has a bowl haircut. His expression is serious and his hands are gently placed on his thighs, offering a calm, contemplative demeanor.\n\nBehind the young man is a large glass window that reflects a vivid and busy scene. Visible in the reflection are various people engaged in different activities. Additionally, the window displays clothing on mannequins, including what appears to be a red and white checkered shirt and other garments suggesting a retail setting, possibly within a mall or a fashion outlet.\n\nThe area is bustling with activity; there are people seated at a cafe with white chairs, enjoying meals or conversations, and others are standing or moving about. The scene conveys a lively, urban atmosphere juxtaposed with the young manâ€™s serene posture in the foreground. The reflective surface of the window adds a layer of visual complexity, blending indoor commercial elements with the outdoor seating area captured in the reflection.","title":"A young man finds a quiet spot on the stonework of the h.c (bud) richardson fountain in front of power's dry goods store","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["549335","547280","557034","546105","551642","557907","553270","553281","548888","552701","551481","555297","552971","553517","545471","551434"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["outlet","thigh","haircut","window","cafe","reflection","bowl","garment","meal","seat"]}
