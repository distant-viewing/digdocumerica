{"path":"547322.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an evocatively blurred and darkened image of a bird in flight at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The bird is captured mid-air, with its wings positioned upward during an upstroke. The color palette is somewhat somber and is dominated by deep purples and blues, contributing to a moody and slightly mysterious ambiance.\n\nThe background is unfocused and largely indistinct, shrouded in the same purple-blue haze that envelops the bird. This lack of detail in the background emphasizes the bird as the central subject and evokes a sense of isolation or solitude. The lighting in the scene is quite low, and the silhouetted nature of the bird adds to the dramatic effect.\n\nOverall, the composition and the visual effects used create a striking image with a strong impression of movement and an aura of introspective solitude.","title":"Part of rural Nebraska's varied bird population.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557204","551379","557628","547318","543922","543873","553875","547593","550382","544547","548832","543918","544605","557208","553776","545142"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","solitude","effect","aura","wing","flight","purple","lack","dawn","haze"]}
