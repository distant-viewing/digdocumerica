{"path":"542779.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a smiling adult man wearing a hard hat. He has a joyous expression, prominently displaying laughter lines and a sincere smile. He appears to be middle-aged, with textured, sun-tanned skin and squinting eyes that suggest either sunny conditions or an expression of deep laughter.\n\nHe is dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeved, striped work shirt, which is slightly wrinkled and has a buttoned-up pocket on the left side. On his wrist, he wears a watch with a dark strap. \n\nThe man is wearing a white hard hat, which is circular in shape with a brim going all around it, indicative of attire suitable for construction or industrial work settings.\n\nThe background is blurred but suggests a natural, outdoor setting. There are hints of greenery and possibly bamboo or thin tree trunks in the slightly mottled bokeh background, which creates a contrast between his brightly lit, clear face and the less distinguishable backdrop.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing the man in a candid, joyful moment, likely during a break or a lighthearted interaction outdoors, emphasizing his cheerful demeanor and the rugged attire of his profession.","title":"Logger Warren Raddatz","placename":"Shaver Lake (Calif.)","location":"Shaver Lake, California","nn1":["544382","542783","554441","547163","553609","558312","553634","556867","553606","556343","549120","556622","554953","544835","553618","547351"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laughter","smile","profession","squint","tan","wrist","strap","hat","pocket","go"]}
