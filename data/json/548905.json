{"path":"548905.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captured from an aerial perspective shows agricultural fields that have been very clearly organized into long, parallel rows which create a striped pattern visible across the photo. The predominant color of these rows varies between shades of purple and dark earth tones, suggesting variations in crop type or soil moisture. Remarkably, through the center of the image, there's a straight, narrow white cloud of smoke or dust, extending horizontally. This could indicate some ongoing agricultural activity, like dust being kicked up by machinery or pesticide/fertilizer application. The differing treatments of the fields or possibly lights affecting the capture can be inferred from the varying darkness of the rows. There's a stark contrast created by this disruption against the meticulous, almost fabric-like pattern of the fields. At the bottom right of the image, a road or boundary interrupts the farm patterns, marked by a straight dark line with perpendicular connections perhaps serving as access routes. Overall, the photograph documents human influence on natural landscapes and possibly hints at active farming operations.","title":"Fertilizing near el centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548907","553047","548902","542710","553881","549094","548908","558414","545897","548898","549253","542517","553696","548817","549098","553972"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["row","dust","field","pesticide","application","infer","pattern","kick","differ","interrupt"]}
