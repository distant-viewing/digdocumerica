{"path":"546688.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows two men inside a helicopter cockpit, seemingly engaged in flight operations. The man on the left, seen in profile, wears a white shirt and dark sunglasses. He is facing forward, piloting the helicopter with a focused expression. The man on the right wears a dark blue uniform with a patch that reads \"Metropolitan Police\" and a badge emblem, suggesting he is a law enforcement officer. He is holding a radio and speaking into it, possibly communicating with ground support or other aircraft.\n\nThe interior of the helicopter features a window structure that provides an extensive view of the landscape below, which includes a developed area with numerous buildings, hinting at an urban environment. The visibility through the windows shows a vast, populated area extending towards a horizon under a slightly cloudy sky, suggesting the helicopter is at a considerable altitude.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of apparent cooperation and coordination between civil and law enforcement authorities, possibly during a patrol or a specific mission, emphasizing the roles of both the pilot in navigation and control, and the police official in communication and operational execution.","title":"Traffic broadcast from police helicopter","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546683","546675","555825","545645","553786","553787","548815","552383","542671","548899","542576","552366","545642","555835","546921","552365"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","enforcement","law","pilot","official","authority","cooperation","coordination","radio","cockpit"]}
