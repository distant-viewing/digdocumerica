{"path":"551267.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor setting characterized by a cozy, well-furnished room with distinct architectural and decorative elements. Three people are seated around a dark-colored table, which features a large, ornate globe at the foreground. These individuals appear relaxed and are sharing a moment, possibly in conversation or enjoying each other's company.\n\nThe room has a rustic yet refined decor theme with a large stone fireplace as a focal point in the background. The fireplace, made of mixed dark stones, dominates the rear wall. Above the hearth hangs a sizeable rectangular art piece framed in gold or brass, flanked by smaller decorative items on a broad mantle. \n\nA luxurious, beige-colored sofa is visible, adorned with multiple matching cushions. This seating faces the fireplace, suggesting a layout conducive to lounging and social interaction. The room's lighting includes small, stylish hanging pendants that cast a warm glow. The ceiling features visible dark wooden beams that contrast the lighter shades of the ceiling and walls, enhancing the room's rustic aesthetics.\n\nThe floor is not fully visible but appears to be covered with a dark, possibly grayish material that could be stone or a dark carpet, which complements the roomâ€™s elegant style.\n\nEach person exhibits a pleasant demeanor, wearing casual attire, which suggests a comfortable and informal gathering in a private setting like a home or a lodge. A window dressed with light, airy curtains allows natural light into the room, contributing to the ambient warmth and welcoming atmosphere.","title":"Prominent realtor Charles Welek, wife Rita, and Peter Brown, executive with \"Land of the Fifth Season\" developers, in bar of family room of the Welek house on the shore of Lake Ozark.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543041","551278","546025","557038","556627","556610","552114","555310","557353","554897","556646","545984","552646","545496","556647","545985"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["room","stone","ceiling","sofa","cushion","globe","lodge","brass","matching","carpet"]}
