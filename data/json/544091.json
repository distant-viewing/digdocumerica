{"path":"544091.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a garbage collection scene on a suburban street. In the foreground, there are two green garbage cans, one set on top of the other and numbered 99, situated at the curb next to a mechanical arm, presumably attached to a specialized garbage collection vehicle. A cardboard box filled with what seems to be shredded paper is beside the cans.\n\nThe garbage truck itself is white, with two visible compartments and several large mirrors. The driver's cabin is towards the right of the image; inside, a male driver wearing sunglasses and a light-colored shirt can be seen looking out. The truck has a sturdy, compact build typical of municipal garbage collection vehicles, designed for easy maneuverability in residential areas.\n\nIn the background, there's a residential scene with houses, trees, and a wide street. One home has a visible garden, and there are open fences around the properties. A car is parked under a tree on the opposite side of the street, suggesting a quiet suburban neighborhood.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is sunny and bright, indicating a clear day, suitable for outdoor work such as garbage collection. The photograph seems to capture a routine moment of municipal service in a peaceful residential area.","title":"Trash Barrels are lifted mechanically by sanitation truck in a new trash collection method sponsored by EPA.","placename":"Tolleson (Ariz.)","location":"Tolleson, Arizona","nn1":["550159","550147","550158","550154","550163","553040","550150","550162","546902","549751","549844","549837","545502","549940","549949","544087"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","collection","can","driver","street","truck","build","compartment","cardboard","curb"]}
