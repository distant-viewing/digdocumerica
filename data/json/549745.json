{"path":"549745.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from a landfill or garbage dump. In the foreground, the blurred image of a car passing by is visible, which suggests the photograph might have been taken from or near a road. Dominating the middle and background of the frame is a large mound of trash covering the area extensively. Multiple types of waste can be seen, including various fragments that appear to be household garbage and larger pieces of debris.\n\nCentered in the photograph is heavy machinery, specifically a bulldozer or compactor, equipped with large wheels and a powerful front shovel. This machine is actively engaged in moving and compressing the garbage, likely to manage the space and volume of waste at the site.\n\nThe sky is hazy, possibly due to dust and emissions from the decomposing waste and mechanical activity. A number of seagulls are flying over and around the trash, which is typical as they scavenge for food at such sites. In the far background, indistinct buildings or hills can be seen, barely discernible through the haze, which gives an urban-industrial feel to the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures an everyday yet environmentally significant activity, highlighting issues of waste management and its environmental impacts. The presence of wildlife, in this case, the seagulls, also serves as a poignant note on the interaction between urban waste and nature.","title":"In time this Hackensack dump will provide park and other recreational facilities to Bergen County residents.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549754","549946","549953","549741","543828","549737","549936","549792","549778","546257","549795","546246","548210","549748","543821","549937"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","garbage","seagull","trash","compactor","case","site","dump","shovel","volume"]}
