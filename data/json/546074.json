{"path":"546074.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene likely taken during the mid to late 20th century. The central focus is a large smokestack emitting a thick plume of dark smoke, dominating the right side of the sky. In the foreground, a busy street scene unfolds with numerous vintage cars, indicative of mid-20th-century models, aligned in traffic. The cars are driving on a road that appears well-traveled, surrounded by multiple signs and advertisements that contribute to a commercial atmosphere.\n\nOn the right side of the image, prominent signage includes \"ANGELOS,\" \"Phillips 66,\" and another sign advertising a coin-operated laundry with the name \"Cure's Clean.\" The presence of these signs suggests a dense commercial area, with various businesses catering to everyday needs.\n\nThe photograph also features utility poles and power lines crisscrossing above, adding to the busy and somewhat cluttered urban environment. The overall lighting and color tones suggest either an early morning or late afternoon time frame, casting a slightly dim light that enhances the industrial quality of the scene.\n\nThis image provides a snapshot of mid-20th-century American life, highlighting the intersection of industrial development and bustling urban life, with the smokestack possibly pointing to ongoing issues of pollution and environmental impact during that era.","title":"Kaiser Aluminum plant smokestack spreads fumes above St. Claude Avenue in the Chalmette section","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546968","550171","550970","548326","551034","550191","557224","550173","547651","550175","545062","548330","543993","545422","545507","548336"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["century","smokestack","laundry","sign","need","intersection","advertisement","issue","car","vintage"]}
