{"path":"548177.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a handwritten sign posted on what appears to be a glass surface, possibly a door or window due to the reflections and the way light plays on its surface. The sign is on a piece of pinkish-beige paper and uses black marker for the text. The message reads:\n\n\"Sorry We're Closed\nGasoline Allotment\nFilled for Today\nOpen 7am Tomorrow\"\n\nThe handwriting is somewhat hurried and informal, suggesting urgency or a spontaneous notice. The backdrop of the image is a deep blue, presumably from either the glass itself or the evening sky reflecting on the glass, enhancing the text's visibility.  The overall context and message indicate an issue related to resource managementâ€”specifically, gasoline, which could hint at a time of fuel shortages or rationing events.","title":"Only one of many such signs that have appeared in the Portland area since the start of the fuel shortage.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555416","555413","555412","555414","548176","548168","555519","555464","555411","548053","555518","548171","548169","548175","548047","555423"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["message","glass","text","shortage","gasoline","urgency","notice","fuel","marker","beige"]}
