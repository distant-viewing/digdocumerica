{"path":"547305.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic rural landscape under a moody sky. In the foreground, there is a freshly tilled field, dark in color, which creates a stark contrast with the rest of the scene. The middle ground of the image is dominated by several structures: there are two bright red barns to the left, both traditional in design, with gabled roofs. Near the center, there is a white house partially obscured by trees, showing a classical design with a peaked roof and visible chimney.\n\nTo the right of the image, further back, stands another house painted in white, perhaps slightly weathered, with parts of its outer wall exposing underlying materials. The landscape around these buildings is lush with mature trees in various shades of green, suggesting spring or summer. Above this serene rural setting, the sky is overcast, tinged with grey, likely indicating an approaching storm or recent rainfall.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a tranquil yet vibrant rural life, framed by natural and man-made elements, with a palpable sense of impending weather change. The contrast between the dark soil, the vivid red of the barns, and the lush greenery adds to the visual interest of the photograph.","title":"Farm near Schuyler","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557946","547291","555571","544481","549237","547304","555577","547428","547307","552515","547303","551305","555537","556962","552462","547128"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","impend","till","tinge","storm","rainfall","roof","approach","weather","design"]}
