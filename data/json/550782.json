{"path":"550782.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene riverscape during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft lighting. The river is calm, reflecting the sky and the surrounding foliage almost like a mirror, adding an element of tranquility and depth to the image.\n\nThe riverbanks are densely covered with various types of vegetation. On the left side, taller grasses are prominent, some of which are backlit by the sunlight, creating highlights on their tips. In contrast, the right bank is more heavily vegetated with lush green shrubs and small trees, possibly indicating richer soil or less disturbance.\n\nIn the far background, down the river's course, thereâ€™s a hint of open land or possibly a meadow, suggested by the lighter vegetation and open space. The sky reflects a clear blue in the water, suggesting no immediate cloud cover at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the photograph create a peaceful natural scene, emphasizing the quiet and stillness of the waterway, surrounded by the vibrant life of the riverbank vegetation.","title":"One of the many swamps of northeastern Wisconsin that contribute to the headwaters of the Wisconsin River.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550845","542653","550839","557106","553355","550656","554762","557239","545861","546963","554629","554775","552318","552597","555076","546171"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["riverbank","riverscape","backlit","vegetation","meadow","course","tip","disturbance","river","vegetate"]}
