{"path":"544191.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and playful scene on a beach. In the image, a young person is seen running along the shore, with a dog bounding alongside them. The person appears to be in mid-stride, one foot lifted off the wet sand, and they are holding what seems to be a stick or a thin object in their right hand. Both the person and the dog are reflected on the wet beach surface, adding a mirror-like quality to the composition.\n\nThe background shows gentle waves of the ocean rolling in towards the beach, and the sky above is a clear, light blue indicating a bright, sunny day. The horizon is flat and spans across the photograph, emphasizing the expansive nature of the setting. The overall mood of the photograph is lively and carefree, capturing a moment of joy and activity in a serene beach setting.","title":"Beach scene","placename":"Grand Isle (La. : Island)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["553072","545218","543463","543395","543390","548292","543396","543394","543500","548695","545133","548697","543083","543498","543070","543460"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["beach","dog","person","stride","stick","foot","mirror","joy","sand","ocean"]}
