{"path":"547100.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays a man standing on a concrete walkway, looking out towards the sea. He is stylishly dressed in a gray overcoat, patterned trousers, a red sweater, brown boots, and a red and brown cap. Next to him, on a leash, is a small dog wearing a blue sweater. The dog is looking directly at the camera. Both are positioned against a vibrant backdrop that includes a bright blue sky and tumultuous ocean waves. The sea is visibly agitated, suggesting a breezy, possibly chilly day. The composition balances the tranquility of the seaâ€™s horizon with the vertical line of the man and the attentive posture of the dog. The image conveys a serene, yet slightly stark atmosphere.","title":"Waves pound seawall in Michigan City","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547148","553089","543500","549928","542874","543038","549112","547150","542976","548695","557470","543394","550924","543327","554951","547087"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","sea","sweater","leash","overcoat","boot","walkway","balance","trouser","ocean"]}
