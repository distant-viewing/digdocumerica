{"path":"542960.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene during what appears to be the early evening, judging by the warm backlighting of the sunset that softly silhouettes the subjects. The setting is a grassy field suggesting a farm environment. At the forefront, there are two cows facing towards the camera, with additional cows dispersed throughout the field behind them. The cows closer to the camera are highlighted against the illuminated background, creating a contrast that draws focus to them.\n\nIn the background, there is a large farm building, possibly a barn, accompanied by other smaller structures that could serve various agricultural purposes. The buildings are somewhat obscured by the lighting but are identifiable by their typical large, sloped roofs and functional architecture.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photo is tranquil and distinctly rural, enhanced by the golden hues of the sunset that cast long shadows on the ground. The image evokes a sense of calm and the simplicity of farm life, characterized by open spaces and the natural landscape. The light specks and grain in the photo suggest it might be a film capture, adding a nostalgic quality to the scene.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542652","554560","557554","548984","542626","547309","542627","546102","542628","545153","554071","549214","550833","548065","542801","557747"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["cow","farm","sunset","backlighting","speck","capture","grain","field","camera","barn"]}
