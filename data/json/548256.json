{"path":"548256.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The image captures a scene within a subway train, viewed from the outside looking in through the windows. The subway car is classic, with a metal frame and paneled design featuring blue and white colors. Each window frame is enhanced by a dark border, further drawing attention to the individuals visible inside.\n\nThere are multiple commuters seen through the individual windows of the subway car, producing a frame-like effect around each person. Starting from the left, there is a young man wearing glasses, behind him is another young man in glasses, seemingly obscured somewhat by a reflection or dirt on the window. Moving right, the next window frames a middle-aged man holding a newspaper that obscures most of his face; a young woman with blonde hair is seen next to him. In the immediate next window section, we observe an older man in glasses, and rightmost in the scene, there is a view of the backs of passengers standing within the train.\n\nThe lighting inside the subway car appears to be typical fluorescent, which casts a stark illumination on the passengers and highlights their varying expressions and states of engagement. The passengers are dressed in typical business attire, suggesting this scene likely captures a weekday commute.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on individual passengers framed within each window, offers a snapshot into daily life and commuter culture, possibly during the mid to late 20th century given the fashion and style observed.","title":"Commuters on subway","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554327","554326","556669","556780","548261","556691","556665","556698","554370","554323","556813","549893","556661","554328","556656","556817"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","window","passenger","commuter","glass","train","frame","car","commute","observe"]}
