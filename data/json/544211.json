{"path":"544211.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, there are two young boys standing beside a body of water, possibly a marsh or river, characterized by calm water reflecting the surroundings. The boy on the left, who is wearing a plaid blue and white short-sleeve button-up shirt, is smiling broadly and holding a black object, possibly a camera case. The boy on the right is shirtless and holding a small black bird in his hands, examining it with a curious expression.\n\nThe background features lush greenery with tall grass and trees, including a prominent tree with sprawling branches behind them. In the midground, across the water, there's a grassy field with more trees that reflect in the water, enhancing the serene rural setting. The overall atmosphere of the image is light-hearted and exploratory, capturing a moment of youthful curiosity and engagement with nature.","title":"Boys with airgun and bird.
