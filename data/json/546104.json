{"path":"546104.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph prominently features a vibrant red jeep, positioned in the foreground with a focus on its front side. The jeep, which looks like a classic model possibly from the mid-20th century, is equipped with rugged tires and a heavy-duty black front bumper with a distinctive v-shaped tow bar attached. A metallic license plate reading \"2Y-5704\" is affixed to the bumper.\n\nThe jeep's front view showcases two rounded headlights, a traditional seven-slotted grille in a contrasting dark color, and a hood adorned with metal latches. There are several rifles mounted on the back seats of the jeep, hinting at recreational or hunting activities. The seats themselves are also red, maintaining the vehicleâ€™s striking mono-color theme.\n\nIn the background, set against an arid landscape with sparse vegetation, is a vintage white and blue pickup truck. The truck is parked farther away on a dirt track and adds an additional layer of rugged, outdoorsy charm to the image's overall composition. The terrain is predominantly flat with scattered bushes and small trees, suggesting a rural or wilderness area suited for off-road driving and similar outdoor pursuits. The sky appears overcast, giving the scene a slightly muted yet natural ambiance.","title":"Hunter's jeep","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["545071","545596","554681","544370","544767","546093","545594","545094","543211","545939","554805","554810","548802","553010","557468","545102"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bumper","rifle","v","truck","affix","pursuit","tow","grille","license","pickup"]}
