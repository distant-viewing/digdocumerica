{"path":"543433.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic coastal scene, characterized by rugged terrain and the dynamic interplay of natural elements. The focal point is a steep, rocky coastline where sharp cliffs plunge into the dark blue waters of the ocean. The surf can be seen breaking against these cliffs, adding a sense of constant movement to the scene.\n\nThe landscape is steep and multi-layered, displaying a variety of textures. The cliffs are bare, revealing earthy tones ranging from dark brown to light beige, and are interspersed with patches of green vegetation which cling to the crevices and slopes, hinting at the hardy nature of the flora that survives in this harsh environment.\n\nAcross the middle of the scene runs a winding road or bridge, following the contour of the mountainside and providing a stark contrast to the natural ruggedness with its smooth, man-made surface. This road carves through the landscape, marked by guardrails that reflect the sunlight, indicating its use as a transportation route along the cliffâ€™s edge.\n\nThe mountains rise steeply from the coastline into the background, covered with dense forests that appear dark green, almost merging with the shadows cast by clouds above. The sky is heavily overcast, with dark clouds suggesting an imminent storm, which adds a moody ambiance to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition successfully captures a blend of natural rugged beauty and human engineering, offering a sense of both awe and isolation. It expresses the dramatic interaction between land and sea under brooding skies, evoking a feeling of the sublime in nature.","title":"Roads wind along coast","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["545122","543300","545934","543309","543061","543291","553910","543295","543424","543428","543435","553775","543432","543328","543297","553774"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","coastline","mountainside","surf","guardrail","crevice","awe","beige","ruggedness","storm"]}
