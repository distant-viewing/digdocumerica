{"path":"558140.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Truman, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene of a sunset backdrop featuring the silhouette of an industrial setting. The photograph is dominated by the vibrant and warm hues of a setting sun which is positioned centrally in the frame. Its golden light casts a gentle illumination that fades into the darker shades of the twilight sky.\n\nIn the foreground, part of an industrial structure is identifiable as “Burick Elevator” according to the visible signage, suggesting that this may be a grain elevator or a similar agricultural facility. This large structure occupies a significant portion of the midframe to the left, extending somewhat into the central area. It appears as a linear construction with vertical elements, which are typical for such industrial buildings.\n\nTo the right, a taller and more massive silhouette of what might be another part of the facility or an additional industrial structure is visible. This part includes a large vertical tower and a connected sloping conveyance system, likely used for moving materials within the facility. The angular and geometric forms of these structures contrast sharply against the rounded, soft sun and the gentle gradients of the sunset sky.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed, mostly obscured by the industrial silhouettes, but hints of a distant treeline can be seen above the facility, suggesting that the setting is on the outskirts of a natural or rural area. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of quietude and the daily concluding operations of an industrial space, juxtaposed with the timeless cycle of nature as signified by the sunset.","title":"Sunrise over the burdick elevator at New Ulm, Minnesota.
