{"path":"544251.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene at sunset. In the foreground, the ocean's surface is textured with gentle waves, reflecting a blend of deep blue and hints of pink from the sky above. The main focus of the image is a large boat, positioned centrally and silhouetted against the sunset. This vessel appears to be a working boat, possibly a dredger or a similar type of industrial maritime equipment, notable for its robust, functional structure and the presence of what looks like a crane or conveyance machinery at one end.\n\nThe sky is a dramatic backdrop, displaying a gradient of colors from a deep navy blue at the top to a rich magenta hue blending into the horizon. The sun is depicted as a distinct, rounded disc sitting low in the sky, casting a warm, orange glow that bathes the entire scene in a soft, ambient light. The placement of the sun near the center of the frame creates an impactful visual alignment with the boat, highlighting its silhouette against the illuminated sky. There are no visible people or other objects in the scene, emphasizing a sense of tranquil isolation on the open water. The composition of the photograph, with the horizon neatly dividing the image, and the boat centrally located, provides a balanced and peaceful portrayal of an evening at sea.","title":"Dredging Lake Pontchartrain: a clean-up operation","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["543411","544247","545170","547110","543956","545055","553990","543143","551215","548117","544238","544655","543613","553991","543880","543119"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","sunset","navy","sun","alignment","blue","portrayal","pink","placement","horizon"]}
