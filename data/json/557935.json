{"path":"557935.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, sunny day at a park where people are engaging in various leisure activities. In the foreground, a man and a woman are actively engaged in eating while seated on the grass. The man, sitting on what appears to be a tree stump, has a beard and wears a white jacket over a dark shirt, dark pants, and a white bucket hat. He seems to be eating something from a small container, holding it with both hands near his mouth. The woman, sitting directly opposite him, sports a red sweater and blue jeans, her hair cut in a bob. She is also eating, holding a small snack in her hand.\n\nThe scene around them features several picnic tables scattered across a grassy area, some occupied by other park-goers. People appear to be enjoying picnics and conversations. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. Trees with budding leaves suggest it's either spring or early fall, contributing to the overall tranquil and pleasant setting. In the background, slightly out of focus, other individuals, possibly families or groups, are visible either seated or walking within the park area. The ambience of the park is vibrant yet peaceful, encapsulated by the bright sunlight and clear skies which enhance the mood of a pleasant day out.","title":"Visitors picnicking at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Bath and Akron, Ohio.
