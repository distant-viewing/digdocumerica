{"path":"548338.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a busy toll plaza where multiple lanes of traffic converge into a series of toll booths. Traffic appears congested as numerous vehicles, including cars, trucks, and vans, line up to pass through the toll booths. The vehicles display a variety of colors, adding a vibrant aspect to the image.\n\nThe toll plaza features several lanes divided by white lines on the pavement, leading towards about a dozen toll booths, each covered with a canopy. Some of the vehicles are stopped at the booths, presumably paying their tolls, while others are approaching or just passing through.\n\nTo the left of the toll plaza, there is an open dirt area, possibly under construction or undeveloped land. On the far right, there appears to be a building which might be related to the toll operations or maintenance.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a common scene of roadway toll collection, emphasizing the high volume of traffic and the infrastructure used to manage it. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the arrangement and activity at the toll plaza.","title":"Entrance to the tappan zee bridge, near White Plains","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548389","548341","552709","548391","548401","546734","544642","546686","547780","547770","548332","546681","546721","547785","546711","546725"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["plaza","boot","pass","lane","dozen","congest","traffic","pay","vehicle","volume"]}
