{"path":"546246.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large landfill or waste disposal site. The foreground is framed by dark foliage, possibly tree branches with leaves, slightly obscuring the view and creating a natural border for the scene. The central and main area of the image features mounds of garbage and debris sprawling over a vast area. Among the refuse are discernible items like papers, plastics, and other discarded materials, suggesting a mix of household and perhaps industrial waste.\n\nIn the middle ground, heavy machinery is visible, functioning amid the hills of trash. There's a yellow bulldozer and nearby, a dump truck, both engaged in managing and moving the waste. Other equipment might also be present but less distinguishable.\n\nThe background shows additional piles of rubbish and hints at an ongoing expansion of the landfill, with earth mounds that have yet to be covered by garbage. No buildings or other structures are visible in the surrounding area, indicating that this location is isolated from residential or commercial zones. The sky above is clear, contributing to a stark contrast with the polluted and cluttered environment below.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
