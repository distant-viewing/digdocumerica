{"path":"549660.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a busy urban setting, likely in a European city. The foreground prominently displays a road sign that reads \"Fußgänger 10:30-19,\" indicating a pedestrian zone active between the hours of 10:30 AM and 7:00 PM. Beside this, partially cut off from view, is a street pole bearing a 'No Entry' sign for vehicles, symbolized by a red circle with a white horizontal stripe.\n\nIn the background, an impressive architectural structure dominates the view. It is an ornate building with a grand entrance and a large, decorated dome. The facade of the building is adorned with various sculptures and intricate designs. The entrance appears to be an archway that leads through the building, opening up into a farther space that is not fully visible.\n\nThe scene also captures several pedestrians around the area. People can be seen walking by, some closer to the camera and more blurred, and others clearer in the distance near the archway. The street itself is lined with buildings that have commercial establishments on the ground floor, evident from some signage and shop windows visible in the photograph. Additionally, hanging flower baskets and other ornamental street elements contribute to the energetic and lived-in feel of the cityscape.","title":"Kohlmarkt Street, famous for its silversmith shops and cafes, ends at Michaeles Tor, the main gate to the imperial palace of the Hapsburgs.
