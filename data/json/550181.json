{"path":"550181.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays a gritty industrial scene dominated by dense emissions and a haze of pollution. The composition features a landscape of various industrial structures, many of which are emitting large amounts of smoke and steam into the sky. The scene is backlit by a hazy, perhaps early morning or late evening, light that silhouettes the industrial elements against a dusky sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a dark silhouette of a bridge, possibly a railway or a vehicular bridge, crosses horizontally, partly obscuring the lower part of the industrial structures. The middle ground is filled with a variety of industrial facilities, including tall chimneys, large cylindrical storage tanks, and complex frameworks possibly associated with processing plants or manufacturing units.\n\nThe air is thick with smoke and steam that billows up and blends into the sky, indicating heavy industrial activity and possibly air pollution. The overall mood is somewhat somber and eerie, suggestive of environmental degradation. The photograph is captured with a focus that slightly softens the details, enhancing the atmospheric effect of the obscured, smoke-filled scene. The color palette is muted, dominated by dark browns and grays, conveying a sense of decay or neglect.","title":"Sunrise in steel mill smoke","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550172","550185","545239","545447","551054","547539","546884","545268","557218","550981","550983","551026","550176","550982","557225","542999"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["smoke","steam","pollution","air","bridge","degradation","emission","unit","amount","railway"]}
