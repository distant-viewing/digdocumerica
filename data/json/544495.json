{"path":"544495.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial complex, possibly a power plant, characterized by its large and complex structures. Two tall smokestacks dominate the scene, emitting white and gray smoke into the atmosphere. These cylindrical chimneys, with alternating bands of red and white, tower over the surrounding area. \n\nThe main facility includes various interconnected buildings and structures with a mix of metallic frameworks and concrete builds. A significant part of the complex appears to be under construction, or in a state of assembly, featuring exposed steel beams and unfinished frameworks.\n\nIn the foreground, various smaller buildings, tanks, and possibly machinery are similarly clustered, creating a dense industrial footprint. Storage areas with what appear to be construction materials or waste are visible near the peripheries of the site.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes what seems to be a water body adjacent to the facility, reflecting the impact or utilization of natural resources in industrial operations. Smoke or steam drifts over the land near these water bodies, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nAdditionally, vehicle tracks and paved roads weave throughout the complex, highlighting the accessibility and operational nature of the plant. The background also hints at more environmental elements like green land, suggesting a coastal or riverside location that integrates natural settings with heavy industrial activity.","title":"Turkey Point Nuclear Plant","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544494","548376","548195","545841","545837","550329","546087","550339","557306","549215","547126","551567","545236","551994","549507","545833"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["complex","framework","drift","alternate","periphery","smoke","footprint","accessibility","assembly","construction"]}
