{"path":"543553.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph provides a tranquil and serene view of a lakeside setting during a clear twilight. The main elements showcased are a dock and an attached fueling station, suggesting the image is taken at or near a marina. A prominent feature is the “Chevron” fuel sign mounted on a pole beside the dock, conveying that refueling services are available at this location. This structure also hosts a small overhanging roof and what appears to be control equipment, possibly for the fuel station.\n\nThe dock itself is composed of weathered wooden planks and pillars, many of which show signs of age and exposure to the elements. It creates a rustic look that contrasts with the smooth surface of the lake. The still water mirrors the scene above it, giving a near-perfect reflection that doubles the visual impact of the dock and sign.\n\nIn the distant background, a mountain range can be observed, providing a majestic silhouette against the sky which appears to have a gradient of colors likely from the setting or rising sun. The overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful, emphasized by the calm waters and soft, dimming light of the sky.","title":"Litter-strewn Lake Tahoe shore","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552311","547052","545911","552225","547027","543527","544126","545149","551312","551280","551258","544567","554552","543579","543604","543618"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dock","fuel","station","sign","marina","lakeside","pillar","plank","gradient","twilight"]}
