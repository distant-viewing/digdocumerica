{"path":"549207.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures an oil field featuring multiple pump jacks, also known as nodding donkeys, situated in a grassy landscape with rolling hills. In the foreground, a large, prominently visible pump jack is painted in black with portions accented in orange. This machine, which is used for extracting oil from underground, is operational, as indicated by its counterweight positioned upwards, suggesting a pumping action.\n\nBehind this central pump jack, the terrain gently rises, revealing additional pump jacks scattered across the landscape. These background pump jacks vary in size and appear smaller, contributing to a visual depth and indicating the expansive nature of this oil field. The area is sparsely vegetated with patches of green grass and small bushy plants, which is typical of semi-arid environments often found in oil-producing regions.\n\nThe sky appears overcast with soft, diffuse lighting, casting an even light across the scene without harsh shadows. Visibly, there are no human figures or moving vehicles, giving the scene a static but industrious feel, focusing solely on the industrial machinery and the natural landscape surrounding it. This kind of setting underscores the interaction between industrial activities and their rural locations, highlighting the extraction of natural resources.","title":"Oil wells near Teapot Dome, Wyoming","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549208","549209","546182","546135","549211","546179","545827","544272","555634","546201","545815","546064","545963","544512","555633","544390"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["pump","oil","black","extraction","field","kind","resource","machine","orange","action"]}
