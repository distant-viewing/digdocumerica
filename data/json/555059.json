{"path":"555059.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image portrays an intriguing natural pattern captured on what appears to be a wooden surface, possibly the cross-section of a tree trunk or a wooden plank. The photograph shows distinctive, curvilinear ridge-like patterns that create a network of lines and grooves across the surface. These patterns have a dark color, perhaps brown or black, contrasting against the lighter reddish-brown wood color.\n\nThe lines seem to flow dynamically across the frame, dividing the wood into various segments that somewhat resemble geographical contour lines on a map. The depth and texture visible in the grooves suggest that this pattern could be due to natural wood aging processes, such as the development of cracks or the growth patterns of the wood. \n\nThe composition of the photo focuses on capturing the detailed texture and flowing lines without any clear reference to scale, which adds a sense of abstraction and artistry to the image. There are no obvious signs of human activity or alteration; the photograph prioritizes the natural beauty and complexity of the wood's texture. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of organic elegance and the intriguing complexities hidden in natural materials.","title":"Trails made by beetles eating their way through a piece of dead Douglas fir bark in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557583","555141","555063","553586","545521","554604","553587","555101","552239","542749","544662","555194","551355","554974","544682","545288"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wood","groove","pattern","complexity","artistry","line","flow","texture","reference","elegance"]}
