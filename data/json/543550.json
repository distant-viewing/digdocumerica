{"path":"543550.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and icy landscape. It features a body of water, presumably a lake, partially covered with crystal-clear ice through which the lakebed is visible. The water is calm, reflecting the clear blue sky. The ice breaks abruptly into a vast expanse of deep blue water that fills the top portion of the frame and extends toward the horizon. \n\nBelow the surface, various-size rocks and boulders are scattered across the lakebed, adding a textured contrast to the smoothness of the ice. A notable detail is the presence of a dark line, possibly a cable or rope, cutting across the lakebed diagonally from the bottom of the frame, leading into the deeper water. This element adds a hint of mystery to the scene, suggesting human activity or infrastructure beneath the water.\n\nIn the background, a snow-capped mountain range stretches across the horizon, underlining the cold environment. The clear sky above and the absence of any human figures or wildlife suggest a quiet, desolate scene, likely captured during a cold season given the presence of ice.\n\nThe composition of the photograph emphasizes the intersection of human elements with the natural environment, symbolized by the submerged cable amidst the natural icy setting. The image displays a delicate balance between tranquility and the subtle human presence.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543533","543770","543532","543546","544721","545923","557180","555703","543761","552907","552917","552894","548034","543816","552974","555696"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["ice","icy","smoothness","presence","water","symbolize","underlin","mystery","boulder","cable"]}
