{"path":"552466.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene, expansive agricultural landscape. The most dominant feature is the vast field which is covered with neatly aligned rows of crops. The crops are young and green, indicating early growth stages. Several distinct tractor or vehicle tracks are visible, creating patterns in the field that draw the eye towards the distant horizon.\n\nIn the center of the image stands a solitary, large tree. This tree provides a focal point and adds a sense of scale and life to the scene. Its lush foliage suggests it is in full health and contrasts nicely with the otherwise flat terrain. Underneath and around the tree are what appear to be a few small structures, possibly related to farm operations or storage, although they are quite distant and details are minimal.\n\nThe horizon is flat, interrupted only by a few very distant trees or shrubs, reinforcing the vastness and open space of the agricultural environment. The sky fills the upper third of the image and is a uniform pale blue, devoid of clouds, which enhances the calm and tranquil mood of the landscape.\n\nThis photograph captures the essence of agricultural scenery, emphasizing openness, growth, and the rural beauty of farmland.","title":"Planted field in zearing","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["549181","554055","552484","544552","544481","552541","549141","554030","555641","554029","552858","545040","554027","554056","555618","549149"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","growth","interrupt","farmland","health","tractor","third","field","openness","tree"]}
