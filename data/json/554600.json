{"path":"554600.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a group of seagulls situated on a large mound of dark, earthy material, possibly soil or sand. The mound has several peaks and troughs, on which the seagulls are perched in various positions. Some of the seagulls are standing still, while others are captured in motion, with one notably spreading its wings as if it is about to take off or just landing.\n\nIn the background, there's a dense, dark forest with tall, coniferous trees providing a deep green contrast to the lighter, grayer tones of the mound in the foreground. The lighting suggests it might be an overcast day due to the lack of harsh shadows and the overall muted color palette of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the mound taking up a substantial portion of the lower frame and the forest filling the background, focuses attention on the interaction of the birds with their immediate environment, highlighting a moment of natural behavior among the group of seagulls. The scene is peaceful yet dynamic, capturing the essence of a wildlife moment in a possibly serene, secluded setting.","title":"Herring gulls (larus orgentatus) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["553347","543281","549738","549744","552146","552238","543282","543285","549772","544609","549757","557123","542919","547008","549758","544834"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seagull","mound","trough","behavior","landing","peanks","forest","wing","perch","group"]}
