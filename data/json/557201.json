{"path":"557201.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a nature scene during winter where the main focus is on tall, bent grasses, or similar vegetation, covered in a fresh layer of snow. The grasses are intertwined and overlapping in a somewhat chaotic manner, with each blade or stem heavily accentuated by the white snow clinging to it. The color palette consists mostly of the tans and browns of the dead vegetation contrasted starkly with the pure white of the snow.\n\nThe background is soft and slightly blurred, filled with similar snow-covered shrubs or bushes, which enhances the depth of the photo and emphasizes the cold, winter environment. The lighting appears natural and possibly taken during early daylight, as suggested by the soft blue hue and gentle shadows cast across the snow, creating a serene and peaceful winter ambiance. The photograph does not include any human or animal subjects, focusing solely on the quiet beauty of a winter landscape.","title":"Closeup of tail grass, big bluestem, covered with winter ice and snow at Lake Quivira, Kansas, near Kansas City.
