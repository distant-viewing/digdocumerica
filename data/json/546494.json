{"path":"546494.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a candid scene set in an urban environment, viewed through a large, shadowed passageway that frames the image. The photo depicts three individuals, possibly a family—two young girls and a woman—walking away from the viewer towards a street. The woman, walking on the right, holds hands with the smaller of the two girls, while the older girl walks independently on the left, carrying what appears to be a baseball bat.\n\nThe setting has a slight industrial feel, with buildings that show signs of wear and practical design. In the background, there is a two-story, brick building with large, rectangular windows, some of which are broken or boarded up. The words \"TRADE\" and \"NAPA\" can be seen on signs, suggesting the presence of commercial businesses in the area. The sidewalk is visible leading off into the distance, underlining the urban setting of the scene.\n\nThe use of shadow and natural lighting through the passageway creates a contrasting effect, highlighting the figures as they move into the lighter, more exposed area of the street. The composition uses architectural elements naturally to guide the viewer's eye from the darkened foreground through to the illuminated street, creating a sense of depth and perspective.","title":"Columbus post office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["555930","555909","556226","545415","549916","557898","557279","546525","546498","555895","556199","545315","552763","550145","545404","553497"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["girl","street","trade","baseball","viewer","woman","word","family","sidewalk","sign"]}
