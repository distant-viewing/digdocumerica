{"path":"552932.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man standing behind a glass door on which various messages are written in white. He is wearing a dark suit and glasses, and is waving from inside a room that looks like a shop or restaurant. The glass door is filled with handwritten text advertising food items like \"FISH,\" \"BAKED-HAM,\" and \"CHILI.\" At the bottom of the door, there’s a striking message about an emergency that reads, \"This is an EMERGENCY To EVACUATE SAT. MOR.\" which suggests a sense of urgency or a specific situational context. The surrounding area within the view behind the door is not well-lit, focusing the viewer’s attention primarily on the man and the writings on the door. The composition of the photograph, with its play of indoor light and shadow, along with the intriguing messages, evokes curiosity about the story behind this image.","title":"Evacuation notice painted on restaurant window.
