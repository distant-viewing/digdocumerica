{"path":"552201.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a logging operation in a forested area. The main focus is a large, heavy-duty logging machine with noticeable features such as long, curved mechanical arms resembling claws, which are likely used for lifting and maneuvering logs. This machine is positioned near a pile of logs, suggesting it is either in the process of stacking them or preparing to transport them.\n\nThe machine is bulky with a robust structure, painted in a faded yellow and sitting atop a muddy, slightly uneven terrain that has been cleared of vegetation, indicative of typical log handling or storage areas in forestry operations. Visible in the background are several tall pine trees against a light blue sky, indicating that this scene takes place in a rural or wilderness area.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it could either be early morning or late afternoon, as the sky has a soft brightness and there are long shadows cast on the ground. No people are visible in the scene, focusing the viewer entirely on the machinery and the logs, emphasizing the scale and nature of industrial logging activities.","title":"Log loader at work at Port of Olympia's log storage site","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554416","542624","554419","542790","554418","548155","542616","554417","556506","550337","552198","542623","542851","554434","554427","542852"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","machine","claw","operation","forestry","logging","pine","handling","duty","brightness"]}
