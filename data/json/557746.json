{"path":"557746.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene dominated by a large, two-story house with weathered wooden siding and a red tin roof. The architectural style includes a full-length porch adorned with latticework, running across the front of the house on both levels. The house is surrounded by lush greenery, including large trees and flowering shrubs near the porch, adding a vibrant natural frame to the residence.\n\nIn front of the house there is a well-tended garden patch, prominently featuring rows of vegetables which seem to be thriving. To one side of the house, a clothesline extends, with various items of laundry hung out to dry, suggesting daily domestic activity.\n\nThe setting also includes a glimpse of an old wooden barnlike structure and a glimpse of a vehicle, partially visible behind the natural and domestic elements, hinting at a self-sufficient, rural lifestyle. The entire scene is set under a bright, clear sky, indicating a sunny day, which casts natural light across the landscape, enhancing the colors and textures of the environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of peaceful rural living, with a touch of rustic charm and self-sufficiency evident in the cultivated garden and the laundry drying in the open air.","title":"Former travelers inn is now a private residence at nacoochee, Georgia, one and a half miles southwest of helen, a small mountain community of 270 people","placename":"Georgia","location":"Georgia","nn1":["550704","551091","548295","547861","556959","554697","546992","555611","547658","546439","555635","557669","557750","558110","546434","556961"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","self","laundry","garden","porch","dry","tin","clothesline","vegetable","glimpse"]}
