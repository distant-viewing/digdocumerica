{"path":"542969.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image features a close-up of a pink-tipped flower with a yellow center, likely a type of daisy, foregrounded against a blurred landscape. The flower is positioned in the lower right corner of the photograph, displaying detailed textures on its petals and the green leaves beneath. The background is heavily out of focus, comprising various shades of blue and white, which could be interpreted as a large body of water or a distant mountainous area, given the texture suggesting either waves or rugged terrain. There's a clear contrast between the sharply captured details of the flower and the almost abstract, color-blocked background, highlighting the flower's vivid colors and intricate form against a minimalistic backdrop. The overall atmosphere of the photograph includes a sense of serenity and natural beauty, emphasizing depth and scale.","title":"Wildflowers above beach near point arena lighthouse","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553997","543623","555189","557618","543597","547815","545699","549230","545706","553588","557167","544875","545695","553361","554840","554843"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","daisy","interpret","serenity","tip","petal","comprise","close","up","block"]}
