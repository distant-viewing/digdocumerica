{"path":"546696.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a unique aerial view from a railway helicopter, likely taken from inside the cockpit based on the visibility of the interior elements like overhead knobs or handles at the top of the frame. The central focus of the photograph is a railway yard sprawling across the middle, emphasized by numerous parallel train tracks densely filled with variably colored freight containers, creating a striking and colorful pattern from this elevation.\n\nTo the left, a highway with moving cars borders the railway yard, visually dividing the industrial area from the more residential parts depicted by clusters of houses extending towards the horizon. The urban landscape stretches far into the distance where the greenery of trees becomes more apparent, showing the blend of city infrastructure and vegetated areas.\n\nParticularly prominent in the foreground is the silhouette of a man on the right side of the frame, partially viewed from behind and side profile, looking out over the scene. The manâ€™s presence adds a human element to the otherwise mechanical and impersonal landscape below. His attire, notably a light-colored jacket, suggests a professional role, perhaps a pilot or a railway inspector, engaged in evaluating or overseeing the operations below.\n\nThe overall composition skillfully paints a narrative of industry, transportation, and urban development as observed through the eyes of someone in a position of oversight or control. The photograph is tinged with the hues typical of film photography of its time, providing a nostalgic element to the modern viewer.","title":"Penn central railroad yards seen from police helicopter","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547999","556692","556464","546719","547050","547140","556783","555742","556382","556852","548167","556873","546700","546627","556853","551006"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","yard","oversight","pilot","knob","cockpit","helicopter","freight","tinge","oversee"]}
