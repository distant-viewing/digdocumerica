{"path":"544076.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image captures a silhouette of a statue against a sunset backdrop. The statue appears to depict a figure, likely a soldier or similar, characterized by a distinct brimmed hat and a uniform that includes a cape or overcoat. The figure is in an upright position, holding what seems to be a rifle vertically, with the butt of the rifle touching the ground near the figure's feet.\n\nThe background features a bright, round sun that is low on the horizon, creating a warm glow that varies in color from yellow to deep orange and shades of brown. This soft, gradient sky dominates the background, with some silhouetted bushy vegetation at the bottom edge of the frame, suggesting the statue is placed in an outdoor setting.\n\nOverall, this composition utilizes lighting and silhouette to emphasize the form and pose of the statue, creating a stark contrast between the dark figure and the luminous background, evoking a sense of solemnity and reverence.","title":"Memorial to Father Kino, the 1st missionary to the Southwest","placename":"Nogales (Ariz.)","location":"Nogales, Arizona","nn1":["558115","553747","547337","555140","558114","558381","547716","554421","543417","548841","544427","548288","543127","554674","544423","553769"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["statue","rifle","figure","overcoat","reverence","solemnity","silhouette","foot","utilize","pose"]}
