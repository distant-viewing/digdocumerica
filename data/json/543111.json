{"path":"543111.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph shows a landscape scene featuring a system of open trenches on what appears to be a construction or excavation site. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a fairly deep, narrow trench with steep, earthen walls. Within this trench, two large corrugated metal pipes are partially visible; one is lying parallel to the trench, while the other is at an angle, suggesting they may be in the process of being installed or have been temporarily placed there.\n\nThe background offers a wide view of an expansive flat terrain under a misty or foggy sky, which limits visibility and adds a moody atmosphere to the scene. There is visible water accumulation in this area, indicative of wetlands or marshes. Small white structures, which appear to be related to construction or environmental monitoring, are scattered across the land. These structures are connected by dirt roads that curve through the landscape.\n\nThe overall setting seems to be in a rural or semi-wilderness area, possibly undergoing development or environmental management such as drainage or water management systems. The mood is somewhat dreary and subdued, likely due to the overcast sky and the nature of the muddy, excavated ground.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["549204","555559","547177","552814","543817","555629","543649","549118","549205","547949","544654","545680","558107","556940","547523","545676"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["trench","system","management","drainage","marsh","construction","monitoring","accumulation","wetland","excavation"]}
