{"path":"550577.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph showcases an aerial view of a river winding through a vast, mountainous landscape. The river, broad and sediment-laden, meanders prominently in an S-shape, cutting through the lush green terrain. The riverbanks are lined with dense forests, primarily coniferous, that blanket the surrounding foothills and valleys, contributing a deep green hue to the landscape.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and rugged, with a series of ridges and valleys that rise and fall throughout the scene. These hills display varying shades of green and brown, suggesting a mix of vegetation and possibly mineral-rich soil. In the background, the mountains progressively soften into the horizon, where lighter blue tints blend with the sky, indicating a vast and remote wilderness area.\n\nThere are no visible structures or human activities in this natural setting, emphasizing its pristine and untouched condition. The overall composition of the image with the river leading the viewer's eye through the frame, coupled with the undulating terrain, creates a dynamic and scenic aerial view of a natural, rugged environment.","title":"Salcha River crossing. The pipeline will descend the low hill in left center of the frame to cross the Salcha at the gently curved meander.
