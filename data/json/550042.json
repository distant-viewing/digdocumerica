{"path":"550042.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures the facade of a historic building characterized by its ornate architectural style. The building features multiple levels, each lined with large, arched windows framed by a rich red-orange structural outline. There are several floors visible, each following a similar pattern: a sequence of neatly aligned windows that are rounded at the top.\n\nThe standout architectural details include the pronounced arches over the windows and the decorative columns that separate each window. The building's exterior is a deep red or maroon, enriching its classic and elegant appearance. Some windows feature what appears to be broken glass, suggesting either disrepair or renovation.\n\nIn the center of the image, an American flag hangs prominently from one of the upper floors, adding a contrasting element of color—red, white, and blue—against the primarily dark red background. The presence of the flag provides a focal point and imbues the scene with a sense of patriotism and history.\n\nThe overall ambiance points to a potentially older urban area, possibly within a city rich in historical structures. The building could be a landmark or hold significant historical value given its distinctive architectural style and state of conservation.","title":"Fulton street, part of old wholesale market area","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550038","557073","557643","555949","556046","547295","552968","542815","558031","550107","557066","558162","557156","550024","545881","553422"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["window","flag","arch","patriotism","sequence","floor","renovation","value","maroon","imbue"]}
