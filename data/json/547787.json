{"path":"547787.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph features a young Black boy standing in what appears to be a sandy area, perhaps a yard or compound, with residential structures visible in the background. The boy is shirtless, displaying a tone of genuine happiness as he smiles broadly at the camera. He holds the waistband of his oversized jeans, which seem a few sizes too large for him, suggesting they might be hand-me-downs.\n\nThe background includes a series of small homes or shacks constructed from wood and metal materials, indicative of a low-income area. These houses appear modest, with one particularly in the midground marked by peeling paint and weathered wood siding. There's no visible greenery, just a dusty, sandy ground that covers the area.\n\nThe overall ambience of the photo, coupled with the boy's joyous expression and the simplicity of his surroundings, evokes a sense of resilience and cheerfulness despite potentially challenging living conditions.","title":"On ethel street, a black neighborhood in Longview, Texas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["544357","550249","555950","543688","545509","553553","544372","546967","553494","556558","553168","556163","548837","556166","545379","556301"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","income","down","compound","happiness","shack","wood","ambience","living","resilience"]}
