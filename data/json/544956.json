{"path":"544956.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene by the water under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, the ocean gently laps against a wooden pier, which shows some signs of wear and water damage. A few pilings emerge from the water, which are not attached to any visible structure, suggesting remnants of a former construction.\n\nNear the edge of the water, on the left side of the image, three swans swim gracefully, adding a natural and serene element to the otherwise industrial setting.\n\nLooking upward, the most dominating feature of this photograph is the large facility located on a hilltop adjacent to the water. The facility includes several complex structures, most notably a pair of towering grey smokestacks that stand out starkly against the cloudy sky. These smokestacks are connected by some scaffolding and there are various other industrial components visible, which could be part of a power plant or manufacturing plant.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a heavy, moody sky filled with dark and light clouds, hinting at the potential of an impending storm which provides a dramatic contrast to the industrial structures and adds a dynamic element to the scene. This sky also suggests a chillier climate or an approaching weather front. The juxtaposition of industrial and natural elements in this image poses a striking visual commentary, possibly on environmental themes.","title":"Pacific gas and electric plant","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["550344","545979","547084","545987","552179","546974","547172","544328","551576","550332","552194","543018","546083","550672","546087","548070"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smokestack","potential","piling","hilltop","manufacture","water","scaffolding","commentary","facility","storm"]}
