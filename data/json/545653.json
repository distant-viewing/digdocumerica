{"path":"545653.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a construction scene, likely focused on industrial or infrastructure work, in a rugged outdoor environment. Featured prominently is a large, mobile crane with a visible boom and a bucket at the end of it. The crane bucket is releasing a load of muddy material into the bed of a utility truck. The truck is dark-colored and has text on the door advertising \"GARCIA & SON\" along with a phone number and additional text that specifies a location in New Mexico (N.M.) and various license details.\n\nThe truck is labeled with the number 5 and it shows visible signs of wear and dirt, possibly from frequent use in construction settings. In the background, a more natural and stark landscape is visible, including a flat-topped mesa and a cloudy sky, which suggests that the photo might be taken in a desolate or sparsely populated area. The ground around the truck and crane is muddy with scattered equipment and debris, indicating recent rainfall or work in wet conditions. A small barrel also lies on the ground near the truck, emphasizing the industrious and perhaps hastily arranged nature of the work site.","title":"Unloading oil-laden debris from the San Juan River onto disposal site in Monument Valley, Utah. A burst pipeline near Shiprock, New Mexico, released some 285,000 gallons of crude oil into the river. The oil was carried 200 miles downstream before it was temporarily contained by a log boom made largely of telephone pole sections at the point where the San Juan flows into Lake Powell.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["557729","545655","547181","545648","550270","545660","544156","544157","544083","555593","548773","544134","550692","547922","550874","545649"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["truck","crane","bucket","work","number","text","mesa","phone","load","construction"]}
