{"path":"543520.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a surface covered with bubbles and moisture, potentially indicative of some form of biological or chemical activity. The texture and color of the surface beneath the bubbles appear somewhat rough and heterogeneous, with tones of orange, brown, and shades of gray. These suggest a possible organic origin, such as mud, wet soil, or a decomposing organic matter. The bubbles vary in size, and their translucent quality suggests they could be filled with air or gas, likely emitted from the substance below as part of a natural process such as fermentation or decomposition.\n\nThe overall composition focuses tightly on the details and textures of the surface and the bubbles, with natural light enhancing the reflections and complexities of the scene. The setting does not provide any immediate clues about the larger environment, keeping the viewerâ€™s attention on the intricate interaction between the bubbles and the substrate. The image captures a moment that emphasizes both the aesthetic qualities of natural processes and an invitation to ponder about the biological or chemical interactions occurring in the scene.","title":"Scum forms in water","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["552980","548089","545850","557626","552239","552983","546217","553582","555837","544992","545674","550606","550373","550837","543149","555841"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["bubble","chemical","origin","process","matter","surface","quality","substance","mud","moisture"]}
