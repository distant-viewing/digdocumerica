{"path":"548886.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic silhouette scene featuring an industrial tower, possibly part of a refinery or manufacturing plant, overlaid against an enormous, glowing setting sun. The sun, centralized in the frame, bathes the scene in a deep red and orange hue, accentuating the contrast of the silhouette. Dark smoke is visible issuing from the top of the silhouette structure, drifting leftwards against the sunlight. This creates an atmospheric effect and highlights environmental concerns associated with industrial activities. The sky around the sun transitions from a bright yellow at the center to a darker red toward the edges, possibly indicating pollution or just a very vivid sunset. The surrounding area is obscured by the darkness, focusing the viewer's attention purely on the interplay of the industrial silhouette and the radiant natural backdrop. The overall composition exudes a poignant blend of natural beauty and industrial impact.","title":"Sunset over fertilizer plant in El Centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548851","545418","544688","553847","544708","545421","546384","544684","545438","545425","547090","545414","544696","545446","555166","545410"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["silhouette","sun","refinery","darkness","concern","yellow","transition","sunset","red","interplay"]}
