{"path":"543888.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene, predominantly featuring the textured surface of water shimmering under sunlight. The image shows a body of water with numerous sunlit reflections scattered across its surface, which appear as brilliant, sparkling specks. These water reflections create a pattern that suggests the sun is either setting or rising.\n\nIn the background, towards the top third of the image, there is a small silhouette of a boat carrying at least one visible occupant. The boat is a simple, small craft that seems to be moving across the water. Its diminutive size against the vastness of the water adds a solitary, tranquil element to the scene.\n\nCompositionally, the photograph is vertically oriented with the boat positioned slightly towards the top, navigating from left to right. The surrounding area is entirely made up of water which takes up the entirety of the frame. This simplicity and minimalism focus attention on the interplay of natural light on water and the lone element of human activity. The image conveys a sense of isolation and the vastness of nature.","title":"Barge being moved by tug boat on the Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550914","552310","548247","551222","545900","557813","547276","543411","547556","543143","557255","547234","543880","552038","544663","549380"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","water","vastness","solitary","sparkl","entirety","reflection","occupant","speck","third"]}
