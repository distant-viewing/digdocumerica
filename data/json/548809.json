{"path":"548809.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and rustic beach scene. The foreground features a wooden picnic table and a large thatch umbrella, providing shade and a spot for relaxation. The table is weathered and appears functional, reflecting a well-used public beach area. Next to the table is a uniquely decorative trash can, brightly painted and topped with what looks like a character with a hat, adding a playful touch to the surroundings.\n\nTo the left, the image stretches out towards the coastline where a person, perhaps a child, is seen in a dynamic pose close to the shoreline, likely playing or bending over to pick up something. In the background, there's a dog standing by the water's edge, and a long pier extends into the calm sea, contributing a sense of depth and exploration to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is conveyed through overcast sky and calm waters, suggesting a tranquil and possibly breezy day at the beach. The simplicity of the scene invites a sense of quiet and relaxation, where human and animal activities blend gently into the natural setting.","title":"Beach at Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548812","544989","543493","548810","545162","543225","548757","548697","546953","547009","547034","543474","543078","548220","547607","555402"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["table","beach","relaxation","pick","picnic","umbrella","dog","coastline","pier","trash"]}
