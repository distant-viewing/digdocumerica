The individual is dressed for water activities, wearing orange-patterned swim shorts and is equipped with a snorkel mask pushed up onto his forehead and a swim fin in one hand, suggestive of recent or impending snorkeling. His expression is neutral as he looks directly at the camera.\n\nThe environment around him includes a coastline filled with uneven rocks and sparse vegetation visible in the background. The sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, indicating good weather conditions for outdoor activities. The sea is calm, reflecting a peaceful setting. This image likely portrays an enjoyable, recreational day at the beach, focused on water sports or exploration.","title":"On Saturday, schoolboys from Lanai City go out to dive for octopus--a delicacy which represents good money if sold to local markets.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["548734","552290","553783","557481","548622","546298","545077","553780","543492","548714","553953","545086","554009","548724","551544","553782"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["swim","snorkel","beach","forehead","impend","fin","mask","push","foot","male"]}
