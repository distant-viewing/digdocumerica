{"path":"557852.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a vehicle service station, with a strong focus on maintenance activities. Three men are visible, each engaged in different tasks related to car servicing. The composition reveals a large garage area with multiple service bays, each covered by an extended metal roof supported by columns.\n\nOn the left, one man stands beside an open equipment cabinet that houses various tools or machinery, possibly diagnostic or electrical equipment, observing or taking something from it. He is dressed in a dark shirt and pants, adopting a stance that suggests he might be selecting tools or checking equipment.\n\nIn the center and right of the image, two other men are tending to a tan sedan, which is parked within a bay marked by yellow lines on the floor. The man on the right, wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, is using a hose or a high pressure washer, possibly cleaning or performing some form of maintenance at the rear end of the car. Meanwhile, another man directly next to him, dressed similarly in a light blue shirt and darker pants, is engaged in an activity at the front end of the vehicle. He appears to be either examining something within the engine bay or preparing to perform maintenance.\n\nThe overall environment in the garage is industrial and functional, with concrete floors that show signs of wear and oil stains. Fluorescent lights overhead provide ample illumination. The setting is utilitarian, with considerations for practical work and efficiency. The walls are paneled with vertical green corrugated sheets, contributing to the typical garage aesthetics.\n\nOverall, the photograph effectively conveys a sense of busy, everyday mechanical work, highlighting the collaborative efforts of the mechanics tuned to the upkeep and performance of automobiles.","title":"Overall view of the safety lane at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. One employee of the public works department asks questions and gives directions to the driver while checking the horn, windshield wipers and turn signals. A second employee operates the exhaust probe and reads the analyzer, and a third looks at the tires and removes outdated inspection stickers. The station handled 800 vehicles or more daily during the peak period after the regulation went into effect.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["542763","557906","557885","557902","557858","557845","557893","557911","557905","546632","557884","557853","553490","557861","557897","557850"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["garage","bay","maintenance","pant","end","equipment","service","tool","man","floor"]}
