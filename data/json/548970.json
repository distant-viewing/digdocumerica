{"path":"548970.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a large, illuminated sign for an establishment called \"Adult Center\" which is announced to be open 24 hours. Above this main sign is a smaller, similar design with the text \"Adult Center\" next to a red apple icon, reinforcing the establishment's name and hours. Below the main sign is another prominent sign with the word \"Peekarama\" in bold red letters, also declared to be open 24 hours. The signs are adorned with many small light bulbs, typical of a nighttime business advertisement designed to attract attention.\n\nThe photograph is taken during twilight or early evening as suggested by the sky's fading light, providing a somewhat dim and moody background. The surroundings are also faintly visible, including what appears to be the silhouette of trees and possibly other distant objects in a relatively indistinct horizon. The emphasis of the image is clearly on the bright, colorful signage against the darker, less detailed background.","title":"Signboards in Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["551321","555424","551322","554185","542894","545462","549015","549009","551495","549017","555404","555439","549014","555381","555410","547021"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["hour","establishment","sign","announce","distant","bulb","call","attract","fading","advertisement"]}
