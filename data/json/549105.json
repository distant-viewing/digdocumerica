{"path":"549105.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment of a child playing by the water at the beach. The child, appearing to be around toddler age, is attentively crouching near the water's edge. This young individual is stylishly dressed in a horizontally striped t-shirt paired with what seem like light-colored shorts, dark socks, and black shoes. The child is also wearing a cap, which adds to the playful and youthful charm of the scene.\n\nThe child reaches out, possibly attempting to touch or catch the water as it laps onto the shore, composed of small smooth stones and pebbles. The interaction between the child's innocent curiosity and the natural environment emphasizes a theme of exploration and discovery.\n\nThe background of the photograph features calm water that reflects a subtle play of light, blending into a hazy horizon that could be slightly overexposed in the image, giving it a dreamy quality. This serene setting, together with the childâ€™s engagement, creates a picturesque and peaceful moment captured in time.\n\nThe overall composition, with soft lighting and a focused depth of field that blurs the background, draws attention primarily to the child and the immediate action. This aids in portraying a sense of intimacy and immediacy, inviting viewers to reflect on simple pleasures and moments of childlike wonder.","title":"Trying the water at Lake Mead.
