{"path":"550954.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a view of a large double-decker bridge crossing over a broad river. The bridge is a truss style, painted in a dark color which contrasts with the lighter sky and water. On the upper deck of the bridge, a few vehicles including a truck are visible, suggesting this deck is used for road traffic. Below, the sheer size of the bridge is emphasized by its sturdy pillars embedded in the water, supporting each segment.\n\nThe backdrop of the image shows a hazy skyline, likely of a city, with buildings that are mostly obscured by the atmospheric conditions, possibly fog or industrial haze. This also gives the river a greyish-blue tone. The lower part of the photograph captures the calm surface of the river, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a functional industrial landscape, likely capturing the intersection of transportation and urban development near a water body. The atmosphere suggests it might be early morning or a cloudy day, which adds a moody, serene quality to the scene.","title":"The Kanawha River bridges (railroad bridge in background)","placename":"Charleston (W.
