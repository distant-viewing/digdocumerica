{"path":"544801.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a scene from a landfill or dumpsite. The site is filled with various types of waste including old cars, scattered paper trash, and miscellaneous debris. In the foreground, a prominently visible crumpled car door and a tattered cardboard box labeled \"IDAHO POTATOES\" can be seen among other smaller pieces of waste. Several damaged and rusted vehicles are visible across the scene, emphasizing the disposal of large items in the landfill.\n\nIn the background, there is a residential area with numerous houses close together, viewed across an expansive open ground. This provides a stark contrast between human habitation and waste disposal grounds. Additionally, utility poles and lines stretch across the skyline. The landscape is flat and open under a clear sky, which suggests the photo was taken on a bright sunny day.\n\nIn the middle ground, a group of people can be seen at the far right of the image; they appear to be standing beside a red vehicle, possibly engaged in some activity, likely related to waste management or scavenging. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, demonstrating interaction with the environment, albeit in a context of waste disposal and recycling efforts.","title":"Jefferson County open dump.
