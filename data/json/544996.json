{"path":"544996.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photo captures a picturesque landscape focused on a small white lighthouse situated on a rugged, rocky headland. Approaching the lighthouse is a narrow dirt path which meanders along the ridge of the cliff. To the left of the path lies dense forestation, likely a mix of pine trees or similar evergreens, creating a lush green backdrop to the scene.\n\nThe cliff itself features a dramatic drop to the ocean below where tumultuous white waves crash against the dark, jagged rocks on the shore. The sea appears energetic, underscored by the white foam that crowns the waves, indicating a potentially windy or tumultuous weather.\n\nThe sky is clear, imbuing the scene with bright natural light that enhances the natural colors of the landscapeâ€”greens of the trees, grays and blacks of the rocky cliffs, and the deep blue of the churning ocean. This location conveys both a sense of isolation and rugged beauty, typical of coastal light stations which are often situated in remote areas to aid maritime navigation. The overall composition of the photograph, with the lighthouse standing sentinel over the wild landscape, evokes a feeling of tranquility and the enduring human presence within nature.","title":"Lighthouse on north spit of Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["543086","550361","550362","543403","543141","545226","549375","546151","545118","543291","547131","550314","543080","543061","543426","547916"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","cliff","forestation","ocean","wave","crown","situate","evergreen","path","churn"]}
