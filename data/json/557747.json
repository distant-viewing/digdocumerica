{"path":"557747.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene in a rural setting, taken during what appears to be early morning or late evening, as suggested by the soft, diffuse light and misty conditions. The focal point of the image is a large farm area housing several structures and animals.\n\nIn the foreground, various grasses and plants are slightly blurred, indicating they are closer to the camera. This creates a natural frame for the scene beyond. The middle ground is occupied by a flock of sheep, grazing on a lush green field. These sheep are interspersed across the landscape, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting.\n\nDominating the middle ground are two long buildings. The building on the left is larger and has a metallic roof that reflects the dim light, suggesting it might be used for storage or as a livestock barn. The smaller building on the left could serve as an additional animal shelter or storage shed.\n\nThe background is composed of rolling hills partially shrouded in mist, enhancing the serene and moist atmosphere of the landscape. Trees can be seen sporadically throughout the hills, with denser foliage to the left side of the frame. This rural scene is enclosed by a backdrop of low mountains or large hills, contributing to the secluded and peaceful feel of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition imbues a sense of calm rural life, with elements of agriculture and livestock management, all set in a lush, green environment that is typical of temperate climates.","title":"Cattle and a building on the Comer Vandiver farm on Georgia Highway 17/75 one mile south of Helen, which is near Robertstown. Helen was a typical small mountain community of some 270 people until 1969. At that time the local officials, businessmen, and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian alpine theme. Success of the project led to new development and attracted tourists. Property valuation increased from $1,484,775 to $3,364,703 between 1970 and 1974.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546102","554779","554928","552556","555820","544933","547309","555577","549142","549256","556963","554560","551305","557749","550833","554887"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","livestock","animal","hill","storage","flock","shelter","shed","agriculture","barn"]}
