{"path":"546186.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an older man sitting inside the partially open back of a van, which is filled with a wide variety of items, giving the impression of a mobile workshop or a collector's haven. The man, wearing a light beige shirt and a grayish cap, holds a small white object in his hand and seems to be in the midst of either organizing or looking for something specific. His expression is somewhat serious and focused.\n\nThe interior of the van is intricately packed with tools, pieces of hardware, and an array of various objects including books which are placed in a makeshift shelf on the inside of the door. Each surface and available space inside the van is utilized, with items hanging from hooks, piled on top of each other, and wedged into available gaps. There are exposed wires, metallic tools, and what appear to be electrical components.\n\nThe image suggests a sense of ordered chaos; though it looks cluttered, there might be a system in place known only to the man in the picture. The van’s exterior and environment are not visible, focusing the viewer’s attention entirely on the man and the contents of the van. The colors are vivid, with a contrast between the earthy tones of the man’s attire and the metallic and varied hues of the items in the van. This setting gives the photograph a rich textural quality that accentuates the man’s connection to his surroundings.","title":"Mayor casey in the truck that is his traveling \"office.\"  He uses the doors for his \"files.\"","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["548252","547427","546176","556547","548999","557913","558356","548455","547353","555956","546092","553090","549058","547883","555532","557765"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["van","man","item","tool","hardware","gaps","inside","hook","grayish","order"]}
