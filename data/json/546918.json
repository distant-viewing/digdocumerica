{"path":"546918.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene at what appears to be a shipping or container terminal. A man is centered in the frame, dynamically positioned as if caught mid-motion. He is wearing a light-colored hard hat, a light windbreaker, and dark trousers. His facial expression conveys focus and determination. He is pointing toward something out of frame, perhaps giving directions or highlighting an area of concern to a colleague not visible in the image. His other hand holds some sheets of paper, possibly work orders or shipping manifests.\n\nThe background is filled with stacked metal shipping containers. They are marked with various shipping codes and numbers, suggesting they are destined for international transport. These containers are weathered, hinting at frequent use and long journeys. The scene is framed by a metal railing, adding to the industrial feel of the photograph.\n\nThis image captures a working environment, emphasized by the safety gear worn by the man and the functional appearance of his surroundings. The man’s active gesture and focused demeanor suggest he’s deeply engaged with his duties, overseeing or coordinating the movements and logistics of the cargo containers. The scene effectively conveys a moment of daily operations in a busy industrial or commercial hub.","title":"Unloading container cargo at dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546796","557110","546910","546762","546915","555261","546914","546881","546861","546917","556391","544835","544161","555279","551046","555283"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["shipping","container","code","determination","colleague","terminal","order","coordinate","oversee","logistic"]}
