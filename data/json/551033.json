{"path":"551033.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a factory complex under a gloomy sky. Smoke billows into the air from several tall stacks, hinting at heavy industrial activity. This dense cloud of smoke adds a foreboding atmosphere to the scene. In the foreground, the image shows a road lined with various structures and foliage leading towards the factory.\n\nThe roadway itself is nearly empty, except for a few vehicles, including a prominently displayed older white car parked on the right side of the road. The architecture in the vicinity appears old and somewhat dilapidated, contributing to the industrial decay theme. Numerous power lines and utility poles crisscross the sky further cluttering and emphasizing the industrial setting.\n\nOn the left of the road, glimpses of green from bushes or trees peek into the frame, juxtaposing a bit of nature against the predominantly man-made environment. A billboard is partially visible in the mid-ground on the left, but the content is unclear, adding a touch of everyday commerce into the industrial narrative.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of industry, transportation, and a trace of nature, enveloped in a somber, perhaps polluted atmosphere.","title":"The Du Pont chemical plant at Belle pollutes the early morning air.","placename":"Charleston (W.
