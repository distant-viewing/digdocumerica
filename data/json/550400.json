{"path":"550400.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is an aerial or satellite image depicting a striking natural landscape. It primarily features a large, deep-blue lake situated in what appears to be a rugged and arid terrain. The lake has a roughly oval shape, surrounded by land that displays various shades of browns, tans, and reddish colors, indicating a dry, possibly desert-like environment. \n\nTo the north of the large lake, thereâ€™s a much smaller lake or pond, exhibiting a dark color, perhaps due to its depth or the minerals dissolved in the water. Intricate patterns of erosion are visible around the terrain, showing a network of dried riverbeds or water channels that once carried water, suggesting this area might undergo seasonal changes in water flow.\n\nThese channels have created a fascinating texture on the landscape, with their detailed branch-like structures extending southward from the lake. Such patterns may indicate previous water activity that has shaped the topography over time.\n\nThe south-central part of the image shows a clear contrast where a river-like body winds through the landscape, its edges marked by significantly greener vegetation compared to the surrounding areas, possibly indicating more fertile soil or consistent moisture presence.\n\nOverall, the photograph strikingly captures a distinct and possibly remote natural environment from an aerial perspective, highlighting the striking contrasts between water, dry land, and vegetation.","title":"Small glacial lake, a tarn, near the pipeline route at the foot of the brooks range","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["548974","555705","549074","552426","543761","552902","555712","555695","545636","548944","557533","550740","555683","555388","555860","555703"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["lake","channel","water","tan","riverbed","shape","undergo","land","topography","moisture"]}
