{"path":"542719.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an airplane in flight, shown against a plain, overcast sky. The airplane, which features a white fuselage with a blue stripe along its length, is depicted from a rear three-quarter view. It is in the process of descent or ascent, with its landing gears visibly retracted. Notably, the aircraft is emitting a thick, dark trail of smoke from the rear, which stands out against the muted, grayish background of the sky, hinting at engine exhaust or possibly a malfunction. Overall, the composition centers the aircraft in the frame, focusing on the contrast between the clean design of the plane and the harshness of the emitted smoke against the soft, featureless backdrop.","title":"Fumes from jet","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542717","542793","542718","547824","542720","547810","542500","548883","542501","544606","548215","544491","556005","549072","542577","549621"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","aircraft","ascent","quarter","descent","harshness","landing","exhaust","smoke","plane"]}
