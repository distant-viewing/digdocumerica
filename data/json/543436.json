{"path":"543436.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a beautiful coastal scene, predominantly showing a dramatic view of a rugged coastline and a classic arched bridge. The time of day appears to be either morning or evening, as suggested by the warm light casting golden hues on the landscape.\n\nOn the left side of the image lies a steep cliff, rich in rusty red and orange colors, that descends sharply into the ocean where the waves break against the rocks, creating white foams. Nestled on top of this cliff, there are a few small buildings which seem like houses or shelters, suggesting a remote habitation. This side of the scene is completed by a visible winding road that seems to lead down to or away from the houses, partially covered by the undulating terrain.\n\nThe main architectural feature dominating the scene is the large, elegant bridge in the middle of the image. This bridge has two prominent arches that span a deep gorge, with its structure made of concrete and possibly steel, denoting a form of 20th-century engineering. The bridge seamlessly integrates into the landscape, linking the two rugged headlands apart from each other.\n\nTo the right of the bridge, the coastline continues its dramatic course, curving inward to form a small cove. The shore below is visible as a mix of sandy beach and rocky outcrops. The ocean here appears calmer, and there is a notable contrast between the dark blue of deeper waters and the lighter shades near the shore.\n\nBeyond the immediate coastal features, the background is composed of further mountainous or highland regions, suggesting a continous rugged terrain with sparse vegetation, typifying a coastal ecosystem. This whole scene is enveloped by a clear blue sky with no apparent clouds, highlighting the serene and isolated nature of this coastal environment.","title":"Cave and bridge, California coast","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543313","542804","543424","547828","543435","543433","543300","543249","543068","543431","543184","543328","543085","543291","543304","543297"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["bridge","coastline","cliff","gorge","ocean","cove","shore","house","course","outcrop"]}
