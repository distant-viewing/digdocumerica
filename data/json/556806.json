{"path":"556806.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an urban scene featuring two buses on a street. The buses, numbered 4115 and 4157, are traveling on parallel lanes of a divided road. The buses are long and predominantly white with bold, colorful stripes in red, blue, and gold along their sides.\n\nTo one side of the street, there is a pedestrian sidewalk with a few people walking, trees lining the side, and some street lamps. On the other side of the buses, adjacent to the pedestrian path, there are parked cars and a small plaza-like area with a distinctive statue forming abstract, curved shapes, which could be an art installation.\n\nThe setting appears overcast, judging by the subdued lighting and absence of shadows on the ground, suggesting either an early morning or rainy day. The high vantage point of the image provides a comprehensive view of this small section in the city, encapsulating a moment of daily urban life with a focus on public transportation and city architecture.","title":"Overhead view of metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) buses in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
