{"path":"554546.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene centered around a large body of water, likely a man-made reservoir or lake. The water is calm, reflecting a light blue sky scattered with cumulus clouds. On the near shore, there's a stony embankment with sparse vegetation including small bushes and grasses.\n\nTo the left of the image, large mounds of barren, brown earth, possibly soil or mining spoil, dominate the landscape. These piles have different textures, some smooth and others more rough and ridged, suggesting recent excavation or dumping activity.\n\nThe background features gently rolling hills, mostly covered in lush green forest. This natural backdrop contrasts distinctly with the stark, open industrial excavation site.\n\nIn the middle right of the image, there's a narrow road or path curving around the water's edge, leading towards a black structure -- possibly an old utility shed or a small building related to the site's operations.\n\nOverall, the scene likely portrays a mining, construction, or earth-moving activity, with significant environmental impact evident from the large accumulations of displaced earth and the infrastructure that encroaches on a natural setting. The exact location and purpose of this site aren't clear from the image alone, but it appears to be a significant scale operation.","title":"Water-filled pit is the result after a dragline dredged materials to be used in making blacktopping, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552427","544569","552169","556504","552258","555591","544527","551532","552425","545854","551576","546073","543717","551611","544788","548644"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["earth","site","excavation","mining","cumulus","she","encroach","reservoir","embankment","dump"]}
