{"path":"550270.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction or industrial scene, primarily featuring a large green dump truck in the process of tipping its load. The truck is positioned to the right side of the frame, with the front cab facing the left side and the dump body elevated towards the right, suggesting it is unloading its contents onto the ground. The ground itself appears muddy and heavily textured, indicating wet conditions, possibly from recent rain or from the nature of the material itself, which looks like dark soil or waste material.\n\nThe background of the scene shows a somewhat barren landscape with minimal vegetation, consisting of grass and sparse shrubs, extending into the distance under an overcast sky. A crane, or similar heavy machinery, is faintly visible in the distance, implying ongoing large-scale activities in the area. The terrain's uneven features, characterized by mounds and indentations filled with dark material, support the interpretation of an active industrial or construction site. The overall setting evokes a sense of isolation and focused industrial work, removed from urban or populated areas.","title":"Reclaiming strip-mined land of the Keller Coal Company near Alliance with sludge from Cleveland's Southerly Disposal Unit","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547922","550266","547232","542538","555636","553041","543896","544083","549956","545677","549743","547523","553378","544135","545653","547243"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["dump","material","truck","interpretation","cab","load","construction","content","mound","rain"]}
