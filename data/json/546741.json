{"path":"546741.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers a broad aerial view of a bustling urban landscape, capturing a moment that showcases both infrastructure and architecture. Central to the composition is a multi-lane highway, busy with vehicular traffic, which meanders from the foreground towards the horizon line, ultimately leading the eye towards a distinct obelisk, the Washington Monument.\n\nThe infrastructure glimpse provided by the shot shows multiple lanes of traffic; some densely packed with cars, while others are relatively sparse. Differing speeds and traffic densities suggest the picture was taken during a period of transition, perhaps early morning or late afternoon. Parallel to the highway, thereâ€™s a less busy road bordered on one side by modest residential or office buildings.\n\nThe background is defined by a panoramic view of a cityscape, dominated by the svelte profile of the Washington Monument standing centrally in the mid-distance, providing a strong focal point. Surrounding the monument, low-rise buildings sprawl across the landscape, interspersed with patches of greenery. Beyond the built-up area, the panorama extends to a tree-lined horizon that fades into a hazy sky, possibly indicating humidity or pollution.\n\nVisually, the photograph is marked by muted tones; the overcast sky casts a soft light, reducing contrasts and softening shadows. The image not only documents an urban environment but also subtly hints at the daily rhythm of city life, illustrating the flow and congestion of traffic and the sprawling nature of urban development.","title":"Southwest Freeway","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546692","546570","547267","546679","546585","547228","546693","546577","547226","546713","547780","546678","553838","546707","546704","546584"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["traffic","highway","panorama","humidity","rhythm","monument","congestion","infrastructure","speed","horizon"]}
