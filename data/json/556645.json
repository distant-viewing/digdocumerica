{"path":"556645.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a modern-looking two-story house set in a snowy landscape. The house has a geometric design with several large windows and a flat roof. The exterior is primarily clad in wood, giving it a warm appearance against the cold, white snow.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a variety of wild shrubs and plants, partially covered with snow, suggesting a natural and slightly rugged terrain. The plants appear dormant, indicative of the winter season.\n\nThe background behind the house shows a clear blue sky and another snowy hill which has a few visible tracks, possibly from vehicles or people moving around in the area. No figures or animals are visible in this scene, emphasizing the solitude and possibly remote location of the house.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph with vivid blue skies, a stark house design, and the natural, snowy surroundings creates a contrast between human habitation and the wilderness. The image conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility, with the house appearing as a shelter or oasis in the cold environment.","title":"Completed picture of the experimental all-aluminum beer and soft drink can house near Taos, New Mexico. It took about 70,000 cans to complete the two-story structure. The cans were laid horizontally in two thicknesses, separated by a vertical sheet of foam insulation. The technique of laying the cans is easily learned, eliminating the need for costly skilled labor. Many of the cans came from a nearby bar at a cost of 15 cents a case for architect Michael Reynolds.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["554232","556644","543526","554233","552986","557327","557326","557669","556629","544448","553458","543543","543587","554549","554213","554721"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","snow","oasis","shelter","plant","habitation","design","winter","exterior","clothe"]}
