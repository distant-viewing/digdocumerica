{"path":"549698.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"The photograph features a group of individuals participating in a historical reenactment, likely from the Civil War era, given their attire and accoutrements. The participants are dressed in uniforms that are reminiscent of 19th-century military regalia, complete with dark coats, light trousers, and black hats. Several are carrying flags, including American flags that have a limited number of stars, suggesting an historical setting. \n\nThe group is arranged in a formation that suggests a ceremonial or parade context, which is reinforced by the presence of spectators in contemporary clothing scattered in the background. There is a gazebo, also hinting that the event takes place in a park or a similarly public venue. The atmosphere appears formal and organized, with participants holding their positions attentively.\n\nThe natural setting features lush greenery and trees, providing a vivid and peaceful backdrop to the historical scene being enacted. This contributes to the contrast between the military reenactment and the casual leisure of the spectators. The clear, sunny weather and the meticulous uniforms add to the vibrancy of the image. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of living history, connecting past and present in a public, outdoor setting.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, June 24, 1973, is held on the Greenfield Village green adjoining the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549699","558274","549701","549700","549705","549729","549735","549697","558273","558277","558275","558276","549736","558271","550766","549703"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["reenactment","spectator","participant","flag","uniform","gazebo","parade","past","venue","star"]}
