{"path":"553509.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of a young girl with a joyful expression. She is smiling broadly, her eyes squinting slightly with delight. The girl has long, tousled dark brown hair blowing slightly in the wind. Her cheeks are slightly flushed, and there are light freckles visible across her nose and cheeks. The background of the image is a soft, out-of-focus bluish-grey, providing a simple, unobtrusive backdrop that emphasizes her features and expression. There are no other people or objects in the frame, focusing all attention on the girl's face and expression.","title":"Diane Watkins, 9, one of 9 brothers and sisters of the Watkins family of Mulky Square.
