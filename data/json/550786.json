{"path":"550786.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene wetland scene. The foreground prominently features clear water, exposing smooth, round stones submerged beneath the surface and bordered by dense green grass. Above the water, floating clusters of lily pads can be seen.\n\nIn the middleground, the focus shifts slightly with the inclusion of several waterlogged tree stumps and a fallen log covered in bright green vegetation. This depicts a likely habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.\n\nThe background extends into a larger body of water that appears calm, reflecting scattered clouds in the sky above. In the distance, the edge of the waterway is lined with tall, dense trees that form a natural barrier, creating a secluded and peaceful natural environment.\n\nThe composition of the image, with its layered elements from clear water to dense foliage, effectively conveys a sense of tranquility and the lush, vibrant life typical of wetland ecosystems.","title":"Reckless logging in the 19th century desTroyed much of the great white pine forests of the north.
