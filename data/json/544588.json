{"path":"544588.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The image features a dense cluster of lily pads floating on a dark water surface. The lily pads are primarily heart-shaped with some rounder edges, displaying a range of green shades. Each pad is dotted with droplets of water, which are likely from a recent rainfall or dew, adding a shiny, textured appearance to their surface.\n\nThe background shows a glimpse of a natural water body's bank, densely covered with dark green vegetation, possibly reeds or grasses, suggesting a freshwater habitat like a pond or slow-moving river. The lighting indicates that the photo was likely taken during the day under natural sunlight, enhancing the vividness and color vibrancy of the lily pads and their aquatic environment. The overall composition focuses on the lily pads, filling the frame, and highlights the tranquility and lush characteristics of a water-based ecosystem.","title":"Northern edge of Everglades National Park, Florida--near the taMiami trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544592","555080","544474","550809","543598","554583","554584","547639","550808","545387","558095","557587","547509","542554","555044","550786"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pads","freshwater","sha","dew","heart","droplet","reed","rainfall","shiny","vividness"]}
