{"path":"549306.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph depicts a dilapidated old barge semi-submerged by the waterside. The barge appears to be rustic and abandoned, its surface cluttered with debris and remnants of wood, as well as some rusted metal elements adding to its decrepit condition. Visible on its bow are several shaped metal structures, possibly part of its former mooring or operational equipment. One prominent feature is a thick rope that extends from the barge into the water, suggesting that it might still be anchored to something below the waterline or ashore.\n\nThe surrounding water is dark and quite polluted, visibly containing more floating bits of wood, debris, and other detritus, which gives an unkempt and neglected atmosphere to the scene. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the barge, the background reveals a more industrial setting with other docks or piers extending into the water. There are complex constructions along these docks, indicating ongoing activities or storage related to the waterway's usage.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somewhat bleak and desolate, emphasizing themes of decay, abandonment, and environmental neglect. This scene might reflect issues related to industrial decline or environmental mismanagement in waterfront areas.","title":"Rusting barge and its debris afloat on the Hudson River at a dock near the World Trade Center, in lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547622","551985","547582","551979","547594","548356","547626","548105","546887","547584","551984","548357","550201","547581","549307","547572"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["barge","dock","neglect","waterline","detritus","mooring","wood","decline","relate","anchor"]}
