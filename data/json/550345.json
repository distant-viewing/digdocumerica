{"path":"550345.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape, likely a wetland or marsh area. The foreground features a muddy path that cuts through the scene, filled with puddles of water reflecting light and scattered with debris, including small stones and pieces of wood. A prominent fallen log lies across the path, serving as a natural barrier that partially blocks the way.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows lush green grass and tufts of reeds or tall grass, giving the area a wild and untended look. These plants are dense and appear to be thriving, suggesting a wet environment conducive to such growth.\n\nIn the background, the scene is bordered by a line of thin, tall trees or bushes that further emphasize the marshy character of the location. These trees stand relatively bare compared to the dense undergrowth, possibly indicating a change in the type of vegetation or land usage beyond this point.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is quiet and untouched, with the natural elements dominating the landscape. The light appears to be ample, possibly suggesting a daytime setting with clear weather, although the specific details of the sky are not visible in the frame. The composition and elements together create a sense of secluded wilderness, typical of a wetland ecosystem.","title":"Leachings from Georgia pacific paper company's waste bark and chemicals pollute a tributary of the st.
