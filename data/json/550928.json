{"path":"550928.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful beach scene. In the foreground, there is a cluster of people under large, numbered beach umbrellas, which are striped in colors such as green, yellow, and blue. The umbrellas provide shade for groups of beachgoers seated on folding chairs around small, portable tables. These tables are scattered with an array of beach day essentials such as bags, coolers, and snacks.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman in a black one-piece swimsuit is in the process of setting up or folding a beach chair, her expression focused on the task. Next to her, a man wearing a white tank top and a hat is seated facing the camera, seemingly resting or observing the scene.\n\nIn the center and to the right, a group of three adults is seated under an umbrella with the number “953” prominently displayed. One of them, a woman, is engaged in conversation with a man who is embracing her, suggesting a moment of affection or a casual conversation. Another woman sits beside them, looking towards the right side of the frame. Their surroundings are filled with numerous other beach-goers, mostly seated and engaged in various leisure activities, contributing to a sense of a crowded and vibrant beach setting.\n\nThe background is filled with more umbrellas and people, indicating the popularity of the location. The sandy beach stretches out to meet a clear sky, hinting at a warm, sunny day, ideal for beach activities. The atmosphere is lively, with people dressed in typical beachwear of the era, portraying a scene of relaxation and social interaction typical of a busy public beach.","title":"Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island, one of the area's most popular summer playgrounds.","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["547503","554160","546794","550931","548541","547491","546768","550932","546874","546942","553685","553686","550936","550933","547628","547482"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["beach","umbrella","chair","table","essential","cooler","popularity","woman","affection","goer"]}
