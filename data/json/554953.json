{"path":"554953.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a man wearing safety goggles and a hard hat. The man appears to be middle-aged, with facial hair, and his skin and clothes are covered in dust or dirt, suggesting he might be a worker engaged in physical labor, possibly construction or mining. The goggles are large, covering the majority of his face, and look a bit dusty or smeared, emphasizing the harsh conditions of his environment. He wears a light-colored hard hat which also appears to be dusty.\n\nThe man's expression is neutral but carries a sense of seriousness, indicative of either concentration or fatigue. The background is out-of-focus, but hints of industrial or construction settings are visible based on the vaguely discernible structures and machinery.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the textures on his face and clothing, adding to the ruggedness of the scene. The close framing on the manâ€™s face centralizes the focus on his expression and the protective gear he wears, reflecting themes of labor, protection, and possibly the challenging conditions under which he works.","title":"Worker from mexico wears goggles to protect his eyes from dust at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["547163","553610","544171","542783","553609","556391","558312","556867","553634","553618","544382","556345","556428","544835","556599","546032"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["goggles","labor","face","seriousness","man","construction","dusty","hat","majority","protection"]}
