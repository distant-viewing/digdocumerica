{"path":"554720.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees. The image is focused on a winding dirt trail that cuts through the center of the frame, bordered by an array of greens and earth tones from the surrounding vegetation. The trail appears lightly used, indicated by the grass and moss encroaching upon its edges, suggesting a peaceful, natural location that is less frequented by visitors.\n\nThe ground along the path is a blend of soil, rock, and patches of bare rock, which hint at a possibly rocky terrain beneath the forest floor. Small shrubs and young trees line the trail, complemented by mature trees that stand taller, their trunks stretching up beyond the top frame of the image. \n\nThe lighting suggests it might be either morning or late afternoon, as the light gently diffuses through the trees, highlighting the texture of the bark and leaves subtly. There is no human presence visible in the frame, reinforcing the sense of tranquility and untouched natural beauty. The composition and natural light contribute to a calm, inviting atmosphere, inviting observers to imagine the quiet sounds of the forest scene.","title":"Dwarfed forest growing on flat rocks \"pavement\" at lake champlain.
