{"path":"549839.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene, primarily dominated by a large pile of trash in the foreground. The trash consists of several bags and some cardboard, varying in color from yellow to black, with one notably bright green bag. The bags are tightly sealed, likely filled with garbage, and some cardboard boxes appear to be partially crushed and torn.\n\nIn the background, there is a narrow alley between two buildings. One building has a dark, open archway leading into an indeterminable space. The second building has a brighter facade and includes a door which a person in a red outfit is entering. This person is captured in mid-step, adding a sense of dynamic movement to an otherwise static scene.\n\nThe scene is set under bright daylight, illuminating the top of the trash bags and the upper part of the buildings, yet casts shadows in the alley and doorways. This lighting creates a strong contrast between the light and shadow areas of the image, contributing to the urban atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image depicts an everyday urban moment, possibly highlighting themes of waste management, urban cleanliness, or merely capturing a mundane aspect of city life. The presence of the person in red adds a human element to the scene, contrasting the inanimate piles of trash.\n","title":"Garbage is piled high on the sidewalk outside New York medical center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549840","545506","545494","548214","549833","549784","550162","547878","545502","549842","550147","542549","556158","547983","548370","544087"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","bag","alley","cardboard","person","seal","mundane","pile","cleanliness","archway"]}
