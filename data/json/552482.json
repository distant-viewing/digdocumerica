{"path":"552482.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a scene from a residential area consisting of mobile homes or modular housing units. The foremost plane of the photograph shows clothing items hung out to dry on a line in front of a house covered with white sidings and a dark roof. To the right, there is a person bent over, seemingly engaged in gardening or some other ground-level activity near a fence.\n\nThe mid-ground reveals rows of similar looking modular housing units, also with white walls and dark roofs. Many of these units have add-ons like small porches with stairs leading up to the doorways. There are signs on some of these homes indicating rental options, as the words \"ONE\" and \"MTHS\" can be seen, suggesting short-term rental possibilities (\"one month\"). A variety of vehicles, including a van, is parked beside some of the homes, indicating residential activity.\n\nThe background shows a row of multi-story residential buildings which feature external staircases. Trees and greenery are visible around the area, adding a touch of nature to the otherwise dense human-made environment. The scene is set under a clear sky, suggesting a sunny day which casts ample light on the surroundings, enhancing visibility.","title":"Migrant labor camp in Princeville","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["545394","544149","557339","548762","544633","547950","558300","551164","556417","556436","552508","555951","551091","544118","556468","549270"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["unit","home","housing","possibility","option","month","row","gardening","plane","staircase"]}
