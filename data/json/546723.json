{"path":"546723.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a busy urban intersection dominated by a blend of architectural styles and a variety of vehicles, suggesting a bustling city environment. We see an array of low to mid-rise buildings with the largest being a multi-storied building with a flat roof, featuring a light brown façade, prominent on the left side of the image. Near the center, a distinct, round-cornered building with a flat, off-white façade stands out; it looks like a commercial structure possibly from the mid-20th century. \n\nSurrounding these buildings are several streets converging at an intersection. The streets are lined with numerous cars, including buses and white vans, indicating heavy traffic typical of city centers. \n\nBoth the layout and density of the vehicles, along with the presence of a small green park area on the bottom right, evoke the characteristic elements of an urban setting. Patches of trees and greenery provide a slight relief from the otherwise concrete-dominant view, suggesting an attempt to integrate nature within the metropolitan landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights a common cityscape scene: dense, active, and architecturally diverse, reflecting the dynamic life of an urban environment.","title":"Greyhound bus terminal","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546712","548318","546579","555743","549476","548364","546616","549979","546697","546617","550153","546624","548358","548420","546678","551506"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["façade","intersection","relief","attempt","converge","city","van","building","street","integrate"]}
