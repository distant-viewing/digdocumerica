{"path":"544647.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph displays an environmental scene of pollution. The setting appears to be a wetland or a swampy area, indicating the natural aquatic environment. The waters are littered with various items of trash, showcasing a disturbing mix of water pollution and neglect.\n\nThe objects that can be clearly seen within the murky water and entangled in the wetland vegetation include several discarded beverage cans which are partially submerged and showing signs of rust and weathering. There is also a distressed cardboard box, partially soaked and deteriorating. A plastic cup is among the debris, along with what seems to be a glass bottle label, indicating it might have been once filled with a drinkâ€”specifically a beer brand named \"Busch.\"\n\nThe background of this image is mainly composed of dense aquatic plants and debris, creating a stark contrast between the natural elements and the pollution. The plants show signs of being robust despite the polluted environment, however, the overall vibe conveys neglect and the adverse impact of human activities on natural habitats.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in this photograph, with the focus primarily on the interaction between human-generated waste and the natural environment. The lighting and quality suggest that the photo might have been taken during the daytime under natural light, accentuating the details of the trash and the wet surroundings.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the TaMiami Canal area beside Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550812","550807","547513","547516","547525","550352","547520","550800","550806","547512","547521","552811","551440","547524","552127","547537"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","wetland","trash","neglect","soak","beer","deteriorate","generate","beverage","cardboard"]}
