{"path":"548465.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This is a vibrant and dynamic photograph capturing a serene outdoor setting that appears to be by a lakeside or beach. The main focus is on two young individuals lying on a grassy area. The foreground of the image features a woman lying on her back on a yellow towel. She has dark, curly hair and is wearing a white bikini top. A man, possibly in his late teens or early twenties, is leaning over her. He has medium-length dark hair and wears a dark swimsuit. His hand supports himself on the ground while the other touches the woman's face gently, suggesting an intimate and tender moment.\n\nTo the left of the photo and slightly blurred, adding depth to the scene, a toddler with curly hair and a white diaper is walking and reaching down to grab something from the grass, hinting at youthful curiosity and movement.\n\nThe background of the image provides a glimpse of life beyond this intimate moment. Various people can be seen enjoying what seems to be a sunny day next to a body of water. Notably, a large airplane is visible on the far left, mid-take-off or landing, contributing to the sense of activity and open airiness of the scene.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are rich and deep, with the blues of the sky and water contrasting with the bright green of the grass and the diverse colors of the beachgoers' attire. This gives the image a real sense of warmth and life, encapsulating a carefree, summer day outdoors.","title":"Constitution Beach--within sight and sound of Logan Airport's takeoff runway 22R","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["554901","548467","553447","552977","548996","551027","551967","552975","553065","550228","547009","556525","551945","543517","543534","543892"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["hair","off","twenty","teen","beachgoer","landing","toddler","bikini","swimsuit","airplane"]}
