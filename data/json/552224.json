{"path":"552224.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene featuring a silhouette of a person engaged in fishing by a body of water. The image prominently showcases the setting sun in the background, casting a warm, golden glow that reflects off the waterâ€™s surface. Clouds lightly streak the sky, enhancing the dramatic effect of the sunset.\n\nThe person, visible only as a silhouette, is standing on the shore, characterized by an uneven, rocky edge. They are holding a fishing rod, poised in an attentive stance as if waiting for a catch. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and contemplative, highlighted by the rich hues of the sunset and the calm water. The composition effectively uses the silhouette and the natural lighting to create a striking contrast and focus on the activity of fishing in a tranquil environment.","title":"Fisherman at sunset on lake Washington at renton.
