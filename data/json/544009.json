{"path":"544009.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a moody evening scene on a street. It appears to be taken during twilight or under heavy overcast conditions, giving the image a dark, enigmatic tone. The setting is a roadway lined with palm trees, which are a prominent feature in the background, silhouetted against the faint light in the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a number of cars travel toward the viewer, with their headlights on, illuminating parts of the roadway and contributing to the moody ambiance. The center of the road shows several cars traveling in both directions, some cars slightly blurred suggesting motion.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, parked beside the curb, is an older model car, stationed under the dim ambient light which adds a sense of stillness contrasting with the moving vehicles.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of quiet movement, with a hint of mystery due to the subdued lighting and shadows. The photograph seems to evoke a feeling of a late evening rush in a possibly suburban or semi-urban area.","title":"Labor Day dust storm viewed from Central Avenue, Phoenix storm followed 153-day drought","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544005","544013","556983","547051","546744","546644","545402","555381","542682","553718","552596","546606","553894","545352","549002","546739"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["roadway","car","travel","evening","rush","headlight","curb","palm","mystery","stillness"]}
