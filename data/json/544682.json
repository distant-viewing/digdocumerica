{"path":"544682.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The image depicts a close-up view of what appears to be a textured surface that strongly resembles cooled lava with intricate patterns of cracks and depressions. The surface texture shows a dynamic range of colors, predominantly dark browns and blacks, with a rough, uneven composition suggesting a natural geological formation. The intricate crack patterns form abstract, intertwining shapes, creating a maze-like appearance.\n\nThe deep crevices and ridges highlight varying shades of brown and black, adding depth and complexity to the visual landscape of the photographed material. The lighting seems to accentuate the texture, casting shadows within the dips and elevating the relief effect of the higher ridges. The entire frame is filled with this textured surface, providing no background context, which focuses the viewer's attention solely on the complex patterns and rugged beauty of the material. No people, objects, or discernible activities are presented; the photograph solely showcases this naturally formed surface, possibly for the purpose of highlighting geological or textural details.","title":"Ground formation at the leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["555793","553582","550606","544694","544992","543149","545597","543148","550474","545795","552239","557626","546110","553770","550475","544907"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["crack","ridge","surface","for","lava","depression","relief","intertwin","dip","black"]}
