{"path":"553869.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decay. In the foreground, numerous discarded appliances, predominantly washing machines, are scattered across a sandy, overgrown plot of land. These appliances appear old and rusted, with some lying on their sides and others upright, their interiors exposed and accumulating debris.\n\nBeyond the appliances, the middle ground is occupied by wild shrubs and patches of grass, suggesting a lack of recent human activity or maintenance in this area. This unkempt vegetation contributes to the sense of neglect evident throughout the scene.\n\nIn the background, a large multistory apartment building dominates the view. It appears to be in a state of disrepair. Its facade is darkened and weathered, with many visible balconies and windows. Some windows seem boarded up, indicating the building might be abandoned or unoccupied.\n\nOverall, the composition uses these elements to convey a strong message of abandonment and deterioration within a once-inhabited space. The contrast between nature reclaiming the space with the stubborn persistence of human-made objects and structures creates a poignant reminder of urban neglect or economic decline.","title":"Breezy Point, Long Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547921","549786","550263","552102","544809","550246","545982","549307","556324","550253","550264","549958","557345","556352","557283","556640"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["appliance","neglect","reminder","deterioration","decline","plot","apartment","balcony","disrepair","space"]}
