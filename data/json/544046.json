{"path":"544046.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive field bathed in sunlight, predominantly covered in wheat that appears golden in color. The perspective is taken from within the field, looking along a narrow trodden path that leads towards the horizon. The path splits the image in two, guiding the eye towards a distant focal point.\n\nIn the background, a range of mountains stretches across the horizon, suggesting a vast, open landscape. The sky is a deep blue, indicative of clear weather. On the left side of the image, partly visible and partially obscured by the wheat, is a rustic, possibly wooden, structure that might be a shed or farmhouse.\n\nThe image composition uses the path as a leading line, drawing attention from the foreground directly towards the mountains in the distance, providing a sense of depth and vastness to the rural scene. The lighting highlights the texture and colors of the wheat, enhancing the natural beauty and tranquility of the setting.","title":"Cornfield and barn","placename":"Thatcher (Ariz.)","location":"Thatcher, Arizona","nn1":["544050","553810","549233","545040","552458","547288","549181","549141","557087","547432","554722","556990","549146","549156","549158","552914"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["wheat","path","tread","farmhouse","split","lead","mountain","field","shed","horizon"]}
