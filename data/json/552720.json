{"path":"552720.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban park setting. A young woman is sitting on a high, stone wall, holding a large piece of cardboard with a message or sign, which includes both text and some illustrative graphics. The sign, predominantly in English with visible phrases, suggests she might be engaged in a form of protest or public statement-making.\n\nThe woman is sitting with one knee slightly raised, leaning forward to balance the cardboard sign. She has long hair styled with a white bow and is wearing a black outfit complemented by high black stockings and shoes.\n\nBehind her stretches a wide grassy area lined with trees, suggesting she is in a significant public space. In the distance, urban architecture frames the scene, notably a prominent building with classical features, including a central clock tower and several floors of windows, situated at the end of a broad avenue or parkway.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph and its elements suggest a moment of personal expression or activism in a peaceful public setting. The contrast between the serene park and the urban environment adds a layer of depth to the narrative implied by the womanâ€™s focused activity with her sign.","title":"Free expression in independence square","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553156","551741","546474","550067","551448","553501","553164","553321","546555","550188","546492","551828","556737","553143","553309","550748"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["cardboard","sign","avenue","activism","protest","woman","statement","sit","clock","bow"]}
