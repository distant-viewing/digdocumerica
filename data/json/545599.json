{"path":"545599.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a young woman sitting on the edge of a high cliff overlooking a stunning canyon landscape. The canyon, with its layered rock formations and deep crevices, is expansive and features a winding river that fades into the distance, bending around the rugged terrain. The river appears as a prominent meandering ribbon of water reflecting light, contrasting sharply with the earthy tones of the surrounding cliffs.\n\nThe woman, likely a hiker or an explorer, wears a bright orange shirt and denim shorts. Her hair is held back with a patterned bandana, and she is engrossed in sketching or writing on a large pad of paper on her lap, suggesting she might be capturing the landscape or making notes about her journey. Her legs are crossed, and she is barefoot, adding a relaxed and contemplative air to her demeanor.\n\nThe background boasts dramatic cliff faces that descend into deep valleys, with a horizon line that stretches wide under a slightly overcast sky. The natural colors of the scene are rich and varied, primarily shades of red, orange, and brown, portraying the typically arid environment of a canyon area. The overall composition of the image emphasizes a harmony between human and nature, illustrating a moment of quiet solitude and appreciation of the vast wilderness.","title":"The view from Dead Horse Point: Canyonlands and the Colorado River","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545595","545300","545697","544946","544917","555395","545607","545689","545785","545758","545753","544931","544899","545765","544895","545780"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","cliff","bandana","ribbon","pad","hiker","appreciation","harmony","crevice","note"]}
