{"path":"545930.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a foggy road shrouded in a dense, bluish mist. In the foreground and moving from right to left across the frame is a large logging truck painted in red and white. The truck is carrying a load of long, heavy logs, tightly secured with chains or straps. The truck features a classic design, often seen in North American logging industries, with visible chrome accents and a robust front grille.\n\nThe background is predominantly made up of tall, straight trees that pierce through the thick fog, which partially obscures their upper portions, giving the scene a mysterious and ethereal quality. The road itself is visible in the bottom right corner of the image, wet from moisture and reflective.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph appears to be natural, softened and dispersed by the dense fog, which adds a soft, almost dreamlike quality to the setting. The colors are muted with shades of blue and grey predominating, underscored by the striking red of the truck, which adds a pop of color and a focal point to the composition.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of isolation and the tough, rugged nature of logging work, contrasting the industrial elements of the truck against the natural and serene, yet also somewhat foreboding, backdrop of the fog-enshrouded forest.","title":"Logs are transported to mills along Highway 101.","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["542858","542925","542854","555154","542855","553628","556986","554420","542856","542953","542780","554416","544767","555875","556429","553629"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["truck","logging","strap","grille","pop","load","accent","quality","chrome","moisture"]}
