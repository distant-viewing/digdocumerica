{"path":"550795.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph portrays an intriguing scene where nature begins to reclaim a man-made object. In the foreground, there's a dense growth of tall wild grasses, dry and golden-brown, dominating most of the view and gently swaying or bending, likely due to a breeze. Partially hidden by these grasses, an old rusted car, likely from the mid-20th century based on its rounded shape and design features like split rear windows, becomes visible. The car's paint appears faded and flaking, with prominent rust patches consuming large areas of its body, suggesting it has been exposed to the elements for many years.\n\nThe background presents a dense thicket of trees and other vegetation, exhibiting varying shades of green, indicating a wooded area or forest. The environment looks somewhat overcast, suggesting either a cloudy day or shadowed light filtering through the canopy above, which casts subtle shadows and creates a subdued and moody atmosphere. Overall, the composition invites contemplation on themes of abandonment, the passage of time, and the persistent, encroaching force of nature over human endeavors. The image captures a serene yet slightly melancholic vibe, emphasizing how artifacts of human presence gradually become part of the natural landscape again.","title":"Chevy abandoned some ten years ago--one of many found on northern county back roads that follow the Wisconsin River.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550797","546405","547535","553008","553007","547747","552673","549107","547024","548751","554920","547771","545540","553010","553002","550279"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["become","consume","thicket","encroach","sway","artifact","reclaim","begin","hide","split"]}
