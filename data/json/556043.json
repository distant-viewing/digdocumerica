{"path":"556043.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of manual labor involving three men. Two individuals are in the foreground actively engaged in an activity: one man is in a red jacket and appears to be receiving or providing something from a handheld tool, while the other man standing on the back of a truck, dressed in a white T-shirt, manipulates or secures this tool. The man in the red jacket is also holding a clear bag filled with ice, suggesting they might be cooling or preparing something. The man on the truck is protected by a safety helmet, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the task.\n\nIn the background, inside the truck, there's a third man observing the action. His attire, including a light-colored cap, indicates he might also be a worker.\n\nThe setting of the photograph is a sunny outdoor location evident from the bright daylight and shadows. The truck is equipped with various tools and apparatuses, including what seem to be cooled boxes (perhaps for preserving food or medical supplies), and it appears to be a structured, yet bustling work environment. The background is blurred, allowing the focus to remain on the men and their activities. The photograph conveys a sense of purpose and urgency, showcasing a moment of intense, cooperative effort among workers.","title":"Blocks of ice are placed aboard the lone star at Fort Worth Texas, as the train is enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas.
