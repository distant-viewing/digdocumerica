{"path":"553705.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban residential area with a well-planned layout of homes and streets. Centrally in the image, there is a road that curves gently to the left, lined on both sides with closely set single-story houses. Each house features consistent architectural design elements such as gabled roofs with brown shingles and walls painted in neutral shades. Many of the homes have prominent driveways, tidy front yards, and several have attached garages.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows several vehicles, including a white car driving down the road and a few others parked in driveways or on the streets. Street lamps and manicured grassy patches along the roadside contribute to the orderly suburban aesthetic. The overall setting appears peaceful and quiet, suggesting a residential area with little traffic.\n\nIn the background, beyond the houses, stretches a panoramic view of a vast water body which might be a river or a coastal bay, suggesting the suburb is located near a significant water feature. The water and the distant shore are shown under a clear sky, emphasizing a broad, open horizon that contrasts with the structured environment of the suburban foreground.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani Town, one solution to the island's housing shortage.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["547211","547435","553699","549071","547769","551198","557454","553928","548824","557405","548011","553970","544604","556974","553700","545914"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["driveway","house","street","home","suburb","shingle","garage","roadside","bay","road"]}
