{"path":"549917.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban alley scene characterized by a distinctive art installation. The focal point of the image is a large, extensive wall completely covered in a repetitive pattern of posters. The posters feature a skeletal diagram, presumably of a human leg, shown in various angles and annotated, perhaps for educational or artistic purposes.\n\nTo the right side of the image, three individuals are interacting near a red dollie, which seems to be used to transport a flat, possibly heavy object that they are either loading or unloading. Two of the individuals are assisting the third, who is doing the main task, while the others provide support and guidance.\n\nThe alley itself, where this scene unfolds, is narrow with tall buildings on both sides. It has a paved cobblestone street, and debris is scattered around, hinting at a bustling city environment. The background displays the typical facade of urban buildings, with visible windows and fire escape stairs, adding to the gritty, industrial feel of the setting.\n\nThis scene captures both an artistic statement through the wall of posters and an everyday moment of work and cooperation among individuals in an urban landscape.","title":"Freight handlers with stack of boxed women's wear outside warehouse on reade street, lower Manhattan--looking east from west broadway","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545343","552969","555909","548372","553247","546514","548371","545315","556230","545348","552971","546525","545361","547174","551666","543360"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["poster","alley","diagram","guidance","cooperation","statement","do","unloading","escape","individual"]}
