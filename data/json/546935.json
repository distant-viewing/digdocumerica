{"path":"546935.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a marina with several boats docked in front of an apartment building. The building is a multi-storied structure, featuring balconies, many of which have items like chairs or plants on them. The color palette of the building includes muted shades of pink and gray.\n\nIn the foreground, various types of boats are moored at the docks. These range from larger cabin cruisers to smaller sailboats and speedboats. The boats appear well-maintained, and some exhibit details such as shiny surfaces and organized decks. One boat in the lower right of the image has a person visible on it, seemingly engaged in a leisure activity, possibly sunbathing or relaxing.\n\nThe water is calm, reflecting a sense of tranquility at the marina. There is a glimpse of a walkway or pier running parallel to the boats, with a woman walking along it, adding a human element to the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, leisurely day at a residential marina.","title":"Luxury on Hilton Head Island.
