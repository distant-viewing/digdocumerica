{"path":"556817.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and crowded scene inside a subway train. The image shows a diverse group of passengers, primarily women, engaged in various activities. Some are standing and holding onto overhead handrails, while others are seated along the sides of the train, suggesting a full or potentially busy time of day such as rush hour.\n\nOn the left, a woman standing is shown gripping an overhead rail with one hand. She is dressed casually and is focused on something out of the shot, possibly a conversation or something happening within the train. Other passengers appear engaged in their own activities; some are talking to each other, while many are seated, looking tired or preoccupied.\n\nThe carriage itself is narrow and elongated, with advertising posters and signs visible above the windows, contributing to the realistic and everyday feel of the scene. The lighting inside the carriage is artificial and slightly dim, casting soft shadows and contributing to an intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe composition utilizes a perspective that leads the viewerâ€™s eye along the length of the carriage, emphasizing the cramped and crowded conditions. The use of a wide-angle lens distorts the space slightly, making the train car appear even more packed and congested.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of life from public transport, highlighting the proximity and diversity of city life, with individuals from various walks of life sharing a small, transient space.","title":"Passengers on a Lexington avenue line subway train operated by the New York city transit authority.  In 1974 the system was providing four million rides each work day.  (this is something less than two million people per day because most people made round trips, and the others made several trips per day.)  Ridership has been decreasing slightly.  In 1960 the system handles 2.2 million persons each day or 51 percent of the work force.  In 1970 it was 2.1 million and 47 percent","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["556661","556665","554328","554326","556691","554327","556669","556780","556653","554370","556813","551895","556671","551883","556818","548256"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["carriage","train","passenger","distort","handrail","happen","life","grip","lens","subway"]}
