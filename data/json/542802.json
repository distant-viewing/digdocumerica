{"path":"542802.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph provides a view from inside a building, looking out onto a street scene through a large window framed by distinct architectural features. In the foreground inside the building, a silhouette of a person sitting is visible, facing the window. The individual's features are not visible, making them appear as a dark, anonymous figure against the brighter outside light.\n\nThe view outside the window captures a vibrant urban environment. The street is lined with historic buildings of approximately three stories high, each featuring rows of windows and detailed façades with an architectural style that suggests they might be from the early 20th century. The buildings are painted in soft colors, contributing to their aged appearance.\n\nA clear blue sky is visible, suggesting a bright, sunny day. One can also see electrical poles and wires, which add to the urban feel. On the street, vintage automobiles suggest the photo might be set in the mid-20th century, given their design and style. There is a traffic signal at the street corner, enhancing the sense of a bustling city atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the dark, introspective indoor setting with the lively and bright street scene outside, creating a contrast between the interior and exterior environments. The photograph uses natural light to emphasize this dichotomy, highlighting the quiet contemplation of the figure inside against the dynamic, illuminated life outside.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542579","543028","550123","545353","553845","552745","546521","556249","549880","555902","553255","549854","546546","545333","549997","551493"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","window","signal","century","figure","building","automobile","façade","feature","contemplation"]}
