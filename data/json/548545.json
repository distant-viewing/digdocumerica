{"path":"548545.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively coastal scene at what appears to be the southernmost point of Key West, Florida, as indicated by the large, weathered sign. The sign, featuring bold black text against a faded background, reads \"The Southernmost Point of Southernmost City Key West, Fla.\" It is adorned with hanging buoy-like objects and is anchored with what look like large, rusted weights or anchors at its feet.\n\nThe foreground of the image is filled with numerous conch shells, symmetrically aligned and positioned upright on a concrete surface, pointing toward the camera. Their pink interiors add a vivid contrast to the gray tones of the pavement. \n\nBeyond the arrangement of shells, the background transitions to a serene ocean view under a clear blue sky. Several small boats are visible in the calm water, hinting at local maritime activity. The photo conveys a sense of a quiet yet inviting tourist spot, combining natural beauty with a touch of quirky, man-made charm.","title":"Souvenir seashells for sale at the southernmost point of the United States","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548530","548670","545154","548764","544554","548765","554081","554119","554143","543362","548763","554101","546397","543108","548534","543053"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["shell","anchor","weight","buoy","tourist","foot","pavement","point","charm","align"]}
