{"path":"544518.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a spider positioned on a green plant stem. The spider, prominently in focus, exhibits an ornate body pattern characterized by white markings on its dark, spherical abdomen. Its legs, thin and segmented, stretch out delicately to grasp the stem. Directly behind the spider, the blur of a white flower with yellowish details adds a soft contrast to the background, which is otherwise a muted green, creating a natural, depth-filled backdrop. The lighting appears soft yet directional, highlighting the textures and details of the spider and the plant. On the right side of the image, there is a vertical border with a series of dots and numbers, typical of a film strip edge, suggesting the photograph was taken on film. This adds a tactile, vintage quality to the image.","title":"Spider and wild flower","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["553874","544526","555021","555195","557585","555039","557620","555196","558077","557544","554842","544603","555052","555053","557625","544619"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stem","film","tactile","grasp","plant","strip","marking","segment","detail","blur"]}
