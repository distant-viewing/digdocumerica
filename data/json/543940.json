{"path":"543940.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"In the photograph, three people are on a small motorboat over calm blue water. The boat is a classic design with a glossy wooden finish and a curved bow, featuring a clear windscreen at the front. At the bow, inside the boat, a young child with light brown hair is seated, holding onto the sides of the boat; he is dressed in a light blue shirt. Behind him, two adult men are seen tending to the boatâ€™s operations.\n\nThe man nearest to the child, likely in his thirties, is seated facing the rear of the boat. He has unkempt dark hair and is wearing a white shirt with sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing a watch on his left wrist. The second man, also appearing to be in his thirties, stands closer to the stern. He wears a yellow T-shirt and is managing the motor of the boat. The motor is prominent, labeled \"Mercury\" at the side.\n\nBoth men are focused on their tasks, the seated man looking down, possibly adjusting or holding something, while the standing man is turned slightly towards the motor, handling an oar or a pole. The backdrop features a watery horizon that hints at a serene day, likely conducive for boating activities. The overall scene captures a moment of leisure or maintenance on the water, with attention taken in handling the boat and ensuring safety.","title":"Boating on the Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550841","544270","544980","546912","546352","544122","551255","544269","546348","554199","548054","548525","546356","554196","549418","546976"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","motor","bow","man","handle","oar","elbow","ten","wrist","child"]}
