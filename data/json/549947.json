{"path":"549947.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two men, likely co-workers, during a break or casual moment in an industrial or construction environment. \n\nThe man on the left is seated and appears to be laughing or smiling broadly. He wears sunglasses, a light-colored shirt, dark pants, and a wristwatch, suggesting a mix of casual and work attire. \n\nThe man on the right, who is partially obscured by the man on the left, appears to be enjoying the conversation or moment, shown by his broad smile and relaxed posture. He wears a dark-colored cap with a logo, possibly of a company or brand, and a dark blue jumpsuit, indicating he might be involved in more hands-on or mechanical work.\n\nThey are sitting next to or on a large yellow piece of machinery, which could be construction-related equipment, given its heavy-duty appearance. The equipment's significant, yellow-painted metal housing and parts suggest it's possibly used for lifting or earth-moving.\n\nThe background is not very detailed but seems to consist of more industrial elements, possibly further machinery or structures related to their work environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph exhibits a warm interaction between colleagues in a work setting, emphasizing a moment of leisure or camaraderie amidst a rugged backdrop.","title":"Workers at the Croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["543651","556868","547160","553802","553160","556316","554870","542546","544969","553606","556339","553636","547987","557883","546036","553153"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["work","smile","jumpsuit","colleague","moment","wristwatch","machinery","laugh","man","construction"]}
