{"path":"545900.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene, characterized by a small, solitary sailboat navigating through large expanses of water. The boat is located slightly off-center to the right, with its white sail contrasting vividly against the predominantly blue and gray hues of the surrounding water. The water itself displays an interesting mix of textures and shades, ranging from deep blues to lighter, almost silvery patches, possibly suggesting a play of light or currents on its surface.\n\nThe perspective of the shot, which seems to be taken from an elevated angle—potentially a cliff or another high vantage point—gives an ample view of the watery expanse, suggesting a sense of isolation and tranquility. There are no visible landforms or other vessels, heightening the sense of the boat's solitude in the vast, open water. The overall lighting is soft, creating a calm and somewhat muted atmosphere, emphasizing the thematic elements of solitude and the vastness of nature.","title":"Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["557813","549380","553991","548516","548118","549374","548247","544663","552345","548521","543888","542903","547273","544669","544667","545120"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["solitude","expanse","landform","boat","current","sail","water","sailboat","vantage","play"]}
