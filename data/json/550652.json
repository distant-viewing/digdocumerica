{"path":"550652.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image is a dramatic and moody depiction of a landscape that appears to be an inverted reflection; it combines elements of nature and what might look like a water reflection effect, although artistically altered.\n\nThe upper portion of the photo exhibits what seems to be the sky, showing swirling cloud formations that vary in shade from a deep purple to lighter mauve tones, setting a somber and mystical tone. The texture in this area is smooth and flowing, resembling the fluid motion of clouds, but with a distinct quality that seems almost surreal or painted.\n\nBelow the sky, the lower area of the photograph features darker silhouettes of what appear to be trees. These silhouetted trees are densely packed and uneven across the bottom, giving a jagged and natural horizon line against the sky. The trees are shown with dark purple and black hues, providing a stark contrast against the lighter sky.\n\nThe overall impression is gothic, with an emphasis on the play of colors and light, creating a scene that feels both familiar and otherworldly. The orientation and treatment of the image suggest it might be a reflection in water captured during twilight or digitally altered to enhance its dramatic and mysterious qualities.","title":"Reflections--androscoggin river above milan","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["545213","555081","552142","543621","547793","553578","544577","555126","557561","554608","555122","557575","543843","542981","543611","557579"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["alte","reflection","orientation","fluid","treatment","quality","swirl","depiction","purple","emphasis"]}
