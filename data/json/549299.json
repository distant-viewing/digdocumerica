{"path":"549299.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up of two young people, a boy and a girl, with the boy prominently in the foreground. The boy, who is laughing and looking upwards to his right, appears to be in his early teens. He has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a blue jacket over a yellow t-shirt with a white collar peeking out. His joyful expression suggests he is enjoying a moment of lightheartedness or amusement.\n\nThe girl, presumably younger, is positioned slightly behind and to the right of the boy, looking at the camera with a calm, introspective expression. She has long, light brown hair tucked under a cap and is wearing a navy-blue knitted sweater adorned with horizontal red and white stripes, hinting at a patriotic theme.\n\nThe background is soft and out of focus, mainly in a neutral tone that does not distract from the subjects, emphasizing their expressions and the interaction (or contrast) between their moods. The focus and depth of field suggest an intimate setting, capturing a candid moment between the children. The overall composition, with the boy's head slightly titled and the girl looking directly at the viewer, creates a dynamic and engaging snapshot of youth.","title":"Neighborhood children of the Neptune Road-Lovell Street area, the residential community closest to Logan Airport.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553147","543612","556142","553171","556606","543870","552859","545959","556139","556138","553168","553170","551548","553536","557358","553509"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","girl","expression","teen","navy","amusement","youth","hair","collar","close"]}
