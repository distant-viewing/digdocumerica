{"path":"551438.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman as she is seated on a raised surface, dressed in multi-colored, patterned attire with a dark blue cloak over her shoulders and wearing a striped headscarf. The focus is on her meticulously tying the lace of a dark-colored shoe onto her left foot. Her hands show visible signs of ageing; they appear wrinkled with prominent veins and sunspots, which adds a layer of texture and detail to the image. \n\nHer right leg is partially visible, revealing a compression stocking, indicating possible health-related issues pertaining to circulation. She wears open sandals on her other foot. The background is minimal and nondescript, featuring a slightly blurred clay-colored brick floor and a light beige or white wall, providing a plain backdrop that directs attention to the subject.\n\nThe photograph seems to convey a moment of independence or routine in the daily life of this elderly woman, with a strong focus on personal care and self-sufficiency. The scene is intimate, capturing a private, ordinary moment that reflects broader themes of ageing and the maintenance of personal autonomy.","title":"On a bench in nicollet mall--an old lady readjusts her shoe ties","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551439","555530","551828","556594","554051","556498","553482","558327","558323","546977","558319","553484","544311","544321","558337","558336"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["foot","clay","cloak","self","lace","headscarf","sandal","vein","wrinkle","health"]}
