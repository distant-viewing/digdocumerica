{"path":"545171.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, the dominating feature is a large, hyperboloid-shaped cooling tower, typically seen at nuclear or thermal power plants. The tower looms large in the frame, its light concrete surface stands stark against a gloomy, overcast sky. To the right of the cooling tower, partially constructed buildings and a crane can be seen, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance work at the site.\n\nThe foreground of the image features the dark, rippling surface of a large body of water, possibly a river or a lake, which reflects light from the sky, creating shimmering patterns on its surface. The water extends to the horizon, meeting the base of the cooling tower and the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe surroundings are wooded, with pine trees visible around the edges of the power plant, slightly obscured by the mist or light rain, which also causes visible specks on the photograph, giving it a grainy texture. The atmosphere conveyed by the image is somewhat somber and industrial, highlighted by the natural elements around the man-made structures.","title":"The controversial Trojan nuclear power plant on the Columbia River","placename":"Prescott (Or.)","location":"Prescott, Oregon","nn1":["553885","548039","545131","551184","548208","548211","548035","551155","553829","545127","551175","548043","544966","551928","545167","549215"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["cool","tower","power","surface","speck","loom","plant","cause","rain","woode"]}
