{"path":"544194.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts two young boys standing in front of a body of water, likely a lake or pond, with a serene landscape behind them. The older boy, on the left, is wearing a plaid short-sleeved button-up shirt paired with dark pants. He holds a black handgun in his right hand, which is hanging loosely by his side. His expression is serious and his hair is short and somewhat tousled.\n\nThe younger boy on the right is shirtless and wearing green shorts with a dark belt. He is slightly tanned and similarly holds a handgun in his right hand, though his gun is smaller and is being pointed towards the ground. His expression mirrors the seriousness of the older boy, and he also has short, light-colored hair.\n\nIn the background, the water reflects the trees lining its banks, contributing to a calm and lush environment. Amid the greenery, a house or building can be faintly seen in the distance. On the right side of the foreground, part of a wooden structure (perhaps a dock or a part of a boat) is visible, marked by reflective metal bands strapped around a post.\n\nThe setting appears to be tranquil yet the presence of handguns introduces a contrasting element of tension or foreboding. The overall composition of the photo, with its natural surroundings and the stark focus on the boys with guns, evokes a narrative that might explore themes of youth, innocence, and perhaps the influences of environment.","title":"Boys with airgun and bird.
