{"path":"544092.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an urban street, predominantly shaded, with sunlight illuminating specific areas. On the left side, there is a large red and dark building which hosts the \"El Minuto Tortilla Factory,\" as indicated by a painted sign on its exterior. The building has a traditional industrial appearance, with visible vents and pipes around its structure, and a canopy over a doorway labeled \"Entrance.\" \n\nIn the middle of the composition, there's a street extending into the background, where it is met with another dark building across from the tortilla factory. The street itself has a few visible details such as a curb painted red, a stop sign ahead warning for a steep incline, and a small set of steps to one side.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a lone person, appearing relatively small compared to the surroundings, walking down the street. The person, likely a woman judging by the attire, is dressed in a long coat and is carrying what seems to be a bag or a briefcase. Her shadow is elongated and falls directly behind her due to the angle of the sunlight.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat stark and quiet, with no other visible people or vehicles, suggesting a possible early morning or a non-busy time of day. The light and shadow play a significant role in defining the mood and texture of the scene, highlighting the solitude and routine of urban life.","title":"Downtown area of an old mining town","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["546498","549916","547820","547809","546493","546494","546423","547816","547695","552724","555930","555890","550108","550130","555902","543360"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","briefcase","incline","vent","stop","curb","routine","sunlight","doorway","person"]}
