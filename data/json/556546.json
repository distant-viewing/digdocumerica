{"path":"556546.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a young girl standing on a porch in a rural setting. The girl is looking directly at the camera, with a somewhat solemn expression. She is wearing a sleeveless, multicolored dress adorned with large flower patterns. There are neatly arranged rows of empty glass bottles nearby, possibly signifying beverage consumption or a collection for recycling.\n\nThe background of the image shows a laundry line with various items of clothing hanging to dry outside a dark-colored wooden house, which reinforces the rural, rustic feel of the setting. In the distance, another house with similar construction can be observed, and behind, lush green hills suggest that this location is in a valley or a similarly secluded setting.\n\nNotable elements, such as a glove hanging from a wire and a hanging lamp off the porchâ€™s beam, contribute to the detailed capture of rural life. The overall mood conveyed by this setting is quiet and perhaps reminiscent of simpler, pastoral life, which is further emphasized by the subdued lighting and the natural backdrop.","title":"One of the daughters of Jerry Rainey, 34, a miner who was out on strike against the Brookside Mining Company in Brookside, Kentucky, near Middlesboro for several months during 1974. She is on the back porch of the house Rainey rents from the company. Notice the outhouses in the background. The family was threatened by eviction during the lengthy and sometimes violent strike despite a state law which outlaws such a practice.","placename":"Middlesboro (Ky.)","location":"Middlesboro, Kentucky","nn1":["544261","552957","552961","556541","554798","544257","556487","545436","544398","551129","556495","546987","552747","557357","556356","557746"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["girl","porch","consumption","house","recycling","beverage","capture","glove","bottle","lamp"]}
