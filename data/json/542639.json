{"path":"542639.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a unique and eye-catching scene focused primarily on the transportation of vehicles. The top portion of the image captures a white sports car, possibly a model from the 1970s or 1980s, being lifted by a large, robust lifting frame made of orange beams, resembling a large scale pallet or crate. This frame is attached to unseen lifting machinery, likely a crane, which is hoisting the car up or down from a large ship, parts of which are visible as a dark, shadowy background.\n\nThe lower half of the photo displays a separate composition where numerous cars are parked closely together, suggesting a busy shipping or receiving area. The vehicles shown include a variety of models and colors, ranging from sedans to station wagons, largely reflecting automotive styles from the mid-20th century.\n\nThe overall scene depicted in the photograph is industrial, focusing on the logistics of vehicle transportation. The contrast between the single, highlighted vehicle in the upper part and the mass of tightly parked cars below emphasizes the scale and organized chaos of this operation. The image is likely taken during daylight, given the bright lighting on the suspended car and the visible details of the parked vehicles.","title":"Datsun being unloaded","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["542636","542633","553741","549704","549688","547327","546848","547480","547469","542640","546900","546881","546915","549696","552077","555748"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lift","car","vehicle","model","transportation","pallet","park","crate","receive","mass"]}
