{"path":"549291.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two elderly men engaged in a conversation on a street. The man on the left wears thick-rimmed glasses and a multicolored plaid jacket with a dark shirt underneath. He appears to be listening intently or responding to the other man, as he faces towards him with a glimpse of a watch on his left wrist.\n\nThe man on the right, who seems to be making a point, gestures with both hands extended slightly. He wears a checked hat, glasses, and a light brown overcoat over a yellow shirt. His expression is focused and somewhat stern.\n\nBehind them, the environment suggests a small-town commercial street. The storefront in the background features a dark facade with a \"For Rent\" sign displayed in the window, indicating vacancy. Various small posters or advertisements are also visible in the window, alongside what appears to be some sort of book or magazine display. A rounded, antique wall clock hangs beside the store window. The architecture and overall scene have a somewhat dated, mid-20th century American feel.","title":"92 year old james morse of lovell street tells anthony bruno of nearby neptune road how airplane vibrations twice knocked over his telephone, once knocked him out of bed.
