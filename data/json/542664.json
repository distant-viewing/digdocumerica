{"path":"542664.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an older man with glasses engrossed in scientific or technical work. He is focused on adjusting or examining a large cylindrical object, likely a part of some sophisticated lab apparatus. The device he is working with has a transparent tube or container section through which internal components or substances might be visible or housed. Connected to this tube are various metallic fittings and valves that suggest the manipulation of gases or liquids might be involved in the process.\n\nThe man is wearing a patterned shirt adorned with geometric shapes, which adds a casual touch to the scene. His facial expression, characterized by a slightly furrowed brow and a concentrated gaze directed toward the object in his hands, conveys a sense of attentiveness and care in his task.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred and cluttered, hinting at a typical laboratory or workshop setting with various other pieces of equipment and possibly some wiring or structural elements of the facility. The overall lighting is somewhat dim, focusing more on the subject and the object he is handling, which makes the image feel intimate and intensely focused on the moment of interaction between the man and his work.","title":"Frank burleson, staff research associate at statewide air pollution research center, measuring aromatics - oxygenates, in ambient air sample","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["546328","542666","549612","556557","551595","546284","549364","551590","546277","546327","543801","551594","555280","549384","546291","545002"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["tube","object","fitting","work","valve","attentiveness","engross","lab","liquid","laboratory"]}
