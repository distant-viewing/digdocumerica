{"path":"554145.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a coastal resort area. The photograph includes several tall hotel buildings, presumably several stories high, situated along a curved coastline. These buildings are multi-storied, with light colored exteriors, and surrounded by lush greenery including trees and well-manicured garden areas.\n\nThe coastline features dark blue, relatively calm waters lapping against a rocky shore with white wave crests visible at points where the waves hit the rocks. There is a mix of developed and undeveloped land in the vicinity with a narrow road visible winding through the area. \n\nBehind the resort area and further inland, the terrain transitions to a more rugged and less densely vegetated landscape, indicating volcanic or similarly harsh soil conditions that are less conducive to dense foliage or agriculture. The background is dominated by a distant mountain range, partly shrouded by haze, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo with its blend of tropical resort luxury and the raw, natural beauty of the volcanic landscape suggests this might be an exotic location, possibly Hawaii or another location within the Pacific's volcanic island chains. The image captures both the appeal of human hospitality development and the overwhelming presence of nature in such regions.","title":"Kailua, also called the Kona Coast, on the western side of the island, is part urban and part agricultural and is the fastest developing area on the island.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554144","553983","553982","554171","553671","543437","554170","554143","553689","544638","553779","543429","548785","554090","543434","557532"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["resort","coastline","luxury","wave","hit","hotel","crest","manicure","location","appeal"]}
