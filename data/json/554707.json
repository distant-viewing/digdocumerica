{"path":"554707.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an old and dilapidated building, likely once a residential or perhaps a slightly commercial establishment, set in a rural or possibly wilderness setting. The building features wood siding and a stone chimney, with parts of its structure seemingly giving way due to decay or neglect; the roof appears partially caved in and the windows are mostly broken or missing.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a rusty, swinging metal gate, partly open, leading towards the building. The surrounding area is overgrown with tall dry grass, shrubs, and a few small trees suggesting that the area has been uninhabited or abandoned for a considerable time. Near the left of the frame stands a wooden utility pole equipped with a yellow sign that is weathered and unreadable, and a white rectangular sign attached lower on the pole, which is also difficult to read due to its condition and angle. These signs may indicate prior attempts to mark the property for some informational, warning, or directional purpose.\n\nNo people are visible in the shot, emphasizing the sense of abandonment and isolation of the location. The scene is bathed in natural light, suggesting the photograph was taken during daylight hours under clear skies. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of neglect and the passage of time, highlighting natureâ€™s reclamation of human-built spaces.","title":"Abandoned house deteriorates on Blue Ridge Road in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["543344","552455","552491","552494","545233","543339","557344","543171","551330","554785","553548","554822","555612","557348","556330","550129"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["reclamation","pole","attempt","sign","gate","warning","time","establishment","passage","property"]}
