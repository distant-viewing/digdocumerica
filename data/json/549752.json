{"path":"549752.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image captures a striking contrast between urban development and waste management challenges. In the foreground, there's a large pile of scattered garbage covering the ground. Amidst the waste, a black garbage truck emblazoned with the words \"Marie, Du-Rite Garbage Service\" is prominently displayed. The truck, adorned with various decals and shiny, reflective surfaces, stands out against the dirty backdrop. Two workers beside the truck appear to be engaged in their tasks related to waste management.\n\nIn the background, the scene shifts dramatically to an urban skyline dominated by a series of tall residential buildings. These high-rise structures, likely apartment complexes, are tightly packed together and stretch across the entire frame. The buildings are modern, with a mix of architectural styles and colors, predominantly grays and reds. The sky above is a crisp blue with minimal cloud cover, providing a clear day setting which sharpens the contrast between the natural blue sky and the human-made environment.\n\nThis juxtaposition underscores the theme of urban expansion adjacent to the essential, yet often overlooked, functions like garbage disposal that sustain city living. The image serves as a visual commentary on environmental issues, urban lifestyle, and the infrastructure necessary to support large urban populations.","title":"Large apartment complex, \"Co-op City\" in the Bronx overlooks municipal dump.
