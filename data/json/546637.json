{"path":"546637.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image presents an outdoor setting, depicting a street-level interaction between a police officer and a civilian woman. The scene is framed by the silhouette of a motorcycle in the foreground, specifically focusing on its rear-view mirror. The officer, a Caucasian male dressed in a standard police uniform which includes a badge, a radio, and a name badge on his chest, appears attentive as he listens, his eyes directed towards the woman.\n\nThe woman is shown in profile with a slightly raised arm, possibly in the midst of conversation or making a point. She wears what appears to be a dark-colored coat or dress, and her hair is styled in a manner typical of the period (1960s or 1970s), adding a temporal context to the photograph.\n\nIn the mirror's reflection, you can see a distorted and somewhat obscured image of another police officer, suggesting a second presence watching or participating in the interaction.\n\nThe background features urban elements such as a building, some foliage, and a street, blurred and giving focus to the interaction in the foreground. The overall mood conveyed appears to be serious and the interaction intent, insinuating a matter of some significance being discussed or resolved. The use of natural light and the soft focus on the background elements emphasizes and directs attention to the human elements and interpersonal exchange taking place.","title":"Officer calls paddy wagon for disturber of the peace.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546657","546663","546633","546611","546654","546634","546661","557872","551941","546630","542757","557865","546658","547205","557841","542756"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["officer","police","badge","mirror","interaction","intent","woman","exchange","radio","matter"]}
