{"path":"545560.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up image of a chipmunk on a sunny day. This small, brown rodent is shown in profile, licking or nibbling at its paw. The fur of the chipmunk has a rich, orange-brown hue that contrasts nicely with the soft-focused background that appears blurred, hinting at a natural, possibly arid environment due to the reddish-brown color tones.\n\nThe sunlight illuminates the chipmunk’s fur, creating highlights that give a sense of texture and vitality to the scene. The creature’s head is turned slightly towards the camera, allowing us to see the detail around its whiskers and the attentive expression in its eye. This intimate angle gives the viewer a sense of closeness to the chipmunk, which is centered in the composition against the undefined, muddy backdrop.\n\nThere’s a soft lens flare on the left side of the image, indicating the direction of the sunlight and adding a dreamy quality to the photograph. The overall atmosphere is serene and focused, capturing a moment of everyday life in the natural world. The chipmunk’s activity, possibly cleaning itself or eating, suggests a snapshot of its daily behavior in its natural habitat.","title":"Chipmunk at campground of Dead Horse Point State Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545556","545564","557615","550468","554597","550472","542629","543265","555668","545549","550469","554599","550470","554621","543851","542630"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","vitality","behavior","closeness","clean","creature","flare","lens","sunlight","world"]}
