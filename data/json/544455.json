{"path":"544455.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scene showing evidence of a recent storm or other disruptive event. It features several large, green utility poles that have fallen onto a concrete surface, possibly a street or driveway. These poles appear to have been snapped at their bases, lying diagonally across the frame, disrupting the normal order of the environment. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight, with shadows cast by the poles and surrounding trees creating a contrast on the concrete.\n\nIn the background, there is a single-storey house with a white exterior and a large porch area. The house features a mid-century architectural style, including a flat roof and modest design elements. The yard around the house is cluttered with various items and debris, possibly as a result of the storm or ongoing construction or repairs. There is also a white van parked in front of the house.\n\nThe overall setting is residential, with mature trees and greenery surrounding the area, suggesting a suburban neighborhood. The ambiance is one of calm after a significant event, highlighted by the clear sky and the stark presence of the fallen infrastructure.","title":"Guadalupe river flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544466","545966","547079","544583","557350","544458","557978","544468","544461","544467","557993","557977","547130","544464","544463","544587"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["house","storm","pole","basis","event","driveway","disrupt","order","result","repair"]}
