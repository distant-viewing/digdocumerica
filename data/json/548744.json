{"path":"548744.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows a group of tall trees, seemingly taken during winter or early spring, as indicated by the leafless state of some trees and the presence of coniferous trees still bearing foliage. The sky, visible through and above the treetops, is a pale blue, adorned with minimal cloud coverage, hinting at cold weather. The trees in the foreground are primarily leafless deciduous types, with their intricate, bare branches extending upwards. Among these, several coniferous trees stand out due to their dark green foliage, which contrasts starkly against the more muted tones of the deciduous trees and the sky. This mix of tree types suggests a mixed forest environment, possibly in a temperate climate zone. The composition of the image, with its focus upwards towards the treetops against the sky, creates a feeling of openness and height, emphasizing the natural vertical lines formed by the trees. This perspective invites the viewer to consider the natural world's quiet and potentially chilly atmosphere.","title":"Some of the still standing trees of Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key, much of whose land area has been cleared to make way for a \"travel-trailer\" camp.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["555201","543621","553576","554746","553579","554984","544918","553574","542725","553575","549234","548685","543442","550537","557019","555217"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["treetop","tree","type","coverage","foliage","openness","world","winter","spring","climate"]}
