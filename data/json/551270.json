{"path":"551270.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene featuring a sailboat on a body of water, its white sails fully unfurled and catching the breeze. The boat is moving from right to left across the frame, and its hull is predominantly white. The boat has a prominent \"72\" visible on the sail, along with a smaller emblem near the top. In the background, amidst a lush, densely forested hillside, stands a distinctive modern architecture building. This building is multi-leveled, featuring horizontal lines that contrast dynamically with the natural surroundings. The structure is supported by what appears to be a stone foundation or lower section, and it includes several vertical elements that might be chimneys or decorative features, enhancing its unique profile. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene, emphasizing a blend of human activity and natural beauty.","title":"Sailboat on Lake Ozark passes expensive vacation home","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557425","544669","557416","544224","542908","548118","547273","543941","547757","544667","544663","543217","552348","544717","552343","548204"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sail","foundation","emblem","boat","breeze","sailboat","hull","profile","hillside","chimney"]}
