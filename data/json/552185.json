{"path":"552185.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial facility surrounded by a forested area. At the central focus of the image is a tall chimney from which a considerable amount of white smoke is emitted, suggesting active production or processing operations within the facility. The chimney stands prominently against the sprawling forest backdrop.\n\nAround the base of the chimney, several interconnected large industrial buildings can be observed. These buildings appear to be constructed primarily of metal and are functional in style, typical of manufacturing or processing plants. The layout of the facility includes multiple tracks and roads that interconnect different parts of the plant, potentially for the transport of materials or goods.\n\nIn the larger setting, the plant is situated within a landscape that is dominantly green, indicating a dense forest area that extends to the horizon. This juxtaposition of industrial activity with natural surroundings emphasizes the contrast between human economic activities and nature.\n\nIn the foreground, numerous lumber piles and clearings suggest that the facility could possibly be involved in timber processing or a related industry. The bodies of water and wet grounds around the buildings reflect industrial usage and management of the natural resources in the area.\n\nThe image is taken from an elevated perspective, likely from an aircraft, giving a comprehensive view of both the extent of the industrial operations and its environmental context. The time appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the muted lighting and long shadows, adding a somewhat serene but industrious quality to the scene.","title":"Smoke stack of aluminum smelting plant","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543011","545113","548195","544777","543005","550329","546141","543733","550716","546760","551567","544495","545244","546236","543749","551056"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["chimney","processing","facility","plant","extent","lumber","operation","forest","timber","usage"]}
