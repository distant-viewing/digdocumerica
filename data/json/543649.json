{"path":"543649.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an industrial environment, likely a factory or processing plant. The foreground features a concrete trench, filled with murky water that is flowing through it; the trench is bordered by rocky, uneven ground and some scattered debris. Above the trench, an assortment of industrial pipes and valves are visible, which suggest some form of fluid transportation or waste management system is in place.\n\nCentral and background elements of the image include a complex array of factory infrastructureâ€”multiple levels of metal walkways, stairs, and platforms are evident, all constructed with a heavy-duty metal framework. The structures are densely packed, creating a labyrinthine appearance. Various pieces of machinery, metal containers, and another set of pipelines accentuate the industrial function of the setting.\n\nA key visual element in the image is the lighting; there's an overhead lamp with a bright light that illuminates part of the trench, adding a contrasting glow to the otherwise dim scene likely due to an overcast or dusk/dawn time setting. The overall mood is gritty and raw, embodying a typical industrial work environment that emphasizes function over aesthetics. No people are visible in the scene, which directs the focus solely on the industrial elements and machinery.","title":"Cement plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["557388","546757","557387","543810","544048","544153","546767","543158","557390","550684","547956","546085","545992","546108","556402","552003"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["trench","function","metal","valf","embody","overcast","machinery","fluid","heavy","stair"]}
