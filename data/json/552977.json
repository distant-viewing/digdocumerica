{"path":"552977.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a relaxed and intimate scene on a beach. A man and a woman are the central figures. The man is reclining on the sand, propped up on his elbows. He wears glasses, a plaid short-sleeved shirt, and dark pants. His bare feet are casually stretched towards the water, which gently laps the sandy shore near them.\n\nThe woman is seated directly behind him. She wraps her arms around his neck from behind in a gentle embrace, her body leaning slightly against his back for support. She wears a greenish long sleeve shirt tucked neatly into her dark pants. A wide green headband holds back her hair, giving her a neat and tidy appearance.\n\nThe beach scene is tranquil, with clear sunlight casting shadows and highlighting the contours of the wet and dry sand. The water next to them glistens under the sunlight. The background is simple, focusing on the sandy beach and reflective water. This setting imparts a calm and serene atmosphere to the image, emphasizing a moment of peacefulness and togetherness. The overall mood suggested by the photograph is one of quiet connection and contentment shared between the two individuals.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
