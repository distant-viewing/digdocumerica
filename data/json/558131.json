{"path":"558131.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively suburban scene where children are engaged in outdoor activities. It features three young individuals—two boys and one girl—riding bicycles along a paved pathway that courses through a well-maintained grassy area, possibly a park or community space.\n\nOn the left, there is a large brick building with two visible windows, adding an urban touch to the scene. In front of this building, neatly planted trees in a row contribute to the greenery, enhancing the suburban feel.\n\nCentered in the foreground is a small circular brick structure, possibly a planter or a fountain, surrounded by additional greenery. This element serves as a focal point in the composition, around which the pathway curves.\n\nTo the right of the photo stands a wooden two-story house painted in a light, salmon color, with a symmetrical design featuring a central door and evenly spaced windows. The house’s quaint and tidy appearance complements the overall peaceful setting.\n\nBehind the wooden house, a tall wooden fence is visible, marking the boundaries of the property and ensuring privacy. The sky appears clear and sunny, suggesting a warm, pleasant day.\n\nOverall, the photograph showcases a snapshot of everyday life in a suburban community, emphasizing outdoor activity, community infrastructure, and the harmonious integration of urban and residential elements.","title":"A newly created park downtown on Minnesota Street in New Ulm, Minnesota","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["547433","557290","546545","557699","557437","548574","546430","547946","557365","547938","556170","550689","550121","547211","545201","557405"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["house","community","pathway","salmon","brick","planter","privacy","integration","course","fountain"]}
