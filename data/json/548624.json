{"path":"548624.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed scene on a sunny beach day. The prominent subject in the foreground is a man lying on his back on a beach towel. He is shirtless, wearing only swim shorts, and appears to be sunbathing or resting. He is reclined comfortably with his arms positioned casually by his sides and his head turned towards the camera, giving the impression of a relaxed and serene moment.\n\nThe background shows a scenic view of the beach stretching towards the horizon. The sand appears fine and golden, leading towards the blue sea which includes visible waves and a couple of people distantly enjoying the water. The sky above is partly cloudy with some fluffy white clouds against a bright blue backdrop, conveying a typical sunny day.\n\nIn addition to natural elements, there are lens flares visible in the image, likely caused by the bright sunlight striking the camera lens directly. These flares add an artistic touch to the photograph, creating a slightly dreamy effect. Overall, the composition and the elements present depict a peaceful beach day, providing a sense of relaxation and leisure typical of a seaside setting.","title":"Sunbathing at South Beach, a popular retirement center","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["553882","543477","547935","553685","550930","550932","548541","547503","547507","545162","547628","550920","547491","550923","548623","547680"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","flare","lens","seaside","swim","addition","towel","camera","day","relaxation"]}
