{"path":"553968.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid aerial view overlooking a large industrial facility emitting significant amounts of smoke, set against a partially residential backdrop. The industrial facility at the foreground features multiple large structures, including two prominent tall smokestacks releasing thick, white smoke. The buildings are predominantly rust-colored, matching the large, bare patches of reddish soil adjacent to the plant, suggesting soil displacement or storage related to the facilityâ€™s operations.\n\nBehind the industrial area, there is a contrasting serene residential zone comprising numerous houses interspersed with greenery. The homes appear close-knit, each with its own distinct roof and surrounded by lush tropical vegetation, indicating a warm climate. Further in the background, expanses of open fields painted in shades of red and green suggest agricultural use. The overall setting has a slightly overcast sky, filtering the light and casting soft shadows over both the industrial and residential areas, highlighting the stark contrast between the industrial activity and the residential life existing in close proximity.","title":"Lihue plantation sugar mill","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["550866","548376","544058","546141","551567","550339","550706","544495","557303","547126","550862","543733","548195","550329","543001","546005"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["facility","soil","exist","smoke","release","knit","hom","emitte","overlook","contrasting"]}
