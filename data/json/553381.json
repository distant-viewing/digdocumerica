{"path":"553381.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy construction site with various activities occurring simultaneously. In the foreground, a prominent piece of heavy construction equipment, specifically a Caterpillar 631A scraper, is featured. The scraper, painted in yellow and marked with the number \"4,\" is being operated by a worker who is visible in the open driver's compartment. The wheels and body of the vehicle are coated with dirt, indicating active usage on the site.\n\nBehind the scraper, another similar machine is partially visible. This machine is also engaged in construction activities, moving dirt or debris. Several large piles of gravel and dirt are scattered around the area, suggesting excavation or landscaping work.\n\nFurther in the background, more elements of the construction site are visible, including additional heavy machinery and construction vehicles. There is a red truck parked alongside the site and several industrial tanks or drums positioned near the vehicles. A group of workers can be seen in the distance, wearing hard hats and involved in discussions or overseeing the work.\n\nThe environment is rugged and dusty, typical of construction zones. The terrain is uneven with visible tracks from the movement of heavy vehicles. The landscape is largely devoid of vegetation, focusing solely on the construction activity and equipment present in the scene.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction this is an EPA-assisted project.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["543107","553378","543114","553382","545652","555636","547236","545664","555638","545665","547243","557742","553394","550274","542539","556939"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","dirt","vehicle","machine","worker","drum","compartment","landscaping","equipment"]}
