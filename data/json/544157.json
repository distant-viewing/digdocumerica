{"path":"544157.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a large crane positioned in a rugged industrial landscape. The crane is vibrant, primarily orange and cream in color, bearing the label \"The 101 Mine\". The image shows the crane's substantial metal structure extending upwards with visible wires and joints, emphasizing its industrial purpose and strength.\n\nThe crane is stationed on a flat area amidst piles of dark-colored gravel or ores, suggesting a mining or excavation site. There are several distinct piles of these materials in the foreground, their textures rough and irregular, contrasting with the smoother, manufactured appearance of the crane. The ground appears muddy and uneven, likely from the movement of heavy machinery and excavation work.\n\nThe background is relatively nondescript with a light blue sky, a few clouds, and a hint of a distant horizon, possibly indicating the remote location of this mining operation. A bird can be seen in the sky, adding a touch of nature to the otherwise industrial scene.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the scale and functional aspect of the crane within the context of heavy industry and extraction processes.","title":"Strip mining with dragline equipment at the Navajo Mine in Northern Arizona","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["545887","545655","544156","554770","554545","555593","544109","550874","555586","547615","548773","553027","545883","544134","545648","547223"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["crane","excavation","mining","pile","ore","strength","mine","extraction","cream","label"]}
