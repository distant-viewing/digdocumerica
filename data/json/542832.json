{"path":"542832.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a forested area with clear signs of extensive logging activity. In the image, you can see a sharp contrast between a densely wooded area and a large, devastated patch without trees, covered with fallen logs and debris. The cleared section displays a chaotic array of timber, indicating recent cutting and removal of trees.\n\nA winding road is visible, snaking through the logged area and into the forest, suggesting access routes used for logging operations. The surrounding untouched forest area appears dark and dense, offering a stark visual juxtaposition against the barren and disrupted terrain of the logged section.\n\nThe topography is slightly sloped, aiding in the visual flow from forested to deforested areas. The lighting in the image suggests either dawn or dusk, casting long shadows and enhancing the textural details of the scene, highlighting the environmental impact of such logging practices. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of disruption and contrast between human activity and natural landscape.","title":"'Clear cutting'","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542833","545143","542827","557001","542834","555085","555221","542823","556922","550354","555208","555198","542947","545138","555143","542820"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["logging","cutting","removal","section","disruption","forest","timber","topography","practice","route"]}
