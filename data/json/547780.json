{"path":"547780.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a busy multi-lane highway, showcasing the dynamics of urban transportation. Several lanes of traffic are visible, extending into the distant horizon, converging and diverging at various points.\n\nThe highway is teeming with vehicles, hinting at a scene of daily commute, likely either during rush hours or due to a traffic incident causing congestion. The vehicles vary in size, suggesting the presence of both personal cars and larger commercial transport vehicles.\n\nOn either side of the highway, the land is primarily developed; tall buildings indicative of a business or residential area can be seen to the left of the highway. The buildings display typical architectural features of mid to late 20th-century urban development.\n\nThe environment around the highway includes green grassy areas, which serve as buffers and possibly aid in the aesthetic enhancement of the roadway system. Above the highway, there are overpasses visible, likely serving as connections for vehicles transitioning between different routes.\n\nThe skyline in the background is muted, characterized by a pale blue sky with light haze, which could suggest air pollution typical of heavily trafficked urban areas.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the scale and complexity of highway systems in large cities, capturing a moment in the lives of countless individuals as they navigate through the urban landscape. The perspective offered is expansive, giving viewers a comprehensive sense of the scope of traffic movement and urban sprawl.","title":"Friday afternoon traffic on the Dallas freeways","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546686","546713","547770","553838","546726","546608","552719","546709","546734","546612","546681","547785","548391","556194","549902","553015"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","vehicle","system","diverge","buffer","incident","commute","scope","teem"]}
