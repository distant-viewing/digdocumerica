{"path":"547380.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of social gathering, likely during a party or event. Two older women are the focal point of the image, involved in serving punch. The woman on the left, wearing a white sleeveless dress with a red waistband and matching red earrings, is pouring punch from a ladle into a clear glass cup. She is concentrating on her task and appears engaged in the activity. The woman on the right, dressed in a sleeveless blue dress, is also holding a ladle and appears to be either waiting her turn or conversing with the woman on the left. Her attire is complemented by a bracelet and glasses.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows more people, suggesting a larger gathering or social event. These individuals are in varied attire suggesting a casual or semi-formal gathering. The setting seems to be an interior room with windows covered with white curtains, and decorated with what looks like traditional furnishings. The table with the punch bowl is covered with a yellow patterned tablecloth, and there are other refreshments visible on the table.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of interaction and activity typical of social occasions among a group of mature adults. The atmosphere is one of engagement and community, emphasized by the direct involvement of the two women in the preparation of drinks for the guests.","title":"Refreshment time at the monthly meeting of the Seward chapter of the \"PEO\" Sisterhood.
