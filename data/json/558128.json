{"path":"558128.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a two-story blue building with architectural details typical of the late 19th or early 20th century. The vivid blue facade has a darker blue trim and is divided into three vertical sections, each with a rounded white-framed window on both the first and second floors. Each second-floor window features a flower box bursting with red and pink blooms. \n\nThe building's architectural details include ornate white cornices at the top edge and a lintel above each window creating a sophisticated and traditional look. On the ground level, besides the main entrance, there's an additional entrance to the right which is not clearly visible due to the angle of the photo.\n\nThe main entrance is accessed by a short flight of concrete steps with a metal handrail. Above this entrance is a white sign with black lettering advertising a law office, insurance agency, and public notary services. Additional signage on a post by the sidewalk echoes these details. \n\nThe bottom edge of the image is somewhat obscured by the roof of a car, indicating that the photo might have been taken from inside or near another vehicle.\n\nThe building is flanked by sidewalks and a modest patch of grass. The surroundings hint at a small-town or urban setting, without visible neighboring buildings in the immediate vicinity of the photo.","title":"A restored building on Center Street in New Ulm, Minnesota which had been a family home.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["557156","557643","546436","546440","545334","556182","555949","558122","558029","556046","544088","550042","550677","552964","558126","558031"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["entrance","sidewalk","19th","neighboring","detail","floor","cornice","law","handrail","window"]}
