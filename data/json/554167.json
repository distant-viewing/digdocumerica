{"path":"554167.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo features an outdoor scene on a golf course. There are two men standing on a well-maintained grassy area, actively engaged in playing golf. One man is in the mid-swing, holding his golf club above his head, poised to strike the ball, while the other stands nearby, likely watching the shot or waiting for his turn.\n\nThe golf course appears to be in a semi-arid landscape given the dry, bushy hill visible in the background. Thereâ€™s a road that curves around this hill, and several tall, white lamp posts line the course and possibly the road, implying that the area supports play or traffic during dimmer light conditions.\n\nThe sky has a soft gradient, possibly indicating either dawn or dusk, contributing to the serene and calm atmosphere typical of golf courses. The terrain in the distance looks relatively flat with a broad horizon. Overall, the scene captures a peaceful moment of sportsmanship in a quiet, natural setting.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela. Land Use Commission staff recommended total denial of developers' petition for rezoning. The commission, however, permitted 3,414 acres of the 5,000 requested to pass over to urban use. Since then, 900 lots have been sold but little building has been done, leaving an empty subdivision to be protected by county services. Residents play on golf course in rezoned section.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554149","543633","554492","552608","557512","546959","549069","554148","546513","558098","548821","545249","547286","543262","553980","546509"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","course","club","swing","ball","turn","hill","road","gradient","lamp"]}
