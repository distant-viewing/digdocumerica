{"path":"544889.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a detailed view of a desert environment, prominently featuring a small tree or shrub growing out of a cracked, reddish-brown, clay soil. This tree has a thin trunk and is bushy, populated with small, grayish-green leaves, suggesting it is well-adapted to arid conditions. The roots of the tree are partially exposed above the surface, highlighting its struggle for stability and nourishment in the tough soil.\n\nThe soil itself is deeply fissured, indicative of arid or semi-arid climate effects where water erosion and extreme temperature changes cause the soil to crack deeply. These cracks suggest that the area experiences infrequent but possibly intense rain.\n\nIn terms of composition, the image is a close-up and focuses primarily on the interaction of the plant with its harsh soil environment. The background, though out of focus, implies a continuation of the barren, desert-like landscape with no visible signs of water or other vegetation. The lighting appears natural and harsh, likely midday, casting clear and detailed shadows that accentuate the textures of the soil and the rugged survival form of the plant.","title":"Exposed root system at eroded bank.
