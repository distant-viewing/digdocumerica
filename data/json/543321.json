{"path":"543321.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a sandy beach area surrounded by vegetation. The beach is crowded with a diverse group of people, primarily teenagers and children, engaged in various activities. The atmosphere appears dynamic and casual.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left, a girl with long hair, wearing a dark sleeveless top and trousers with a red belt, strides purposefully across the sand. In the center, another girl, wearing a striped top and jeans, is extending her arms, possibly to catch or throw something, while another child next to her in a green top is sitting on the sand reaching out.\n\nScattered around are numerous other individuals who are sitting, standing, and interacting in small groups. Many people are dressed in casual, colorful clothing typical of warm, outdoor settings. The clothing styles suggest a time period that could be from the late '70s to early '80s given the fashion styles like flared trousers and layered hairstyles.\n\nThe background reveals more people enjoying the area, some walking and others gathered in groups, with dense green foliage and a clear blue sky overhead. The scene exudes a sense of youthful energy and the relaxed enjoyment associated with beach outings, possibly during a school trip or a community gathering. Patches of sandy ground and natural vegetation are visible around the groups, emphasizing the outdoor, natural setting of the activity.","title":"Natural Arches Beach (State Park)","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["546794","555923","546768","547482","546874","548541","550243","543534","546942","543216","550936","547503","550239","553951","544206","550933"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["beach","group","girl","trouser","sand","80","top","walking","teenager","clothing"]}
