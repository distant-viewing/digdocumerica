{"path":"547353.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting in an office-like environment filled with various items. The man is wearing glasses, a buttoned-up shirt under a dark vest, and a thicker jacket on top, suggesting it might be cold. He appears to be seated comfortably in an office chair, slightly reclining with one arm extended, resting over the arm of the chair or possibly an adjacent object.\n\nThe background of the image is busy and cluttered, indicating a workspace used for practical and perhaps creative purposes. To the left, there are large windows that allow natural light to flood the space, and numerous items hang from the window frames, including what looks like a horseshoe for decoration or luck. The walls and surfaces are stacked with papers, books, a variety of containers, and miscellaneous objects that give the space a lived-in, somewhat chaotic feel.\n\nBehind the man, there is a desk covered with more papers, and above it, shelves filled with even more items. There are visible labels and what appear to be small hand tools, suggesting that the place might serve as a workshop or a general office for someone engaged in hands-on activities or management. The overall ambiance is that of a personal workspace that has evolved organically over many years of use.","title":"Walter Doehing, owner of the only gas station and store in the little town of Surprise.
