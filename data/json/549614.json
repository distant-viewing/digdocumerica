{"path":"549614.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This is a photograph of a large, red-lightship moored on a calm body of water, likely a harbor or bay, judging by the smoothness of the water and the presence of distant land. The lightship has the name \"AMBROSE\" visible on its hull in white lettering, indicating it is likely the Lightship Ambrose, which served as a floating lighthouse. The ship itself is robust and painted with a bold, cherry red that stands out against the muted backdrop.\n\nThe vessel features a variety of deck equipment, including several masts with lines and rigging, and a large lattice superstructure that supports the main light beacon atop the ship. There are also antennas and other navigation aids visible on the upper desks and masts, reflecting its role in maritime guidance and safety.\n\nThe sky above the ship is overcast, bathing the scene in diffused, soft light. A thin strip of land is visible in the far background, shrouded partially by mist or low-lying clouds, which blurs the line between the water and the sky, creating an atmosphere of isolation and tranquility. The overall composition of the photograph, with the ship dominating the central portion of the frame and the vast surroundings, underscores the size and importance of the vessel in its environment.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
