{"path":"548642.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of an airstrip located on a narrow strip of land, which is surrounded by clear ocean waters on one side and a chain of smaller islands or keys in the distance. The airstrip runs nearly parallel to the length of the land, with marked lanes and parking or storage areas having a pale, possibly sandy or gravel texture. The runway area is devoid of tall vegetation, featuring marked sections and paths, and appears well-maintained.\n\nOn either side of the runway, dense green vegetation suggests a tropical or subtropical environment, possibly mangrove or similar coastal forest. Two distinct bodies of water can be seen on the land adjacent to the airstrip; these could be ponds or water collection areas, and they are irregular in shape.\n\nThe overall color palette of the scene is dominated by the bright turquoise of the sea, contrasting with the lush green of the vegetation and the pale colors of the runway and its infrastructure. The absence of visible structures or vehicles suggests the airstrip might be infrequently used or possibly reserved for specific types of activities. The location seems remote, indicating it might be used for either private purposes or special types of operations requiring isolation from populous areas.","title":"Land development at Big Pine Key, showing the typical scraped land and \"plugged\" canals of the developers in this area. Permits to open artificial waterways to the sea are hard to get. Developers dig the canals anyway, but stop them just short of open water. Buyers assume that these \"plugs\" will eventually be removed.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548776","548782","556932","556941","548605","548630","548785","548430","548777","548604","556909","549520","550575","548787","554171","548786"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["runway","land","key","mangrove","turquoise","type","reserve","vegetation","require","island"]}
