{"path":"554448.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a gathering, likely a ceremonial or memorial event, with a mix of uniformed personnel and civilians in an outdoor setting, characterized by an unpaved lot and greenery in the backdrop.\n\nSeveral individuals in different uniforms are visible. On the left, a man in a white naval uniform with dark sunglasses stands facing another man in a police-style white cap and dark sunglasses. The man in the police cap holds a rifle, positioned vertically in front of him, with his hands clasped around the barrel. Behind these individuals, a large, white car, likely from the 1960s based on its styling, has an American flag displayed on its front.\n\nOn the right side of the image, three men in what appear to be military or ceremonial outfits, likely from a veterans' organization, are holding flags. One of the flags is the American flag, while the others bear different emblems, suggesting they could be military or perhaps state flags. The men holding the flags wear military-style caps with badges and dark blazers with patches and ribbons, which indicates a form of ceremonial uniform.\n\nIn the background, there are several more people observing or participating in the event. Another white vintage car is visible, and there are bystanders, some of whom wear casual civilian clothes and others in what appear to be different uniforms or service attire, indicating a diverse group in attendance.\n\nThe setting hints at a small-town environment given the casual dress of some attendees, the simplicity of the surroundings, and the presence of older model cars. This event, likely commemorating or celebrating a specific occasion, presents a snapshot of community and military engagement from a past era.","title":"Citizens of Inlet, New York, prepare for Memorial Day parade","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["557706","549697","549698","556275","549701","549577","554450","549571","557059","557715","556246","551935","558274","557707","549700","558279"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["flag","uniform","police","cap","event","sunglass","man","rifle","car","personnel"]}
