{"path":"542962.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a young elk backlit by a strong light source, which creates a glowing outline around its body and especially highlights the tips of its ears, chin, and fur. The elk is facing slightly towards the viewer with its head turned to its right, allowing its facial features and expression to be visible. The animal's fur appears somewhat mottled or in the process of shedding, giving it a rugged texture.\n\nThe background is predominantly dark, enhancing the contrast with the bright outline of the elk. The dark setting gives the image a dramatic and moody atmosphere. The lighting accentuates the contours of the elk's body and face, creating a sense of depth and detail in the fur and features. The overall composition focuses on the interplay of light and shadow, conveying a serene yet vivid portrayal of a moment in nature.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542964","543022","555068","554621","545902","544916","542959","546159","542599","546163","550495","542778","558368","545898","552339","550381"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","outline","chin","ear","tip","portrayal","feature","source","contour","animal"]}
