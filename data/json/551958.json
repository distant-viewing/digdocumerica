{"path":"551958.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting where a group of people are assembled under a large, concrete pergola with a rectangular frame. The image is taken during the day, suggested by the outdoor light and shadows visible in the scene.\n\nUnder the shaded structure, individuals are engaged in casual social activities, mainly focused on playing chess, as indicated by the small, visible chessboards on the wall that some of the participants are intensely concentrating on. The group is diverse, comprising both men and women, dressed in typical casual outdoor attire. Several men wear hats, indicative of a sunny day.\n\nThe people are seated on what appears to be a continuous concrete bench that runs along the inside of the pergola, facing inwards towards the chessboards. The atmosphere seems quiet and contemplative, typical of a chess game setting.\n\nThe background behind the pergola is blurred, suggesting a vast, open space, possibly a park or a waterfront area, given the suggestion of a clear, open sky and a faint horizon line. The foreground is composed of a well-maintained grassy area, enhancing the tranquility of the setting. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on leisurely recreation in a public space, portrays a slice of everyday life and outdoor community interaction.","title":"Playing chess in Lincoln Park Pavilion near La Salle Drive","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553158","553215","551265","553197","556522","551017","553950","552036","553065","557985","552033","550074","557955","555947","551771","548568"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["suggestion","inside","game","group","recreation","participant","space","outdoor","slice","bench"]}
