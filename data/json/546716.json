{"path":"546716.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a bustling multi-lane roadway, filled with vehicles of various models and colors. The road consists of multiple lanes in both directions, separated by painted road markings. Colors of the vehicles range from white and yellow to blue and red, contributing to a vibrant scene indicative of busy city life.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are two rows of cars parked parallel to each other, tightly packed along the curb next to a sidewalk. Beyond the parked cars and sidewalk, several red brick buildings can be observed. These buildings appear to be either residential or small-scale commercial properties, characterized by their traditional architectural features and small balconies.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a series of commercial establishments, visible by their signs and facades. One prominently displayed sign reads \"PARK FREE,\" suggesting complimentary parking services, likely to attract customers. The area seems urban, possibly on the outskirts of a downtown core given the mix of residential and commercial properties.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a dynamic and somewhat congested street scene, providing a snapshot of urban transportation and architecture from a bygone era, as evidenced by the vintage make and models of the cars. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the traffic flow and surrounding environment, making it a rich tableau of urban life.","title":"City traffic","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546730","547369","547776","553301","556724","546370","543961","549919","556195","555450","549886","556709","551135","548419","552711","545216"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["property","sidewalk","model","core","make","road","car","tableau","customer","curb"]}
