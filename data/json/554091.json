{"path":"554091.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a coastal landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and deep blue hues. The image prominently features several distinct elements:\n\n1. **Mountain Range**: Dominating the left side of the photograph is a large mountain range with pronounced ridges and peaks. The mountain faces are devoid of dense vegetation, showcasing exposed rock or sparse scrubland in various shades of purple and mauve, possibly due to the lighting.\n\n2. **Coastline and Water Body**: To the immediate right of the mountain range, the image captures a broad stretch of water, which gleams dark blue under the ambient light. The coast curves gently, and there is a slight glint on the water's surface, suggesting calm conditions.\n\n3. **Settlements and Infrastructure**: Along the coastline, there are clusters of lights and structures indicating populated areas. The settlement appears dense with buildings in some sections, interspersed with areas that seem less developed. Patches of land near the coast are divided into geometric parcels, possibly agricultural or unused land plots, visible due to their red and ochre tones.\n\n4. **Background**:\n   - **Sky**: The upper portion of the image shows a sky transitioning in color from a deep blue at the top, gradually lightening towards the horizon. The horizon line is adorned with soft, low clouds that catch some of the ambient light.\n   - **Distant Land Masses and Clouds**: Farther along the coastline and into the background, additional land features faintly appear, merging with the horizon under a layer of distant clouds.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a rich display of natural and human-modified landscapes, emphasizing geographical features and the interaction between the land and the sea. The lighting conditions enhance the mood and bring out varied textures and colors in the landscape.","title":"Maalaea Bay area north of Kihei is a combination of agricultural, conservation, and urban sections.
