{"path":"552032.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene park setting with a group of six people gathered around a picnic table. The scene unfolds on an expansive lawn that stretches toward a river or large body of water, visible in the background. The water is quite calm with some light ripples, suggesting a peaceful day. Trees sporadically dot the landscape, adding splashes of green and creating a relaxed, natural setting. Just behind the picnic table on the left, a lamp post with twin lights stands, enhancing the park-like feel of the environment. It appears to be a sunny day, as evidenced by the bright lighting and the shadows cast by the trees and the lamp post. The people at the table, some facing towards us and others with their backs turned, seem to be engaging with each other, possibly enjoying a meal or a casual gathering, contributing to a leisurely and communal atmosphere.","title":"Midsummer evening family picnic on goat island.
