{"path":"557952.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape prominently featuring two buildings with distinct architectural styles under a partly cloudy sky. On the left stands a classical white church characterized by its clean, simple lines and a prominent steeple that includes a spire topped with a weather vane. This traditional design imbues the building with a sense of calm and reverence. The church is situated amid lush green lawns with some visitors visible in small groups, giving a sense of scale and activity without overpowering the peacefulness of the setting.\n\nTo the right across a spacious, grassy field bounded by a low dark fence is a more complex, multi-section building appearing to be a large house or perhaps a community building. It features elements of classical architecture including a portico with columns, large windows, and an elaborate entrance that adds to its grandeur. This structure's facade contrasts with the rustic red outbuildings adjacent to it, which add a functional, utilitarian touch to the otherwise dignified and residential appearance.\n\nThe surrounding area is richly vegetated with an assortment of mature trees and manicured grass, enhancing the bucolic feel. The background is bordered by a dense tree line that provides a natural green backdrop, reinforcing the quiet and isolated atmosphere of this rural setting. Overall, this photograph depicts a tranquil scene that blends architectural beauty and natural landscapes harmoniously.","title":"Meeting house on the green at the left in the hale farm and western reserve village near Akron, Ohio.
