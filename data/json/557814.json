{"path":"557814.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil ocean scene viewed from above, dominated by the vast, textured surface of the water. The ocean displays a gradient of colors ranging from a deep blue to a lighter turquoise, indicating variations in water depth or the presence of underwater features. The surface of the water is slightly rippled, suggesting a gentle breeze. There are no visible landforms, boats, or people; the image focuses solely on the natural patterns and hues of the sea. The lighting in the photograph suggests it could be taken during late afternoon, with subtle sunlight enhancing the serene blue tones of the water. The overall composition is simple yet thoughtful, emphasizing the expansive and undisturbed nature of the ocean.","title":"Dumping area for acid wastes in the New York Bight near New York City.
