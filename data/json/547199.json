{"path":"547199.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The image depicts a young girl riding a bicycle in an urban park setting. The girl, dressed in a light-colored shirt with a decorative pattern and white shorts, appears focused and slightly leaning forward while handling the bicycle. The bicycle is a classic design, possibly a cruiser, characterized by its shiny chrome handlebars and a curving frame. \n\nThe background features large, densely packed high-rise apartment buildings, suggesting an urban environment. There are a few cars parked in the distance and a bench, implying this could be a designated recreational area in the city. Trees are sparsely scattered throughout the grassy areas, and their shadows are cast on the ground, indicating it might be late afternoon or early evening, based on the lighting.\n\nThis scene captures a moment of youthful enjoyment and recreation, set against the contrasting backdrop of urban architecture. The composition of the photo, with the child in movement and the buildings stationary, creates a dynamic urban tableau.","title":"Highrise buildings border Lincoln park, Chicago's largest lakefront park","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555436","551303","553515","551727","551456","546967","553908","551464","551443","551681","546465","557699","547209","551545","554312","544967"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["bicycle","girl","cruiser","handlebar","designate","tableau","curving","stationary","chrome","recreation"]}
