{"path":"544152.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a structure shaped like a traditional Native American tipi, modified into a commercial store. The tipi is predominantly white, with decorative red and brown elements near its base that resemble mountains or zigzag patterns, common in Native American art. The structure prominently features the Enco logo, a brand of energy company, implying that the tipi serves as a store or service station.\n\nAt the base of the tipi, there is a small, rectangular window that functions as a service counter. On this window, there are various signs, including one for Pepsi and another yellow sign that likely provides information about services or policies. The sign next to the windowreads \"Rest Rooms in Store,\" informing customers that restroom facilities are available inside.\n\nTo the left of the tipi is another sign mounted on a post, stating \"Use Your Gas Credit Cards,\" suggesting that the facility offers gas and accepts credit cards as payment. The sky is clear and bright blue, indicating that the photo was taken during the day under good weather conditions. The overall scene has a strong commercial and promotional feel, blending traditional Native American architectural styles with modern commercial advertising.","title":"Tepee gas station on Route 66","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544148","554184","554185","552518","555506","547866","555487","548047","555414","555517","544113","555494","555467","557679","548175","557336"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["service","store","sign","zigzag","card","modify","base","customer","counter","facility"]}
