{"path":"545740.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of outdoor recreation with a group of people riding in a speed boat on a body of water that has a muted brownish color. The boat, painted in green and white, moves swiftly across the water, creating a spray of water in its wake. This suggests the boat is moving at a high speed. Inside the boat, there are four individuals: one appears to be piloting the boat, and three others are passengers. They are dressed in casual outdoor attire suitable for a day of boating.\n\nThe background features a dramatic rock formation, characterized by horizontally layered red rocks, which implies a sedimentary geological structure likely formed over millions of years. The rocks have rich, variably dark and light red hues, showcasing natural weathering and erosion patterns. The overall setting suggests a rugged, natural area typical of river canyons, possibly in a location akin to the Colorado Plateau in the United States.\n\nThis combination of high-speed water activity set against a serene and ancient geological backdrop creates a vivid contrast between the energy of human activity and the timeless quietude of nature. The image captures a moment of leisure and exploration in a striking natural environment.","title":"Traveling down the Colorado River in a jet boat under the guidance of Tag-Along-Tours of Moab.
