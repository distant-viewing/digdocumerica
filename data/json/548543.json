{"path":"548543.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is a vivid, detailed photograph of a bustling marina. The scene captures multiple vessels of varying sizes and types docked in the water. Notably, a large boat named \"Tia-Lee\" is prominently dry-docked on a structure above the water level. Surrounding this principal boat are several other craft, including a sailboat with raised masts, a cabin cruiser berthed next to a smaller roofed structure, and various motorboats and sailboats moored to the wooden docks.\n\nBeyond the boats, the marina is equipped with industrial equipment and materials indicating ongoing maintenance or construction activities. There are cranes, scattered boat parts, and other marine apparatus densely packed in the area. A wooden shack-like structure with a corrugated metal roof appears to serve as a storehouse or workshop facing the waterfront. \n\nThe background shows other maritime elements and vegetation, suggesting this marina might be near a coastal region or on an island. The visible cars, including classic models, indicate that this photo was likely taken several decades ago. The marina is vibrant and appears to be a hub of nautical activity, capturing the essence of marine life and trade. The photograph overall depicts a lively, working marina with various maritime operations in progress.","title":"At the commercial fishing docks","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["542912","542871","552027","552028","545155","548075","546853","542650","546877","542902","548078","548969","557450","548547","548535","544130"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["marina","boat","sailboat","cruiser","shack","trade","overall","motorboat","craft","mast"]}
