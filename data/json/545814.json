{"path":"545814.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated building with the sign \"Little Mexico\" displayed prominently on the front. The building appears to be a run-down structure made of stucco or a similar material, painted in a light color that has largely peeled or faded away, revealing the underlying bricks or blocks. It has a flat roof, parts of which have collapsed or are severely damaged.\n\nThe facade of the building includes a large opening that might once have been a doorway or window, now covered over with slats of wood. Adjacent to this are what look to be remnants of stalls or enclosures made of different lengths of wood and metal bars, contributing to a sense of abandonment and disrepair.\n\nIn front of the building, the ground is barren and uneven with visible patches of dirt and small debris scattered around. On the left, a sign featuring a bottle and glass motif suggests that this location might once have served as a bar or restaurant associated with Mexican culture or cuisine.\n\nThe backdrop of the image shows a dramatic sky filled with clouds, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light, which casts a moody atmosphere over the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of desolation and neglect, portraying what might once have been a vibrant establishment having fallen into ruin.","title":"Abandoned cantina","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["546051","554707","543171","550140","557344","552528","544656","553548","547894","557348","543344","557347","556330","552681","550285","553555"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["bar","stucco","underlie","slat","wood","ruin","collapse","restaurant","enclosure","motif"]}
