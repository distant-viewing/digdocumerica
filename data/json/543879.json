{"path":"543879.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts the remains of a sunken ship half-submerged in water. The image shows the wreckage up close, with the hull largely underwater and sections of rusted metal debris visible above the waterline. Painted on one visible part of the ship is the text \"LSG STERN,\" which possibly indicates the name or part of the ship. The colors of the ship are muted, mainly consisting of rusty browns and orangish hues that indicate weathering and decay.\n\nIn the background, the shoreline is lightly wooded with what appears to be a mix of bushes and trees. The water in the foreground has a ruffled texture, suggesting light wind or current, and is dotted with reflections of sunlight, giving it a sparkling appearance.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of abandonment and decay, juxtaposed against a relatively calm and natural riverine environment. A buoy floats near the wreckage, possibly indicating navigation routes or warnings to nearby watercraft about the submerged hazard.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["546787","546040","544181","549306","552128","552158","547572","547510","547584","549311","549365","548071","551533","546019","546173","547961"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["ship","wreckage","decay","submerged","riverine","waterline","hazard","watercraft","remains","buoy"]}
