{"path":"545026.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene sunrise or sunset over a bustling harbor area. The scene captures several small boats, mostly of similar sizes, scattered across the water in a semi-organized formation, likely hinting at either the start or end of a day's work for fishermen.\n\nThe horizon is dominated by a spectacular skyscape where the sun peeks subtly through a break in the puffy, low-hanging clouds, casting a gentle light that illuminates parts of the clouds and creates a beautiful contrast with the still-dark sky around it. The natural light from the sunrise or sunset bathes the scene in hues of orange, blue, and grey, contributing to the serene and almost surreal atmosphere of the photograph.\n\nIn the background, beyond the sea, land subtly lines the horizon but appears mostly shadowed and indistinct due to the lighting. There is a sense of peaceful activity, as the boats are in the water yet do not show dynamic movementâ€”implying they are either setting out slowly or winding down their activity.\n\nThere's a compelling balance in the composition between the sky, water, and the marine activity, each sharing space and importance in the image, making this a visually harmonious and potentially emotive scene, likely reflecting themes of daily life, nature, and industry.","title":"Along the mouth of the Columbia River at sunset","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["550039","543119","548247","542872","547549","544661","542907","547234","547556","543411","552293","548235","543143","545015","542904","543956"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sunrise","sunset","fisherman","boat","harbor","importance","balance","cloud","break","horizon"]}
