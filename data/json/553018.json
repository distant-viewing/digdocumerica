{"path":"553018.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a busy multilane highway filled with a variety of vehicles during what appears to be either morning or afternoon traffic. Numerous cars, of various makes and models indicating the era likely being the 1970s or 1980s, are visible. The cars are densely packed, occupying every lane, with some vehicles showing signs of movement as if caught in slow-moving traffic.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several cars closely spaced together, while the midground shows cars extending into the distance. The cars come in a variety of colors—reds, blues, whites, and several dark shades. A white van stands out in the near lane, and a red car is directly in front of it, adding a pop of color among mostly neutral-toned vehicles.\n\nTo the right side of the image, a roadway sign is positioned over the highway, indicating directions to “Barham Blvd,” “Lankershim Blvd,” and “Ventura Blvd,” suggesting the location is in or near a city with these street names. The sign also states distances, adding to the navigational help for drivers. Below this sign is a smaller sign with the warning “SLOW TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT,” advising drivers to maintain lane discipline.\n\nThe overall scene depicts the typical hustle of roadway traffic in a city environment, characterized by a large number of vehicles indicating either peak traffic hours or congested routes. The image feels dynamic and somewhat claustrophobic due to the dense packing of cars. The focus and composition emphasize the congestion and the urban traffic scenario effectively.","title":"Hollywood Freeway near Ventura Beach. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
