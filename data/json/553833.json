{"path":"553833.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene dominated by crowded rows of parked cars, seemingly at a large parking lot. The focus is on a man walking amidst the cars. He appears dressed formally, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, a striped tie, and notably, a top hat which gives a classic, perhaps vintage feel to his appearance. He is looking down as he walks, possibly searching for his own car or observing something on the ground.\n\nThe variety of cars in the background exhibits different makes and models, suggesting a diverse and expansive parking area. The cars delineate a spectrum of colors, including tones of red, yellow, blue, and the more traditional white and black. The man stands out with his formal attire, juxtaposed against the mundane backdrop of the crowded, chaotic parking lot. The overall atmosphere is one of ordinary daily life with a slice of individual uniqueness, emphasized by the manâ€™s distinctive outfit and solitary manner as he navigates through the multitude of cars. The lighting and color saturation give an intriguing, somewhat cinematic quality to the scene, highlighting the contrasts and adding depth to the visual story.","title":"Commuter parking lot at Shea Stadium, Queens.
