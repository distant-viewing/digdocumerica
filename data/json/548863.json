{"path":"548863.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image displays a series of orange and red glowing tally marks or vertical bars arranged in eight columns on a dark background. Each column features a set of bars marked with digits suggesting a numerical sequence or count. The digits, lit up in a similar glowing orange and red hue, are placed at the top of each bar, presumably indicating the value or count of each respective bar.\n\nThe numbers progress vertically down each bar mimic an ordered tabulation or chart. The color scheme includes darker shades of red and orange, creating a visually striking contrast against the pitch-black background, possibly hinting at this being an image of overheated metal or another luminescent substance. Alternatively, this may be an artistic or symbolic representation rather than a straightforward informational image.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the dark background and the glowing figures has a slightly enigmatic or scientific feel, possibly related to data analysis, temperature measurements, or another form of technical display.","title":"Gamma radiation counters at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["555843","557395","547671","555266","543020","557398","544049","546314","553883","555330","557399","545528","547763","544008","543696","543996"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["bar","column","glowing","sequence","chart","value","temperature","analysis","data","measurement"]}
