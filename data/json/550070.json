{"path":"550070.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene juxtaposing industrial and urban elements. In the foreground, there is a substantial accumulation of wooden pallets, stacked in various configurations. Some stacks are orderly, while others appear more haphazard. The texture and condition of the pallets vary, with some looking new and others showing signs of wear and weathering.\n\nBehind the stacks of pallets, part of what appears to be an elevated metal structure, possibly part of a bridge or similar infrastructure, is visible. This structure adds a sense of grit and industrial age to the scene.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the industrial foreground, is a city skyline. The skyline is composed of several high-rise buildings, including office towers and other commercial structures. The architecture varies, with some buildings exhibiting modern designs and others appearing slightly older. The buildings are dense and situated close together, typical of a large metropolitan area.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day. The overall composition highlights a stark contrast between the industrial operations at the ground level and the bustling business environment symbolized by the skyscrapers. This scene might entice viewers to reflect on urban development and the coexistence of industrial and commercial zones within a city.","title":"Looking from old bridge at Northern Avenue","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["549777","545146","545255","549638","555772","555790","545257","555763","555791","545251","549958","557283","542866","549782","545851","553557"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["pallet","stack","other","skyline","configuration","city","accumulation","coexistence","skyscraper","office"]}
