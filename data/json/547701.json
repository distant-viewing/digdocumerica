{"path":"547701.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid urban scene on a sunny day. The foreground prominently features a large, yellow construction bulldozer with a heavy-duty bucket, suggesting some ongoing roadwork or construction activity. Dust and debris near the equipment emphasize the work environment.\n\nMoving towards the midground, the focus shifts to a woman riding a bicycle. She appears to be middle-aged, with shoulder-length hair, wearing casual clothes consisting of jeans and a light jacket. She is cycling on a concrete path or road alongside the construction site. The bicycle is equipped with what looks like a metal basket or carrier on the front, and she seems to be in motion, captured from the side as she rides past. Her expression and posture suggest a casual, possibly routine transit through the area.\n\nBehind the cyclist, towards the background, there is a stationary red truck with an open door, indicating that the area is at least partially accessible despite the construction. Behind the bulldozer and the truck, decorative iron fencing that might border a park or some other formal outdoor space is visible, with structured and trimmed greenery. Further in the background, there are glimpses of urban residential architecture and a large, formal monument, creating a connection between the everyday urban environment and historical or decorative city elements.\n\nThe juxtaposition of heavy machinery, a casually dressed cyclist, and refined urban landscaping and architecture gives a multi-layered view of urban life where daily activities, construction, and historical preservation coexist.","title":"With cemetery as backdrop, trucks prepare to reinforce roadbed of evanston's Sheridan road, bordering lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549740","556708","551951","555608","547926","553887","550274","544968","543107","544138","546443","557479","551445","544960","547240","547693"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","cyclist","bulldozer","bicycle","ride","truck","monument","cycle","preservation","fencing"]}
