{"path":"543996.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an intense and dramatic industrial environment, possibly a steel mill or foundry. The image is rich with vibrant colors and stark contrasts, accentuated by the lighting and activities depicted.\n\nIn the foreground, molten metal appears to be poured from a large container, emitting bright orange and yellow flames that light up the scene. This creates a vivid glow that reflects off the surrounding surfaces, including what looks like large molds or containers on the floor.\n\nTo the right, there is a distinct greenish haze, possibly from the chemical reactions or the heat interacting with other elements in the air. This adds a surreal, almost ethereal quality to the photograph.\n\nA worker, partially visible and silhouetted against the bright light from the molten metal, is seen standing beside the metal container. He seems to be controlling the pouring process and is likely wearing protective gear, though details are obscured by the shadows and backlighting.\n\nThe setting is dominated by heavy industrial equipment and infrastructure, with visible beams and stairways that add to the complexity and depth of the composition. These elements have a gritty texture, indicative of a hard-working environment that is typically seen in such industrial settings.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of raw industrial power, highlighting the harsh working conditions and the stark beauty of industrial processes.","title":"Refining operations at the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["557395","544000","557400","545536","557402","544049","557399","557397","545532","547060","549694","544001","549695","549693","544041","557401"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["container","metal","stairway","reaction","process","backlighting","flame","heat","mill","complexity"]}
