{"path":"548366.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photo depicts a large, flat barge filled with heaps of trash, docked in what appears to be an industrial zone. The barge is labeled with \"DS. 77\" prominently displayed on its side, positioned next to a canal or river. The trash load is composed of various discarded items, creating a disorganized, multicolored mound that takes up the entirety of the barge’s carrying area.\n\nOn the right side of the image, adjacent to the barge, there’s an industrial building with large windows and what looks like some external piping. Towards the backdrop, there are additional industrial structures, including one with a tall, thin chimney emitting no visible smoke. \n\nThe surrounding area is relatively flat and partially covered with small growths, suggesting a mix of undeveloped land alongside the industrial setup. The sky is overcast, casting a muted, gloomy light over the entire scene, which underscores the industrial and possibly polluted environment. There are no visible humans in the image, focusing the viewer’s attention on the interaction between industrial activity and the environment.","title":"Garbage scow at Fresh Kills on Staten Island ready for unloading.
