{"path":"556651.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling subway station scene. The setting appears to be an older subway platform, likely from several decades ago given the style of the train and the appearance of the platform and signs. A subway train painted in various shades of red and adorned with graffiti is stationary on the track to the left side of the image. Passengers are either boarding or waiting near the open train doors.\n\nThe platform is busy with people. Individuals of various ages and in different attire (including hats and coats suggesting a cooler weather) are standing or moving about. There are metallic support beams and column wraps painted in red, and various signs indicating the train direction such as \"UP TOWN LOCAL\". The platform is marked with the number \"14\", probably indicating the station name or street.\n\nThe lighting of the subway station gives a slightly dim and shadowy feel, with overhead lights casting a yellowish glow. The ceiling structure is visible, featuring an arched metal framework. The scene captures a moment of everyday urban life, characterized by the movement and transient interactions typical of a public transportation environment.","title":"Passengers getting ready to board the New York City Transit Authority subway on the Lexington Avenue line. The entire subway system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world. In spite of the crucial importance of this system to the city, voters have refused to vote any more funds for improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover Transit Authority costs. In 1960 the system handled 2.2 million people per day; in 1970 the number had decreased to 2.1 million.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551894","551883","556774","556812","556650","556821","556660","556818","556823","556652","551895","556779","556815","556810","556663","556819"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","train","platform","station","wrap","local","support","decade","ceiling","column"]}
