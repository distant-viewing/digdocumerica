{"path":"547021.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid street scene dominated by numerous colorful signs and advertisements related to automotive services. In the foreground, prominent signs from \"Gulf\" and \"Standard\" feature prominently, showcasing their distinct logos. These are large, circular signs mounted on tall poles, visible above the clutter of smaller signs around them.\n\nThe image is dense with advertising and service offerings, including a \"24-hour service\" sign and various promotions for products and services like \"ice\" and automotive \"tune-ups.\" There's also a mention of a \"Casino\" promotion tied to a purchase. Smaller signs peppered throughout the scene advertise products like Coca-Cola and car batteries. Many of these signs are layered on top of each other, creating a busy, commercial atmosphere.\n\nThe background includes a glimpse of a roadway with several older model cars and some greenery, indicating an urban setting with mature trees. Overhead, a network of utility wires adds to the slightly chaotic nature of the scene.\n\nThis image captures a moment in time, likely before the era of strict zoning laws, where businesses used every inch of visible space to advertise their products and services aggressively. The overall feel is busy and commercial, with a focus on automotive and roadside service industries.","title":"Commercial clutter on St. Simon's Island","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["553017","549113","546184","550093","545618","554185","549017","549008","555438","549014","555458","545216","549871","547369","549224","550143"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["service","product","promotion","sign","mention","purchase","law","offering","clutter","advertising"]}
