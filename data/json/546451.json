{"path":"546451.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures the silhouette of a building, possibly a church, against a dynamic and expressive sky. At the center, the building’s roof culminates in a sharp, tall spire or steeple which points straight up into the sky.\n\nThe roof of the building is steeply pitched, suggesting a typical architectural style found in church buildings. The material of the roof has a matte texture and appears dark against the lighter sky. The focus on the spire and its prominence in the photo gives a feeling of aspiration and reaching upwards.\n\nIn the background, the sky is filled with clouds that vary in shades from light to dark, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon setting, where light diffuses through cloud cover. The clouds add a dramatic and somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photo is simple yet striking, with the spire dominating the frame and drawing the viewer’s eye upward, guided by the lines of the roof. The edges of the photograph are dark, focusing the attention further on the central elements of the spire and the sky.","title":"North Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546466","546459","545873","546048","557310","546455","554700","546472","550001","557333","546476","547439","547346","550295","546463","558399"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["spire","roof","church","cloud","steeple","prominence","building","pitch","guide","reach"]}
