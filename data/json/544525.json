{"path":"544525.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a nature scene focused on a tranquil waterbody, likely a pond or a shallow lake, dotted with numerous thin, vertical plants or reeds. These plants are sparse and are growing directly from the water, reaching upwards. The most distinct feature of these plants is the small, yellow colored blooms or leaves that are attached at various points along the stems. These yellow elements are highlighted against the grayish-blue color of the water, creating a visually striking contrast.\n\nThe lighting in the image seems to be soft and subtle, suggesting it might be an overcast day or a time close to dawn or dusk, which enhances the reflective quality of the water and the vividness of the yellow blooms. The background is minimal, focusing solely on the pattern created by these stems and their reflections in the water. This composition, with its calm water and delicate flora, evokes a sense of peacefulness and natural beauty, emphasizing the quiet and serene atmosphere typical of a wetland environment.","title":"Wildflowers beside Miami-Dade Jetport","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544475","543561","544524","554591","550750","557442","543598","550670","542554","551352","547639","547509","550786","547547","550389","554623"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stem","bloom","plant","waterbody","water","reed","peacefulness","vividness","grow","flora"]}
