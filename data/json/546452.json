{"path":"546452.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny day scene along a wide urban sidewalk beside a large modern building featuring stark, geometric architecture. The building has a distinctive look, with white exterior panels punctuated by small, square windows aligned in a neat row, and large, cylindrical columns supporting an overhanging upper structure.\n\nOn the street adjacent to the building, there are people engaging in a relaxed, possibly recreational activity. Several individuals, mainly young adults, are lying on the sidewalk, either resting or sunbathing. They appear relaxed as they lay on their backs or propped up on their elbows, enjoying the sunshine. Some are interacting or chatting with each other.\n\nCloser to the columns of the building, more people can be seen standing and walking. One individual near the center of the image is slightly blurred, indicating movement as they possibly walk down the sidewalk. The whole setting conveys a casual, leisurely atmosphere, likely portraying a moment of rest in a public space, possibly during a break or a weekend. Surrounding details like clear skies and the shadows cast by the architectural features suggest it might be either midday or early afternoon. The color tones used in the photograph give it a slightly aged feel, indicating it might be from a few decades ago.","title":"Columbus East Senior High School, built in 1972","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546443","550751","549926","553159","551823","546522","550071","551635","553840","557272","544808","547882","551493","546464","553158","552718"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sidewalk","column","sunbathing","sunshine","elbow","building","midday","break","rest","decade"]}
