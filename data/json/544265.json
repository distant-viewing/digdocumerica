{"path":"544265.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a market stand. Two cheerful individuals, an older woman and a younger girl, are featured. The older woman, wearing a plaid blue and white shirt, stands with relaxed confidence next to an assortment of onions displayed in front of her. The younger girl, wearing a white dress with a ruffle detail and a necklace, stands beside her, smiling broadly at the camera.\n\nThe stand is stocked with various commodities, neatly arranged in boxes and baskets. Visible items include large, round onions up front, with smaller onions and possibly other varieties, like shallots, housed in cardboard boxes beside them. Notably, there are Coca-Cola crates used for storing some of the onions, adding a touch of familiar branding to the scene.\n\nThe background consists of a simple wooden structure, likely the back part of the market stall. The shelves in the back are filled with more produce, specifically garlic and some fruits, enhancing the rustic feel of a local store. The overall ambiance suggests a friendly, community-focused market environment where fresh produce is the main attraction. The scene radiates warmth, probably due to the smiling faces and the casual setting, inviting viewers into a moment of everyday life and local commerce.","title":"Vegetable stand","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544192","553813","544261","544257","551837","551838","550028","556211","546216","550041","550040","551843","544311","551718","553242","549924"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["market","produce","store","girl","smile","ruffle","boxe","stock","branding","fruit"]}
