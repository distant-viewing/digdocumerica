{"path":"550012.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban setting under an elevated train structure. The large structure casts dramatic shadows on the street below and features an intricate network of steel girders and beams. Directly below the train tracks, you can see a street lined with parked cars, primarily from what appear to be the 1960s or 1970s era, judging by the designs of the vehicles.\n\nIn the foreground, a vintage car with a prominent trunk and distinctive rear lights occupies the most immediate space on the road, suggesting movement or a pause in traffic. A variety of other cars, some indistinct, populate the rest of the visible road space.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a sidewalk with lampposts and pedestrians, who are small and distant, appear to be going about their daily routines. The architecture along the street includes low-rise commercial buildings with signage and large windows typical of urban business districts.\n\nThe overall lighting in the image is dim, likely indicating either early morning or late afternoon, with light filtering through the gaps in the elevated tracks and casting patterned shadows. The ambiance is somewhat gritty and reminiscent of typical mid-20th century American cityscapes. The sky is clear and the environment is devoid of any vegetation, emphasizing the urban character of the scene.","title":"Elevated railroad structure and blighted area below Washington Street south from the corner of Bartlett.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550022","555890","555927","555925","548474","547580","556202","555930","546627","555988","549853","556224","546700","550065","548479","556692"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["train","street","girder","track","lamppost","car","pause","gap","filtering","routine"]}
