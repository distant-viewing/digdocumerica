{"path":"551069.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image depicts a highway scene with industrial activity in the background. The scene occurs during the daytime under hazy atmospheric conditions likely due to pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, the highway stretches horizontally across the photograph and is occupied by several vehicles. From left to right, you can see a truck, a van, and a couple of cars driving on the highway. The road has reflective barriers that divide the lanes and also separate the two directions of traffic.\n\nThe background is dominated by an industrial complex with large buildings, chimneys, and several tall smokestacks releasing plumes of dense smoke or steam into the air. The smoke contributes to the haze and pollution visible in the sky. Above the industrial site and to the left side of the image, there are high-voltage power lines, supporting the narrative that this is an area with significant industrial activity.\n\nThe overall composition along with the reddish, smoggy tint of the image underscores themes of industry, pollution, and perhaps issues related to environmental impact and air quality. There are no distinct human features visible; the focus is primarily on the interaction between industrial activity and the everyday movement symbolized by the highway traffic.","title":"The DuPont Belle works in the early morning smoke and haze--looking south on Route 60.","placename":"Charleston (W.
