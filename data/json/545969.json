{"path":"545969.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a calm, expansive body of water with a clear blue sky overhead. On the water, there are two small boats; one is closer to the foreground, manned by at least one person wearing orange. It appears to be a simple rowboat. The other boat is further in the distance, near a structure in the water.\n\nThe structure in the middle of the water body looks to be a partially submerged platform or dock with some mechanical or electrical equipment installed on top, including what resembles a small tower or signal mast.\n\nThe surrounding area includes flat lands with sparse vegetation and a few trees, suggesting a wetland or marshy environment. A mix of deadwood and debris can be seen along the water's edge, indicating natural decay or perhaps aftermath of a water surge.\n\nOn the right side of the picture, the bank is denser with vegetation and has visible wooden structures, possibly old piers or docking frameworks, adding a rough, abandoned look to the scenery. The horizon is clear, emphasizing the quietude and isolation of the setting.","title":"Natural gas well in Bayou Gauche.
