{"path":"550463.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph beautifully captures two yellow poppies in focus against a soft, blurred background. The foreground showcases a vibrant, open poppy bloom prominently, displaying its crumpled, delicate yellow petals and pale yellow center filled with a dense cluster of stamen and pollen. The stem of this flower leans slightly, contributing to a sense of graceful movement within the frame.\n\nBehind this primary flower, another poppy is present but out of focus, suggesting depth and adding a layer of complexity to the image. The background is a muted mixture of browns and greens, creating a natural, understated backdrop that accentuates the vivid yellow of the flowers.\n\nThe overall effect is one of simplicity and elegance, drawing the viewer's focus immediately to the intricate details and soft textures of the poppies while the serene, diffused background enhances the tranquility and aesthetic appeal of the scene.","title":"Northern buttercups, very common wildflower found along the entire route in alpine and arctic areas","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545699","555189","557433","543596","542704","555033","557541","543623","545706","542969","550464","543597","554574","554580","555186","544875"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stamen","elegance","petal","stem","appeal","bloom","complexity","yellow","mixture"]}
