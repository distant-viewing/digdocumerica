{"path":"544113.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up detail of a rustic, textured wooden facade painted in red, white, and brick tones, featuring a colorful advertisement and a carved, totem-like sculpture. To the left of the image, there is a rectangular Dr Pepper advertisement board that prominently displays the logo of the drink. The logo consists of a red oval background with \"Dr Pepper\" in white script, underscored by a stylish golden arrow shape.\n\nBeside the sign, on the right, is part of a vibrantly painted wooden totem figure. This figure is painted in shades of red, blue, black, and white. The portion visible shows a stylized face with a red background, large white eyes with black outlines, and a carved nose and mouth, suggesting a simplified, expressive character. The carving appears slightly weathered, adding a sense of age and exposure to the elements.\n\nThe overall setting conveys a quaint, somewhat vintage American vibe, possibly located at a roadside establishment or cultural site where such advertising and folk art intersect. It evokes a sense of nostalgia and regional character, highlighted by traditional craft and commercial advertising.","title":"Totem pole at a trading post (for tourists) on the Hopi Indian Reservation","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555377","544081","552518","554184","547805","551085","544373","551495","551323","544148","555439","557567","552511","554186","552512","554185"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["advertising","advertisement","logo","character","folk","script","carving","arrow","nose","sculpture"]}
