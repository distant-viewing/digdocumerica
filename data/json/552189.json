{"path":"552189.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene by a body of water. In the foreground, a discarded tire is partially submerged in the water, floating and appearing weathered and muddy. The water's surface is rather calm, reflecting some elements of the surroundings. \n\nIn the background, an industrial facility is visible. It features buildings with large, rectangular structures and numerous windows. A smokestack emits a plume of smoke or steam, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene. To the right, there's a large cylindrical storage tank resembling a silo, and structural frameworks can be seen around these buildings, possibly for process piping or support.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, allowing for some light and shadows over the water and buildings, accentuating the contrasts in this industrial landscape. This composition captures environmental concerns, possibly reflecting on pollution or neglect evident from the discarded tire in a natural setting juxtaposed with the industrial backdrop.","title":"Discarded tire in former log storage pond at crown zellerbach mill.
