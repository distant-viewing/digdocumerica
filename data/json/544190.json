{"path":"544190.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a shrimp trawler in a river or coastal inlet. The boat is painted white, with a yellow trim and the name \"SHERRY C\" prominently displayed on its side. It's equipped with large booms and nets that are utilized for shrimp trawling. These booms are raised in the image, suggesting that the boat is either in transit or resting.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes dense, lush greenery along the riverbanks, indicating a robust marsh or wetland area. This type of setting is typical for estuarine or coastal regions where commercial fishing boats might operate.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is flat and expansive, continuing the theme of a wide, natural area, possibly near the coast given the nature of the vessel and its environment. There’s another structure visible in the far background, but it’s not distinctly clear if it’s related to maritime activities.\n\nThe image captures a sense of serene maritime activity, possibly at dusk given the softer light and gentle shadows, emphasizing a quiet end to a day's work on the water.","title":"Shrimp boat","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544186","544249","547553","546939","547561","547549","542879","552806","546998","542911","548546","543035","548108","552296","547016","549374"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boom","boat","inlet","marsh","coast","net","trim","transit","wetland","vessel"]}
