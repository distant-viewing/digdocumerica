{"path":"543362.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The image presents a stunning coastal view, possibly taken from an elevated vantage point on a hillside. It prominently features a large body of water, likely an ocean or a large bay, with calm waves gently brushing against a sandy beach. Extending into the water from the middle of the beach is a lengthy pier, topped with a white building that might function as a café, restaurant, or other facility.\n\nOn the shore, there's a settlement consisting of densely spaced houses and possibly small commercial structures, painted in various colors. These buildings are clustered around the area near the beach, progressively rising up the hillside which is covered with green vegetation, hinting at a potentially suburban or small town setting.\n\nThe foreground shows wild grasses and shrubs, indicative of a natural, possibly undeveloped hillside area. The vegetation is mixed, with tall grasses showing yellow hues, possibly due to the season or the time of day. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and the warm tone of sunlight in the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the rich natural foreground, the human settlement, and the expansive view of the water, creates a harmonious blend of nature and human habitation, possibly intended to showcase the beauty of this coastal town. The image communicates a serene, picturesque environment inviting exploration or relaxation.","title":"California -- Sunset beach","placename":"Sunset Beach (Calif.)","location":"Sunset Beach, California","nn1":["557523","554102","543361","543427","553765","550314","542913","557429","545110","547984","544284","542870","542918","543337","543053","545121"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["hillside","beach","settlement","town","café","restaurant","brush","intend","communicate","grass"]}
