{"path":"552938.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a young man standing outdoors under a clear blue sky. He has shoulder-length blonde hair and is wearing a white tank top with \"USA\" printed on it in a faded, stylized font. He pairs this with highly decorated jeans, adorned with various patches and embroidery, suggesting a Bohemian or hippie style typical of the 1970s.\n\nThe young man is holding a small, dark-colored goat in his arms, which he cradles against his side. Both appear relaxed and at ease in the environment. He is barefoot, standing on a rocky ground scattered with small stones and minimal vegetation.\n\nThe background is sparse, emphasizing the vastness of the sky overhead and contributing to a sense of openness and tranquility in the setting. The simplicity of the background focuses attention on the subject and the distinct details of his attire and the small goat he is holding. The overall ambiance reflects a peaceful, rustic outdoor setting.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
