{"path":"558228.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene presumably in a roller skating rink. The main focus is a young woman in the center, portrayed in mid-motion while roller skating. She is dressed in late 1970s or early 1980s fashion, wearing a fitted short-sleeve top and striking red flared pants, accessorized with a thin brown belt. Her blond hair falls freely, and she holds hands with unseen individuals on either side, suggesting she is part of a larger group. She appears relaxed and joyful, gently skating with her arms slightly raised.\n\nThe environment has a rustic yet recreational feel, with wooden floorboards and dark wooden beams visible in the ceiling, likely indicating this is an indoor venue. Other skaters are partly visible around her; some details are blurred, emphasizing the movement and lively nature of the setting. The atmosphere is informal and appears to be a social gathering spot for young people, highlighted by the casual attire of the other patrons and the dim, ambient lighting which gives the space a warm, inviting glow.","title":"Youngsters roller skating at Izzy-Dorry's Roller Rink at New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have located here since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized during the 1960's with community effort.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558229","558230","558231","547334","558286","547317","551124","556288","551820","547403","547387","549909","547830","553251","558284","551019"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["roller","patron","venue","1980","belt","ceiling","fashion","spot","beam","glow"]}
