{"path":"548519.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailboat race or sailing event on a calm body of water. Multiple small, single-sail dinghies equipped with single sailors are visible. The waters appear calm, reflecting a sky that suggests a hazy, perhaps slightly overcast day.\n\nThe main focus of the image is a sailboat near the center, showing a sail marked with distinctive striped and triangular patterns in black and yellow, and the number \"US2041.\" Just behind it, another sailboat features mostly a white sail with a graphic that resembles a lightning bolt and the number \"US3445.\"\n\nIn the foreground, one can see a bright yellow buoy with a large \"F\" printed in black, serving as a marker or part of the race course. The buoyant marker is just slightly off-center in the front left of the image, adding contrast to the blue tones of the water.\n\nThe background is quite minimal with the faint outline of a bridge or structure at a very far distance, blending into the haze. The composition of the photo, along with the soft focus and subtle blues, creates a tranquil maritime scene emphasizing the leisure and sport of sailing.","title":"Sailboat race on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548510","549425","543941","552346","544669","548203","544663","549424","548526","549423","548532","548521","552345","549421","543936","548517"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","race","marker","sailing","number","sailor","bolt","graphic","buoy"]}
