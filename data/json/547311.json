{"path":"547311.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man leaning on a weathered wooden fence in a rural setting. He is dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt with a slightly dirty appearance, indicating physical work. He wears a baseball cap, and his expression is serious and somewhat weary.\n\nBehind him stands a large traditional barn which is red in color with a gambrel roof featuring two small white windows at the peak. The integrity of the paint is failing in some areas, suggesting it is weather-worn and aged. There's a partially opened sliding door on the barn and another small structure is partially visible to the side.\n\nThe ground is muddy, reflecting an outdoor working environment or perhaps recent rain. The foreground showcases parts of the wooden fence, which has barbed wire running along its length, emphasizing a typical farm boundary used to contain livestock.\n\nThe overall ambience of the image is rustic and suggests hard work, rural life, and the toughness of outdoor labor. The overcast sky contributes to the mood of harsh realism and simplicity. The setting and attire suggest that the photograph could be from a cooler climate or taken during one of the colder times of the year.","title":"John Dolezal stands in rain on his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
