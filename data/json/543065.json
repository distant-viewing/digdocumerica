{"path":"543065.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a group of people in the ocean during what appears to be a scuba diving or snorkeling activity. It's a sunny day, as indicated by the glistening sunlight on the water's surface, which sparkles with numerous reflections and highlights.\n\nIn the image, there are at least nine individuals outfitted in scuba diving gear including wetsuits, flippers, and tanks. They are spread out across the frame, some standing in shallow water while others are either walking or adjusting their equipment. The ocean is not calm, showing some wave activity that adds a dynamic texture to the scene. Each person seems engaged in preparation or in the process of entering deeper into the water.\n\nThe lighting in the image is dramatic, possibly from early morning or late afternoon sun, creating deep contrasts and silhouetting some of the individuals against the bright water. The photo conveys a sense of adventure and leisure activity associated with ocean exploration. The overall composition emphasizes the interaction between humans and the natural marine environment.","title":"Frogmen in surf","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544129","555834","549347","548727","557481","544388","549265","548675","543491","555830","548681","549369","546306","548683","555833","553783"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["diving","ocean","wetsuit","sparkle","glisten","enter","preparation","water","adventure","exploration"]}
