{"path":"553482.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph focuses on the crossed hands of an elderly person, resting on their thigh. The image is a close-up, showcasing the details of aging skin, visible veins, and spots that often accompany old age. The person is wearing a short-sleeve blue shirt and dark shorts, which suggests casual attire, possibly suited for a warm environment.\n\nThe fingers are gently wrapped over the forearm, indicating a relaxed yet perhaps contemplative posture. The background is blurred and indiscernible, drawing attention primarily to the subject's hands and clothing. The lighting appears natural, casting shadows and highlights that enhance the texture of the skin. This composition adds a deeply personal and intimate dimension to the photo, highlighting themes of aging, time, and possibly introspection or rest.","title":"Elderly resident of mulky square must soon find new lodging.
