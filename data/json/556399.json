{"path":"556399.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, a man stands in front of a large, detailed diagram or engineering blueprint. The man, dressed in a dark sweater, pants, and a white hard hat, is positioned to the left side of the frame. He has a confident posture with one hand on his hip and the other by his side, wearing glasses that reflect the flash of the camera.\n\nThe blueprint behind him is extensive and complex, covering the entire background of the photo. It appears to show plans of an architectural or engineering project with various lines, symbols, and some areas filled with colors like red, yellow, green, and blue, which might indicate different phases or aspects of the project.\n\nThe setting gives the impression of being in an office or a workspace dedicated to project planning and development, suggested by the meticulous and industrial nature of the blueprint. The lighting is slightly dim, focusing mainly on the man and the section of the blueprint beside him.","title":"G.F.
