{"path":"542633.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid, bustling scene at a cargo port, showcasing an expansive parking lot filled with hundreds of new cars. The vehicles, mostly compact and sports models from what appears to be the 1970s era, are tightly parked in numerous rows, presenting a colorful array of mostly yellows, greens, reds, and blues.\n\nIn the background, large cargo ships are docked at the port, complete with towering white cranes likely used for loading and unloading goods. One ship prominently displayed has a dark hull with the word \"ATLAS\" visible on its side. The sky is mostly clear but has a slight haze, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThe environment suggests that these cars might be imports, possibly awaiting distribution to dealerships. The overall condition and orderly arrangement imply a well-managed industrial operation focused on automotive importation or exportation. The angle of the photograph provides a sweeping view of the scene, emphasizing both the vast number of cars and the industrial setting in which they are situated.","title":"Datsuns on pier","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["547327","542639","549688","546900","547469","547480","555260","547928","555271","549696","542635","546848","549704","547686","553741","548015"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["port","cargo","ship","dealership","await","car","unloading","distribution","hull","good"]}
