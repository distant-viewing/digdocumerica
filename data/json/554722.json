{"path":"554722.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene pastoral landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a meadow with tall grasses and patches of darker green vegetation stretches across the frame. A simple wire fence, possibly dividing different parts of the land, runs horizontally a short distance from the camera and disappears into the distance, following the land's subtle undulations.\n\nMidway through the scene, the landscape transitions into a flat, open field that appears to be cultivated, with more even and possibly mowed grass covering it. Scattered across this area are several small structures—likely farm buildings—that add a human element to the otherwise natural setting. These buildings are simple and mostly white, blending subtly into the scenery.\n\nThe background prominently features rolling hills covered with dense forests showing early autumn colors—vivid oranges and yellows beginning to emerge among the green. Dominating the background are two large, rounded mountain peaks that loom over the landscape, providing a dramatic backdrop. The mountain on the right is particularly striking with a steeper slope and a more pronounced summit.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its layers of foreground grass, middle-distance field, and dramatic, wooded mountains, creates a peaceful and somewhat timeless rural scene typical of certain regions in North America.","title":"Typical farm field near the Adirondack Forest Preserve where soils permit tilling","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543763","549142","553073","550667","555567","549249","557087","549236","554721","549256","543660","545040","549155","549157","557674","543662"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["mountain","grass","summit","undulation","distance","meadow","land","field","yellow","autumn"]}
