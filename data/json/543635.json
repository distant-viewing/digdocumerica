{"path":"543635.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image captures a barren, rocky landscape, primarily composed of rugged, sharp-edged hills covered in numerous stones and small boulders. The photograph is taken from a vantage point that emphasizes the steep and uneven texture of the terrain. The foreground prominently features three ridges or peaks, positioned in a way that they recede into the distance, creating a layered effect. On one of these peaks rests a solitary small bush, which is the only visible sign of vegetation.\n\nThe background reveals more of the mountainous region, marked by softly blurred layers of hills and valleys stretching far into the distance. The color palette predominantly consists of muted browns and greys, reflecting the rocky composition of the landscape and possibly the overcast or diffused lighting conditions, which do not cast stark shadows but rather give the entire scene a uniform, somber tone.\n\nOverall, the image presents a desolate yet dramatic natural environment, highlighting the rugged beauty typical of mountainous terrains devoid of lush vegetation.","title":"Strip mine at Peabody Coal Company","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["545895","555642","555573","546385","550442","544874","544016","550477","550480","549184","550396","555885","550505","549179","544027","545724"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["peak","boulder","hill","ridge","terrain","grey","distance","uniform","way","valley"]}
