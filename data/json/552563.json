{"path":"552563.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a ranch setting where a horse training session appears to be taking place. In the foreground, a young chestnut horse with a white face and legs is depicted in motion, possibly trotting or cantering, and is kicking up dust from the ground. The horse is within a fenced pen, suggesting a controlled environment meant for training or corralling livestock.\n\nTo the right side of the image, an individual (likely a trainer or a rancher) wearing a cowboy hat, blue jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, and boots is engaging with a darker brown horse. This person seems to be either leading or calming the horse with a rope, demonstrating an interaction of guidance or training.\n\nIn the background, traditional wooden structures likely used for storage or additional stabling can be observed. These buildings are rustic, with log and plank construction typical of rural or ranch outbuildings. The surroundings of the small clearing are lush with trees and the fencing encircles the area, providing a secure perimeter. The overall scene is set against a bright, clear day, giving the photograph a vibrant and active feel typical of a working ranch.","title":"At the oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
