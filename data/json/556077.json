{"path":"556077.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage view of a grand and historic building identified by its signage as \"Union Station.\" Dominating the scene, this neoclassical structure features a series of tall columns and a robust façade with an upper tier adorned by smaller rectangular windows. The architecture gives it a stately and authoritative presence, indicative of important public buildings from early 20th century America.\n\nThe building is situated at a street intersection, and the wet surface of the street reflects a possibly overcast or rainy day. A dark-colored, vintage automobile (resembling models from the late 1960s or early 1970s) is in the forefront, adding a sense of era and motion to the scene. Besides the car, the roads appear mostly empty, giving the photograph a quiet and somewhat desolate ambiance.\n\nThis image, likely captured from another moving vehicle given the angle and elevation, offers a snapshot of urban life centered around a significant transportation hub. The environment suggests a quieter time of day, or the less bustling atmosphere of past decades.","title":"Chicago's union station in the heart of the city.
