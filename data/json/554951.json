{"path":"554951.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an older man holding a young black and white dog in his arms. The man is wearing a dark blue cap, sunglasses, and a faded blue denim shirt. He has a weathered and serious expression on his face as he looks off to the side, not directly at the camera.\n\nThe man is standing outside, and the background shows a chain-link fence and a barren tree. Behind the fence, there are indistinct structures which give the impression of a rural or semi-rural setting. There's clear blue sky visible in the top portion of the image, indicating it might be a sunny day.\n\nThe puppy the man is holding appears to be lively, with its mouth open as if it's mid-bark or panting. The man holds the puppy securely and gently with both hands, suggesting a sense of care and affection. The overall image reflects a serene, yet candid moment between the man and the animal.","title":"Farmer near Leakey, holding a goat he has raised.
