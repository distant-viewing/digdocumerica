{"path":"544874.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph portrays a sparse and rugged natural landscape, likely in a desert or semi-arid region. The foreground is mostly covered in dark brown sandy soil, punctuated by small tufts of yellowish dry grass and sparse shrubbery distributed somewhat evenly across the terrain. The middle ground extends slightly upward, leading to a gentle and barely noticeable rise that helps define the separation between the land and the impressive mountain range in the background.\n\nThe mountains in the distance are capped with snow, indicating possibly colder temperatures at higher elevations or recent snowfall. The peaks vary in height and shape, suggesting a natural and rugged mountain range. There appear to be multiple layers of these mountains, with some closer and others fading into the haze towards the horizon. The sky above is overcast, with thick grey clouds dominating, suggesting an overcast day which adds a melancholic or subdued mood to the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is quite balanced with the harsh terrain in the foreground contrasting sharply with the majestic and perhaps forbidding mountains in the background. The image captures a sense of solitude and the vast scale of nature, emphasizing the stark beauty of this arid environment.","title":"Grass mounds","placename":"Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545895","546385","550421","550491","550408","550628","550645","553994","550415","542520","543635","550502","543831","550422","550505","543658"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","tuft","snowfall","separation","temperature","range","distribute","shrubbery","punctuate","elevation"]}
