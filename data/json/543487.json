{"path":"543487.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph displays a dense forest predominantly filled with evergreen trees and some bare, gnarled tree trunks and branches. The trees are varied in size and height, indicating a natural, uneven forest growth. The color palette is mostly comprised of dark and light greens from the foliage, with grey and white hues from the dead or leafless trees which contribute to a slightly eerie or mystical atmosphere.\n\nThe forest appears thick and somewhat impenetrable, and there are no clear paths or visible signs of human interference, suggesting a wild or less frequently visited location. The lighting is subdued, possibly indicating an overcast day or a time when the sun is obscured by clouds, creating a moody ambience.\n\nCompositionally, the photograph is rich in texture due to the interplay of leaves, branches, and trunks. The overall environment gives off a sense of untouched natural beauty, but also invokes a feeling of solitude or remoteness.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["553574","554425","549226","546947","554976","553594","555133","550791","555125","555054","554980","555675","542725","557019","554985","555114"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","trunk","interference","branch","remoteness","visit","invoke","ambience","tree","comprise"]}
