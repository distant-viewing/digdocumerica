{"path":"549213.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a moody and dramatic outdoor scene, characterized by a stormy, overcast sky filled with varying shades of blue and gray clouds. The overall lighting is dusky, possibly suggesting late afternoon or evening. The composition features a silhouette of a landscape with gently rolling hills.\n\nProminently, there are two main structures visible against the skyline: on the left, a traditional windmill, and on the right, a power transmission tower. Both structures are depicted as dark silhouettes due to the backlighting from the sky.\n\nThe windmill has a classic design with a wind vane and the structure extends downwards, ending just above the dark silhouette of the hill. The power transmission tower to the right is taller, with visible insulators and cables descending in a slight curve, connecting to another post outside the frame.\n\nIntersecting the scene horizontally are several power lines, stretched against the sky, linking the tower to other unseen structures outside the frame to the left. At the lower edge, the terrain is marked by a fence running parallel to the horizon, reinforcing the rural setting, and emphasizing a sense of isolation and expansiveness.\n\nOverall, the mood conveyed by the photograph is serene yet somber, with a focus on the interaction between man-made structures and the natural environment under a vast, tumultuous sky.","title":"Windmill and power lines near the dave johnston power plant","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["549212","543728","549216","558107","552483","553820","549210","544131","557310","545832","544355","550390","544695","555609","547793","544405"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["windmill","tower","transmission","power","silhouette","descend","expansiveness","stormy","downward","backlighting"]}
