{"path":"545829.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial facility, likely a chemical plant, dominated by several large metal storage tanks and complex structures with pipes and frameworks. In the foreground, a chain-link fence is visible, presumably delineating the boundaries of the facility. Prominently displayed in front of this fence is a sign with the logo and text \"GENERAL TIRE CHEMICAL DIVISION HOME OF GENSYN RUBBER Odessa TEXAS\", indicating the company and location of the plant.\n\nThe background shows a clear blue sky, signifying a day with good visibility and no apparent pollution or smog. The plant itself has a utilitarian appearance, typical of industrial complexes, with no decorative elements, focused purely on functionality. The area around the plant appears to be a flat open space which suggests a location that could be semi-rural or on the outskirts of urban areas. Key features like safety ladders, railings, and external piping on the tanks speak to the industrial nature of the operation taking place.","title":"Cooling towers and settling tanks for removal of effluents from the water used by this general tire chemical plant are partially financed by the government.
