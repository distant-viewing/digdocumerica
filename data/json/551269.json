{"path":"551269.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features an older man in the foreground, set against a backdrop of an architecturally distinctive house. The man appears cheerful and relaxed, looking slightly to the side with a gentle smile, giving off a friendly demeanor. He has light-colored hair, which is part grey, and he wears a blue polo shirt.\n\nThe house in the background is constructed on tall stilts or columns, and its design includes several levels, each featuring extensive use of glass and dark materials that might be metal or wood. The structure is modern in appearance, incorporating multiple terraces or decks that seem to provide an impressive view of the surrounding area. The setting suggests a semi-rural or leafy suburban environment with mature trees partially visible behind and next to the house.\n\nThe focus on the man with the house forming an out-of-focus backdrop creates a portrait that likely connects the man to the house, possibly hinting at a personal or professional involvement with its design or habitation. The overall ambiance of the photo is serene and contemplative, possibly emphasizing connections between the individual and the architectural philosophy of the building.","title":"Charles Welek, realtor, poses in front of a $75,000 vacation home, part of his most recent development in Lake Ozark.
