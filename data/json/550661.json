{"path":"550661.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is an outdoor scene depicting three individuals engaged in kayaking on a turbulent river. The river has dark, swirling waters surrounded by lush green trees. Two of the kayakers are paddling on the river, positioned close to one another, the kayak in the foreground is red with a bit of yellow, and contains one person who is not clearly visible. The same is true for the second kayak, which is mostly red. A third person is in the process of getting into their kayak from the riverbank on the right side of the photo.\n\nThis person, wearing a yellow helmet and a dark wet suit, is being assisted by another person in pulling the kayak into the water. A fourth kayak is lying on the ground, suggesting they may have recently arrived or are preparing to join others in the water.\n\nThe immediate shore where this activity is taking place is muddy with scattered grass and small branches. Beyond the river, a dense forest stretches across the horizon, contributing to a secluded, natural setting. The sky is overcast, indicating cloudy or possibly rainy weather, which contributes to the overall moody tone of the photograph.","title":"Launching kayaks into the Androscoggin River below the Errol Bridge near the headwaters of the river.","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["558070","558069","550657","554465","558071","550653","553333","558068","554462","549439","550659","554463","545733","545741","553335","550663"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["kayak","person","river","yellow","helmet","bit","suit","riverbank","water","shore"]}
