{"path":"543152.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a small, rounded rock surrounded by water, with sunlight causing the water's surface to glitter. The rock has a smooth surface with a grainy texture and is colored in shades of brown and beige. The rock features depressions that form a pattern, somewhat resembling swirls or folds, which are highlighted by the glistening water flowing over and around it.\n\nThe surrounding area is covered with numerous smaller pebbles and stones, varying in color from dark grays to light browns and reds, wet and similarly glistening under the effect of water and light. The image's focus is on the interaction between the water and the rock, emphasizing the natural erosion and smooth texture created by the flowing water. The lighting, possibly natural sunlight, enhances the contrast in the image, drawing attention to the reflections on the water and the varied textures of the stones.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the central placement of the rounded rock and the framing filled with a chaotic spread of smaller stones, creates a detailed depiction of a natural water-eroded rock surface, suggestive of a peaceful and dynamic aquatic environment, likely a riverbed or a shoreline.","title":"California--Point Lobos State Park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550726","543096","543172","544790","543617","557251","550474","543151","545589","554410","543150","555077","542583","543789","544907","550678"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rock","stone","water","depression","fold","brown","texture","swirl","riverbed","surface"]}
