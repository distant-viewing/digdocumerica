{"path":"558330.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph portrays an elderly man standing outside a doorway. He is dressed in light-toned casual clothing: a buttoned-up shirt, dark trousers, and a flat cap. His posture suggests a quiet moment as he clasps his hands in front, possibly holding an object like a cane. His expression appears contemplative or focused, and he gazes downward slightly towards his hands.\n\nThe background features the doorway of a rustic-style house, with a wooden surface that shows signs of wear and a solid, dark-colored door slightly ajar. The house's worn-out texture indicates it might be quite old or weathered.\n\nIn the foreground, part of another individual is visible, showing just the torso and partial left arm. This creates a sense of casual interaction or the presence of others around, perhaps in a family or community gathering setting. The overall mood of the photograph is set in a quiet, reflective atmosphere, emphasizing a moment of rest or pause in daily activities.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire. There is a close community responsibility towards older people no matter what their financial position might be. Older citizens and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community facilities, Alexander Home and Highland Manor. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["548218","548458","547330","556488","556489","552871","552523","547816","547427","553516","553090","554845","543849","548251","552103","547313"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["doorway","cane","torso","clasp","house","pause","hand","button","family","set"]}
