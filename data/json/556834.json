{"path":"556834.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a train car, showing various passengers engaging in different activities during their travel. The interior of the train has rows of blue and red patterned seats, neatly aligned along the length of the car. The lighting in the car is bright and natural, indicating daytime travel.\n\nIn the foreground to the right, an elderly woman dressed in a bright yellow dress and matching yellow shoes is seated with her legs crossed, looking attentively to her right. She holds a white purse on her lap. In front of her, two people are seated opposite each other. On the left, a younger woman in a striped blouse appears to be reading a book, her attention focused downward. Opposite her, a middle-aged woman in a floral blouse holds her hands together, seemingly in thought.\n\nFurther back in the train, there are more passengers, including a younger girl seated towards the window, reading what looks like a book or magazine. A man stands in the aisle, slightly blurred, suggesting some movement, possibly walking towards the rear of the train.\n\nOverall, the scene illustrates a quiet, calm atmosphere typical of a train journey, with passengers individually occupied, either resting or engaging with some form of reading material. The decor and fashion suggest the photograph might be from a past decade, given the style of clothing and interior design.","title":"Passengers settled in for the ride on Amtrak's Broadway Limited between Chicago and points east. The train leaves Chicago daily at 4 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the following day at 6:22 a.m. There it splits into two sections with one heading for Washington, D.C. and the other going to New York City. The train has a history of not maintaining the schedule. Amtrak blames it on the poor upkeep of the tracks it leases from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555974","556097","556081","556061","556095","555982","556062","556671","556833","556656","555977","556781","556094","556080","549893","556117"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","passenger","book","travel","blouse","woman","car","magazine","aisle","purse"]}
