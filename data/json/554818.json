{"path":"554818.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an old and neglected house, seemingly abandoned. The house is one-story and mostly covered in white peeling paint. It features two windows that are either broken or open, and a central door that is ajar, showing its dark interior. There's prominent graffiti in faded yellow paint across the front, though the words are not fully legible.\n\nThe structure has a deteriorated appearance, with some panels near the roof and around the windows coming loose or missing. Overgrown foliage, including bushes and vines with autumn-colored leaves, partially obscures the lower part of the house and adds to the overall sense of abandonment and decay.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a temperate zone during late autumn, as suggested by the leaf colors and the general mood of the scene. The sky is overcast, giving the image a gloomy, almost melancholic atmosphere that enhances the dilapidated look of the house.","title":"This sign read \"ban strip mines\" before being painted out local opposition to stripping is mild because most people look to the coal companies for employment since the farm economy is crumbling.
