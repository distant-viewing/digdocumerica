{"path":"551558.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a large cargo ship docked at a port. The ship, named \"Sila Dan,\" features a white superstructure and a red hull, and is marked with the number 7 near the bow. Two small, black circular windows can be seen on the bow, adding detail to the vessel's facade. A coat of arms, or similar emblem, is also present just above the waterline.\n\nThe ship is docked alongside an industrial area characterized by tall, vertical structures that appear to be cranes or loading mechanisms, essential for handling cargo. These structures are metallic and stretch upward, dominating the right side of the background.\n\nIn the foreground, a close-up view of a weathered and textured concrete edge leading into the water adds depth to the image. The water itself is relatively calm but shows ripples indicating slight movement.\n\nThe sky above is clear and mostly cloudless, providing a bright blue backdrop that contrasts sharply with the industrial scenery. The overall composition offers a perspective that emphasizes both the largeness of the ship and the industrial setting it is part of, giving a sense of scale and activity typical of a working port.","title":"The shipment of grain is a major activity of Duluth harbor.
