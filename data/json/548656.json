{"path":"548656.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures an old house, possibly made of wood, with signs of weathering and some paint peeling off. The house has two visible windows with half-opened white shutters, and the peak of the roof features some decorative wood trim that is also showing signs of weathering and age. The building is positioned under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn front of the house, dominating much of the foreground, is a large, leafy plant which seems to be a type of cactus or succulent, densely foliated and vibrant green, suggesting it is well-cared for or thriving in this environment. There are other smaller plants around, adding to the sense of a lush, green space in front of the house. \n\nThe overall impression is of a residential setting that though aged, conveys a sense of life and growth through the flourishing plant life. The location suggested could be in a warmer climate considering the types of plants and the structureâ€™s architecture. The visual focus is equally split between the imposing greenery and the characterful old house.","title":"One of the old Bahama style houses of Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546989","555632","542588","551091","545041","558110","546439","558036","557746","555581","548295","558153","548662","542967","549195","557094"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","weathering","plant","cactus","flourish","age","wood","type","consider","shutter"]}
