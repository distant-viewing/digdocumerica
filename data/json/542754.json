{"path":"542754.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a scene focused on air pollution control efforts. A patrol car labeled \"Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control Vehicle Patrol\" is prominently displayed with an officer standing beside it and another officer sitting inside the car. The patrol car is classic in design, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, painted white with extensive markings and equipped with sirens and lights on top.\n\nThe car is parked in front of a large industrial facility, which features a complex structure of metal and various machinery, indicating it might be related to energy production or heavy industry. The facility has a massive, crane-like structure on top that supports additional equipment, possibly related to emissions control or monitoring. The background shows clear skies and the environment appears to be dry and possibly located in a suburban industrial area.\n\nThe officers are dressed in uniforms with badges visible, suggesting formal duty in monitoring and enforcing air quality regulations. The standing officer is engaged in either placing or removing equipment from the trunk of the vehicle, while the seated officer appears to be handling paperwork or maps.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment in the daily operations of air pollution control authorities in an industrial setting, reflecting efforts to manage environmental impact in a densely populated and industrially active region.","title":"Air pollution control department officers, Mel Schreckengost and Dick Fehrenback, making routine inspection of Southern Edison generating plant.","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["542760","542755","542762","542758","549894","549691","557825","549898","550191","555461","546661","542761","545443","546538","552775","550171"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","control","air","car","effort","paperwork","authority","regulation","map","facility"]}
