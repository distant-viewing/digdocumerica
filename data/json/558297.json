{"path":"558297.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Villalobos, Horacio","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a man is washing a large vehicle. The man appears to be using a hose to spray water on the front part of the vehicle. He is dressed casually, wearing jeans and a white long-sleeve shirt with the number \"44\" printed in red on the front.\n\nThe vehicle looks like a commercial truck or delivery van, painted in blue and white with some visible patches of dirt and water running down its surfaces. The truck features a logo, possibly indicating it belongs to a company, though the specific details are not clear.\n\nIn the background, there is a mobile home with a metallic exterior; it has a deck with steps leading up to a white door. The scene gives an impression of a clear day, given the bright sunlight and shadows visible on the ground. \n\nThe setting looks like an industrial or residential area due to the combination of the mobile home and commercial-type vehicle. The activity and attire suggest a casual work environment or perhaps a routine maintenance task taking place during a regular day.","title":"Resident of one of the two Mobile home parks washes his truck. The trailer parks were created in response to workers who arrived for jobs in the town's manufacturing plants which opened since the 1950's. These newcomers reflect the cultural influence of the Germanic penchant for neatness and order even though they are not of ethnic German origin. The town was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["542535","557926","551120","544061","557924","555866","555973","544370","549948","555817","555957","549652","557832","553040","545074","547962"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["vehicle","home","truck","delivery","hose","van","company","combination","step","logo"]}
