{"path":"551926.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid and dynamic street scene captured at night. There's a young person in the center of the image striking a dramatic, mid-action pose, which suggests movement, possibly dancing or playing. The subject is bare-chested and wears striped shorts with red shoes, highlighting a casual, expressive attitude.\n\nThe background features a gritty urban environment characterized by a large concrete wall covered in graffiti. The graffiti includes various markings and words, adding a raw, artistic flair to the scene. Notably, there's visible text such as \"Sue + Tony\" surrounded by other less decipherable tags.\n\nThe ground is scattered with small debris, adding to the rough, untidy atmosphere of the setting. The lighting is moody, with shadows and dim illumination that enhances the sense of an urban night scene, focusing attention on the expressive stance of the subject in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of youthful energy and abandon against the backdrop of a textured urban canvas, conveying themes of freedom and self-expression.","title":"Child about to skip a stone in Lake Michigan.
