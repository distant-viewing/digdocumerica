{"path":"547925.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image shows a scene of environmental neglect or pollution in a natural setting. In the foreground, two large, round concrete structures, potentially sewer pipes or culverts, are visible. They are grey and weathered with visible cracks and dirt.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a small pond or puddle covered with green algae and surrounded by marshy vegetation and dry, brown reeds. The water appears stagnant and possibly polluted.\n\nScattered throughout the scene are various pieces of trash, including pieces of plastic, papers, and what appears to be fragments of Styrofoam or other white material, contributing to the overall feel of an uncared-for and contaminated area.\n\nNo people are visible in the photo, emphasizing the abandonment and lack of human care for this environment. The area appears to be a neglected, wetland area with potential water flow issues, possibly exacerbated by the refuse and debris blocking natural water paths. This environment suggests a need for cleanup and possible ecological restoration efforts.","title":"Debris from drainage pipes fills this Breezy Point tidal pool.
