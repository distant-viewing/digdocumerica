{"path":"554039.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating silhouette scene framed by wind-blown palm trees in the foreground. The image captures a moment by the ocean during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the softer light and the shimmering reflections on the water's surface. Central to the composition is a silhouette of a boat docked at the end of a small pier or jetty, extending into the ocean. The boat appears equipped with some kind of rigging, possibly for fishing or research purposes, suggested by visible antennas or masts.\n\nThe ambiance is quite tranquil yet subtly dynamic due to the swaying palms in the wind, suggesting breezy conditions. The water glistens with the light, possibly of the early morning or late evening sun, enhancing the serene yet somewhat mysterious quality of the scene. The overall composition, dominated by dark tones and highlighted with the light on the water, creates an almost monochromatic palette, focusing the viewer's attention on the textural details and the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Dredging sand for development at \"Puaahala.\"","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["554147","547044","553991","552344","543143","548247","545911","543133","551222","547143","553788","544655","545120","547556","548118","551311"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["palm","wind","ocean","silhouette","jetty","rigging","antenna","boat","light","mast"]}
