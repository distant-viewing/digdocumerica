{"path":"547598.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of extensive debris and wreckage, seemingly the aftermath of a significant event like a natural disaster or demolition. The foreground is cluttered with various forms of debris including twisted metals, broken pieces of wood, and scattered stones and rubble. There are also visible fragments that appear to be parts of machinery or possibly parts of a demolished structure.\n\nLeading lines are created by the bent and twisted metal rods that traverse the scene, adding a sense of chaos and destruction. The composition of the image focuses on the wreckage, filling the frame with ruins that tell a story of devastation.\n\nIn the background, faintly visible across a body of water, are industrial buildings that hint at an urban or semi-industrial setting. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting either a clearing after a storm or an average day, which contrasts with the destruction in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a strong sense of abandonment and decay, emphasizing themes of loss and destruction. The location appears isolated and neglected, enhancing the impact of the devastation shown.","title":"Dumping at Fields Point along Narragansett Bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["549307","547868","555544","549311","557993","544468","543769","546120","544583","554565","552043","555780","547622","553470","547130","556324"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["destruction","wreckage","devastation","demolish","loss","ruin","demolition","traverse","tell","chaos"]}
