{"path":"545719.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural landscape, likely in a canyon or desert environment. In the foreground, there is a vibrant cluster of wildflowers with thin stems and small, bright red blooms. These flowers are abundant and scattered across the rocky, reddish-brown earth that typifies the terrain in the foreground.\n\nBeyond the flowers, the canyon stretches out. The middle ground reveals the dramatic vertical cliff faces characteristic of canyons, showcasing layers of rock in various shades of red and brown. These cliffs rise imposingly on either side of the scene, suggesting a deep and narrow canyon.\n\nIn the middle of the canyon flows a river, seen as a winding, muted blue strip, contrasting with the rich reds of the rocky cliffs. This river meanders away into the distance beneath the canyon walls.\n\nThe topography and plant life suggest a harsh, arid climate, typical of canyon country in regions like the southwestern United States. This environment is often marked by extreme temperatures, limited water, and rugged, erosion-shaped landscapes.\n\nThe expansive sky above the canyon is partially visible and appears to be clear blue, indicating a bright, sunny day without much cloud cover. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the micro beauty of the wildflowers and the macro grandeur of the canyon, creates a vivid image that encapsulates the rugged, natural beauty of such landscapes.","title":"Globe mallow","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544887","545703","545723","544950","545797","545562","549018","544938","549228","545301","545800","545296","552442","545798","548134","545799"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","cliff","wildflower","red","flower","country","temperature","stem","topography","bloom"]}
