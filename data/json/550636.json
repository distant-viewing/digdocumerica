{"path":"550636.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a glacier nestled between mountain ranges. The glacier is significant in size, with its textured surface appearing cracked and rugged, suggesting the dynamic processes of ice movement. The white and bluish tones of the glacier contrast against the darker mountainous regions surrounding it. These mountains are steep and mostly barren, covered in dark rocks and minimal vegetation.\n\nIn the lower section of the photograph, the glacier tapers off into a sharp point and extends into a glacial lake. The lake is a deep blue color, typical of glacial meltwaters, reflecting the high mineral content from the glacier's erosion. The sunlight enhances the lake's surface, making it a vivid focal point within the darker surroundings.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or constructions; the scene is purely natural and untouched, emphasizing the isolation and pristine nature of this wilderness area. The composition of the photograph, with the glacier dominating the frame and the rugged terrain around, highlights the scale and the raw beauty of this remote environment.","title":"Worthington Glacier, view southwest","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550635","555664","550637","555663","555686","550419","550594","555711","550632","555669","555690","550418","555662","550610","550592","550599"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["glacier","lake","taper","mountain","ice","crack","mineral","point","content","erosion"]}
