{"path":"552576.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of agricultural activity, specifically the process of hay baling. Three individuals, all male, are involved in the manual labor of handling and stacking large, rectangular hay bales. The man on the left is wearing a blue jacket, jeans, and is partially in shadow. He is lifting a bale of hay. The central figure appears younger, dressed in a gray shirt and jeans, stationed atop a small, wooden platform elevated by haystacks, he seems to be organizing or directing the placement of the bales. The man on the right, dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, is also engaged in lifting a hay bale.\n\nThe setting is a wide-open, rural landscape under bright sunshine with clear blue skies. In the background, undulating hills or eroded cliffs provide a dramatic backdrop to the scene. Nearby, two tractors, each towing a flatbed loaded with hay, hint at the scale of this operation and the mechanization involved, despite the manual handling of the bales.\n\nThe field itself is dotted with numerous completed stacks of hay, illustrating the productivity and ongoing nature of the task. This is a dynamic, physical representation of rural farm work, embedded within a tranquil natural environment.","title":"Three generations of oldlands have ranched on piceance creek.
