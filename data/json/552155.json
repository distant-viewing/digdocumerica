{"path":"552155.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene featuring a beautiful reflective body of water mirroring a spectacular mountain range and a cityscape. The landscape is depicted during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as the sky has a purple and blue hue, indicating low light conditions. In the upper three-fourths of the image, a large, rugged mountain range dominates the background, its peaks capped lightly with snow, suggesting either early winter or spring conditions.\n\nThe city, located at the base of these mountains, is lit with clusters of white and golden lights, creating a striking contrast against the natural dark tones of the mountain and the encroaching night sky. The lights reflect off the water, doubling their presence in the scene, which adds to the symmetry and tranquility of the image.\n\nThe water is exceptionally still, creating a nearly perfect mirror image of the mountains and city lights above. This water body could be a large lake or a calm bay. The absolute calmness of the water suggests there is little to no wind, and the overall atmosphere is quiet and still. The composition of the photograph, with a perfect horizontal division created by the reflection in the center, draws the viewerâ€™s attention to the symmetry and peaceful coexistence of natural and human-made landscapes.","title":"Port Angeles Harbor on the Olympic Peninsula","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549445","549446","542994","554397","543604","557570","543577","552311","557000","543590","552263","552336","557497","557769","544679","546392"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["mountain","symmetry","range","division","water","city","calmness","mirror","coexistence","night"]}
