{"path":"550887.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image features a magnificent skyscape dominated by large, fluffy clouds dyed in pastel shades of pink and peach, suggesting that the time is either sunrise or sunset. There is a flock of birds, likely geese or similar large birds, in a typical V-formation flying across the sky. The birds' silhouettes are sharply defined against the colorful sky. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the vastness of the sky juxtaposed with the coordinated, purposeful movement of the birds. There is a subtle texture to the clouds, adding depth and a slightly dramatic effect to the serene image. The boundary of the photo is framed by a black border, highlighting its rectangular aspect ratio. The overall mood conveyed is one of calmness and the natural beauty of a quiet moment in nature.","title":"Formations of pelicans fly towards the clouds above the Houston Ship Channel.","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550888","557203","553875","554646","544609","550382","544605","549772","544834","544597","544601","557209","557202","550889","557208","552238"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["bird","v","flock","pink","calmness","cloud","border","sunrise","boundary","sunset"]}
