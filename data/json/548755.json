The cans, which appear in various states of crushing and wear, are tightly packed together, covering the entirety of the frame. Many are recognizable brands from popular beverages, including sodas and beers, showing a variety of colors and designs prominent on their labels. Some cans show signs of oxidation and dirt, indicating they have been exposed to the elements. This collection suggests a context related to waste management, recycling, or environmental pollution, emphasizing the volume of consumer waste produced. The overall composition, with its dense cluster of used cans, creates a visually textured and chaotic image, highlighting consumer culture's impact on the environment.","title":"Dimensions of the littering problem are suggested by this heap of cold drink cans, salvaged by girl scouts at Islamorada in the central Florida keys","placename":"Islamorada (Fla.)","location":"Islamorada, Florida","nn1":["548758","556640","543698","548753","544831","545136","543616","547506","551246","556616","550805","556631","542494","552937","557307","544830"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","consumer","collection","waste","soda","entirety","aluminum","beer","crush","recycling"]}
