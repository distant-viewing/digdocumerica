{"path":"557726.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph offers a sweeping view of a rural landscape dotted with various elements that reflect both nature and human development. In the image, we can see a mix of open fields and wooded areas, creating a lush green backdrop against which other features stand out.\n\nCentral in the photograph is a construction area that includes patches of cleared land and some standing water, possibly from recent excavation or natural sources. Construction equipment and some vehicles are visible on the site, suggesting ongoing development or land management activities.\n\nSurrounding this central area are various structures and roads. There are several small buildings, likely residential homes, scattered across the scene, which represent a small community nestled in the valley. The houses appear modest, each with a distinct yard or surrounding space.\n\nThe roads in the image curve gently through the terrain, connecting the cluster of homes and the possible construction site to one another. These roads also help outline the parcels of land and give structure to the rural setting.\n\nIn the background, the terrain rises into foothills and eventually into layered mountain ridges. This backdrop of mountains adds depth to the image and highlights the relatively undisturbed nature of the broader landscape beyond the immediate focus on human activity.\n\nOverall, the composition is balanced, with natural features predominantly framing human presence and activity within a serene and picturesque setting.","title":"Helen Valley seen from the front of the home of Mayor Bob Fowler of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Stacked concrete blocks at the bottom center of the photo mark the area for a new tourist village outside of Helen which will double the size of the small mountain community's tourist facilities. Earth moving equipment at the upper end of the valley is being used to install Helen's first sewage treatment line. Helen's business district was Renovated with a Bavarian alpine theme starting in 1969.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556341","556968","556915","549116","553817","556997","549255","556971","558044","556994","552593","553938","555873","556969","553978","556907"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["construction","land","parcel","home","road","development","site","mountain","feature","ridge"]}
