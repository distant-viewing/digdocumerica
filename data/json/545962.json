{"path":"545962.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a wooden utility pole densely plastered with various homemade signs advertising items for sale, primarily related to maritime activities. The signs are basic in design, using pieces of wood with hand-painted text.\n\nAt the top of the pole, there is a faded wooden sign reading \"BRAND NEW FOR SALE,\" along with a contact number, followed by \"TRAWL BOARDS.\" Beneath this sign is a more prominent and colorful yellow board stating \"A + G TRAWL BOARDS 42\" AND UNDER,\" accompanied by another telephone number. Directly below, a smaller wooden sign advertises a \"BOAT AND TRAILER\" for sale with a contact number, and the lowest, crudely written sign on the pole advertises another boat with its price listed as \"$125\" and a different telephone number.\n\nIn the background of the image, there is a parking lot that seems spacious and is scattered with various types of vehicles, indicating an outdoor, possibly rural commercial area. The atmosphere looks somewhat overcast and the ground is covered in gravel, enhancing the utilitarian, work-focused ambiance of the setting. \n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a scene likely from a fishing community or a harbor area where equipment related to boating and fishing is being sold directly by owners, displaying a DIY approach to trade and advertisement.","title":"Homemade signs at public boat launch","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["554924","554185","542812","545154","543210","547021","546187","552513","548730","549871","557756","551323","547957","550664","543115","554186"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["number","contact","sign","telephone","advertise","sale","pole","boat","plaster","fishing"]}
