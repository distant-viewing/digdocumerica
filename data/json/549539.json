{"path":"549539.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of turbulent water adjacent to a structured stone wall that appears to be part of a dam or barrier. The upper part of the image showcases calmer, dark green water that transitions into frothy, chaotic white waves and swirls as the water interacts with the barrier. This turbulent white extends to a region of lighter, greenish water, indicating strong currents or churn caused by the structure.\n\nThe stone wall, visible in the bottom right of the frame, is made of evenly placed, rectangular blocks forming a long, linear structure that visibly separates the calm water from the turbulent side. The photography angle provides a direct, top-down view, emphasizing the stark contrast between the serene body of water and the powerful energy on the other side. The image highlights the engineering and natural forces at play, illustrating an intriguing interaction between man-made structures and nature.","title":"Outfall from the city of Niagara Falls sewage plant flows into the niagara river below the falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553398","553372","553395","548309","553137","553388","553349","550654","553354","544795","551580","553136","547215","549497","547238","557247"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["barrier","water","calmer","stone","churn","wall","dam","current","intrigue","swirl"]}
