{"path":"552602.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant street scene that looks to be taken in a small American town, likely in the mid-20th century given the style of the vehicles and storefronts. The foreground prominently features a stop sign on the right, set against the backdrop of a busy intersection. The street is lined with classic American cars that date from the 1950s or 1960s, parked along the curb and in motion.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there's a building with a visible sign reading \"Chappelle Auto.\" Across the road, you see a line of businesses with large, clearly readable storefront signage, including a \"DRUGS\" store with a red and white facade and a large neon sign on its roof, advertising \"PRESCRIPTIONS.\" Other visible business signs include \"JEWELRY,\" \"CAFE,\" and \"COATS & SUITS.\" \n\nSidewalks on both sides of the street are populated with pedestrians going about their day. Above the street, strung electrical lines and traffic signals are visible against a clear, bright blue sky. The architecture of the buildings suggests a typical small town from the mid-20th century with squared brick facades and large glass windows for their storefronts. In the far end, the street seems to continue into a more residential area. The overall composition of the photograph pulses with the life of a small town, capturing a blend of daily life, commerce, and transportation typical of the era.","title":"Rifle, the major community of Piceance Basin, is a small town with a one-street business district.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["545216","546428","557705","542900","557805","545614","549872","551125","552526","557655","556224","551135","548889","554297","555584","554709"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","town","storefront","sign","business","facade","jewelry","1950","cafe","date"]}
