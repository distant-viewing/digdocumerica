The setting appears to be the interior of a vehicle, likely a bus or a train, during the night. The child on the left is using a soft, orange, brimmed hat as a pillow. This child wears a light-colored shirt and is partially covered with a striped blue and white blanket over a dark seat. Next to this child, on the right side, the other child is asleep with their head resting on a white pillow with a yellow pillowcase. This child is wearing a yellow outfit, matching their pillowcase, and is fully curled up on their side. Both seats have matching upholstery, featuring a floral pattern with red and beige flowers on a grey background. The overall atmosphere is quiet and peaceful, representing a moment of rest during a journey.","title":"Children sleeping in one of the chair cars on the southwest limited, an overnight train from Los Angeles, California, to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
