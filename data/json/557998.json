{"path":"557998.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene featuring a narrow water canal flanked by grassy banks. The left side of the canal shows a dirt path bordered by lush green grass, while the right side presents a steeper, more vegetated embankment with several cows grazing. Towards the background on the right, there's a person visible who appears to be observing or tending to the cows.\n\nIn the distance along the left bank, there is construction activity involving heavy machinery, including what appears to be a yellow bulldozer and another piece of construction equipment, possibly engaged in maintenance or expansion work on the canal or the adjacent pathway. The area reflects a blend of rustic pastoral life and light industrial activity, possibly indicating land and waterway management in a rural setting. The environment overall gives off a calm yet industrious atmosphere under an overcast sky, suggesting the photo could be capturing a typical day of rural upkeep and agricultural activity.","title":"Remains of the Ohio-erie canal are seen as workers in the background repair canal road, north of stone road in cuyahoga county, near Cleveland, Ohio.  The canal connected the great lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a disastrous flood and competition from the railroads put the waterway out of business.  It is now a part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["544535","558016","558002","553083","549032","549027","555645","552465","552733","546868","551332","553080","550833","544654","554560","556011"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["canal","cow","bank","upkeep","embankment","construction","expansion","tend","graze","bulldozer"]}
