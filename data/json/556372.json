{"path":"556372.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of coal miners at what appears to be the entrance to a mine. The miners are dressed in work clothes typical of their profession, featuring hard hats—some with lamps—dirty, long-sleeve shirts and pants. Their casual stances and close proximity to one another suggest they might be in the midst of a conversation or a brief meeting before or after their shift.\n\nThe environment around them looks industrial and somewhat worn down, with metal structures and what looks like old timber supporting the mine entrance. There's a metal gate semi-visible in the background and several walls made of different materials, such as metal sheets and possibly concrete, indicating a setting that has been built purely for functionality. The ground is muddy and littered with what could be coal pieces, reflecting the nature of their work environment.\n\nThe lighting suggests it could be daylight, possibly overcast, enhancing the gritty and industrial feel of the photograph. There is a general sense of camaraderie and shared purpose among the miners, visible through their close grouping and engagement with each other.","title":"Miners at Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 are searched for smoking materials prior to taking the elevator into the mine for the 4 p.m.  To midnight shift.
