{"path":"542627.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene set in a rural landscape. In the foreground, a group of cows grazes on a grassy field which spans the width of the image. The field is dotted with large, leafy oak trees providing shade, creating a serene, natural environment. In the background, the terrain transitions to hills, prominently displayed with one particularly large hill rising in the distance. This hill is mostly bare with a few scattered trees, and it has a golden-brown color, contrasting with the lush green of the foreground. The sky above is clear, suggesting a bright sunny day. Along the horizon, a white fence runs parallel to the foothills, subtly marking the boundaries of the pasture. The image embodies a quiet, rural charm, depicting a typical day on a ranch or in a countryside setting where agriculture or animal farming is prevalent.","title":"Black Angus cattle at ranch","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["552566","542628","554071","542626","554560","545153","550833","555645","557749","557439","543318","546102","551305","548984","557012","542652"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["hill","oak","embody","pasture","ranch","cow","countryside","width","graze","field"]}
