{"path":"542678.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene sunset scene with the sun positioned centrally in the frame, appearing as a vivid, glowing orb. The sky around the sun features gradients of orange, pink, and a dusky purple, suggesting it is late evening. Below the sun, there are silhouettes of mountain ridges, layered one behind the other, creating a sense of depth. The ridges appear soft and somewhat obscured, likely due to atmospheric haze or mist, which adds a dreamy quality to the scene. There are no visible objects or people in the image; the focus is entirely on the natural landscape and the color-filled sky. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative, with a strong emphasis on color and light. The corners of the image have a rounded dark border, suggesting this may be a scan from a slide film, which adds a vintage feel to the photograph.","title":"Sunset seen through heavy smog","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553844","542680","557560","554643","557957","552896","549106","542679","543410","545864","550646","552337","555070","549847","557447","543144"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","ridge","orb","slide","film","emphasis","purple","gradient","vintage","mist"]}
