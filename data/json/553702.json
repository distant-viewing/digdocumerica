{"path":"553702.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures an ongoing construction site featuring the wooden framework of a building, possibly a residential structure. The framework is prominently made up of numerous vertical and horizontal wooden beams, creating a grid that outlines what will be the walls and rooms of the building. There are open spaces where windows and doors will likely be installed. The construction scene is set under a partly cloudy sky with ample sunlight illuminating the wooden structure, giving it a warm tone. The ground around the construction site appears muddy and scattered with debris, which is typical for an active construction zone. The background beyond the construction displays a faint hint of trees, suggesting a suburban or rural setting. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the length and skeletal structure of the building, showcasing the construction's progress and the intricate network of beams used to frame the building.","title":"\"new town\" grows where pineapples used to thrive.
