{"path":"551093.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures a vibrant poolside scene. In the foreground, two young women are lying on beach towels by the edge of a swimming pool. The one on the left is wearing a yellow checkered bikini and is posed with her legs bent, propping herself up on her arm, directly facing the camera. The other, on the right, is wearing a black bikini with green polka dots; she is turned slightly to the side, resting her head on her hand and smiling at the camera.\n\nBeyond them, the pool area is bustling with activity. Various people, including children and adults, are seen around and in the pool. Some are swimming, while others relax on the deck chairs. A few towels and personal belongings are casually placed around the poolside.\n\nThe background features a simple, utilitarian building presumably containing facilities or changing rooms related to the pool. In the distance, a gentle hill with lush greenery under a clear sky forms a natural backdrop. The overall atmosphere is sunny and leisurely, suggestive of a warm, enjoyable summer day.","title":"Glasgow swimming pool is the only one between Charleston and montgomery","placename":"Charleston (W.
