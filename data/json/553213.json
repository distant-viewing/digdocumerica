{"path":"553213.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic aerial view of a cityscape beside a river. The front foreground is covered with lush green foliage, giving the impression that the photo could be taken from a high vantage point on a hill or similar elevated area. Just below the foliage, partially visible at the bottom of the image, is a church spire, suggesting that the viewpoint is near some developed areas.\n\nThe river flows horizontally through the middle of the composition and is a dominant feature. On the river, there are multiple barges: some appear to be moving while others are anchored. These barges vary in color from blue to reddish-brown, speckling the river with industrial activity.\n\nAcross the river, the city spreads out extensively. The architecture includes a mix of residential buildings, commercial structures, and industrial facilities. Several bridges span the river, facilitating vehicular movement and possibly pedestrian traffic between different parts of the city. The city's skyline in the background has a few taller buildings, indicating a possibly central business district or a downtown area.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, allowing for generous sunlight, bathing the city and the river in a radiant light, enhancing the colors in the setting. This light casts mild reflections on the river's surface and gives a lively vibe to the urban environment shown in the image.","title":"Looking along the Ohio River.
