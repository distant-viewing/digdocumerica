{"path":"553600.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a wooded area with dense fog or smoke permeating the atmosphere, creating a moody and obscure environment. At the center, a person wearing a yellow safety helmet is engaged in forestry work. The individual, demonstrating a posture of exertion, grips a chainsaw. Their focus appears directed towards the ground or a nearby object that is not entirely visible due to the composition of the shot and the misty ambiance.\n\nEmbedded in a natural setting, tall, slender trees rise steeply into the obscured sky, enhancing the sense of being deep within a forest. The scene conveys a rugged, labor-intensive atmosphere, amplified by the cool, misty conditions suggestive of either early morning dew or the aftermath of rainfall. \n\nThe earthy tones of the forest floor and the worker's attire blend seamlessly into the natural environment, highlighted only by the flash of color from the helmet, marking a point of visual focus that captures the essence of human activity within a natural setting. This image emphasizes themes of nature, industry, and the elemental interaction between human and environment.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" has just cut down a giant tree which the flames had desTroyed. Clouds of soot and ashes stirred up by the crash, are beginning to drift away.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553599","542771","542773","553602","542769","553597","553601","553614","542770","542785","553635","542623","553604","553608","542716","553611"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["helmet","chainsaw","exertion","permeate","dew","amplify","embed","grip","forestry","forest"]}
