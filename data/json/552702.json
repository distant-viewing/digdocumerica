{"path":"552702.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a summery outdoor scene where four children are interacting near a water source, likely a fountain or pool. On the left side of the image, a young girl is seated, appearing relaxed with her legs stretched out. She is wearing a white diaper or shorts. The focal point of the image is a woman (in the center) who is joyfully embracing a young boy. Both the woman and the boy are wet, suggesting they have been playing in the water. The woman is dressed in a wet, red patterned dress, and her expression is one of happiness and affection as she hugs the boy close.\n\nOn the right, another young child, a boy, is sitting with his legs hanging over the edge of the water source. He is wearing red swim trunks and appears to be sucking or chewing on his fingers, possibly a gesture of shyness or contemplation. His body language contrasts with the lively interaction happening beside him.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but hints at a grassy, open park-like area with structures that might be part of a residential zone. The overall ambiance of the scene is lively and warm, reflective of a casual, joyful day spent near water, likely in a communal or public setting. The image composition, with its soft focus and candid expressions, lends an intimate, snapshot quality, capturing a moment of genuine emotion and interaction among the group.","title":"Cooling off in one of the fountains around the Philadelphia Museum of Art.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["551446","551160","552540","552539","551638","553449","551857","550002","556293","551544","546851","551548","551467","551667","551639","550080"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","source","leg","woman","affection","emotion","happiness","hug","embrace","child"]}
