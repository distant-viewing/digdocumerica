{"path":"551054.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene with a significant amount of smoke and emissions filling the air. In the foreground, dense trees obscure part of the view, while the middle ground is dominated by industrial buildings. The buildings are boxy with distinct architectural features such as towers or large chimneys, some of which are emitting thick plumes of smoke.\n\nThe smoke, which is the most prominent feature in the photo, billows upwards and blends into the sky, creating a dramatic effect with shades ranging from deep pink to purple, suggesting the photo might have been taken at either dawn or dusk. This atmospheric tint adds a moody, almost somber tone to the scene.\n\nThe background is somewhat obscured by the haze of the emissions but appears to be hilly, suggesting that the industrial facility is located in a valley or a region with varied topography. The contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity creates a juxtaposition that might be reflective of environmental concerns commonly associated with such settings. This scene captures a powerful industrial moment, possibly hinting at the environmental impact of such facilities.","title":"Union carbide's ferroAlloy plant at Alloy, as seen from across the kanawha river at deepwater","placename":"Charleston (W.
