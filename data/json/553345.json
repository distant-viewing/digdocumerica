{"path":"553345.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts two people, likely women, canoeing on a tranquil body of water, which appears to be a calm river or lake. Both are seated facing away from the viewer, paddling the canoe. The person in the front wears a light beige or white jacket, while the one in the rear wears a dark grey jacket. Both have long hair reaching down to their mid-backs.\n\nThe canoe is a traditional design, seemingly made of metal or a similar material, reflecting a bit of light, suggesting it might be overcast or that the photo was taken during a clouded day. The surrounding environment is lush with dense trees lining the banks of the water. The trees appear to be coniferous with some bare-branched trees indicating that it might be late autumn or early spring. The water is slightly rippled but generally calm, enhancing the serene mood of the scene.\n\nThe focus and composition are centered on the individuals and their activity, using a shallow depth of field to keep the canoe and occupants sharp while the background is softly blurred, adding a naturalistic and tranquil ambiance to the scene.","title":"The Nashua River watershed group is on a canoe outing to study changing conditions in the part of the river around the Route 119 bridge in Groton. There is no \"pleasure canoeing\" here because of the foul odor of the polluted water.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550823","550767","553409","549996","553343","553806","550822","547213","550659","550768","547550","550309","558072","544759","544031","550774"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","jacket","occupant","paddle","rear","keep","one","reach","autumn","bit"]}
