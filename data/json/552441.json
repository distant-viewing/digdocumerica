{"path":"552441.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a riverside scene under overcast skies. The main features include:\n\n- Water Body: A broad expanse of shimmering water occupies the foreground, with sunlight reflecting off its surface, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon illumination.\n\n- Vegetation: To the left foreground, a solitary tree with thin branches and light foliage stands partially submerged in the water, indicating a possible high water level or a regularly flooded area.\n\n- Industrial Setting: In the background across the river, an industrial landscape is visible. Prominent are multiple box-like buildings and tall chimney stacks emitting smoke, contributing to an atmosphere of industrial activity.\n\n- Bridge: On the right side of the background, a long bridge spans the river. Its structure includes several arches and appears to be a truss bridge, typical of many used for both rail and road traffic.\n\n- Sky and Clouds: The sky takes up the upper third of the photograph, filled with thick clouds that block most of the direct sunlight, creating a flat and diffuse light over the entire scene.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the natural elements in the foreground against the man-made industrial and infrastructural elements in the background, framed under a dramatic, expansive sky.","title":"Looking toward Peoria from Cooper Park in East Peoria across the flood waters of the Illinois River","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["550189","555730","547890","550214","557233","548019","547807","552247","549515","548097","545988","550955","545862","555758","545979","548207"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["bridge","third","riverside","sunlight","illumination","arch","river","rail","box","chimney"]}
