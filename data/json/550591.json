{"path":"550591.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph shows a majestic and rugged mountain landscape. The dominating element in the image is a large mountain peak that rises sharply in the background. The peak itself has a somewhat conical shape with its summit capped by snow, indicative of its altitude and the cold conditions at such heights.\n\nThe mountainâ€™s surface is characterized by a mix of bare rock and sparse vegetation, creating patterns of gray, brown and patches of green across the slopes. In the foreground, the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains are more lush, covered with dense green vegetation which could be bushes or small trees. This transition in vegetation from the base to the peak suggests a variety of ecological zones influenced by the elevation.\n\nThere is a distinct valley visible in the midground that appears to be formed by erosion, possibly from past water flow. This has created a somewhat rounded trough in the valley floor, leading downwards from the base of the mountain. The colors in the valley range from dark greens due to the vegetation to earthier tones where bare soil or rock is absent of plant cover.\n\nThe sky above the mountain is overcast, with gray clouds that suggest an impending or recent bout of weather, which could include rain or snow given the environment. This overcast sky casts a soft and diffused light over the landscape, muting the colors and enhancing the atmosphere of a secluded and wild mountain region.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its focus on the towering peak, contrasts in vegetation, and the sweeping lines of the valley floors creates a dramatic and naturalistic scene that captures the serene yet rugged essence of mountainous landscapes.","title":"Typical Alaska Range peak -- small size. This mountain sits astride the Denali Fault as it cuts across the Delta River at the entrance to the Black Rapids Glacier Valley. View looks south to the peak from a point above the glacier's outwash plane on the west side of the river.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543831","550516","550415","555681","550416","550421","550504","552173","550628","550645","550514","542830","542519","555657","550515","550413"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","peak","valley","vegetation","base","slope","snow","trough","summit","floor"]}
