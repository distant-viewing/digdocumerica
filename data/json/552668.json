{"path":"552668.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features an agricultural scene, where a young girl is showing a large cow, potentially at a fair or exhibition. The girl has dark hair pulled back into a ponytail and wears a white button-up shirt, which appears to be part of a formal or semi-formal attire for the event. Looking over her shoulder with a bright smile, she exhibits joy and pride.\n\nThe cow, likely a dairy breed given its large rounded head and ears, has a calm demeanor and is being held by a blue ribbon adorned halter, suggesting it may have won an award. The cow's peaceful expression and the girlâ€™s gentle handling of the halter emphasize a caring interaction between human and animal.\n\nIn the background, there are elements that suggest this setting is under a covered area, possibly a pavilion at a fairground. The area behind them features other livestock and casually dressed individuals, likely attending or participating in the event, and various structures typical of a fairground, such as metal barriers and canopies.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment filled with pride and camaraderie, highlighting human-animal relationships and the culture of agricultural fairs.","title":"Garfield county fair.
