{"path":"550466.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of what appears to be a fossilized footprint preserved in a muddy or clay surface. The imprint prominently features three pointed, claw-like toes, which suggests it could possibly be a trace of a prehistoric bird or a small dinosaur. The surface surrounding the footprint has uneven and rough texture, enhancing the details of the impression.\n\nThe color palette of the image is predominantly monochromatic with earthy tones, ranging from dark browns to shades of gray, giving an aged and natural look to the scene. The lighting is subtle, highlighting the contours, depth, and details of the footprint and the surrounding surface texture. There are no other objects or any sort of background detail visible in the image that could provide further context. The focus is strictly on the footprint itself, captured with enough clarity to see minute details and sediment patterns around it.","title":"Parka squirrel tracks along the west bank of the Sag.
