{"path":"542511.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a rugged and arid terrain that appears to be in a desert environment. The landscape is characterized by a complex network of fissures and canyons, creating a dramatic and textured appearance.\n\nKey details and components seen in the image include:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The predominant colors in the photograph are various shades of brown and tan, indicating the dry and barren nature of the land. The surface exhibits a mix of smooth areas intermingled with rough, textured patches suggesting rocky or eroded soil.\n\n2. **Fissures and Canyons**: The terrain is crisscrossed with deep, dark lines that are likely canyons or large fissures. These natural formations create intricate patterns and add a distinctive character to the landscape.\n\n3. **Paths and Tracks**: There are visible paths or dirt tracks winding through the terrain. These may be paths made by vehicles or formed by water flow. They contribute a sense of scale and hint at human interaction with the environment.\n\n4. **Isolated Features**: Throughout the landscape, there are isolated spots that appear slightly darker or have different textures. These could be vegetation, small water bodies, or geological features distinct from the surrounding soil.\n\n5. **Light and Shadows**: The image has an interplay of light and shadows that enhances the depth and contours of the terrain. The areas lit by the sun contrast sharply with the deeper shades in the canyons and fissures.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the stark beauty and complex geological features of a desert landscape from an aerial perspective, highlighting the natural patterns and rugged texture of the environment.","title":"Oil waste on Barren hillside","placename":"Coalinga (Calif.)","location":"Coalinga, California","nn1":["552690","552923","543148","545799","550395","545806","549016","555029","545895","545795","554817","555553","552423","550397","545802","552420"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","terrain","desert","feature","soil","path","texture","pattern","landscape","shade"]}
