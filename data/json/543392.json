{"path":"543392.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two young girls engaging in a playful activity on a sandy beach. One girl, with bright red hair, is wearing a pink long-sleeve top and dark blue pants, while the other girl, with dark hair, is dressed in a yellow sleeveless top and dark shorts. They are both kneeling on the white sand, deeply focused on something in front of them, possibly playing with the sand or building a small structure.\n\nThe backdrop features a rugged, rocky cliff partially covered in vegetation or moss under a clear blue sky. Notably, thereâ€™s no indication of water immediately visible, suggesting they might be at a higher elevation part of the beach or at a large sandy area away from the shoreline. Between the two girls and the cliff, a wooden post is visible in the background, perhaps indicating a path or a protected area of the beach.\n\nThe lighting is bright, indicative of a sunny day, which casts soft shadows on the sand, enhancing the texture and highlighting the concentration on the girls' faces. The overall mood is serene and absorbed, a snapshot of childhood innocence and the simple pleasure of playing at the beach.","title":"California -- southern Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543875","555892","550229","543214","544200","544206","547676","543216","552341","557511","557507","543225","543333","543457","548280","543215"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["girl","beach","sand","cliff","play","innocence","pleasure","indication","hair","absorb"]}
