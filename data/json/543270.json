{"path":"543270.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal path leading through a natural marine refuge. The foreground features a curved dirt path, bordered on one side by large aloe plants with thick, fleshy leaves, and on the other by a vibrant blanket of pink and purple flowering ground cover. A sign stating \"Marine Refuge - All Marine Life Protected - Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints - Pacific Grove Police Dept.\" is prominently displayed alongside the path, indicating the environmental preservation efforts in the area.\n\nThe path leads towards a rocky shoreline, where jagged rocks protrude from the water. The calm sea extends to the horizon under a clear blue sky. In the mid-ground and beyond the coastal flora, a residential area can be seen. The homes appear nestled among trees and overlook the ocean, suggesting a peaceful coexistence with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of tranquility and the beauty of coastal conservation, inviting viewers to appreciate and respect the natural environment.","title":"Marine refuge","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543420","543271","547592","543389","543196","543066","543401","543399","543346","543255","543299","543168","543404","543352","554081","543316"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["path","respect","preservation","footprint","protrude","appreciate","lead","hom","conservation","leave"]}
