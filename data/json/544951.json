{"path":"544951.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape dominated by ancient, pueblo-style ruins situated atop a rugged, rocky cliff. The ruins, made of reddish-brown stones, are partially fragmented, with some walls still standing intact while others are reduced to rubble. These structures suggest a historical or archaeological significance, reminiscent of Native American architecture found in the Southwestern United States.\n\nThe foreground of the image showcases a dense growth of shrubbery and small trees, possibly sagebrush and junipers, typical of arid or semi-arid environments. This vegetation covers the uneven terrain of the cliff and adds a touch of greenish-gray to the otherwise earthy tones of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a mountain range stretches across the horizon, providing a majestic backdrop. These mountains appear soft and blue, possibly due to the atmospheric effect of distance. The sky above is a clear, vibrant blue, suggesting a dry, sunny day without clouds, which enhances the visibility of the landscape.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on historical ruins and a sweeping landscape, invites contemplation of the natural beauty and historical depth of the region. It evokes a sense of timelessness and the enduring mark of past civilizations on the landscape.","title":"Ancient indian dwellings, built between 1100 and 1300 a.d Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["545817","544429","544949","544922","544953","545550","544745","544392","545800","545783","555587","544927","545696","544950","551520","545804"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["ruin","cliff","civilization","timelessness","enduring","reduce","intact","mountain","rubble","reminiscent"]}
