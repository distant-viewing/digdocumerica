{"path":"552472.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a serene setting featuring a flowing body of water with a curved spillway in the foreground. The water cascades over the spillway creating an evenly spaced pattern of miniature waterfalls, each leaving a white frothy trail in the river below. The surface of the spillway is smooth, and the water sheeting over it reflects light, enhancing the undulating texture of the flow.\n\nIn the background, there is a lush landscape consisting of trees lined up along the shores of the river. The trees are predominantly green, suggesting that the photograph was taken during a time when the vegetation is thriving, likely in the spring or summer months. The sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, indicating fair weather at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe composition of the picture emphasizes the contrast between the man-made structure of the spillway and the natural riverscape surrounding it. The curvature of the spillway and the contours of the riverbank create a pleasing geometric harmony. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and idyllic, highlighting an interaction between human engineering and natural beauty.","title":"Lake Bloomington and spillway","placename":"Lexington (Ill.)","location":"Lexington, Illinois","nn1":["548309","553137","550654","557745","551230","552471","553349","547952","550979","553398","546171","551349","549486","543869","550976","554408"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["spillway","riverscape","flow","month","curvature","cascade","harmony","sheet","thrive","waterfall"]}
