The canal is bordered on its right side by a dirt path lined with lush grass and a few tall trees, and a wire fence is visible running parallel to the path.\n\nOn the left side of the canal, there is a contrasting scene of a developed area with multiple parked cars and small commercial buildings, including one with a visible sign resembling a cafe or shop. Beyond the foreground, the built environment continues with a cluster of buildings and utility poles supporting various power lines.\n\nOverall, the image shows an intriguing blend of a tranquil natural waterway adjacent to a small bustling roadside area, suggesting a cohesiveness between natural and man-made environments in a rural setting. The sky is overcast, casting a soft light over the landscape and contributing to the serene atmosphere.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal with towpath at the right and Canal Road at the left, near Cleveland, Ohio. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business. The canal is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Cleveland and Akron. Industrial development between the cities had bypassed the valley, leaving the riverbanks almost unchanged.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552733","558016","553080","553083","549032","558047","557998","550216","558011","558043","558017","544536","547529","542631","544658","545927"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["canal","path","cafe","roadside","shop","waterway","wire","power","blend","utility"]}
