{"path":"549138.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic rural landscape dominated by a vast, rolling field in the foreground, which is filled with numerous aligned hay bales. These bales are evenly spaced across the terrain, suggesting recent agricultural harvesting activity. The field itself presents varying shades of green, indicating different types of crops or stages of growth.\n\nIn the background, a mountainous terrain rises, characterized by steep, rocky hillsides covered with patches of dense forest. The mountains feature a rugged texture, highlighted by the striation in the rocks and interspersed greenery, providing a stark contrast to the orderly, manicured field in the foreground.\n\nAbove this picturesque scenery, the sky appears largely clear with a hint of clouds, subtly suggesting a fair weather condition. The overall composition of the image, with its juxtaposition of the cultivated agricultural field and the natural, wild mountain landscape, evokes a sense of tranquility and the timeless beauty of pastoral life.","title":"Hay fields on ranch in Sarpy Basin.
