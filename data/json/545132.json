{"path":"545132.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal landscape, prominently featuring a curved shoreline. The beach itself is broad and sandy, bordered by calm, blue waters on one side, increasingly blending into gentle ocean waves. The edge of the shore is scattered with numerous pieces of driftwood and other debris, stretching out unevenly across the sand's surface, contributing to a somewhat rough and naturalistic scene.\n\nOn the lower left corner of the image, there's part of an enclosed body of water, likely a lagoon, which mirrors the color and tranquility of the ocean but is visibly separated from it by a narrow strip of sand. Near this separation point, partially on the sandy stretch, an abandoned and dilapidated boat is visibly stationed, lying on its side with evident signs of decay and neglect. The boat adds a sense of desolation and the passing of time to the scene.\n\nThe background of the image extends into a distant horizon, where the sea meets a clear sky, streaked subtly with clouds. The overall vista, viewed from above, gives an expansive sense of the natural and untouched coastal environment, marked by a lingering human presence suggested by the forsaken boat. The image captures a serene, if slightly somber, maritime landscape where natural beauty dominates, yet human stories—implied by abandoned artifacts—whisper traces of past activity.","title":"Washington--willapa bay","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543175","543057","543085","554023","543053","544989","543088","547602","545106","543069","548604","554156","548184","547637","548733","545121"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["abandon","boat","sand","lagoon","passing","separation","artifact","viewed","vista","curved"]}
