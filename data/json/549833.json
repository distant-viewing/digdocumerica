{"path":"549833.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image captures a scene of urban decay featuring a large accumulation of garbage. It appears to be an outdoor setting, possibly an alley or the back of a building. Multiple trash bags, primarily brown and torn, overflowing with contents such as paper, discarded food packaging, and miscellaneous waste, are piled haphazardly against a curb. Some bags are secured with pink and white plastic, suggesting attempts at containing the garbage.\n\nScattered around and on top of the bags are additional pieces of trash including loose papers and smaller items of refuse. The pavement is stained and shows signs of wear, with visible cracks and patches suggesting it has been in disrepair for some time. No people are visible in the image, but the presence of a large quantity of garbage suggests recent human activity. The overall mood conveyed is one of neglect and disregard for environmental cleanliness in an urban setting.","title":"Trash is piled haphazardly on 172nd Street.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547878","549840","545494","549786","548214","549839","543824","557307","545506","548370","547775","547983","550264","556640","550801","546854"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","bag","trash","paper","disregard","packaging","cleanliness","quantity","overflow","alley"]}
