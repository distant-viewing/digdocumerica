{"path":"553603.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up side view of a man engaged in an outdoor activity. The man is wearing a hard hat and is focused on working with a handheld mechanical device, which appears to be a chainsaw or similar tool. He is dressed in rugged, work-appropriate clothing that includes a dirty and worn blue shirt. His gloves and the tool are both stained, suggesting they are frequently used in a demanding environment.\n\nThe setting seems to be an outdoor location as indicated by natural lighting and a glimpse of a wooded area in the softly blurred background. The overall color tone of the image has a cool hue, emphasizing blues and purples, which together with the lighting, creates an intense, focused atmosphere.\n\nThe man's attention is keenly directed towards the device, indicating he is either fixing or adjusting it. His posture and the way he handles the tool show a combination of concentration and expertise. The image effectively portrays a moment of manual labor, emphasizing skill and focus in a natural setting.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora.
