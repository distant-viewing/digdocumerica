{"path":"553412.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This image captures a scene of people standing on an arched dam, observing the tumultuous waters of a river. The photograph seems to be taken during daylight under overcast conditions. Here’s a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Foreground**: In the immediate foreground on the right side, a bush with large leaves occupies a small portion of the frame, slightly obscuring the view but adding a natural frame to the scene.\n\n2. **Middle Ground**: The focus of the image is on a group of people standing on the dam. There are four individuals: \n   - A young child, standing closest to the camera, dressed in light-colored pants and a dark top, appears to be looking towards one of the adults.\n   - Three adults, possibly consisting of two males and one female. One male (on the far left) wears a suit and is facing towards the other adults, likely engaged in conversation. The woman and the other male are dressed in casual attire and are looking out over the dam at the water. The woman's attention seems caught by something in the distance.\n\n3. **Dam**:\n   - The structure on which they stand is a curving dam made of stone or concrete, retaining or redirecting tumultuous white water seen on one side. The curve of the dam and the reflective calm water on the near side contrast starkly with the frothy, violent water on the far side.\n  \n4. **Background**: Lush, dense greenery lines the far side of the river, forming a canopy of trees that fills the upper part of the composition. The river, swollen perhaps by recent rains, rushes past this green backdrop.\n\n5. **River and Water Dynamics**: The river water shows a dynamic range — on the near side, under the dam, it is calmer and nearly mirror-like in its reflection, while on the other side, the water is white and frothy, indicating rapid movement and turbulence.\n\n6. **Overall Composition and Atmosphere**: The photograph has a quiet, contemplative atmosphere, with the humans in the image appearing small in comparison to the natural scene around them. The overcast lighting softens the colors, making the greens of the trees and the white of the water subtly stand out.\n\nThis photograph likely captures a moment of leisure or observation during a trip to a location known for its natural surroundings and potentially powerful river currents.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River. The Nashua Conservation Commission envisions it as a nature preserve, with facilities for hiking, picnicking, bicycling and eventually swimming once the heavily polluted river is cleaned up. Members of the commission stand above the dam which forms the park. They are on an outing to study its possibilities.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["553414","549486","550978","551221","550213","553413","553137","553136","553349","551423","550222","546199","549514","554190","551538","547526"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["dam","male","river","adult","water","side","stand","turbulence","like","curve"]}
