{"path":"548817.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a vast agricultural landscape, illustrating a striking patchwork of fields variously colored in shades of red, green, beige, and brown. These colors likely reflect different crops or soil conditions. Some areas of the landscape show irregular patches of bright red and green, possibly indicating specialized crops or fields in different stages of growth or harvesting.\n\nThe composition includes a network of winding water channels or small rivers, which are darker and more sinuous, cutting through the fields and providing essential irrigation. This complex irrigation system highlights the intensive agricultural management in the region.\n\nToward the bottom of the image, the landscape is crisscrossed by roads or dirt tracks, some aligning squarely with the fields, while others meander between the plots, providing access to the various sections of farmland.\n\nOverall, the photo captures the geometric beauty and large-scale organization of cultivated farmland when viewed from above, along with the integral water management that supports it. The top of the photo fades into a dusty green haze, possibly indicating atmospheric conditions or a transition into a different type of landscape outside the frame.","title":"Imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548901","542708","547725","549094","548907","554029","552858","558414","553047","549098","553977","542730","547724","557517","548908","554053"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","farmland","field","crop","management","harvesting","patchwork","organization","plot","cultivate"]}
