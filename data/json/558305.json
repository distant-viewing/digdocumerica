{"path":"558305.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Bisping, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a man sitting on a vintage red tractor, which is parked indoors, likely in a barn or similar structure. The tractor, potentially from the mid-20th century, has detailed components visible such as a large rear wheel, metallic engine parts including a visible air filter and exhaust pipe, and headlights integrated near the front. The man, wearing a dark shirt and pants, is turned slightly towards the right, engrossed in operating or adjusting the tractor's controls.\n\nThe setting has an atmospheric quality, with sunlight streaming through a large window and casting illuminated patches and shadows around the space. The interior walls behind the tractor are constructed of bricks, adding a rustic and aged feel to the setting. The space is otherwise dim, enhancing the focus on the tractor and the man operating it.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment that feels both historical and personal, inviting a nostalgic glimpse into a past era of machinery and manual operation.","title":"Wallace \"Whitey\" Wolf at work at the repair garage for the city.
