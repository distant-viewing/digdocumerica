{"path":"548930.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a massive dam and hydroelectric power facility, suggesting that it might be the Hoover Dam, based on its distinctive architecture and location. The dam is nestled between steep, rugged mountains with a sparse vegetation landscape which appears to be arid, characteristic of desert terrain.\n\nThe dam itself is a concrete arch-gravity structure, curving between the canyon walls of the river below. At the bottom of the dam, several large cylindrical structures can be seen in the water, which are likely part of the turbine intakes or penstocks. The water on the upstream side of the dam forms a large reservoir, showing a deep blue color contrasting with the surrounding rocky terrain.\n\nSeveral roads and pathways snake around the terrain, connecting various facilities and observation points across the area. Structures and smaller buildings related to dam operations are visible near the dam. On the downstream side, the river continues through the canyon demonstrating how the water is channeled away from the dam.\n\nThe background displays unforgiving and rough terrain that extends to the horizon under a clear blue sky, indicating the remote and isolated setting of this impressive engineering landmark. This overall view highlights the dam's role in water management and energy production within this harsh landscape.","title":"Hoover Dam on the Colorado River","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548920","548938","548975","548936","548927","548922","548947","548013","549004","548003","548913","549024","548024","544141","548915","548007"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["dam","canyon","terrain","gravity","reservoir","facility","landmark","engineering","observation","production"]}
