{"path":"554365.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph presents a moody and artistic scene focused on a small figurine placed on what appears to be the dashboard of a vehicle. The figurine is of two people embracing; one is slightly bending forward as if looking into the eyes of the other, who seems to be reaching up to meet their gaze. Both figures are depicted in a classic style, reminiscent of vintage car decorations.\n\nThe lighting and color in the image create a soft, ethereal atmosphere, with a dominant dark hue that verges on a purple or navy tone. This lighting casts deep shadows and highlights across the curvatures of the figures and the reflective surfaces surrounding them.\n\nThe background behind the figures is blurred with abstract shapes, suggesting reflections possibly from the interior structure of the vehicle or external environment, which contribute to a feeling of depth and space within the composition. The overall effect is dreamlike and introspective, centered around the intimate pose of the figures against a backdrop of shadows and reflective surfaces.","title":"St. Christopher statuette on dashboard seems to float in reflected clouds.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549382","557847","551360","546667","554919","550943","557908","557871","547722","557863","556728","556703","552935","545335","553261","557848"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["figure","dashboard","navy","curvature","gaze","decoration","highlight","pose","vehicle","shadow"]}
