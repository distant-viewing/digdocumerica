{"path":"547320.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a group of men gathered indoors, likely involved in a meeting or assembly of some sort. The setting is an indoor environment illuminated by ceiling lights. The photograph's color palette features rich and subdued tones, contributing to an intimate and somewhat solemn atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several men standing with their hands over their hearts, suggesting they are participating in a ceremonial or patriotic act such as the singing of a national anthem or recitation of a pledge. One of these men, prominently in focus and standing in the center, is a young Caucasian with dark hair, dressed in a light-colored shirt. To his right, another young man in similar attire participates in the same gesture.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, other individuals can be seen. These men appear to be attentively engaged in the proceedings, with expressions of solemnity or respect. One notable individual at the back is wearing spectacles and poised in a respectful stance.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of collective participation, likely in a formal or semi-formal gathering, where attendees demonstrate reverence or respect towards a significant element, presumably of national or organizational importance. The attire varies, suggesting a diverse group in terms of age and possibly roles within the gathering. The interior setting and lighting add to the gravitas of the moment depicted.","title":"Members of the seward kiwanis club open weekly meeting with pledge of allegiance","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547365","549073","558393","556450","547407","556246","547362","552618","547367","556451","558262","556247","545384","552616","556243","556068"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["respect","participate","gathering","man","reverence","solemnity","spectacle","heart","poise","participation"]}
