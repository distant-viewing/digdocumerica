{"path":"545824.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a large, prominently displayed sign posted in a barren desert environment. The sign is rectangular and appears homemade, predominantly painted in bright red with white lettering. It advertises the availability of a land office in \"Terlingua Ghost Town\" and a trailer park at \"Study Butte\". There is a notation in blue in the top left corner of the sign reading \"Acreage for sale.\"\n\nThe terrain around the sign is flat and devoid of vegetation, typical of a desert landscape. The ground is covered with small rocks and sandy soil. In the background, a range of distant mountains can be seen under a clear and bright blue sky, which suggests a sunny day. The sign's position casts a sharp shadow on the ground, indicating the sun's position.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a sense of isolation and the sparse, rugged beauty often associated with desert towns in the American Southwest. The sign itself, potentially serving as a guidepost or an advertisement, conjures an image of a small, remote community nestled among the quiet vastness of the desert.","title":"Texas--near Big Bend National Park","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["549039","543637","543641","544845","544136","544182","545620","549001","548822","547648","544017","543100","543115","545624","549129","547782"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["desert","sign","town","availability","covered","advertise","sale","trailer","reading","position"]}
