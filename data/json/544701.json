{"path":"544701.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody seascape under a tumultuous sky. A large ship, appearing dark and silhouetted, is sailing on the sea towards the right side of the frame. The image is dominated by an impressive display of natural light: beams of sunlight break through the heavy, dark clouds, creating a spotlight effect on the water and illuminating parts of the ship.\n\nThe background features a mountainous landscape, also mostly silhouetted due to the strong backlighting, creating a layered effect with varying tones of blue and gray. The sea reflects the light from the sky, creating patterns and textures on its surface.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of awe and slight somberness, with the play of light and dark giving it a dynamic and powerful visual impact. The scene is devoid of any human activity visible, focusing purely on the interplay of natural elements and the ship.","title":"Swords of sunlight over lighthouse","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["553857","544659","550291","544655","544234","554004","547057","544705","543138","553991","553852","548705","545277","543046","547352","544672"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["ship","spotlight","sea","layered","effect","awe","backlighting","seascape","sail","silhouet"]}
