{"path":"549810.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph displays a collage of informational materials and artistic depictions on a bulletin board or wall. The central feature of the image is a large, hand-made poster with a message about recycling and environmental preservation. It reads: \n\n\"Each time we use A TON of WAST PAPER, we save 17 Trees. If in ONE YEAR we save 11 million TONS of WAST PAPER we save 200 million. Recycling is THE ANSWER to being cut down. This problem. Would you HELP.\"\n\nThe text is in varying font sizes and handwritten in a casual style. A childlike drawing of a tree and a scribbled sun with the word \"M.A.M.A\" at different places are also on the poster. Alongside the main poster, there are other elements pinned to the board. These include smaller notes and pages, possibly articles or memos, one of which distinctly features an image of the Statue of Liberty with the caption \"MAMA NEEDS HELP\". The overall arrangement is somewhat cluttered yet displays a grassroots effort to communicate the importance of recycling. There's a backdrop of a perforated board, typical for hanging tools or notes, seen through the gaps between the various papers.","title":"The recycling center in Park Slope (Brooklyn) handles three tons of newspapers per week.
