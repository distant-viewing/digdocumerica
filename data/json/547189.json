{"path":"547189.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features four young adults standing on a pebble beach with the sea stretching behind them under a mostly cloudy sky. From left to right: The first individual is a woman wearing a long, light-colored coat over a darker garment, and dark pants; she has long, straight hair. The second person is a man in a black and red plaid jacket and jeans; his hair is styled into a shaggy, chin-length cut. The third individual is a woman dressed in a white top and flared jeans; she has long, dark hair and a bright smile. The fourth person in the group is a man wearing a dark jacket, light-colored shirt, and jeans; he also sports a casual, shaggy hairstyle.\n\nThe group is lined up almost shoulder-to-shoulder, posing for the photograph with relaxed postures and casually dressed, suggesting a friendly and informal outing. The beach itself is not sandy but covered with pebbles and small rocks. The sea is calm with little wave activity, and the horizon is visible under the overcast sky which covers most of the upper portion of the image. The overall mood conveyed by the setting and the attire of the people suggests a cooler season or climate. The image captures a moment of leisure and companionship among friends in a natural setting.","title":"Posing on lake Michigan shore","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547879","547873","547688","548700","544988","543372","553951","543534","547009","548695","555402","543072","552286","543047","552295","543216"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["jeans","shoulder","hair","beach","flar","sea","ching","jacket","companionship","garment"]}
