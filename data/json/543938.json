{"path":"543938.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively and scenic river setting, centered around a concrete arched bridge that crosses the river. The bridge appears aged with graffiti covering much of its visible surface, adding a touch of urban character to the otherwise natural landscape. This bridge, with its large, rounded arches, is surrounded by dense green foliage, hinting at a location away from urban centers, possibly on the outskirts or in a more suburban area.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple leisure boats are docked along the riverbank and on the water, suggesting popular recreational use of this river. Notably, a cabin cruiser named \"Lady Lee\" is cruising on the water, complete with passengers engaging in what appears to be a leisurely boat ride, indicating a peaceful day out on the water.\n\nThe arrangement and state of the boats, ranging from more equipped cabin cruisers to simpler, smaller boats, alongside docks and other boating gear, indicate a well-utilized area for boating enthusiasts. This setting captures a moment of relaxed, recreational activity in a natural setting enhanced by a touch of human interaction with the environment.","title":"Boating on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["551527","548301","551218","551208","551236","558067","548098","548077","549503","547263","548028","543935","558065","548064","557972","550825"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["cruiser","boat","boating","bridge","cabin","river","dock","cruise","touch","enthusiast"]}
