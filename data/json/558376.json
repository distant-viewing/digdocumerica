{"path":"558376.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up of a person's hands engaged in a precise manufacturing or technical task. The focus is on the hands and the item they are working on, which appears to be an electronic circuit board or some kind of technological component with various pathways and metallic pads.\n\nThe individual in the photograph appears to be using a soldering iron to make connections on the circuit board. The soldering iron, with its pointed tip, is being manipulated by one hand, while the other hand steadies the board. The hands are adorned with a watch, a bracelet, and a ring, and the fingers are clearly visible, focused on the task.\n\nThe background of the image shows very little beyond the immediate work area, ensuring the viewer concentrates on the activity at hand. The framing of the shot emphasizes the intricacy of the work involved in dealing with electronic components, emphasizing themes of technology, craftsmanship, and attention to detail.","title":"Closeup of an employee working with a solderer on one of the products made by the 3m co.( Minnesota mining and manufacturing).  3m has 1,377 employees which makes it the largest industry in town.
