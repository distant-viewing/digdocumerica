{"path":"554325.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in a subway train car, prominently marked by graffiti and displaying a raw, urban aesthetic. The train itself, perhaps stainless steel or silver in coloring, is lavishly covered in a variety of graffiti styles, which includes vibrant blues, reds, and whites. These displays of street art range from complex tags, possibly showcasing the aliases of the artists, to more elaborate, cartoon-like figures and abstract patterns.\n\nThe doors of the subway train are apparent; they are closed, with windows acting as frames for the interior. Through one of the glass windows, a person is visible sitting alone inside the somewhat dimly lit interior of the train. The individual appears contemplative or perhaps simply observing, seated adjacent to the window.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a gritty, lived-in atmosphere typical of many urban subway systems during an era when graffiti was a dominant form of self-expression and territorial marking among youths in cities. The scene tells of the cultural environment of the time, balancing the quiet, solitary figure inside against the loud, expressive artwork on the exterior. This dichotomy adds a powerful narrative about public spaces and personal experiences within urban environments.","title":"Subway car","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548258","556811","553823","554324","548261","548266","548260","556690","548253","548273","556652","548263","556653","548265","556814","548255"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","train","graffiti","interior","artist","cartoon","window","self","artwork","coloring"]}
