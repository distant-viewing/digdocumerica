{"path":"551149.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This is a vibrant and intriguing photograph featuring six swans gliding gracefully on a body of water. The swans are gently floating, positioned closely together, headed in the same direction towards the lower right of the frame. Each swan is depicted with its distinct features prominently shown, including their long, elegant necks and white plumage contrasting sharply against the dark surface of the water.\n\nThe water appears slightly choppy, reflecting the light and creating a shimmering effect around the swans. This adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene scene. The background is minimally detailed, allowing the viewerâ€™s focus to remain on the swans.\n\nThe composition uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus namely on the nearest swans while subtly blurring the further background, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and drawing more attention to the subjects. The lighting is natural, seemingly from a bright day, casting natural hues and shadows across the swans and water, enriching the visual textures of the scene. It's a tranquil depiction of nature and wildlife, conveying a sense of peace and elegance.","title":"Swans in procession on the Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
