{"path":"545867.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a playground, vividly depicting children playing on a colorfully designed piece of playground equipment reminiscent of a ship. The ship-like structure features a bright red color with white spots and a large sail mounted on top, which is adorned with flower bed designs against a polka dot background. The main section of the equipment is shaped like a boat's bow, making it appear as if it is ready to sail.\n\nAt the center of the image, a young boy in a yellow t-shirt and shorts is climbing up the side of the ship, gripping onto a white handle. Another boy, more distantly visible, stands on top of the bow, peering over the side. Meanwhile, a third child is climbing a ladder behind the ship, and a fourth child is running in the dirt area near the ship, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe surroundings suggest the playground is located in a large open park or similar recreational area. There's a flat, grassy field visible around the playground equipment, and a line of trees and a clear blue sky can be seen in the background, adding a tranquil and cheerful ambiance to the setting. The overall atmosphere of the image is playful and carefree, typical of a sunny day out in the park.","title":"Playground ship and young sailors","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["547875","549666","549674","555931","551720","551725","555946","547188","546897","555928","557410","556290","546781","557987","550002","546562"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["playground","ship","bow","child","equipment","boy","park","ladder","handle","dot"]}
