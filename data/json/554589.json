{"path":"554589.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural landscape that predominantly features tall coniferous trees. These trees, which may include species such as pines or spruces, have a dense arrangement and are characterized by their needle-like leaves. The variety in the foliage color ranges from dark to bright green, suggesting different species or lighting conditions.\n\nIn the foreground, there appears to be low brush or shrubbery, possibly wet with dew or rain, reflecting the moisture-rich environment typical of a coniferous forest. Below this underbrush, the ground is not clearly visible, which may indicate dense ground coverage, perhaps moss or fallen leaves, common in forested areas.\n\nThe background is a lighter gray sky, likely overcast, contributing to the overall moody and tranquil atmosphere of the scene. The absence of any human-made structures or figures points to this being a remote or undisturbed natural setting. There are no visible paths or clearings, reinforcing the wild and natural essence of the scene. The image composition, with the trees sharply in focus and the soft, obscured ground layer, emphasizes the height and dominance of the trees in this ecosystem.","title":"Tamarack tree (Larix laricinia), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555114","542725","554960","555108","555120","549234","557019","557596","555115","555133","555116","549226","555675","542753","542849","554965"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["specie","dominance","underbrush","dew","leave","brush","coverage","needle","ground","pine"]}
