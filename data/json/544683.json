{"path":"544683.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil natural scene at what appears to be dusk. The main focus is on a vast, shimmering body of water, likely a salt flat or shallow lake that reflects the light of the sky. The water is interspersed with patches and lines of white that could be salt deposits or thin ice.\n\nA bird, possibly a seagull or similar species, is captured in mid-flight near the center of the image, just above the horizon. Its wings are spread wide, suggesting it is either taking off or gliding over the water surface.\n\nThe background features a low, flat horizon with a faint outline of distant mountains, adding to the expansive feel of the landscape. The sky, though not prominently shown, seems to contribute a soft light that enhances the reflective quality of the water's surface.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is serene, dominated by cool blue hues and pale lighting, emphasizing the quiet and isolated nature of this environment.","title":"Sunset","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544679","544725","545991","544774","547744","543063","548832","550388","542992","545142","543922","552237","544721","548241","550389","542994"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["salt","seagull","deposit","wing","ice","flight","specie","water","horizon","white"]}
