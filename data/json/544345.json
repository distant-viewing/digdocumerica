{"path":"544345.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a lush, dense forest scene centered around a small, rocky stream with a person interacting with the environment. A young woman, dressed in a sleeveless cream top decorated with a star pattern, black shorts, and hiking shoes, bends over the stream. She is also wearing a black cap and appears to be either collecting water from the stream or perhaps examining something in the water.\n\nThe stream winds through the forest floor and is bordered by an abundance of green vegetation, including broad leafy plants and possibly ferns. The light filters through the canopy above, creating dappled patches of sunlight on the rocks and water, enhancing the natural beauty of the scene.\n\nThe surrounding trees are tall and densely packed, their branches and leaves forming a thick natural canopy that shades most of the area, giving it a secluded and intimate atmosphere. The setting suggests a quiet, serene spot, possibly in a temperate forest, inviting contemplation or exploration of nature.","title":"Bather enjoys the Havasu Falls area.
