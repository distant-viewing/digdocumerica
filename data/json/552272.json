{"path":"552272.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor aquatic setting, likely at a marina or dock area. In the foreground, a young adult with shoulder-length hair, dressed in a blue t-shirt and bright yellow bib overalls, is captured mid-action while working. The person is knee-deep in a water basin enclosed by weathered wooden docks. In their hands is a hose, from which water is actively being sprayed into the basin, possibly part of a routine to clean or maintain the area.\n\nAround the person, various elements suggest aquatic or marine activities, such as buoyant barriers and wet wooden platforms that make up the dock. In the background, a large body of calm water stretches out, and a ferry or large boat is visible in the distance, moving left to right across the frame. The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light and creating a moody atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of daily life at a working dock, emphasizing maritime labor in a natural water environment.","title":"Roy Yager netting commercially raised salmon at the Domsea Aquaculture site in Manchester","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["549595","546885","543465","551046","547065","547164","546892","552301","544226","547033","545928","546301","547559","545189","547020","544993"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["dock","basin","deep","ferry","overall","marina","hose","routine","knee","person"]}
