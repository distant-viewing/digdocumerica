{"path":"547892.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures the exterior of a vibrant and somewhat weathered establishment known as the \"Clam Bar.\" The main focus is on a large window framed by a red border, underlined by a yellow sign proclaiming \"Clam Bar Ice Cold Beer Soda\" in bold, black, capital letters. The top part of the window features a neon sign with the word \"OPEN\" glowing in red.\n\nThe window, occupying most of the image, reflects a street scene including parts of buildings, a sky with varying tones, and other faint, diverse reflections that are a bit hard to decipher. The outer frame of the building is painted red, with a mustard yellow upper half that appears somewhat flaked and faded, suggesting age and exposure to elements.\n\nThere is a metal fixture above the window, possibly a light or an old heating element, adding to the dated look of the facade. The overall color palette of the photograph is rich and saturated, giving it a nostalgic, vintage appeal. The setting suggests a place with a casual, local vibe, possibly by the sea or in a coastal town, welcoming visitors to enjoy simple seafood delights and chilled beverages.","title":"Snack bar in summer community of broad channel on Jamaica bay.
