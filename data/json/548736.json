{"path":"548736.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene marine scene featuring two boats on the water. On the left side of the image, a small boat with three individuals is shown. One person, possibly the driver, is seated at the rear controlling the outboard motor, while the other two individuals stand. The standing individuals appear to be engaging in some activity, possibly preparing to water ski, as suggested by the posture of the person in swimwear looking back toward the water.\n\nOn the right side of the picture, another boat is speeding across the water, creating a prominent wake behind it. This boat is larger and carries four individuals, all of whom are seated with the exception of one. The background features calm blue waters and distant shores with visible land masses, possibly islands. The skies are clear, indicating good weather conducive to water activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures the leisurely and recreational atmosphere of a day out on the water, highlighting both the activity and the natural environment.","title":"Fishing off the coast of Marathon in the central Florida Keys.","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["552316","548080","558234","552050","552982","548525","544021","555718","546976","549417","552292","546317","548054","549411","546352","551310"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","water","individual","masse","swimwear","ski","motor","rear","wake","person"]}
