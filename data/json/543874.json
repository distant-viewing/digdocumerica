{"path":"543874.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on an open highway with sparse traffic, likely taken from an overpass or elevated viewpoint. In the foreground, a curving two-lane road dominates the frame with a bright green car traveling in the lane nearest to the camera. The vehicle appears to be a model from the late 1960s or early 1970s, characterized by its boxy body and round headlights.\n\nThe background features a large billboard stretching across the horizon, advertising a business named \"Tennessee Alabama Fireworks and Gift Shop.\" The sign is sprawling and colorful, with red and white text on a black background. It proclaims to offer the \"Lowest Prices in the South\" and highlights other appeals such as free parking and quantity discounts.\n\nSurrounding the highway, the scenery is lush with verdant trees suggesting a rural or suburban setting. The sky is clear and a deep blue, indicating it is a bright sunny day. A small yellow sign on the right side of the road reads \"Bridges icing before road,\" caution is advised, which typically warns of potential driving hazards in colder conditions.\n\nNo other vehicles besides the green car are visible in the near lanes, providing a sense of calm or minimal traffic at the time the photo was taken. Overall, the image captures a typical moment of travel in a seemingly quiet area, distinguished by its large advertising structure.","title":"Tennessee--near pittsburg","placename":"South Pittsburg (Tenn.)","location":"South Pittsburg, Tennessee","nn1":["543878","555437","556785","546242","549890","547444","547298","557230","555584","549224","553017","542764","547302","547811","554031","556988"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lane","highway","travel","warn","traffic","road","hazard","caution","quantity","overpass"]}
