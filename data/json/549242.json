{"path":"549242.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive open pit mine. The setting is rugged and barren, primarily characterized by layers of earth and stone exposed by mining activity. The terrain is uneven, featuring several steep slopes and terraces. A prominent, curved dirt road winds through the pit, noticeably wet and muddy, likely due to water used in the mining process. This road appears to see frequent use, as indicated by its well-worn path.\n\nForeground of the image showcases some dense, green foliage which contrasts starkly with the stark, stripped environment of the mining zone. These bushes at the bottom edge of the frame provide a splash of natural color against the predominantly gray and brown hues of the excavation site.\n\nThe upper layers of the terraced mine are visible with different striations of soil and rock, each layer a record of natural history altered by human industry. In some sections of the pit, there are red markers—possibly for safety or operational purposes—sprinkled across the mining terraces, indicating areas of interest or zones to be cautious around.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a stark contrast between nature and industrial activity, highlighting the environmental changes brought about by such large-scale operations. The background shows a wide-open sky that suggests the remoteness and scale of the mining activity.","title":"Decker coal company strip mine","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554631","549172","549167","544054","555621","544111","549241","552177","544112","549177","543758","544785","544110","544100","554768","553049"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","pit","terrace","zone","layer","alter","terraced","stripp","striation","remoteness"]}
