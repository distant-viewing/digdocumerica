{"path":"547604.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene marshland during what appears to be dusk, given the soft, dim lighting and color tones. The scene is comprised of a waterlogged environment with several patches of green marsh grass interspersed with pools of water that reflect the sky. The foreground of the image is dominated by colors shifting from deep purple to dark blues, suggesting a reflection of the sky on the water's surface. \n\nIn the middle ground, various grassy islets are scattered across the landscape, varying in size and surrounded by the shiny watery surface that mirrors the trees and darkening sky. Towards the background, a line of trees, possibly some type of wetland-adapted species, borders the horizon under the subdued sky. The trees are silhouetted against the sky, adding a subtle contrast to the darkening tones of the evening.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is calm and tranquil, depicted by the stillness of water and the absence of any visible human activity or animal movement. The tones and reflections create a moody and almost mysterious ambiance, inviting contemplation of natural beauty and the quiet moments of twilight in a marsh ecosystem.","title":"Tiverton salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547544","547589","550788","550789","547547","547500","547489","553085","554717","553856","547532","542525","544515","550345","546066","547663"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["darken","islet","marshland","reflection","tone","marsh","adapt","shift","specie","pool"]}
