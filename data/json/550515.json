{"path":"550515.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a striking aerial view of a rugged mountain landscape. The mountains are steep and dramatically inclined, with sharp ridges and deep valleys. The majority of the terrain is coated with a blanket of snow, which highlights the contours and crevasses of the mountain slopes. The snow is arranged in parallel stripes, indicating the natural flow and erosion patterns of the mountainside.\n\nThe contrasting areas of rock that are exposed are dark and jagged, providing a stark visual contrast to the bright white of the snow. These exposed rock surfaces also suggest the harsh and erosion-prone nature of the environment.\n\nAbove the mountains, a layer of clouds partially obscures the view, adding a sense of depth and mystery to the scene. The clouds are fluffy and dense, hovering close to the mountain peaks, mingling with the topography which gives a sense of the altitude and the cold, moist climate typical of high mountain ranges.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its bird's-eye view and emphasis on the textures and patterns of the mountain surfaces, showcases the natural beauty and formidable presence of these snow-covered mountains. The image evokes a sense of isolation and the pristine, untouched quality of a high-altitude environment.","title":"Detail of north ridge of table mountain, view west across the dietrich river valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550514","542519","550423","542830","550413","552144","550504","550501","542520","550416","550500","550422","552173","542842","550415","555678"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","snow","altitude","erosion","expose","hover","prone","mingl","mountainside","coate"]}
