{"path":"548329.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph depicts a high aerial view focusing on urban apartment buildings, captured likely from the perspective of an adjacent high-rise or through aerial photography. The primary building in the frame shows a flat, expansive rooftop filled with various elements common to urban building rooftops.\n\nThe rooftop surface appears generally worn, surrounded by a low safety railing. There are several small, square structures on the roof, possibly housing stairway exits or other mechanical access points. Notable features include multiple chimneys, from one of which a plume of grey smoke is rising, dispersing into the air.\n\nAdditionally, the roof is equipped with various ventilation pipes and exhaust outlets, likely connected to the building's internal heating or plumbing systems. A couple of air conditioning units can also be seen on the roof, indicative of efforts to provide cooling to the building interiors.\n\nSurrounding the building, glimpses of adjacent buildings and green areas such as trees provide a hint of a densely populated urban environment with interspersed greenery, which could suggest public parks or private gardens nearby.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a typical scene from an urban residential area where utilities and infrastructure on rooftops play a crucial role in the functionality of the building. The mood is somewhat muted and everyday, offering a glimpse into the less often seen aspects of urban living.","title":"Incinerator of this south Bronx tenement is going full blast","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550277","546728","556180","548330","548374","548343","548424","549971","543796","548321","557213","547207","548425","552394","555791","553673"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["rooftop","building","roof","outlet","air","conditioning","heating","everyday","glimpse","cool"]}
