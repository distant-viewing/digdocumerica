{"path":"545559.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a stunning natural rock formation, specifically a large arch, known as Double O Arch located in Arches National Park in Utah. This arch consists of two massive, circular openings eroded into a larger sandstone rock structure, giving it a distinctive and impressive appearance.\n\nThe larger, bottom-opening of the arch dominates the foreground, framing a view of the rocky landscape beyond it. This lower arch has a somewhat smooth, weather-worn surface, colored in deep red and brown tones characteristic of sandstone formations. The sunlight illuminates the arch, highlighting its rugged textures and the various shades of red and orange that paint the rock.\n\nBehind the first arch, the upper and smaller arch is visible, echoing the shape and composition of the lower one but at a different angle. This alignment provides a visually striking perspective, illustrating the natural beauty and geological wonder of the park.\n\nThe background reveals a sprawling desert landscape that includes additional rock formations, distant cliffs, and sparse vegetation typical of the high desert. The sky is clear and bright blue, enhancing the vividness and warmth of the rocky landscape below.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the grandeur and natural beauty of a famous geological landmark, emphasizing both the scale and the unique formations that make Arches National Park a place of interest and exploration.","title":"Double O Arch, one of many windows carved into vertical redrock by centuries of erosion","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545582","545570","544935","544939","545568","545573","553077","545551","545572","545555","545566","545580","545563","545569","545585","545584"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["arch","formation","sandstone","rock","opening","desert","wonder","alignment","landmark","warmth"]}
