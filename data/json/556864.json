{"path":"556864.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of workers, likely engaged in railway maintenance or construction. Four men are visible in the foreground, each wearing hard hats, which indicate the industrial and potentially hazardous nature of their environment.\n\nOn the left, one worker, dressed in a dark jacket and pants, and wearing a brown hard hat, is engaged in conversation with another worker who is seated on a piece of equipment. The seated worker, wearing a light pink hard hat, has a relaxed posture and is listening intently to the standing worker. This central interaction seems to be the focal point of the image.\n\nTo their right, two additional workers are visible. The first stands facing away from the camera, also participating in the conversation or perhaps just observing. The other, farther to the right, is turned slightly towards the camera, listening to the conversation or focusing on a point off-camera. He also wears a brown hard hat and a light blue denim shirt.\n\nIn the background, other personnel and more equipment are visible. The environment has grey gravel (likely railway ballast) and grassy areas, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. A large, industrial railway maintenance machine, which seems to carry chains or other heavy materials, dominates the middle background.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of communication and cooperation amongst workers in a railway construction or maintenance setting, framed by their industrial work environment under an overcast sky.","title":"Southern railway track repair crew work around equipment used to remove old rails and replace them with quarter mile long rails in a regular program to improve the company's 10,531 miles of track.  In 1974 southern averaged four crews of 50 to 55 men.  They laid 91,808 tons of rail and replaced 2,278,318 cross ties.
