{"path":"549816.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph features a large barge loaded with a massive heap of garbage, navigating through blue water. The barge, marked with the number \"DS 844\", is decorated sparingly with graffiti. The foreground and midsection of the image show the textured deck of the barge, equipped with several fixed cylindrical bollards used for mooring ropes. Some ropes are casually looped around the bollards. The deck and parts of the garbage pile are littered with smaller debris pieces, further emphasizing the purpose of the barge for waste transport.\n\nThe water surrounding the barge has a few patches of froth, indicating movement and typical water turbulence caused by the vessel’s journey. The backdrop reveals a distant shoreline, which seems to be an urban landscape with uniform, block-like buildings of medium height, characteristic of a city’s outskirts or a densely populated residential area. The sky is clear and offers a bright contrast to the darker tones of the barge and the piled garbage.","title":"Garbage is towed down the East River to Staten Island landfill, Manhattan in background.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549780","548366","549799","549817","549808","549821","549822","549801","549802","549818","548356","549819","548315","549306","549824","549783"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["barge","bollard","garbage","rope","deck","froth","mooring","turbulence","journey","heap"]}
