{"path":"551360.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up, intimate scene with a strong focus on tactile elements and warm lighting. The central object of interest is a person's hand adjusting a cylindrical device (possibly a flashlight or some form of manual equipment) on top of another object that appears rounded and light-emitting, similar to a globe. The surface of this globe-like object is textured and it emanates a soft, glowing light. The overall lighting adds to the warmth and suggests the setting might be in a dimly lit place, possibly during an evening or at night.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurry figure of another person engaging with what appears to be a sculpture or a large object that is not fully visible due to the focus and depth of field used in the image. This background figure seems to be either holding or interacting with the object, adding a layer of activity and depth to the composition.\n\nThe photograph evokes a sense of curiosity and focus, with the detailed attention to the hands and objects suggesting an action or adjustment being made meticulously. The atmosphere is somewhat enigmatic due to the soft focus and muted color palette, primarily in shades of amber and dark hues that enhance the mystery and intimacy of the image.","title":"Bill Moulder, Bridal Cave guide, with onyx-coated stalagmite. The crystal diffuses the light from the flashlight through the column. Bridal Cave, one of the major attractions of the region, is said to have more onyx per square foot than any other known cave.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["553883","543744","547116","546580","552382","555441","555428","555332","558357","553263","547427","547763","555429","548998","557851","550048"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["object","globe","adjustment","focus","intimacy","sculpture","figure","mystery","warmth","person"]}
