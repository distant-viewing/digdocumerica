{"path":"544047.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and scenic view of a mountainous landscape during sunset. The sky, filled with a mixture of deep blues and radiant oranges, dominates the upper half of the image and features clouds that are illuminated by the setting sun, creating a vibrant backdrop. Rays of sunlight pierce through the cloud formations, casting streaks of light that spotlight different sections of the landscape below.\n\nThe lower half of the image showcases several layers of mountain ranges. These mountains have a silhouette-like quality due to the backlighting of the sunset, progressively fading into softer tones of blue and gray as they recede into the distance, enhancing the sense of depth in the image. The rays of sunlight create patches of highlights and shadows across the mountains, adding a textural and dynamic element to the view.\n\nIn the foreground, a portion of a valley is visible. This area is less defined but suggests a flat, possibly vegetated landscape that contrasts with the ruggedness of the mountains. The interplay of light and shadow, alongside the grandeur of the mountainous terrain and the vivid colors of the sunset, collectively contribute to a serene yet awe-inspiring natural scene.","title":"Sunrise over Superstition Mountains.
