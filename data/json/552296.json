{"path":"552296.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph provides a serene view of a harborside scene with various boats and a wooded landscape. In the foreground, several boats are docked at what appears to be a marina. To the left, there is a larger white and green fishing boat named \"Menominee,\" prominently featuring fishing gear such as masts and winches. Adjacent to it is another similar style boat, in white and blue, named \"Chinook.\"\n\nOn the water, further in from these boats, a small white sailboat with its sails down moves slowly. Beyond these vessels, nestled in the middle ground of the image, is an eye-catching yellow boat, larger than the others in frame, appearing to be a commercial or industrial type vessel docked on the opposite bank of the water.\n\nThe background consists of a lush, tree-covered hillside. This wooded area gently slopes down towards the water's edge. There are small houses or cabins dotted sporadically across this hillside, partially obscured by the trees, hinting at a quiet, residential area. The overall atmosphere conveyed is calm and peaceful, typical of a quaint coastal or lakeside community. The lighting suggests that it may be either an overcast day or the photo was taken in the soft light of early morning or late evening, adding to the gentle ambiance of the setting. The water is still, reflecting the boats and the greenery of the trees, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the scene.","title":"Salmon fishing boats at Gig Harbor, a small fishing community in southern Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542872","548247","548235","543545","552297","542903","543246","542905","542907","546388","552292","542904","548546","546939","542908","543358"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","hillside","vessel","fishing","name","dock","winch","marina","mast","lakeside"]}
