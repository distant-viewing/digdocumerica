{"path":"553444.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a person in mid-air, plunging into a dark body of water. The water's surface is calm with just a few gentle waves, suggesting a relatively still environment. The subject wears colorful swim shorts with a floral pattern, and his body is positioned in a dive, almost touching the water. His arms are held out and slightly bent, enhancing a streamlined position with the legs straight and toes pointed. From the angle and lighting, the person appears to be diving during the day, as the water glistens slightly under what could be sunlight. The overall mood of the photo conveys a sense of freedom and exhilaration associated with diving. No other objects or people are visible in this tightly framed shot, focusing solely on the action of the dive and the vast, undefined expanse of the water.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["552227","548834","544351","551165","549359","548844","548835","547134","548726","544347","553443","548675","554007","548683","549347","548714"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dive","plunge","diving","water","freedom","glisten","swim","person","position","leg"]}
