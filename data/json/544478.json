{"path":"544478.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image of a cattle egret in a natural habitat. The egret is prominently positioned in the foreground, characterized by its bright white plumage contrasted with the neutral beige and muted green tones of the environment. The bird's head is turned slightly to the side, showcasing an orange to reddish beak and a keen, alert gaze.\n\nThe egret is standing in a sparse landscape likely within a grassland or marsh area, indicated by the dry, cracked ground and scattered tufts of grass. Some reeds or grass blades partially obscure the bird, slightly blending into the setting but still distinctly visible against the complex texture of the ground.\n\nThe background of the photograph is subtly out of focus, creating an impression of depth and highlighting the egret as the main subject. The natural lighting of the scene suggests it might be taken during a bright day, enhancing the vividness of the egret's feather and the surrounding natural tones. Overall, the composition captures a serene moment in nature, emphasizing the grace and adaptation of the cattle egret within its environment.","title":"Cattle egret with breeding plumage near jetport","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544486","544482","544516","548732","544842","545967","544616","547745","544631","544489","548731","548729","544484","547630","544620","550471"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","cattle","bird","tuft","grace","beak","plumage","adaptation","blade","feather"]}
