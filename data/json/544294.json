{"path":"544294.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene with a somewhat grim and polluted ambiance, taken by a body of water, potentially a river. In the foreground, the riverbank is cluttered with debris, including what appears to be broken down and partially sunken boats amidst piles of assorted waste and driftwood. The water surface reflects a grey sky.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by industrial structures. There is a variety of grey and white buildings, cylindrical storage tanks, and vertical structures resembling silos or towers. Notable among these is a tall, slender tower with a cylindrical upper section, possibly a smokestack, given the presence of other industrial elements. The sky above the industrial setup is overcast and cloudy, suggesting a gloomy or stormy day.\n\nAdditionally, to the right side of the image, there is a flame visible, possibly from a flare stack, indicating the burning off of waste gasesâ€”a common practice in some types of industrial operations.\n\nThe overall composition and the elements within the photograph convey a sense of environmental degradation associated with industrial areas, highlighting issues related to industrial pollution and its impact on nearby natural settings.","title":"Pointe a la Hache","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557246","548357","552019","551559","551562","550875","552189","547582","552154","550725","544803","551009","552210","550332","550694","547702"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","tower","burning","flare","flame","driftwood","silo","practice","degradation","gas"]}
