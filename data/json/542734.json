{"path":"542734.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque view of a bridge over a rugged river canyon. The bridge, likely constructed in an early 20th-century architectural style, features a series of graceful arches supporting a roadway lined with a simple, elegant balustrade. Built with what appears to be concrete or stone, the bridge spans across a steep, rocky canyon through which a turbulent river flows. The river itself cascades over and around large, smoothed boulders, creating white water rapids that add a dynamic element to the serene natural setting.\n\nSurrounding the river and bridge, the terrain is densely vegetated with a mix of trees and bushes, primarily green, suggesting this scene is set during a vibrant spring or summer season. The foliage is lush, indicative of a wet environment possibly in a mountainous or forested region.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph highlights the contrast between the man-made structure of the bridge and the wild, natural beauty of the canyon and river below. The perspective used in capturing this image looks downward into the canyon, giving a sense of both the depth of the gorge and the height of the bridge above the river.\n\nThis scene could be a popular spot for nature lovers and possibly indicates a location that is a part of a national park or a protected area, aiming to preserve its natural beauty while allowing for human access and enjoyment. The image evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence between human infrastructure and nature.","title":"Bridge on road to mineral king","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["549469","543313","548870","552052","549547","557959","552598","544304","558048","557969","551527","548064","548087","557096","558051","557658"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["canyon","bridge","river","gorge","smooth","balustrade","rapid","preserve","boulder","cascade"]}
