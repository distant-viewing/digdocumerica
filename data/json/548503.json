{"path":"548503.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene aboard a traditional, bright red fishing boat. There are six individuals actively engaged in various tasks associated with sailing or maintaining the boat. The crew appears diverse, consisting of men and women wearing casual, practical attire suitable for a day at sea.\n\nOne man on the left wears a dark blue bandana and is holding a large steering wheel, focused on navigating the boat. Next to him, a woman in a light green skirt and floral blouse engages with equipment or controls on the boat. In the center, a man in a sleeveless green shirt and another wearing a dark blue tank top are together handling ropes, likely adjusting the sail or other rigging components; their efforts appear coordinated and labor-intensive.\n\nTo the right, a woman in a white t-shirt and high ponytail sits on the edge, possibly taking a break or supervising the work. Another person, visible mainly by their arms and a hint of multicolored clothing, contributes to the group activity centered around the mast and rigging.\n\nThe boat itself features prominent, colorful details, including a red wheel-like structure with geometric black and red patterns. The background suggests a calm day on the water with haze slightly obscuring the coastal landscape. The atmosphere is one of cooperative effort and the enjoyment of a sunny day at sea.","title":"Hoisting sail on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549412","549355","547465","549410","549427","547455","547456","547453","547458","549415","549433","544269","549336","549392","549399","547466"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","rig","wheel","effort","ponytail","woman","multicolored","sea","bandana","supervise"]}
