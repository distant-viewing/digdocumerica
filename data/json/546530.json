{"path":"546530.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil lakeside scene. In the foreground, there are tall grasses and sparse reeds at the edge of the water, slightly blurred, which indicates that they were closer to the camera lens compared to the rest of the scene. The lake itself is calm, with a smooth water surface that reflects a mild shimmer of light.\n\nThe center of the image shows a large body of water that extends towards a distant structure on the opposite bank. This structure has a modern architectural style, characterized by rounded, tubular shapes forming the roof, interspersed with rectangular sections. The building is nestled among lush greenery, with various types of mature trees and shrubs surrounding it, suggesting a well-maintained landscape that blends with the natural environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is peaceful and serene, primarily focusing on nature and modern architecture harmoniously coexisting. The color palette is rich in greens and blues, punctuated by the grays and whites of the building, contributing to a calm and inviting scene.","title":"House on harrison lake","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548034","550778","544565","558093","544561","548030","543547","554527","550750","550389","551207","550324","547127","550493","557562","546293"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lens","coexist","lakeside","reed","shimmer","punctuate","calm","white","compare","nestle"]}
