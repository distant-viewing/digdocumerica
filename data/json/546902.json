{"path":"546902.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a roadside scene featuring a waste collection or clean-up activity. In the foreground, there's a large dumpster filled with various types of debris including crushed cans, discarded papers, plastic items, and larger objects like tires. A man, dressed in dark winter clothing and gloves, stands at the edge of the dumpster, looking upward towards the camera.\n\nBehind him, a yellow flat front truck, which seems like a garbage truck, is parked on the side of a multi-lane road. Another vehicle, resembling a utility vehicle, is parked in front of the truck. On the road next to the parked vehicles, cars are passing by, indicating that this scene is taking place in a moderately busy area.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a rural or semi-rural area given the presence of grassy patches and small trees on the sidelines of the road. The sky is overcast, suggesting cold or gloomy weather conditions, which is consistent with the attire of the man in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the man and the dumpster, emphasizing the theme of waste management or environmental clean-up along a busy roadway.","title":"Trash along the john hanson highway is picked up by prisoners","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547208","549940","549949","549936","549945","549743","549749","542549","547983","549751","550154","550147","550162","542550","549746","546761"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpster","truck","waste","road","vehicle","parke","crush","front","discard","glove"]}
