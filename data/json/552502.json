{"path":"552502.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a serene natural landscape showing a rolling hill densely covered with wildflowers in shades of pink, white, and light purple. The slope inclines from the foreground up towards the crest of the hill which is lined with a lush green grass. At the top of the hill, against a clear blue sky, stands a solitary tree with a broad, leafy canopy, suggesting it might be a type of deciduous tree. There are no visible human activities or people in the image; the focus is entirely on the natural beauty of the flowering hillside under bright sunlight, invoking a sense of peace and the splendor of an untamed environment.","title":"Along Interstate 74","placename":"Brimfield (Ill.)","location":"Brimfield, Illinois","nn1":["557189","557099","542644","557098","547540","555589","557191","544574","544439","552553","549186","549225","557190","545847","549248","552442"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","crest","peace","wildflower","hillside","purple","slope","canopy","type","sunlight"]}
