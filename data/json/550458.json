{"path":"550458.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene, primarily composed of a pebble-covered shoreline. The foreground features a collection of round and smooth stones in various shades of gray and white, spread unevenly along the dark, damp sand near the water's edge. On the left, a slightly raised ridge of stones and debris forms a small mound, likely shaped by wave action. Subtle hints of organic material, possibly seaweed or small pieces of driftwood, are also visible among the stones, adding a touch of organic texture to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground shows a strip of wet sand, reflecting the dark, overcast sky above, which transitions into water. The water itself is relatively calm, showing gentle ripples rather than waves, suggesting a tranquil setting. The color tone of the environment is mostly monochromatic with dark blues and grays dominating, which might imply either an early dawn, late dusk, or an overcast day.\n\nOverall, the composition is simple yet evocative, capturing the quiet mood of a deserted beach with natural details that convey a sense of peace and solitude. The photograph emphasizes texture and subtle variations in natural material, showcasing the quiet beauty found in undisturbed natural environments.","title":"Details of bedded gravels in the Sagavanirktok River, and typical of almost all major rivers the pipeline will cross in Alaska.
