{"path":"547897.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene involving a polluted shore area next to a body of water. In the foreground, there is considerable debris and waste scattered over muddy and wet ground. Items include various pieces of wood, discarded cables or wires, and miscellaneous waste materials.\n\nA partially submerged television set is a prominent feature near the center of the frame, highlighting the extent of human impact on this natural setting. The reflection in the water adds to the grim atmosphere of neglect.\n\nTowards the middle of the composition, one can see a bridge constructed from heavy beams, which crosses over the water body. The bridge provides a stark industrial contrast to the natural environment, suggesting proximity to urban areas.\n\nThe background features further industrial elements such as warehouses or factories, with no significant vegetation visible, amplifying the feel of a heavily industrialized zone. The skyline is relatively clear, indicating it might be either a sunny day or one where pollution affects visibility.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a dismal yet critical statement about environmental degradation near urban and industrial areas, demonstrating how human activities contribute to the despoiling of natural landscapes.","title":"Oil-soaked mud lines industrial canal in Gravesend Bay area of Brooklyn.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550352","547907","548741","552089","552127","546785","547844","547831","550800","555852","547626","551559","552080","551440","544810","552811"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["waste","television","bridge","statement","extent","degradation","cable","set","warehouse","proximity"]}
