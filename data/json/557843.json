{"path":"557843.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"In the photograph, a young girl is peeking out from behind a deep red, wooden column. She appears to be of African descent and is smiling subtly at the camera. The girl has her hair partially pulled back with a pink bead hair accessory. She is wearing a playful outfit which includes a white sleeveless top with ruffled straps and neckline, decorated with a colorful, horizontally striped pattern across the chest. The shorts she's wearing are white, patterned with various patriotic motifs including stars, stripes, and other elements in red, blue, and beige tones.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, hinting at an interior setting with dim lighting, which brings a cozy and intimate feel to the image. The dominant visual element besides the girl is the striking, polished red column, which adds a strong vertical line and a pop of color to the composition. The overall mood of the photo is cheerful and innocent, caught in a moment of playful hide-and-seek or shy curiosity.","title":"Young girl on a visit to her gRandmother in Norwood, Ohio the home is near an auto emission inspection station where all light duty, spark ignition powered vehicles registered in the city must be certified annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.
