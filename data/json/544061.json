{"path":"544061.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts a gritty, somewhat industrial or rural environment during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft lighting and long shadows. The scene includes a large white industrial or utility truck parked along a narrow dirt path or road. The truck is equipped with a variety of tools and equipment, and the front of another similar vehicle can be seen in the distant background, suggesting a fleet or work crew presence.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a large cylindrical object, possibly a utility component or storage bin, with a dome-shaped top that appears tan or beige in color. There is tall, yellowish-brown grass and sparse vegetation throughout, indicating a dry or unkept area.\n\nThe area is bordered by a fence constructed of horizontal slats on the far left, contributing to the secluded or backroad feel of the location. Wires and utility poles run alongside the path, further emphasizing the functional, less residential nature of this particular setting. The overall mood of the image is one of isolation and routine utility work, with a focus on the equipment and work environment rather than human activity.","title":"Mechanical \"arm\" of garbage truck picks up 320-gallon trash containers and dumps contents into truck.
