{"path":"552509.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph displays a rural setting centered on a quaint, single-story building labeled \"Hickory Town Hall Polling Place.\" This structure, showing wooden panel exteriors painted a fading white, features a pointed roof and has a single, glass-paned front door. Surrounded by green grass, the building appears slightly weathered, implying some age and exposure to elements. Beside the town hall, slightly to the right, is a smaller wooden structure, similarly painted and possibly serving as a utility or storage shed. The area is open and tranquil, with trees partially visible to the left and back, and a field extending into the horizon under a vast blue sky lightly brushed with clouds. Overall, the scene captures a serene and somewhat nostalgic slice of rural American life, possibly in a small community where such a town hall doubles as a central meeting spot for local governance and community voting.","title":"Hickory town hall and polling place","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["552460","552469","557154","558099","550704","549221","558109","558032","557947","552456","547658","557156","548295","554697","557951","555635"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["hall","town","meeting","community","shed","slice","white","panel","exposure","exterior"]}
