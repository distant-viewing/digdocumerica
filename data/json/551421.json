{"path":"551421.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features two individuals engaged in what appears to be environmental clean-up activity near a body of water. The setting is a natural area with tall, dry grasses and some scattered litter. The water in the background suggests this might be a riverbank or lakeside.\n\nThe person in the foreground is a woman who is climbing up the slope. She is dressed in a long-sleeve brown turtleneck, blue jeans, and dark shoes, and she is wearing round sunglasses. She is holding up a white piece of trash with her right hand while grasping a black trash bag in her left hand.\n\nBehind her, another person, also likely female based on the hairstyle, is bent over, reaching towards the ground as if picking up trash. This individual is wearing a navy blue jacket, light-colored pants, and possibly boots. This figure has long, reddish-brown hair which partially obscures her face.\n\nThe overall composition captures a moment of active participation in an environmental cleanup with a focus on individual actions contributing to the care of natural spaces. The mood is one of diligence and purpose, underscored by the casual, practical attire and focused expressions of the subjects.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
