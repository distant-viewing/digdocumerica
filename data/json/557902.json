{"path":"557902.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at what appears to be a vehicle inspection or service station. The setting features several men dressed in uniforms, suggesting they are employees or workers at the station. In the foreground, there are four men wearing white shirts and dark pants, engaged in conversation. Their attire includes name badges and belts, typical of a service uniform.\n\nFurther into the scene, an older man with gray hair stands near the entrance of the structure. He is dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants, looking off to the side as if observing the activities or waiting for someone.\n\nBehind this area, there is a partially visible dark-colored car lifted by what seems to be service equipment, with another man working around it or inspecting it.\n\nThe station itself has an industrial aesthetic with visible steel beams overhead and large, circular red lights hanging down, perhaps indicating different service stations or safety lights.\n\nThe background beyond the station is less distinct, softly illuminated by natural lighting, suggesting an outdoor setting with trees and possibly a street or parking lot. The overall atmosphere is busy yet routine, with a focus on automotive maintenance or inspection.","title":"City employees watch the approach of a car for a headlight alignment check at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. All vehicles registered in the city must undergo an annual safety check. In addition, all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must undergo an emissions test for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust gases. The emissions test went into effect in January, 1975; the safety test has been in effect since 1940.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557852","542763","557884","557906","557893","557850","557905","557855","557885","557897","557833","552789","557861","557858","557867","553491"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["station","service","inspection","uniform","employee","man","pant","badge","belt","outdoor"]}
