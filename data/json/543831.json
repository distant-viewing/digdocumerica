{"path":"543831.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a striking mountain landscape under a cloud-filled sky. The main feature is a rugged mountain peak, dusted with snow and prominent against the surrounding mist and clouds. This peak, sharply pointed, rises majestically and dominates the upper portion of the frame.\n\nIn the lower foreground, there is a darker, sloped hill that contrasts with the snow-covered peaks. No vegetation is visible on this closer hill, giving it a barren look. It seems to be a typical mountainous terrain, possibly suggesting a high altitude.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is subdued, likely due to heavy cloud cover, which adds a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere to the scene. The colors are primarily shades of blue and grey, which enhance the feeling of coldness and remoteness of the mountain environment.\n\nOverall, this is a serene, yet powerful image of a mountain landscape that conveys a sense of isolation and the grand scale of nature.","title":"Dallas divide","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["550591","550408","550628","555681","550415","550645","550521","542520","550504","550416","550421","552695","550500","550610","543023","550516"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["peak","mountain","cloud","snow","remoteness","slop","hill","prominent","rugged","dust"]}
