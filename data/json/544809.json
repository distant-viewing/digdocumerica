{"path":"544809.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a desolate, sparsely vegetated area scattered with various discarded items and debris. In the foreground, a white stove stands prominently, seeming out of place in the outdoor setting. It appears unused and has its oven door open. There's also a flat piece of wood with what looks like a rusted metal frame or vent attached to it lying on the ground directly in front of the stove.\n\nDominating the mid-ground is an older model convertible car, likely from the 1950s. It's black, with its bonnet open, revealing the engine inside. The car adds a vintage touch to the scene, contrasting starkly with the surrounding disorder.\n\nBehind the car is a large, makeshift structure, with the words \"OLD WEST\" crudely painted on the side, suggesting a theme or former attraction, now seemingly abandoned and dilapidated. The walls of the building are dark, and there is significant wear and decay visible. \n\nThe ground is littered with more rubbish, including broken glass, cardboard boxes, and assorted debris, contributing to the overall theme of neglect and abandonment. The background displays a distant mountain landscape under a slightly cloudy sky. The open, hilly terrain emphasizes a sense of isolation and disuse of the area. \n\nThis scene conveys a strong narrative of decay and abandonment, perhaps indicating socio-economic decline or the remnants of a once-thriving area now forgotten.","title":"Jefferson county open dump","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["553009","547587","544060","552997","543354","550279","545304","553869","556640","556313","556352","554561","547917","547775","547921","553010"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["stove","abandonment","bonnet","decay","1950","car","disorder","rubbish","forget","attraction"]}
