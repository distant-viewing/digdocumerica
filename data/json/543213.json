{"path":"543213.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant carousel scene. In the image, a man and a young girl, who are riding side by side on elaborately painted carousel horses. The man, to the left, is wearing sunglasses and a white short-sleeved shirt; he grasps a vertical pole attached to his horse for stability. Beside him, the young girl holds onto a similar pole and seems to be enjoying the ride; she's wearing a light-colored shirt with a pattern and darker, possibly denim shorts.\n\nThe horses are exquisitely detailed with rich decorations that include colorful saddles, bridles, and draped fabrics in hues of green, orange, and white, adorned with jewels and ornamental elements. The expressions on the horses are crafted to look lively, adding to the whimsical atmosphere of the carousel.\n\nThe background, slightly blurred due to the motion or focus of the photograph, indicates that the carousel is housed within a structure, possibly a pavilion, which typically allows for year-round use. Iridescent lights, presumably for night-time illumination, dot the periphery of the carouselâ€™s top and are reflected in other areas of the structure, adding to the magical feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall impression is one of joy and classic amusement park fun, encapsulated in this timeless activity popular with children and adults alike.","title":"Merry-go-round at amusement park","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["549711","547002","547278","551299","543218","552950","545458","551298","557712","551295","545464","549108","549574","551297","554455","551717"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["horse","girl","pavilion","bridle","saddle","fun","stability","pole","periphery","amusement"]}
