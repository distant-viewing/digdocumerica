{"path":"545419.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential street scene, likely from an earlier decade given the style of the vehicles visible. The foreground features a stop sign at the right, with a car parked facing the camera. The car is an older style sedan, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, with a distinctive trunk design and chrome bumpers.\n\nThe middle ground shows a gently curving street lined with mature trees, adding a lush green canopy to the scene. Another older car is parked on the street, and two more are visible in driveways. These cars also mirror the era suggested by the first, supporting the vintage feel of the photograph.\n\nThe background is occupied by two-story houses, some with visible chimneys and one with a satellite dish, hinting at a blend of slightly different eras. The houses have varying roof styles and are placed amidst a lot of greenery, indicating a well-established neighborhood. The roofs and some details of the houses are slightly obscured by the trees, lending an air of privacy and seclusion.\n\nOverall, the image has a quiet, tranquil atmosphere, capturing a slice of suburban life in a bygone era. The focus and slight haze suggest it may have been taken on a humid or overcast day.","title":"Residential street near steel plant.
