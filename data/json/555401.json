{"path":"555401.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows a scenic river environment, capturing both leisure and industrial activities. In the foreground, there are three people engaged in beachcombing along a wet sandy shore. They appear to be dressed in casual outdoor clothes, with one individual seemingly wearing a cap. Each of them is holding a bucket, suggesting they might be collecting shells, rocks, or perhaps marine debris.\n\nIn the background, the focus shifts to a large body of water where a vibrant scene unfolds. A tugboat, painted in yellow and featuring a prominent wheelhouse, is actively towing a long barge. The barge appears heavily laden, possibly with cargo or raw materials given its industrial look and the presence of multiple compartments.\n\nThe setting is framed by lush, dense forestry that lines the opposite bank of the river, emphasizing the juxtaposition of natural beauty and human activity. The water itself reflects a shimmering pattern due to the wake generated by the moving tugboat, enhancing the dynamic feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment of peaceful coexistence between human activities and the natural environment, highlighting both the recreational and commercial uses of the river.","title":"Lowest flow on record for the Columbia River in the fall of 1973 was the result of low precipitation the previous year. Beach never before seen was uncovered for more than three months at Rooster Rock State Park east of Portland.","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551148","548067","550901","548187","550951","548059","557235","556481","551179","546938","551282","545658","546836","551038","551993","550900"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","barge","river","compartment","shell","forestry","wake","coexistence","clothe","cargo"]}
