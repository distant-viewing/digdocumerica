{"path":"548957.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural cattle handling scene, presumably on a farm or ranch. In the foreground, a cow is confined within a metal chute, specifically designed for safely holding the cattle during veterinary procedures or similar tasks. The cow's head is visible at the far end of the chute, peaking out slightly, suggesting it's being held for inspection or treatment.\n\nStanding beside the chute, there is an individual wearing traditional rancher attire including a cowboy hat and a long-sleeve striped shirt. This person appears to be operating or monitoring the equipment, paying close attention to the cow.\n\nIn the background, various farm equipment and machinery are visible, including what appears to be parts of other chutes or metal holdings, and a white vehicle, possibly a pickup truck, indicative of chores or tasks that require transportation of goods or livestock around the area. The ground is dry and dusty, typical of a rugged outdoor environment often found in ranch settings.\n\nThe setting is open-air with clear skies, emphasizing the outdoor, labor-intensive nature of ranch work. The equipment is practical and robust, designed for heavy, regular use under such environmental conditions.","title":"Annual spring roundup of cattle raised on experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552569","548952","548959","552669","554949","548955","554881","554950","548960","549033","548962","552567","553106","548878","553107","543686"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["chute","ranch","cow","cattle","farm","equipment","procedure","task","livestock","inspection"]}
