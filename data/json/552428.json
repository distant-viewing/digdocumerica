{"path":"552428.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of small, sparse vegetation emerging from a dark, sandy or possibly volcanic soil surface. The soil textures appear grainy with a matte finish, suggesting either moisture or a fine particulate composition. The plant life shown varies slightly in type but includes thin, frail green stems and small leaves that are sporadically scattered across the area. There are also some dry, white grasses interspersed among the greener plants. The tone of the image is somewhat muted, with natural light casting subtle shadows from the plants onto the ground, hinting at either a cloudy day or a shaded area. No backdrop or other objects are visible, focusing all attention on the interplay of the plant life with the textured ground.","title":"Aftermath of strip mining at st.
