{"path":"543220.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of two children engaged in fishing activities on a sunlit wooden pier. One child, wearing a green jacket and dark pants, is seated on the pier, bending over slightly while looking at the water. The other child, also dressed in a green jacket and dark pants, is standing and actively casting a fishing rod, looking focused on the fishing line extending into the air above him.\n\nOn the pier, there is a bucket filled with several fish near the standing child, symbolizing a successful fishing venture so far. Notably, there's a written notice on the pier that reads \"NO FISH\" perhaps humorously acknowledged or ignored by the setting. The background offers a broad view of a shoreline dotted with various buildings, suggesting a communal or populated coastal area. The sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, enhancing the feeling of a crisp, pleasant day, conducive to outdoor activities such as fishing.\n\nThis delightful and dynamic outdoor scene encapsulates a moment of childhood adventure and the simplicity of leisure activities by the water.","title":"Fishing","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["550776","554518","553914","552118","544200","542740","552257","552291","546410","544203","543516","552828","543472","546800","547884","547004"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["fishing","pier","child","fish","notice","jacket","pant","symbolize","childhood","write"]}
