{"path":"551110.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with a series of small, single-story houses aligned along a dirt road. The houses are modestly sized, box-like structures with pitched roofs, and each features different pastel colors: grey, yellow, and teal. The environment suggests a warm climate due to the presence of lush green trees in the background, which overshadow the houses and provide a dense, forested backdrop.\n\nIn the foreground, a large tree stands dominantly on the left, near which are some hay bales, indicating agricultural activity or use. To the right, along the winding, unpaved road, an elderly man is pulling a small cart. His presence along with the rustic surroundings suggest a tranquil, possibly slow-paced rural life. The overall composition, with its vibrant house colors and natural setting, offers a picturesque view of rural architecture and lifestyle. Furthermore, the image captures the scene in daylight, enhancing the colors and shadows, giving depth and contrast to the landscape.","title":"New houses at kimberely were built by Buffalo housing Buffalo housing originated at the West Virginia institute of technology in an effort to provide jobs for the unemployed and low cost housing for the needy","placename":"Charleston (W.
