{"path":"552157.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic scene on a body of water, possibly a river or bay, with a backdrop of a small industrial or maritime community nestled against a mountain range. The main focus is on a large white object in the foreground, which appears to be an upturned part of a boat, such as a hull or a tub, partially submerged and vigorously bobbing in the choppy, dark brown water that reflects a hint of blue sky.\n\nBehind this object, the waterway expands towards a shoreline cluttered with buildings including small industrial structures or warehouses, typical of a fishing village or a small harbor town. Some of these buildings are directly adjacent to the water's edge, hinting at their possible utility for boat storage or processing marine goods. The shoreline reveals a row of evergreen trees silhouetted against the bright sky, contributing to the rural or semi-wilderness character of the area.\n\nThe background mountains, dusted with snow, rise majestically, suggesting a cold or alpine environment. They are bathed in sunlight from a low angle, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon. The overall atmosphere of the image, enhanced by the stark contrasts between the dark waters, bright icy objects, and sunlit mountain peaks, evokes a feeling of rugged outdoor life and nature's powerful elements at play.","title":"Waste from the ITT Rayonier sulphite pulp mill gives water its reddish hue.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545156","555694","549458","545651","552222","555693","552174","543809","552921","544770","544567","550647","549066","552330","545932","548939"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["object","mountain","shoreline","village","boat","harbor","water","bay","hull","good"]}
