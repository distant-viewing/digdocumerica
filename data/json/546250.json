{"path":"546250.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy landfill operation. The ground is covered with a dense spread of waste including paper, plastics, and miscellaneous rubbish. In the midst of this scene, several heavy machinery vehicles are busy processing the waste. A bulldozer in the foreground is directly facing the viewer and appears active, possibly pushing debris. In the background, to the left, another bulldozer is in operation, while near the center a dump truck is being loaded or unloaded, with two individuals standing on top of it. Further to the right, there is a garbage compactor compressing waste, with two workers visible beside it.\n\nThe environment appears dusty and dry, under a clear sky. The dense composition of waste, scattered heavy machinery, and active workers all contribute to a sense of ongoing, intense labor aimed at managing and organizing the expansive accumulation of waste in this landfill. The scene captures an essential, albeit grim, aspect of waste management operations.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
