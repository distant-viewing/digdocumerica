{"path":"546562.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and energetic scene at a playground set against a suburban backdrop. In the foreground, there is a swing set featuring four swings with metal chains, each swing placed over a weathered asphalt surface. Two children are captured in mid-action on the swings: the child on the left is reaching the apex of the swing's arc, lifted high off the seat, suspended momentarily in the air, her hair billowing out due to the force of the motion. The child on the right is also in full swing, seated and leaning backward to gain more height, legs outstretched forward.\n\nIn the background, other playground facilities are visible, including a basketball court with at least two visible basketball hoops. Behind the basketball court, there are power transmission towers and a few sparse buildings, suggesting a suburban setting. An open grassy area on the left further extends the feeling of an open, public recreational space. On the right, next to the swings, there is a standing bicycle, adding to the childish and carefree atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests it is a sunny day, casting defined shadows of the swing set on the asphalt. Overall, the image captures a joyful and carefree moment of childhood play in an everyday suburban park.","title":"Children on swings behind Smith Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["549666","551720","555946","555931","553512","551725","555928","556290","547188","551498","557410","547875","555901","551128","543093","556175"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["swing","basketball","playground","asphalt","child","apex","outstretche","hoop","arc","set"]}
