{"path":"554011.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a middle-aged man sitting on a white horse in a vast field of crops under a dramatic sky. The man is dressed casually in a denim jacket and denim jeans. He is holding the reins of the horse and has a relaxed posture with a warm smile on his face, suggesting he is comfortable and content in this setting.\n\nThe field in which they are situated is large with rows of crops stretching far into the background. These crops have long green leaves which suggest they might be some type of agricultural produce. The soil is not visible, covered entirely by the dense plantation.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is open and expansive. The field extends to a distant hill which bounds the horizon. Above, the sky is a mix of light and shadows, with large clouds near the horizon reflecting the sunlight, and darker, denser clouds above, suggesting a dynamic, possibly changing weather situation.\n\nThis scene might suggest themes of rural life, agriculture, nature, or simple enjoyment of the outdoors. The overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful, signifying a harmony between the man, the horse, and the natural environment around them.","title":"With pineapple fields as his arena, Henri Aki takes his horse for a late afternoon training session near Lanai City.
