{"path":"550445.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures two Dall sheep standing on a rocky terrain that seems to be composed of fine gravel or a scree slope. The sheep appear to be comfortable in their surroundings, indicative of a natural habitat, possibly a mountainous or hillside region.\n\nThe sheep on the left is facing towards the camera with a slightly turned body. It has lighter fur predominantly, with darker patches around its face and upper back, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its horns are less prominent, suggesting it might be younger or a female.\n\nThe sheep on the right is facing the camera more directly and has more pronounced, curling horns suggesting it is likely a mature male. Its fur is mainly white, providing a stark contrast to the dark ground it stands on.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark and lacks distinct features, which emphasizes the subjects (the sheep) and contributes to a sense of the rugged and sparse environment in which these animals are found. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of calm and isolation in the wilderness.","title":"A pair of young rams, 3-5 years old, descend the hillside salt lick at the west end of the atigun gorge (four miles from the point where the pipeline will cross the atigun river)","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550453","550451","550448","550446","550449","550452","550450","550444","543269","554890","554928","550454","554891","554888","554889","555820"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","horn","face","mountainous","pronounced","female","fur","camera","hillside","gravel"]}
