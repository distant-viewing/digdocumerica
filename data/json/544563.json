{"path":"544563.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring several cormorants perched on the tangled roots of mangrove trees. The setting appears to be a coastal or riverine area, with water visibly surrounding the root structures where the birds are resting. The water is calm, suggesting a tranquil environment, possibly a protected bay or estuary.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple cormorants are seen in various postures: some are standing upright on the roots, while others sit nestled within the branches. The cormorants are dark-feathered, with slender bodies and long necks, typical of the species.\n\nThe background consists of dense green vegetation, likely additional mangrove trees, forming a thick, lush backdrop that indicates a healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystem. The foliage is vibrant in color, contrasting nicely with the darker tones of the birds and the roots.\n\nThe composition of the image emphasizes the intertwining structure of the mangrove roots, highlighting their role both as a natural habitat and as a crucial part of the coastal ecosystem. The roots appear weathered and water-worn, indicative of their continuous exposure to the elements, underscoring the resilience of mangrove environments.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures an intimate moment in the life of coastal birds and the dynamic, intricate beauty of mangrove forests.","title":"Pelicans on mangroves","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544624","544493","548729","544611","544838","544620","544497","544506","545991","548728","550388","551378","552910","557123","544489","548702"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["mangrove","root","bird","ecosystem","neck","specie","bay","resilience","wetland","habitat"]}
