{"path":"554755.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and mysterious scene on a foggy body of water. In the foreground, there are several large, dark rocks partially submerged in the water, appearing smooth and rounded. The lake itself is covered by a layer of mist, which adds a tranquil and somewhat eerie quality to the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, sparse evergreen trees emerge from the fog, their silhouettes slightly blurred but still distinguishable against the lighter fog. Some trees stand taller than others, with their branches sparsely populated with needles, suggesting they might be pines or similar conifers.\n\nThe background features a thicker collection of trees, all shrouded in dense fog, creating a soft gradient of grays and whites that blend into the sky. There's no visible horizon due to the fog, which gives the entire landscape a feeling of infinite depth and isolation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its layers of rocks, water, mist, and trees, conveys a peaceful yet somber atmosphere, typical of a misty early morning or late evening in a secluded natural area. The color palette is subdued, with cool grays and dark tones dominating the scene, enhancing the mood of quiet solitude.","title":"Misty morning on Twitchell Lake shows virgin white pines and partially submerged Boulders in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554754","545213","557021","552336","557014","557561","557601","543406","557000","554752","555536","557570","545012","550750","555126","550735"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["fog","mist","gray","layer","conifer","rock","needle","pine","tree","gradient"]}
