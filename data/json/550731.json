{"path":"550731.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet poignant scene of a small graveyard set against a natural backdrop. The cemetery, containing several aged and weathered gravestones, is situated right next to a body of water, possibly a lake or river, surrounded by a dense forest. The tombstones, of various sizes and styles, are mostly upright and feature visible engravings that may include names and dates, though they are not clearly readable from the image.\n\nThe burial site is enclosed by a simple wire fence supported by wooden posts, partially covered by grass and wildflowers, suggesting a sense of decay and the relentless passage of time. The foreground of the image is dominated by lush green grass, interspersed with wild plants and flowers, conveying a wild, untamed aspect to the cemetery.\n\nThe background is dominated by the calm water body, reflecting the sky, and flanked by a thick line of trees with vibrant green foliage, emphasizing the secluded and tranquil setting. Above, the sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, suggesting a warm, sunny day that contrasts with the somber mood of the cemetery.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the themes of life and death, with the life-affirming natural surroundings providing a stark contrast to the gravestones that symbolize finality and remembrance. This setting may evoke a sense of contemplation and peace, highlighting the natural cycle of life and the beauty that can exist even in places of mourning.","title":"Cemetery at Turner, near seaplane base on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["557184","554824","554790","557942","550364","557089","552451","557185","547420","554792","552683","547417","546147","552017","552487","548239"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","gravestone","tombstone","remembrance","date","cycle","life","peace","grass","wildflower"]}
