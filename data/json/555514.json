{"path":"555514.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image depicts a vintage gas pump, creatively repurposed and transformed into a religious-themed display. The body of the pump is painted in purple and features a top section with gold and black trims, hosting a small panel with a quote from the Bible, John 14:6, saying \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" Below this, encased in a small framed section, is a portrait of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe central section of the pump includes a phrase in red-orange lettering that reads \"Fill up with Old Time Salvation,\" and there is a large red cross painted below the text. The original pump handle and hose are still attached, dangling beside the pump.\n\nThe background shows a bluish gray sky and a snippet of a rustic, possibly abandoned building with red and white paint, contributing to the overall vintage and somewhat neglected atmosphere. The ground is paved and scattered with small debris and leaves, accentuating a sense of abandonment or disuse.","title":"Gasoline stations abandoned during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1973-74 were sometimes used for other purposes. This station at Potlatch, Washington, west of Olympia was turned into a religious meeting hall.
