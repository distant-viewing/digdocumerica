{"path":"543420.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic coastal landscape. In the foreground, a sign that reads \"PRIVATE PROPERTY NO CAMPING - FIRES CITATIONS WILL BE ISSUED\" is prominently displayed, indicating restrictions on the use of the area. The sign is a bit worn and stands on a metal pole, positioned among wild, untended grass and shrubbery showcasing a variety of colors including yellows, browns, and greens.\n\nBeyond the sign, the terrain rolls gently towards a series of rugged cliffs and rocky outcroppings that jut into the vibrant blue sea. Waves can be seen breaking against the rocks, creating a dynamic contrast with the calm sky. The coastline is scattered with dense patches of coastal vegetation which add to the natural ruggedness of the scene.\n\nTo the right of the image, a road or dirt path runs parallel to the coast, suggesting a means of access to this picturesque location. Alongside the road, small, sparse buildings or structures can be seen, possibly private properties or small businesses related to tourism or local services.\n\nThe sky is clear and contributes to the brightness of the scene, emphasizing the vivid colors of the natural landscape. Overall, the photo captures a serene yet strictly regulated coastal environment, highlighting both its natural beauty and the human interventions in place to preserve it.","title":"California -- coast between Carmel Highlands and Yankee Point","placename":"Carmel (Calif.)","location":"Carmel, California","nn1":["543168","554168","545129","543184","543291","545125","545248","545109","543270","543080","542984","543297","553861","543249","545105","554023"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["property","outcropping","no","tourism","restriction","sign","coast","ruggedness","camping","intervention"]}
