{"path":"546071.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a close-up scene, predominantly focused on a person interacting with a branch adorned with bright red berries and green leaves. The person, shown from behind, is reaching out with their left hand to gently touch or possibly pick the berries. They are wearing a denim jacket with the sleeve rolled up, revealing detailed stitching and worn fabric at the cuffs.\n\nThe person's hair is dark and partially swept across their shoulder, obscuring the side of their head, and adding a sense of movement to the scene. The background, slightly defocused, suggests an outdoor environment with a broad expanse of what could be a grassy field, hinting at a rural or park setting illuminated by natural sunlight.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the detailed focus on the interacting hand and the branch, alongside the green and red natural elements, creates an intimate and perhaps contemplative mood, emphasizing the tactile connection between the person and the natural environment.","title":"Winter berries in city park","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["543452","550461","553376","556492","543319","544731","543488","558105","557146","543624","555007","554668","557593","550703","548684","552688"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["person","cuff","branch","fabric","hand","denim","connection","shoulder","head","sleeve"]}
