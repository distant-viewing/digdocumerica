{"path":"553154.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene involving three African American individuals, who appear to be engaged in a lively interaction at an outdoor setting. The focus of the image is a woman standing in the center, with a distinct expression of vocal intensity and emotion on her face. She is dressed in a denim jacket and wears her hair in a voluminous afro. She is pointing dramatically with her right hand towards a man seated at what seems to be a low wall or bench. This man, who is leaning back slightly, is attentively looking up towards the woman, listening or reacting to her. He wears glasses and a dark sweater. \n\nTo the left side of the woman, another figure, partially visible and facing her, seems to be part of the interaction. This person appears to be a woman, dressed in a shiny black outfit and holding a patterned purse. Only the back and side profile of her head are visible, showing that her hair is styled close to the head, contrasting with the central woman's voluminous afro.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, suggesting an urban park or public square with trees and possibly some park benches. The scene is lit in a way that suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft light on the subjects' faces. The overall atmosphere, combined with the expressive postures and gestures of the people involved, conveys a moment of intense personal exchange or a spirited discussion.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553804","551013","553167","553205","551433","551482","553178","551016","548482","551011","555899","553166","553267","553275","556151","553761"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["afro","woman","face","head","emotion","react","exchange","purse","hair","shiny"]}
