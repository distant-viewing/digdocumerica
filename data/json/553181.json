{"path":"553181.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a serene nocturnal scene likely set at a public space featuring a large fountain. The image is taken under dim ambient light, with the scene illuminated primarily by the light reflecting off the fountain and adjacent structures. The light casts a golden hue across the scene, reflecting on wet surfaces that suggest recent rain.\n\nTwo silhouetted figures are the focal points of the composition, seated near the edge of the fountain. They are positioned against the backdrop of a large, illuminated water jet from the fountain, which creates a dramatic backlight effect around their outlines, accentuating their forms against the darkness. The fountainâ€™s spray adds a dynamic texture to the scene.\n\nThe ground, likely a pavement, appears glossy and reflective, mirroring the golden light and contributing to the overall mystical and serene ambiance of the photograph. The environment is quiet and devoid of any visible activity aside from the two figures, providing a sense of solitude and contemplation.\n\nThe background suggests an enclosed space, possibly surrounded by buildings given the presence of what appears to be windowed facades, reflecting some light and adding depth to the setting. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, with a juxtaposition of natural water elements and urban architecture.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: photographing Tyler Davidson Fountain on a raining night.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553179","553195","553196","553295","553224","551468","551855","551663","550747","553194","551858","557282","557268","550748","549982","551647"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","backlight","light","jet","figure","reflect","pavement","darkness","spray","space"]}
