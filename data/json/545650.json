{"path":"545650.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor river scene. The river has a large amount of driftwood accumulated near the shore, forming a dense, tangled mass of logs and branches. At the water's edge, a small motorboat with three individuals is visible. The individuals appear to be engaged in some activity involving the boat, perhaps preparing to navigate through the water or dealing with the driftwood.\n\nThe background features eroded rock formations typical of river landscapes, with layered sedimentary rock visible. The rocks are predominantly flat and horizontal, suggesting a calm geological area without recent upheaval. Vegetation in the background is sparse, consisting of small bushes or grasses scattered across a relatively barren terrain.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a remote or natural area, possibly within a park or undeveloped region, where the river and its natural processes dominate the landscape. The color palette is composed of earth tones with the browns of the driftwood, the grays and reds of the rock formations, and a muted green from the sparse vegetation, contributing to a sense of a dry or arid environment.","title":"Log boom, center of clean-up operations following a massive oil spill into the San Juan River. Here, EPA men check main boom for leakage. Made of telephone poles sections, the boom served to contain the oil and debris until flood conditions caused overflow into Lake Powell. In addition to the pipeline company, five government agencies were involved in the clean-up. The operation was supervised by the EPA.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545654","551538","550222","545658","542537","544770","550208","551603","544749","550988","554467","550209","548018","550717","557972","550338"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["driftwood","rock","river","formation","mass","motorboat","amount","log","gray","vegetation"]}
