{"path":"547740.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up scene where a man is engaged in operating and recording data from a complex device labeled as a \"Radiation Monitor.\" He is focused on writing down the readings that appear on the machine's gauges and recording chart. The man, who seems to be a technician or a scientist, is wearing a utility hat which suggests that he may be in an outdoor or industrial setting.\n\nThe machine is housed in a sturdy metal frame. Its purpose is indicated by several labels and meters, including one large dial that is centrally highlighted in the image. To the left of the device is a chart under a transparent cover, where ongoing measurements seem to be getting recorded automatically.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears to be outdoors due to the natural light and glimpses of vegetation in the diffuse background. The technician is intently using a pen to jot down numbers on a clipboard, ensuring that the data collected by the monitor is accurately documented. His attention to detail underlines the importance of the monitoring task at hand, likely linked to environmental or safety protocols.","title":"Technician from epa's national environmental research center at Las Vegas monitors for radio-active fallout in alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["542661","549610","542659","542663","552371","546285","542662","557829","542765","551595","555249","549378","549625","552377","549607","552380"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["recording","chart","technician","datum","machine","device","label","protocol","clipboard","scientist"]}
