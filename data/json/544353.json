{"path":"544353.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a solitary, small house in a rural or isolated setting, likely taken during late afternoon or early evening, given the soft lighting and long shadows present. The house appears modest and utilitarian, painted in a pale color with contrasting trim around the door and windows. It features a simple, pitched roof and a single visible window next to the front door.\n\nBeside the house, there is a large, traditional-style TV antenna, indicating either its isolated location, necessitating such an antenna for reception, or its vintage, from a time when such antennas were common. The surroundings of the house are sparse; there's a noticeable absence of trees close to the structure. The land immediately around the house appears to be mostly dirt, perhaps indicating recent activity that disturbed the natural vegetation or the nature of the terrain itself.\n\nIn the background, a gentle hill rises, covered with grass and scattered bushes, emphasizing the rural atmosphere. The foreground includes patches of grass and some debris or scattered objects, which could be tools or discarded materials, adding a sense of ruggedness or disrepair to the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a mood of solitude and simplicity, possibly suggesting themes of isolation, self-reliance, or rural living. The composition uses the natural light to highlight the isolation of the house against its natural surroundings.","title":"Hogan with tv antenna","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["546997","554787","554084","554822","555632","547658","558110","558318","554788","549221","552464","551091","556962","547292","547306","547288"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","antenna","isolate","reliance","door","self","isolation","discarded","disturb","surroundings"]}
