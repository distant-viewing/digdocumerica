{"path":"554109.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases an older man interacting with large square nets, possibly bird nets or some kind of protective covering, in a lush, dense orchard setting. The man is standing underneath the canopy formed by these overlapping net squares, each stretched out tightly and secured at various points, intersecting each other. He appears to be either adjusting or inspecting the netting with both hands raised above his head, slightly facing towards one of the nets.\n\nThe orchard is verdant, filled with mature trees that are brimming with leaves. Sunlight filters through the canopy above, creating a patterned shadow on the forest floor which is dappled with leaves and small plants. This gives the scene a serene, somewhat secluded atmosphere. The man is dressed casually in a patterned short-sleeve shirt and pants, suggesting a warm climate and possibly a personal or professional activity in a rural or semi-rural setting. His focused engagement indicates that he might be concerned with the maintenance or functionality of these nets in relation to the trees, potentially protecting the produce or the trees themselves from birds or other elements.","title":"10,000 acres of the island of Hawaii is devoted to growing macadamia nuts, and production is increasing. At the Royal Hawaiian plant near Keaau, workers plant new trees in an expansion which is doubling the size of the growing stock. This plant is the largest processor in the world. Hiroshi Ooka, horticulturalist for the plant, inspects a screen he designed for catching valuable nuts.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["552807","554197","554110","554797","552299","542776","552298","557115","546360","548299","544961","554523","546383","545085","542777","546340"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["net","canopy","netting","relation","produce","covering","leave","square","kind","functionality"]}
