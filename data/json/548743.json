{"path":"548743.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a recreational scene by the waterside, showcasing a mix of leisure activities and the serene outdoor environment. On the left side of the composition, there is a large, modern RV parked parallel to the shoreline. The RV is predominantly white with red and black accents, adding a vivid contrast against the natural background. A man is visible next to the RV, attending to the vehicle, perhaps organizing or preparing something related to their stay.\n\nOn the right, a woman is actively engaged in fishing. She stands on a narrow, concrete jetty that extends into the sparkling blue water. The woman is dressed in a casual red blouse and gray pants, and wears a hat, which suggests sunny weather. She holds a fishing rod attentively, casting her line into the water, emanating a sense of relaxation and enjoyment.\n\nThe background of the image shows a tranquil coastal landscape with a clear sky, scattered clouds, and palm trees that evoke a typical tropical setting. There is also an indication of a mild breeze, suggested by the slight ripple in the water and the posture of the trees. Additionally, utility poles stretch across the horizon, hinting at human habitation and infrastructure nearby.\n\nOverall, the scene is a picturesque representation of leisurely activity by the sea, highlighting elements of travel, natural beauty, and the pleasure of simple, outdoor pursuits.","title":"A retired couple from California stop to fish off embankment at Spanish Harbor Key.
