{"path":"546450.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene viewed from a shaded, semi-enclosed space looking out into a sunlit area. The foreground is dominated by strong architectural elements: a series of dark, heavy beams and columns that create a robust frame, and brick walls to the sides enclose the space, giving it a cavernous feel. Through this framework, a person is seen walking from one side to the other. This person appears mid-stride and is wearing casual clothing.\n\nThe background displays an open, well-maintained park-like setting with manicured grass and scattered trees that offer generous shade. A picnic table is barely visible in the distance, enhancing the recreational and leisurely appeal of the area. The natural light flooding the outer area contrasts starkly with the dim, muted lighting of the foreground, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow which adds depth and interest to the composition. This setup not only guides the eye to explore the different depths of the space but also invokes a sense of calm and serenity typical of a quiet, outdoor setting.","title":"Mabel mcdowell elementary school, built in 1960","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546535","552723","546559","546510","546540","546505","546457","546470","544808","550298","546517","553043","544811","546539","546498","546532"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["space","manicured","picnic","invoke","serenity","explore","sunlit","appeal","person","dim"]}
