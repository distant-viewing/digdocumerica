{"path":"550930.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene filled with a variety of activities and people enjoying a sunny day by the sea. The composition highlights different elements of a typical beach outing:\n\n1. **Foreground**: There are two main figures prominently visible. On the left side of the image, a man is lying on a yellow towel on the sand, soaking up the sun in his swimsuit, which appears to be of a leopard print design. He’s lying on his back with sunglasses on and seems to be in a relaxed state. Nearby, a woman walks along the shore carrying a dark blue inflatable float. She is dressed in a one-piece swimsuit with a colorful floral pattern and appears to be heading towards the water, possibly after having just come out.\n\n2. **Midground**: The shallows of the sea are speckled with various beach-goers who are either standing in the water or engaging in shallow-water activities. The people include children and adults in swimwear, spaced out and casually enjoying the water. Notably, there's a child near the center of the frame in a black swimming outfit.\n\n3. **Background**: Beyond the shallower waters, there are more swimmers immersed in deeper waters. The calm sea extends towards the horizon, where it meets a clear sky, subtly blending shades of blue. On the far left, there is a small boat or yacht, further adding to the leisurely atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe beach itself appears sandy and the water looks inviting, contributing to the overall relaxed and recreational atmosphere of the scene. The vintage quality of the photograph, suggested by the clothing styles and the film’s color saturation, adds a nostalgic element to the image, reflecting beach-going experiences of a past era.","title":"Stewart beach, on the eastern end of Galveston island, one of the area's most popular summer playgrounds","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["547503","546794","551931","546874","546942","550243","547628","547482","550931","553685","550936","547491","550919","548541","553686","555923"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","swimsuit","sea","water","swimmer","lie","goer","soak","swimwear","yacht"]}
