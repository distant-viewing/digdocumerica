{"path":"557040.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals from behind, both wearing large-brimmed straw hats. The person on the left wears a green inner-brim hat, with a plaid shirt featuring a subtle flower pattern, and a large ponytail draped over their shoulder. The person on the right, whose hat has a yellowish-gold tint, is donning a sleeveless garment exhibiting bold, multicolored stripes. This figure holds what appears to be a red plastic cup with a white straw. Both hats have a textured pattern of natural straw braiding. The background is slightly blurred but appears to be an open outdoor setting under a bright, clear sky. The scene conveys a leisurely, communal mood, possibly suggesting an outdoor event or gathering. The focus and framing lend a sense of intimacy and shared experience between the two individuals.","title":"Young woman sips a soft drink while riding behind her friend on a horse at Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia. They were in town for the Flint Hills Rodeo and parade, a major cultural event of the area. Horses and large cattle trucks are the featured models of transportation. It is a 19th century \"cowboy\" town in the heart of the Kansas Flint Hills, and near an area designated as a possible site for a tall grass prairie national park.","placename":"Emporia (Kan.)","location":"Emporia, Kansas","nn1":["553709","553275","557042","547437","551028","544408","557043","558295","548565","557054","556528","554049","553178","558245","543864","551011"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["straw","hat","ponytail","brim","intimacy","garment","gold","tint","cup","person"]}
