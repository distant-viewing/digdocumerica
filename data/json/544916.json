{"path":"544916.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a young deer standing in a natural setting. The deer is positioned in the center of the image, looking over its shoulder with its head turned slightly toward the camera. Its fur appears light brown and slightly mottled, suggesting it might be a fawn growing into adult coloring. The animal's ears are perked up, indicating alertness.\n\nThe surrounding environment consists mainly of dry grass, typical of a meadow or open woodland area. There are patches of green bushes and trees in the background, contributing to a sense of a dense, somewhat arid forest. The lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, casting enough light to illuminate the scene without harsh shadows, enhancing the calmness of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a peaceful moment in nature, emphasizing the deer in its natural habitat with an undisturbed and serene background.","title":"Mule deer.
