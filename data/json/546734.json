{"path":"546734.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a densely packed highway during what appears to be peak traffic hours. It shows multiple lanes of cars, with traffic particularly congested on the side presumably heading into the city or a central area, as these vehicles are almost at a standstill. Conversely, the lanes on the opposite side show lighter traffic flow, indicating vehicles moving out of the city or area.\n\nThe highway is surrounded by lush greenery, with mature trees lining both sides of the road and a small park-like area visible near the bottom of the image. There's also an overpass or another highway ramp that curves over part of the scene, creating a layered effect with the roads.\n\nThis viewpoint is likely from a high-rise building or another elevated structure, providing a broad perspective over the highway and its surroundings. Overall, the photograph captures the busy nature of urban commuting and the infrastructure designed to handle a large volume of vehicles.","title":"Rush hour on the 14th street bridge joining Virginia and district","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546686","546725","546714","547780","546721","546711","546713","546681","548391","546608","547770","546583","546709","546603","546670","552719"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","lane","commuting","vehicle","ramp","volume","overpass","city","viewpoint"]}
