{"path":"543557.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a large, rectangular billboard positioned among a thick wooded area of coniferous trees. The board advertises 24 acres of commercial property available for sale or lease. The prominent text on the billboard reads \"FOR SALE or LEASE\" in white font on a faded blue-green background. Below this, there is additional text in pink font, stating \"24 ACRES Commercial Property\". The contact information provided at the bottom of the billboard belongs to a person named \"Samuel Taylor,\" with an address in San Francisco, California, and a phone number. The surroundings are lush with evergreen trees, and the billboard is partially shaded by the tree canopy, suggesting that the photo was taken in a secluded or possibly remote forested area. The scene captures a sunny day with some natural lighting illuminating parts of the billboard and creating a speckled shadow pattern across it.","title":"North shore development","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543556","543115","543100","548730","545049","557553","545263","554133","547648","543528","546425","549039","552988","556989","554123","554034"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["billboard","font","text","contact","trees","phone","address","belong","advertise","sale"]}
