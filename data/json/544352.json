{"path":"544352.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque natural setting featuring a waterfall and a stream. The waterfall, located in the upper left corner of the image, cascades down a rocky cliff surrounded by lush greenery, contributing to a tranquil and secluded ambiance. The water appears to fall into a calm river that flows gently through the centre of the frame, flanked by verdant banks.\n\nIn the foreground, two children are seen exploring the area. One child, in a light blue shirt and dark shorts, is stepping cautiously into the water, while the other, wearing a yellow shirt and dark shorts, stands on a rock just beside the water. Both seem engaged in their surroundings, possibly looking at something in the water or just enjoying the refreshing environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its rich natural colors and peaceful setting, evokes a sense of adventure and connection with nature. The image also conveys a moment of childhood curiosity and exploration in a beautifully wild landscape.","title":"Bathers enjoy the Havasu Falls.
