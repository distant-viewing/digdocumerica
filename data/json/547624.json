{"path":"547624.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image depicts a dramatic beach scene at sunset. The sky is saturated with deep shades of pink and purple, which cast a colorful glow over the entire scene. Two silhouetted figures, possibly a couple, are standing close together on the beach, facing the ocean. The sea itself has gentle waves, visible in the creeping surf, which contrasts slightly in darkness against the sand. The horizon is straight, dividing the vibrant sky from the darker sea. The overall mood of the image is serene and somewhat romantic, emphasized by the solitude and the striking color palette. The framing suggests it was taken with a wide-angle lens as it captures a broad swath of the beach and sky, adding a sense of vastness to the setting.","title":"The beach in moonlight","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547479","550288","557509","547496","548222","553989","554075","554074","542890","547492","552331","545194","545234","550296","543052","552335"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["beach","swath","sea","surf","saturate","lens","framing","darkness","divide","couple"]}
