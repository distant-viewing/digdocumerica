{"path":"549195.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, seemingly abandoned or unkempt two-story house with a rustic, eerie charm. The house is constructed with stone walls and features multiple roofs, all at different levels, suggestive of a complex architectural design. Noteworthy are the large, weathered wooden windows, many of which are framed by broad, dark wooden beams that contrast with the lighter stone walls. The house is surrounded by a lush, overgrown landscape with various types of dense vegetation including trees, shrubs, and grasses.\n\nForegrounding the house is a sprawling, wild meadow that enhances the sense of isolation and abandonment. The background is completed by a forested hill which slopes gently upwards, covered with dense greenery that suggest an untamed, rural environment. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of solitude and the natural reclamation of human-made structures by the environment, evoking a sense of timelessness and decay. The lighting and shadows in the image suggest it was taken in bright, natural daylight, contributing to the vividness of the greens and the clarity with which the house details are visible.","title":"This old farmhouse is threatened by plans for massive strip-mining in the powder river region","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555632","554822","552464","556999","554787","546989","552494","551330","545041","554823","552491","558110","557640","552455","554788","554799"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","reclamation","stone","timelessness","meadow","complete","wall","vividness","clarity","charm"]}
