{"path":"556607.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features an intimate and poignant portrait of two individuals: an adult male and a young female child, likely his daughter. The setting appears indoors, possibly within a home environment due to the wooden wall paneling in the background.\n\nThe adult male wears a rugged look, marked by his occupation-related attire. His hard hat, which is white with signs of wear and covered in dirt, is equipped with a helmet light, indicating he may work in mining or a similar field that requires such equipment. His face is also dirty, suggesting he has come directly from a labor-intensive job. He has a somber expression and gazes directly at the camera with an expression that mixes fatigue and resilience.\n\nThe young girl, positioned closely next to him, gazes slightly away from the camera with a neutral expression. Her long, blonde hair frames her face, and she wears a light-colored long-sleeve shirt featuring a cartoon character, adding a touch of innocence to the scene.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the child's relative cleanliness and youthful innocence with the man's work-worn appearance creates a striking and emotionally resonant image. This might be suggesting themes such as the contrasts between youth and adulthood, personal sacrifice, and familial bonds. The overall composition, lighting, and somber tones lend a dramatic and powerful aura to the photograph.","title":"Miner wayne gipson, 39, with his daughter tabitha, 3.
