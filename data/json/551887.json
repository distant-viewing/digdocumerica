{"path":"551887.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph is a vibrant scene inside a bustling indoor public space, which appears to be a subway station or a transit area, characterized by modern architectural elements typical of the 1970s or 1980s. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of muted brown and beige colors. The area is quite populated with people engaged in various activities, mainly focusing on the act of commuting or stopping at the various stalls and amenities offered within the space.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there’s a food stall labeled “Möhrmix Spaß Eis” which seems to specialize in ice cream and snacks, as indicated by the graphics on the stall. The stall is attended by a worker in a white uniform, and it shows a menu and promotional posters. Next to this stall, two cylindrical columns can be seen, wrapped in brown tiles that harmonize with the overall color scheme.\n\nIn the center and right side of the photograph, the composition captures some people mostly in motion. A woman to the right, standing still and looking away from the camera, is wearing a black coat over a green dress, her purse dangling from her forearm. The movement in the scene is rendered through a blur effect, notably on a passerby in the right foreground who is captured in a stride and appears blurred, imparting a sense of action and haste typical of such a transit environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggested by the muted lighting, the dominance of warm browns and beige in the color palette, along with the straight lines of ceiling lights, conveys the ambiance of the 70s or 80s public transit spaces. This setting provides a nostalgic reflection on everyday life during this time period, depicting a slice of urban routine where diverse activities and paths intersect in public transit areas.","title":"Underground stations include shops and restaurants as well as amusements, shower and washrooms, telephone and locker areas.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["556815","556825","551886","556680","556674","556679","551890","551893","556054","556821","556682","551879","549643","556648","556687","556819"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["stall","transit","80","menu","space","dominance","graphic","snack","purse","70"]}
