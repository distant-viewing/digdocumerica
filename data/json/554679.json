{"path":"554679.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene where two individuals are resting and engaging in leisurely activities beside a small stream in a wooded area. The environment is typical of a late autumn or early spring setting, indicated by the sparse vegetation and the leafless trees in the background.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a person is sitting on the ground, wearing a red and black plaid jacket and a matching hat, both suggesting a traditional outdoor or hunting style. This person appears relaxed, sitting with their legs crossed and hands in their lap, possibly enjoying the peaceful surroundings.\n\nOn the right, another individual is engaged in an activity, holding what looks like a line or a wire, potentially fixing or setting up some outdoor gear. This person is dressed in green pants and a light green shirt, with a brown hat that blends with the natural hues of the setting.\n\nThe background is wooded, mostly bare with thin, densely packed trees that suggest a natural, undisturbed location. The stream is narrow and meanders through the scene, adding a serene element to the setting. The presence of a few scattered objects, like a container and some gear, hints at a hiking or camping scenario.\n\nOverall, the composition and the casual attire of the individuals, combined with the natural surroundings, suggest a moment of leisure and connection with nature, possibly during a break in a hike or a camping trip.","title":"Hunters on opening day of the big game season in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at moose river plains.
