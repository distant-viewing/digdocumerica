{"path":"547164.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a male worker engaging in manual labor at what appears to be a shipyard or a docking facility. The worker is dressed in light-colored, possibly gray work attire smeared with dirt or grease, suggesting physical activity. He is bending over, handling a large, thick rope that is partially hanging over the edge of a steel structure, possibly a deck or the side of a ship. The environment around him includes heavy metal surfaces with visible rust and some standing water, reflecting an industrial maritime setting. There are circular mooring bollards nearby, which are used for securing ships at a dock. In the background, the inner wall of the dry dock or similar maritime infrastructure is visible, characterized by large metal plates and rivets, showing signs of wear and corrosion.\n\nThe mood conveyed by the scene is one of industriousness and possibly the rigorous daily routine of a worker in the shipping or dockyard industry. The image captures a moment that emphasizes hard work and the robust, often harsh environment of such industrial settings. The focus is on action and interaction with hefty maritime equipment in an ambiance that highlights the aging and maintenance of industrial maritime facilities.","title":"Calumet River--seaman in towing operation secures barges","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551046","547065","546841","552301","552148","548102","546016","549595","551955","549376","551040","546917","552272","549590","546861","552149"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["worker","ship","bollard","smear","industriousness","rivet","dock","corrosion","mooring","shipyard"]}
