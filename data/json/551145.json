{"path":"551145.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph displays a stark juxtaposition between a residential area and an industrial complex. In the foreground, there are rows of small, closely spaced single-family houses, typical of mid-20th century American suburbs. Each house has a pitched roof, and several have front porches. The homes are varied in color but maintain a uniform architectural style, indicative of the period and possibly the economic bracket of the residents.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features a large industrial facility marked by several towering chimneys emitting dark smoke, large storage tanks, and numerous interconnected buildings of varying sizes. This industrial plant dominates the backdrop and is set against a backdrop of densely wooded hills, which further accentuates the industrial activity. The smoke from the chimneys suggests ongoing production processes, likely involving heavy manufacturing or energy production.\n\nThe composition underlines the proximity of industrial activities to residential zones, likely highlighting themes such as economic dependence, environmental impact, and the blending of different land uses within a confined geographical area. This setting could be indicative of many post-industrial towns where the local economy is closely tied to one predominant industry.","title":"Smokestacks of the union carbide plant in south Charleston the residential section is close by","placename":"Charleston (W.
