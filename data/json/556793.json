{"path":"556793.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a city scene focused on a public bus and a passenger interacting with the bus driver. The bus, prominently marked with the number 4174 and route \"41-Piedmont Limited,\" is a classic design, featuring round headlights and a sizable, curved front windshield. The bus is painted in a light color with darker trim around parts of it, including the windshield.\n\nA man is seen from behind, entering the bus. He is wearing a light pink shirt and dark trousers, standing on the street while stepping onto the bus. Although the back of the bus blocks much of the man, his bent arm and the top of his head are visible as he prepares to hand something to the bus driver or communicate with him.\n\nThe background shows a typical urban setting with tree-lined streets and buildings that suggest a bustling city environment. There is a discernable building in the far background with large square windows, typical of mid to late 20th-century architecture. The scene conveys a moment of everyday city life, likely capturing the routine interactions between a bus driver and his passengers amidst the urban backdrop.","title":"Passengers board a metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) bus in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.  In 1974 the system carried 73,727,000 passengers, an increase of 27 percent since 1970.  Many of those new passengers were attracted for the first time.  The increase occurred for a number of reasons, including new buses, new routes, night service, fringe parking, 100-passenger waiting shelters and a decrease in the fare from 40 to 50 cents.
