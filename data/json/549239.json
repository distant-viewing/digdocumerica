{"path":"549239.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph displays a silhouette of two large, heavy construction vehicles against a soft, light sky. The vehicles are positioned on an elevated mound, outlined sharply against the light backdrop. The first vehicle on the left appears to be equipped with a large, curved protective frame possibly suggesting it is a loader or another type of heavy-duty equipment designed for rugged tasks. The second vehicle, right of the first, shows a similar profile with a slightly different build, potentially another type of heavy construction or earth-moving equipment. The sky in the background has a gradient of light grayish-blue tones, providing a serene contrast to the dark, bold shapes of the machinery. The overall composition emphasizes the machinery's robustness and the industrial nature of the scene, set against the backdrop of a calm sky.","title":"Construction equipment at the site of the new railroad which will transport coal from the Westmoreland Coal Company.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555608","549203","547583","556506","544164","555631","554837","542538","554809","547922","543105","545662","555638","545677","549956","547232"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["vehicle","loader","machinery","type","build","construction","equipment","duty","profile","mound"]}
