{"path":"543972.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph features a large, multi-tiered riverboat docked near the shore of a wide river. The boat is an old-fashioned paddle steamer, a type traditionally used on American rivers, evident from its multiple decks, large rear paddle wheel, and tall smokestacks. It is decorated with flags and has the name \"Admiral\" prominently displayed above the top deck. The boat appears bustling with activity, perhaps with passengers on board suggesting a tour or cruise function.\n\nThe setting includes a calm river with a gentle reflection of the sky and the boat. In the background, there's a long railroad bridge stretching across the river, enhancing the riverine industrial ambiance of the scene. The skies above are partly cloudy, diffusing the sunlight and creating a moody, soft lighting that casts the boat and surroundings in silhouette. This atmospheric condition contributes a serene yet dramatic tone to the image. The horizon is mostly flat, with minimal structures or vegetation visible, drawing focus mainly to the boat and the expansive sky.","title":"Steamboat on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["545917","543954","543967","543963","543962","549509","545921","543971","554658","545736","543959","543964","543966","543955","554657","553815"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","paddle","river","deck","cruise","riverboat","tour","railroad","board","function"]}
