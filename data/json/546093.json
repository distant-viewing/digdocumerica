{"path":"546093.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid outdoor scene featuring two individuals and a car, suggesting an adventurous or hunting theme. A man stands beside the open driver-side door of a classic station wagon, his expression relaxed and contemplative. He is dressed in a patterned casual shirt, and the setting sun casts a warm glow on his face.\n\nInside the car, visible through the open window, is a woman with sunglasses, seated at the steering wheel. She is reading or looking at a camera, her demeanor cheerful and engaged. The car's interior is shown in some detail, including its steering wheel and dashboard.\n\nAtop the car is a collection of animal carcasses and antlers, hinting at a successful hunting trip. These include what appears to be deer and other small game, arranged somewhat haphazardly.\n\nThe setting features bright, clear skies with no visible clouds, and suburban elements in the background including low buildings and utility poles. The location suggests a service station or a similar stopover point, indicated by the architectural structures around.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a glimpse into a moment of leisure or sport, characterized by outdoor adventure and the camaraderie of the two individuals. The focus on the car and its load, along with the expressions and activities of the people, conveys a narrative of travel and sporting achievement.","title":"The first deer casualty of the hunting season is tied to top of autoMobile.
