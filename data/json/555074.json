{"path":"555074.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a lush, detailed scene of a mossy rock face with a small, delicate waterfall. The rock surface appears slick and is predominantly covered in mosses that range in color from bright green to shades of dark green and brown. Small branches and leaves, with different textures and shades of green, are interspersed throughout the moss, adding depth and diversity to the landscape.\n\nThe waterfall is thin and meandering, cascading gently over the rock surface, and creating a translucency effect against the dark, wet rocks. The water's flow creates a contrasting element to the still, dense greenery.\n\nThe overall lighting in the image suggests a shaded environment, possibly a forest or mountain area with filtered sunlight occasionally reaching the waterfall and the moss-covered rocks. The image captures a sense of tranquility and secluded natural beauty, emphasizing textures and the interplay of light and moisture.","title":"Water streaming down rock in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545839","555073","555210","554408","558087","545878","546180","543869","554409","554113","557820","550843","555220","543172","545874","542594"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["waterfall","moss","rock","mossy","dark","moisture","diversity","shade","texture","flow"]}
