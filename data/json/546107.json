{"path":"546107.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene primarily focusing on a large complex, most likely some type of refinery or chemical plant. The plant is characterized by numerous metal structures, pipes, tanks, and industrial apparatus, including large square and cylindrical forms that suggest distillation or storage functions. There are multiple tall smokestacks emitting light colored smoke against a hazy sky.\n\nThe foreground shows blurred motion, likely from fast-moving vehicles on a road or highway adjacent to the plant, indicating the image was captured from a nearby location and possibly emphasizing the hustle of daily life around the industrial area.\n\nThe colors in the image seem to be overcast with a palette of muted browns, oranges, and grays contributing to a somewhat grim or polluted atmosphere. The overall clarity of the photograph is slightly grainy, adding a vintage or archival quality to the image. The plant functions amid a dense array of infrastructure, enveloped in an air that appears heavy, possibly with pollution given the color of the sky and the emissions from the stacks.","title":"Olin-mathieson plant emits sulphur fumes","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["549713","546143","544700","546108","544691","549967","550328","557214","545992","547010","557225","551026","551034","545920","542999","550917"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","function","distillation","emitting","refinery","overcast","orang","envelo","hustle","square"]}
