{"path":"545183.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vast, muddy tidal flat at low tide. The ground is predominantly wet, dark mud, interspersed with numerous shell fragments scattered across the surface. These shells, primarily oyster shells, appear bleached or pale, creating a contrast against the dark mud.\n\nIn the distance, the tidal waters can be seen receding towards the horizon, under a cloudy sky that covers most of the upper frame of the image. The clouds are gray and white, suggesting overcast weather conditions. The horizon is faint, with a hint of land or another part of the tidal shoreline visible in the far distance. There doesn't appear to be any human activity or wildlife; the focus is entirely on the natural landscape.\n\nThe lighting in the photo hints at either early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows are not very harsh and the light has a soft quality to it. The overall mood of the image is serene yet somewhat desolate, highlighting the natural beauty and expanse of the tidal flat environment.","title":"Oyster beds","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545095","552236","552147","544729","544687","547663","545294","542869","552145","548603","555396","545224","555400","555394","553856","544530"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["shell","mud","oyster","tide","fragment","hint","horizon","wildlife","distance","shoreline"]}
