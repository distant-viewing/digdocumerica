{"path":"552620.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a snowy scene, predominantly featuring a police officer standing next to a \"STOP for Children in Crosswalk\" sign. The officer, occupying the left side of the frame, is silhouetted against the wintry backdrop, his posture and attitude reflecting attentiveness and duty. He appears dressed in a typical policeman's uniform, complete with a peaked cap and badge visible even in silhouette. His right hand holds the sign, and his stance implicates readiness and vigilance.\n\nThe sign itself is bright red with white lettering, providing a strong visual contrast to the dusky, blue-hued background of snow and twilight. The background features a large brick building, resembling a school, which further contextualizes the setting as an educational or child-centered environment. The building, located across a wide expanse of snow-covered ground, looks sturdy with a wide central entry adorned with steps and symmetrically placed windows.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image, assisted by what appears to be either dawn or dusk light, evokes a cold yet vigilant mood, emphasizing responsibility and community safety concerning children crossing the street in snowy conditions. The composition, with its blend of somber tones and sharp contrasts, effectively narrates a story of daily life and public service in a wintry environment.","title":"Patrolman Mark Shearer puts up school crossing signs at daybreak.
