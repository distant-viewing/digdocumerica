{"path":"549198.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with an older man and several horses. The man is prominently featured on the right side of the image, facing to the left and slightly away from the camera. He is leaning on a sturdy wooden fence and wearing a weathered cowboy hat, a denim jacket, and spectacles. His attire and posture evoke a sense of experienced familiarity with the rustic environment.\n\nIn the background, there are three horses inside a spacious paddock. The horses are various shades of brown and are engaged in grazing or looking around the area. The enclosure is made of wooden fences and the paddock includes a wooden gate structure visible in the upper middle part of the background. The environment is overcast, with a diffused, soft light that suggests it might be a cloudy day. The terrain is flat with an open grassy field stretching into the distance, bordered by what appears to be more fencing.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene, everyday moment in a country setting, emphasizing themes of rural life and the connection between the man and the horses.","title":"Bud redding, rancher, settled on the sarpy basin land in 1916 he and his son have refused to sell to the westmoreland coal company","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["552562","553114","553118","554011","552564","543779","552565","543776","554885","552501","543787","542622","552677","556958","546068","544420"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","fence","familiarity","grazing","spectacle","bordere","country","enclosure","gate","sturdy"]}
