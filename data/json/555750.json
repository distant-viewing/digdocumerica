{"path":"555750.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a gritty urban scene featuring a heavily graffitied structure standing on a waterfront. The structure, a robust pier or concrete block, has its visible surfaces covered in multiple layers of graffiti. Various names, phrases, and dates can be seen in different styles and colors of spray paint, indicating frequent visits and markings by individuals. One notable graffiti states “THE PIRATES.” \n\nThe water in the foreground reflects sunlight, creating a speckled pattern of light on the surface which adds a shimmering texture to the lower section of the image. Behind the structure, an urban landscape can be seen, including what appears to be a railroad track on which multiple train cars are visible. The train cars have a blue and silver color scheme. Beyond the railroad, a layer of greenery and trees partially obscures the view of a multi-story building in the background, suggesting this scene could be near the edge of an urban area. The overall lighting in the photo suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening, evoking a slightly moody atmosphere.","title":"On the Harlem River showing the Bronx in New York City. The problem of how to move people and goods is ultimately bound up with the quality of life everywhere. The lands adjacent to the bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have direct impact upon the environment of the coastal waters. The New York, New Jersey metropolitan region is one of the most congested in the world.","placename":"Bronx (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Bronx, New York","nn1":["555731","548375","547622","547575","547581","547572","549303","549300","548105","547893","551985","547585","543408","551978","547582","547594"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["railroad","train","phrase","visit","layer","graffiti","scheme","marking","spray","date"]}
