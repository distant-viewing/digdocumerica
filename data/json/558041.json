{"path":"558041.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image features a dark-toned, stately monument captured in a serene outdoor setting. The monument is a vertical structure consisting of a base, a central pedestal, and a top section that may be a capstone or additional decorative monument element. The central pedestal has engraved plates with text that appears commemorative, including names and possibly dates, indicating its purpose as a memorial or dedication monument. The uppermost plate includes the easily legible words \"BOSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT.\" This suggests that the structure honors members or aspects of that service.\n\nThe background shows a lush, grassy area with mature trees, adding to the solemn, reflective nature of the setting. The soft, diffuse lighting and greenery suggest it could be early morning or a cloudy day. The scene is devoid of people, emphasizing the monument's imposing presence and the quiet atmosphere typical of memorial sites. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the solemn monument amidst a natural landscape, conveys a sense of reverence and remembrance.","title":"Memorial to Civil War veterans from the area stands in the cemetery in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
