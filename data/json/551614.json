{"path":"551614.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph is a microscopic image displaying a micro-organism or a close-up section of a biological specimen with a fibrous structure. The primary feature in the image is a symmetrical formation resembling a fern, with a central axis from which numerous branches extend on either side. Each branch appears lined or filled with smaller, grain-like or cellular structures, indicating it may be a close-up of a part of a plant, possibly a leaf or another type of vegetative organ, or perhaps even animal tissue at cellular level.\n\nThe branches are colored in shades of dark pink and purple, while the main axis has a translucent pink hue. The background is uniformly light pink, enhancing the contrast and detail of the main structure. The image likely utilizes staining techniques commonly used in microscopy to highlight specific features of the specimen, aiding in the visualization and study of its structures.","title":"The epithelium (gill covering) of a healthy channel catfish camera microscope study made at the national water quality laboratory.
