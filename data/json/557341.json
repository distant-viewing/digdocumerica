{"path":"557341.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban landscape framed against a backdrop of distant snow-capped mountains. The foreground is dominated by an array of electrical poles and wiring, projecting a sense of clutter against the openness of the sky and the mountains beyond. Below the complex network of wires, the middle ground is filled with multiple layers of infrastructure and buildings, including a prominent large warehouse or factory building. Various billboards with advertisements add to the urban commercial vibe, with one prominently displaying the logo for \"King's\" and another for \"McDonald's Vacuum Cleaner Sales and Service.\"\n\nFurther enriching the scene are numerous parked cars, suggesting a busy industrial or commercial area. The cars appear to be from the 1970s or 1980s, indicated by their boxy shapes and the styles typical of those decades. The overall color palette is a mixture of muted urban tones with splashes of color from the billboards, set against the natural blues and whites of the mountainous skyline, adding a contrasting natural element to the industrialized setting.","title":"View of Colorado's front range beyond urban and industrial sprawl","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557340","543714","545382","553721","544791","543961","548326","550149","550143","557224","550203","546866","544793","550167","557431","549638"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["billboard","clutter","mountain","enrich","openness","advertisement","warehouse","project","decade","car"]}
