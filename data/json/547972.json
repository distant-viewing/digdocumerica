{"path":"547972.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of children and a few adults gathered outside a portable building, which is being used as an educational facility. The sign on the building reads \"Brookdale Community College Sandy Hook Environmental Education Center.\" The building is white, rectangular and utilitarian in appearance, with at least three visible windows and a double stairway leading to an open door.\n\nThe children, who are of various ages, are mostly facing away from the camera, focusing their attention towards the adults and the building. The kids are dressed in typical casual attire from what might be the late 20th century, including T-shirts, shorts, and jeans. The vibe is informal and lively, suggesting a field trip or educational outing. Some children are carrying bags, which could contain lunches or educational materials.\n\nThere is also an assortment of bins and equipment on a table near the stairs, which might be used for educational demonstrations or activities. The background features a bright blue sky and sparse greenery, indicating a warm, sunny day. The area around the building is a simple dirt ground, reinforcing the temporary and functional purpose of the setup.","title":"Sandy hook school children line up outside marine biology laboratory at the spermacetti cove nature center","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["546449","557171","546453","546522","556265","553096","547751","544806","558205","550648","557943","549626","546821","551761","545311","544829"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["child","adult","stairway","kid","lunch","building","demonstration","bin","stair","trip"]}
