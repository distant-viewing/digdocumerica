{"path":"543421.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph shows a rugged and textured rock formation, shot from a low angle looking upwards towards the sky. The rocks have a variety of colors, mainly shades of brown and beige, with some parts darkened by shadows. The surface of the rocks is highly irregular, featuring cracks, crevices, and various sediment layers, making the rocks appear jagged and sharp.\n\nA clear blue sky can be seen in the upper background, contrasting starkly with the dark and rough texture of the rocks. The composition emphasizes the natural erosion and geological forms of the rock, suggesting a rugged outdoor environment, possibly in a mountainous or desert area. The lighting of the photograph highlights the contours and the intricacies of the rock surface, suggesting that the photo might have been taken during a time of day when the sun accentuates these details. There are no people or man-made objects visible, focusing solely on the natural geological formations.","title":"California -- rocks at Point Lobos, south of Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["552685","552890","552546","555047","545804","544363","554410","552444","545589","545795","552445","550428","545805","555084","550474","544907"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["rock","formation","intricacy","crack","crevice","sediment","contour","erosion","desert","surface"]}
