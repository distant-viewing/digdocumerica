{"path":"550747.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph portrays a lively urban scene, likely captured at a public plaza or a park in a city. The central feature of the image is a large, cascading fountain with multiple tiers, which spouts water along its stepped layers into a sizable, rectangular pool at the base. The surface of the water appears to shimmer under the light, suggesting it might be a sunny day.\n\nSurrounding the fountain, numerous people are visible. They are primarily seated along the edges of the fountain and appear to be enjoying the day, engaging in casual conversation or simply relaxing in the urban setting. The individuals are diverse in terms of age and clothing styles, indicating a public, accessible place likely frequented by both locals and visitors. \n\nThe background of the photograph features a mix of architectural styles. Several tall buildings define the skyline, including a prominent high-rise that dominates the background. This building's modern, boxy architecture contrasts with some smaller, older-looking buildings located to one side of the square. A series of street lamps are visible, punctuating the plaza perimeter and adding to the urban atmosphere. Also, parts of a tree branch are seen in the top right corner, framing the image softly and introducing a natural element against the urban backdrop.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of city life, focusing on the interaction between people and public spaces in an urban environment, enhanced by elements of modern architecture and natural details like water and trees.","title":"City Hall Plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551647","551772","551661","551663","557258","550752","551449","557282","552726","553289","550762","553224","552703","552705","551792","557261"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","plaza","local","frequent","tier","perimeter","introduce","architecture","square","city"]}
