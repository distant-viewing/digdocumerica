{"path":"552259.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant view of the Port of Seattle. The scene is dominated by several towering red cranes, which are clearly marked with \"Port of Seattle\" on their sides. These cranes, used for loading and unloading cargo, feature prominently in the foreground and midground, with their bold red structures and complex framework standing out against the background.\n\nThe backdrop of the image showcases the Seattle city skyline under a partly cloudy sky. Tall buildings, including possible office towers, form a striking cityscape. The water in front of the skyline features a busy maritime scene with a few vessels visible. Notably, there's a barge loaded with a large, shining heap of scrap metal or similar materials, being towed by a tugboat. Additionally, various containers and maritime equipment lie scattered around the dock area in the foreground, hinting at the bustling activity typical of a major port.\n\nOverall, the composition beautifully juxtaposes industrial prowess in the form of giant cranes with urban development, represented by the city skyline, within a dynamic waterfront setting.","title":"Port of Seattle freight handling equipment and city skyline frames industrial waste barge under tow to landfill on the snohomish river estuary","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552266","552267","555760","551577","555283","555270","555271","549305","555285","547998","552013","546828","555766","555261","550915","550910"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["crane","skyline","shine","tow","bold","not","unloading","tugboat","city","scrap"]}
