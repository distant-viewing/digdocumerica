{"path":"547029.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of a surface, which appears heavily textured and is drenched in water, with multiple droplets visible across it. Dominating the center of the frame is a dark, circular object that resembles a loop or ring, potentially made of metal, and it has a smaller circular opening within it. This structure may be a part of some machinery or hardware, perhaps something like an old-fashioned ring for securing a rope or chain. A key feature of the image is the light reflecting off the various water droplets, creating a sparkling effect across the surface, which looks like it might be wood or another organic material based on the texture. The photograph has a very dark and moody tone, further pronounced by the ambient lighting that enhances the minute details and textures of the surface and the droplets.","title":"Ice covered cement pipe","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546932","545850","554016","546907","544716","556361","553901","543931","547037","555032","546888","543564","553180","546789","542990","555184"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["droplet","ring","minute","hardware","loop","pronounce","surface","sparkling","secure","opening"]}
