{"path":"545370.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a vintage bus with the signage \"Sixth Avenue Baptist Church.\" The bus is white with a light brown band running along the side. Text on the bus also includes messages promoting civic engagement, such as \"Be sure to vote.\" The setting appears to be a residential area with trees and a well-maintained lawn visible in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, two African American individuals—a woman and a man—are seen interacting near the front door of the bus. The woman, dressed in a light cardigan over a patterned dress and wearing glasses, is on the left side facing the bus, while the man, wearing a dark shirt, appears to be assisting or guiding her onto the bus. The atmosphere suggests a day of either community gathering or transport related to church activities. The bus itself is presumably used for transporting members of the church community, evident from its dedicated signage.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of community involvement and the use of resources, like the bus, for fostering collective activities and civic participation within this church community.","title":"Bus provided by Rev.
