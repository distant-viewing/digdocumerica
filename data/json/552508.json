{"path":"552508.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene residential setting featuring a small, well-maintained mobile home. The home is primarily silver in color with white trimmings and has a large window with a white decorative frame in its center front. A white, latticed screen door is visible, along with steps leading up to the main entrance.\n\nIn front of the mobile home is a manicured lawn that displays a small, ornate white fence surrounding a rectangular flowerbed. The flowerbed is meticulously arranged with a variety of colorful flowers and a few small bushes, creating a vibrant and inviting garden space. A neatly laid concrete pathway leads to the steps of the home.\n\nThe surroundings include a mature tree positioned to the left of the frame, partially obscuring another dwelling in the background. The sky above is clear and predominantly blue, showing some wispy clouds, hinting at good weather. Additionally, the environment includes a few other residential structures in the distance, though they are mostly obscured by foliage and the angle of the view. A distinctive antenna towers over the home, perhaps for television reception.\n\nThe ambiance of this photograph suggests a peaceful, suburban community, possibly in a rural or semi-rural environment, dedicated to personal housing and garden pride.","title":"Trailer home in Bluff City","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["548460","558299","544149","558300","558296","556455","556417","544633","548295","556476","556472","548762","557339","556468","552482","551164"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["home","flowerbed","step","garden","trimming","television","dwelling","screen","pride","antenna"]}
