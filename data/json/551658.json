{"path":"551658.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of leisure in an urban setting. It features four individuals sitting on the edge of a large rectangular fountain. From left to right, there is a young man in a dark suit and tie, and three older women. The women are dressed in day dresses; their styles and floral patterns suggesting a relaxed, daytime occasion. One of them holds a small purse.\n\nBehind them, large water jets create an active and lively backdrop, the fountain's spray adding a dynamic element to the scene. The fountain itself has a wide basin, evident from the cascading water creating a white, frothy effect as it hits the reservoir.\n\nThe background features imposing modern architecture: tall buildings characterized by a dense arrangement of vertical lines that create a rhythmical, geometric pattern. One of the buildings prominently displays the \"Exxon\" logo, identifying the location as near a corporate area or plaza influenced by mid-20th-century architectural styles, likely dating the photo to the post-war era.\n\nThe whole setting evokes a sense of everyday city life, with individuals finding a moment of repose amidst the structured, corporate environment. The scene is framed in a way that emphasizes both the solitude and community in shared public spaces.","title":"Rockefeller Center--6th Avenue side--a green, cool resting place for passersby.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551858","551663","551449","550747","553224","557258","553207","553214","551647","551772","551480","551793","549982","551642","553185","551661"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","reservoir","purse","basin","jet","occasion","plaza","spray","pattern","woman"]}
