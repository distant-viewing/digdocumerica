A person, likely a scientist or a lab technician, is intensely focused on their task. They are dressed in a white lab coat, suggesting a professional setting. This individual is standing at a laboratory bench where numerous petri dishes are laid out in an organized array. Each petri dish appears to contain biological samples or cultures.\n\nThe person is engaged in handling these dishes, possibly examining them or preparing them for incubation or analysis. Their left hand reaches for a dish, while their gaze is fixed attentively on the task at hand.\n\nThe laboratory is equipped with various scientific apparatus and equipment. On the bench and shelves behind the scientist, there are bottles likely containing chemicals or reagents, and other lab essentials like test tubes and glassware. Notably, there is a piece of equipment mounted high on a shelf, perhaps a filtering system or some form of extractor, indicative of the types of experiments or procedures that might be conducted in this space.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a moment of scientific research and investigation, highlighting meticulous work and the organized environment typical of a laboratory.","title":"Dragica Fuks studies bacteriological cultures at the Rovenj branch of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute.
