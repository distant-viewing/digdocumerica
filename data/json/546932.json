{"path":"546932.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a close-up view of what appears to be a large, dark-toned, textured mechanical or industrial component. The object's surface is wet and reflective, possibly suggesting recent exposure to water or some kind of lubricant, giving it a shiny appearance. The prominent texture on the structure looks similar to the threads of a screw or the ridges on a large gear, hinting at a mechanical function.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a low and close angle, emphasizing the towering size of the equipment. In the background, elements of an industrial setting are visible including metal struts and beams typical of factory or warehouse infrastructure. There's minimal natural light, implying an indoor setting possibly under artificial illumination that casts a slight purple tint in areas of the image. The image exudes a gritty and robust industrial atmosphere, focusing on the textures and forms of the machinery rather than its function, leaving its exact purpose ambiguous to the viewer.","title":"Unloading wire from a ship docked at the Port Covington terminal in the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["556388","543121","546888","547029","556389","543997","557387","546757","556321","549125","547964","555325","542545","558365","543158","543258"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["function","thread","tint","illumination","kind","ridge","warehouse","texture","exposure","component"]}
