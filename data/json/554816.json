{"path":"554816.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape dominated by a large strip mining operation. The terrain shows extensive excavation with deep furrows and mounds of displaced earth, highlighting the environmental impact of mining activities. This bare, rocky terrain stretches across the midground and into the background of the image.\n\nIn the foreground, rocky debris and soil create uneven terrain, indicative of recent mining or excavation activity. The middle ground features a grassy area leading to a small white house with a dark roof, nestled at the base of the excavated hills. This house appears isolated amid the surrounding desolation, with a small outbuilding visible nearby. Some trees, mostly barren of leaves which suggests it might be autumn or winter, are scattered around the house and along the edges of the mining site.\n\nThe background consists of more mounds of earth and exposed rock, all forming part of the same mining operation that characterizes the scene. The color palette is muted, with grays, browns, and dull greens dominating, giving a somber overtone to the landscape.\n\nOverall, the image presents a stark contrast between rural life and industrial activities, encapsulating the intrusive and expansive nature of human impact on the environment.","title":"Abandoned farmhouse surrounded by stripped land, off Route 100, near Morristown, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["554769","555604","543857","554829","554815","554808","549167","549177","545529","549243","554768","543836","554836","549148","553051","549174"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","mound","excavation","dominating","terrain","earth","outbuilding","house","impact","operation"]}
