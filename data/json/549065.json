{"path":"549065.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral and somewhat industrial scene. In the foreground, a large volume of water forcefully exits a rectangular, concrete culvert into a broader, calm body of water, creating a dynamic swirl of white foam on the surface. To the right of the water stream, a person stands on the grassy bank that delineates one side of the water channel. This individual appears to be observing the water, standing upright and might be wearing casual clothing suitable for an outdoor setting.\n\nThe far bank of the channel is similarly grassy and extends into the background where the landscape gradually flatties out into an expansive plain. In the distant background, rolling hills or low mountains outline the horizon under a clear, bright blue sky.\n\nThe overall composition gives the impression of a controlled water irrigation or drainage system in a primarily agricultural or rural setting. The vast, unobstructed sky suggests openness and the low-lying terrain implies that this area could be used for farming or similar activities, relying on such water management systems.","title":"Irrigation canal on the Colorado River Indian Reservation","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549064","547952","548871","549078","548309","555550","553380","547238","544734","549304","543670","546868","553083","548061","543830","545164"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["channel","water","system","bank","drainage","plain","irrigation","swirl","volume","openness"]}
