{"path":"554082.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a beautiful and peaceful view overlooking a coastal scene. The foreground prominently features rich, vibrant red flowers amid lush green foliage, which adds a burst of color and a sense of depth to the image. Slightly blurred, these flowers lead the eye towards the serene bay visible in the middle distance.\n\nThe bay itself is encompassed by a gentle coastline that curves subtly around the calm, blue waters. A few white waves gently crash onto the shore, suggesting a quiet and gentle sea. This part of the photograph captures an expansive view of the water and hints at a small beach nestled in a crescent shape at the edge of the land.\n\nFurther away, there are cliffs or steep shores covered with dense, dark green vegetation that frames the bay, enhancing the natural and untouched feel of the scene. The hills or mountains in the distance are less distinct, shrouded in a light mist or haze, possibly indicating humidity or the early signs of evening.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its natural framing, the interplay of vivid colors in the foreground, and the sprawling seascape, creates a tranquil and picturesque setting. This image is likely taken from an elevated viewpoint, possibly a hillside, which provides a panoramic view of the coastal landscape.","title":"Honomanu bay lies in a conservation district of the island","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554081","542968","547592","543066","553805","543401","543196","543404","543184","543346","542917","543299","545101","542870","554102","543363"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bay","humidity","shore","flower","burst","encompass","seascape","crash","shroud","overlook"]}
