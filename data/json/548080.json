{"path":"548080.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows two small boats on a body of water that has a sparkling surface, indicating it is a sunny day. The first boat on the left is white and appears to have three people aboard; they are seated and wearing casual clothing, possibly engaged in a leisure activity like fishing or touring. It is a motorboat with a windshield and an outboard engine.\n\nThe second boat on the right is also a small motorboat, colored green and beige, with three individuals aboard who seem to be actively engaged in an activity, possibly fishing, as one person appears to be handling equipment at the back of the boat. Like the first boat, it also has an outboard motor.\n\nThe water shimmers with the reflections of the sunlight, enhancing a sense of calm yet vibrant outdoor activity. The overall setting seems serene and recreational, with no visible land or other objects in the immediate vicinity, suggesting an open water area possibly used for fishing or boating excursions.","title":"Salmon fishing on the Willamette River at Oregon City fishing is good in part because of the success of Crown-Zellerbach Corporation and Publisher's Paper Company, both based here, in cleaning up this stretch of river.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552316","548736","552050","558234","550841","548525","548054","543942","549417","546976","546317","555718","551310","544021","555785","549411"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","motorboat","fishing","excursion","windshield","motor","boating","shimmer","engine","vicinity"]}
