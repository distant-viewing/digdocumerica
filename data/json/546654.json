{"path":"546654.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a city street where a police officer is interacting with the driver of a parked car. The officer, dressed in a light blue shirt and dark pants with a police cap, is standing near the front of the white car, facing toward the driver. The driver appears to be looking up at the officer from the car’s open window.\n\nThe car is an older model, notably indicated by the design and chrome accents. On the side of the car, near the windshield, there’s a decal that reads \"Southeastern University,\" which suggests the car may be related to the institution, either as part of its fleet or belonging to a student or staff member.\n\nIn the foreground, the police officer's back is mostly to the camera, with his right side slightly visible, displaying his badge and radio attached to his belt. The driver is partially visible through the car's windshield and side window, appearing engaged in conversation with the officer.\n\nThe streetscape includes other cars parked and moving in the distance, under an overcast sky, suggesting a typical busy urban setting. The scene implies an interaction typical of traffic or parking enforcement but retains an air of calm communication. The overall mood is one of everyday urban life, captured candidly.","title":"Officer warns driver that his exhaust is emitting too much smoke","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546611","546663","546661","546647","546657","546637","546631","557841","546634","551941","546633","546635","557868","557872","555461","557865"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","driver","car","police","windshield","decal","streetscape","enforcement","institution","radio"]}
