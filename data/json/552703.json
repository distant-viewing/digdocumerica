{"path":"552703.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a public urban water structure, which appears to be a fountain or a series of waterfalls integrated into a concrete and stone architectural design. The scene is bustling with activity, mainly involving people engaging with the water.\n\nIn the image, multiple people, including children and young adults, are seen enjoying the water on a sunny day. They are scattered at various levels of the structure. Some are sitting or standing on the edges, with their feet dipped into the water, while others are more actively interacting with the cascading waterfalls.\n\nThe water originates from a variety of openings and flows down in steps and falls, creating a dynamic visual of moving water across the structured environment. The design elements of the architecture feature geometrically patterned railings and urn-like structures which add to the aesthetic appeal.\n\nIn the background, dense green trees hint at an urban park setting. The attire of the people, which includes swimsuits and summer clothing, suggests that this photograph was taken during warm weather, emphasizing an informal and recreational atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is rich in detail, capturing both the social and physical elements of a communal space designed for both beauty and public enjoyment.","title":"Cooling off in one of the fountains around the Philadelphia museum of art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550747","550752","552706","550762","557258","552737","551647","551667","551772","549982","557268","544342","551449","551638","550002","551661"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["waterfall","water","originate","visual","design","dip","swimsuit","people","fountain","appeal"]}
