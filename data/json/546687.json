{"path":"546687.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view from inside a helicopter, emphasizing a bustling urban landscape focused on a complex highway interchange. The picture is taken from the perspective of an observer sitting behind the pilot, whose head and shoulders occupy the right foreground. The pilot is wearing a headset and is looking towards the sprawling highway network.\n\nThe helicopterâ€™s interior, particularly the cockpit controls and the frame of the helicopter window, are visible at the lower part of the image, framing the view. This aspect provides context about the vantage point from where the photo was taken.\n\nThe highway system depicted in the image is intricate, with multiple lanes, overpasses, and ramps facilitating varied traffic flow directions. There are several vehicles on the roads, which appear to be flowing smoothly. The landscape around the highways features green areas, and the background shows a mix of residential and industrial areas with buildings spread out into the distance. The overall feeling is of a developed, densely organized urban space, viewed from a height that provides a comprehensive oversight of the area's infrastructure and layout.","title":"New traffic \"mixing bowl\" (near Pentagon), looking west","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["552374","546709","547765","553015","553001","553838","548332","547770","552719","547780","546617","547762","544642","546726","549478","546686"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["helicopter","highway","pilot","oversight","interchange","cockpit","flow","ramp","observer","overpass"]}
