{"path":"547059.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph shows a scene at a residential property. In the foreground, the ground appears to be uneven and muddy, with scattered bits of debris. The scene is framed through the slightly out-of-focus bars of a metal gate.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a small, fluffy, white dog standing and staring toward the camera. The dog has a shaggy coat and its tongue slightly out, adding an endearing quality to its appearance.\n\nThe background of the image features the entrance to a home. There is a storm door slightly ajar with a red and black \"BEWARE of DOG\" sign prominently displayed. The door opens onto an exterior landing of a wooden structure, likely a porch or a stoop, that shows signs of weathering. The siding of the house is light colored, possibly grey or faded white, contributing to a rustic or aged look.\n\nOverall, the contrast between the small, harmless-looking dog and the warning sign adds a humorous or ironic touch to the scene, juxtaposing the dog's innocent appearance with the typical connotation of a \"Beware of Dog\" sign. The image captures a moment of simple, everyday life with a touch of visual storytelling.","title":"Beach front home on Lake Michigan in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["543031","547767","553481","548121","557637","552674","555581","543261","554126","551000","546992","557676","554935","553089","544210","543780"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["dog","sign","stare","stoop","door","landing","touch","gate","warning","appearance"]}
