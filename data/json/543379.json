{"path":"543379.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of outdoor activity, presumably hiking or backpacking, in a rugged and natural landscape. The central focus is on a group of three people gathered around a trail signpost. The signpost, made of wood, has multiple signs attached; one reads \"TRAIL NO. 3104 CRYSTAL LAKE 2\" and another indicates a distance to \"Sawtooth Pass.\" Additional handwritten notes on cardboard are also attached, suggesting directions or distances to other locations like \"Monarch Lake\" and \"Crystal Lake.\"\n\nThe people in the image are equipped for a hiking expedition. The person on the right is dressed in a uniform featuring a badge, suggesting they might be a park ranger or a guide. This individual is kneeling, seemingly examining or perhaps repairing gear. To the left of the image, another individual is standing, looking on with a backpack strapped on, indicating preparation for a trek. The clothing and gear suggest a setting that is not recent, likely from a previous decade, given the style of the backpacks and attire.\n\nThe setting around them is mountainous and sparsely vegetated, with rocky terrain visible in the background under a clear, bright sky. This environment conveys a sense of remote wilderness, ideal for hiking and exploration.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction around the trail sign and the visibly loaded backpacks, effectively portrays a moment of preparation and perhaps decision-making in a wilderness hiking situation.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
