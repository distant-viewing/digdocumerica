{"path":"547546.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, somewhat ethereal landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The dominant feature is a large, leafless tree standing prominently in the foreground. Its intricate branches spread out against the backdrop of a softly illuminated sky. \n\nThe lighting creates a silhouette effect for the tree, emphasizing its detailed structure against a faint, glowing light that could either be from the sun low on the horizon or a diffused light filtered through mist or fog.\n\nThe ground around the tree is covered in tall grass, giving a sense of an overgrown, wild field. The grass has a shimmering golden-brown color, likely highlighted by the same ambient light that backlights the tree. \n\nIn the middle distance, partially obscured objects that could be discarded items or perhaps fallen tree limbs are subtly visible. These elements add a hint of desolation or abandonment to the scene.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, featuring gentle hills that fade into the misty, light-filled sky. This gradation of tones conveys a serene yet slightly mysterious atmosphere, typical of rural or natural landscapes captured at such twilight hours. The composition's use of natural light and shadows effectively conveys the quiet beauty of a seemingly secluded location.","title":"Smoke fills fields near open burning city dump.","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547705","551365","556473","554994","557013","542932","549248","543621","553578","557598","553579","546533","543410","552484","548756","554668"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["light","limb","tree","gradation","grass","fog","desolation","hour","twilight","dawn"]}
