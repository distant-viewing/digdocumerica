{"path":"550650.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is an atmospheric photograph depicting a serene lakeside setting framed by slender birch trees. The composition primarily focuses on a peaceful body of water, possibly a lake, reflecting the cloudy sky above. Three prominent birch trees, characterized by their white bark with dark markings, occupy the foreground on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the view of the lake but creating a natural frame for the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance, a single small boat floats on the lake, conveying a sense of tranquility and isolation. Beyond the lake, the background is filled by low hills or mountains that stretch across the horizon, their details slightly obscured by the lighting conditions and a cloudy sky. The overall mood is calm and contemplative, enhanced by the cool color tones and the natural beauty of the setting. The photo might have been taken during the late afternoon or early evening, as suggested by the soft and subdued lighting.","title":"Rangeley lake, north shore--mingo springs area","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["551207","554752","552319","550674","554733","550324","554405","557021","550746","550735","543611","543618","557493","554616","550493","550745"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["birch","lake","obscure","lakeside","marking","bark","float","occupy","evening","isolation"]}
