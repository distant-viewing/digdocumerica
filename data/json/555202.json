{"path":"555202.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape of a burnt forest with visible damage due to a wildfire or similar natural disaster. The foreground is dominated by dark, jagged rocks scattered across the area, which appear to be charred or covered in ash. Amid the rocks, small patches of resilient greenery poke through, hinting at nature's recovery process.\n\nThe middle ground and background feature tall, thin trees with burnt trunks and bare branches. Many of the trees seem to have lost their leaves or needles, and those remaining are reddish-brown, likely scorched by heat. The atmosphere carries a somber tone, enhanced by the lack of vibrant colors and the visible effects of the fire.\n\nThe scene is enveloped in a dim, possibly dusk or dawn light, which casts long shadows and emphasizes the texture and contours of the landscape. Overall, the composition conveys a sense of devastation yet also subtly hints at the beginning stages of natural regeneration.","title":"A combination of slash burning and erosion wore away all ground cover in this location in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542819","555113","553626","542598","555159","555088","553571","553561","553572","553565","555095","553583","542600","555162","555157","555230"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["burn","char","ash","beginning","wildfire","recovery","lose","devastation","heat","disaster"]}
