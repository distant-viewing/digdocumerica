The setting appears somewhat retro, reminiscent of mid-20th century American diners. On the left side of the image, the bar features an array of equipment and utility items such as trays with utensils, cups, and other bar essentials. The bar itself is a long, curved counter where patrons are seated. These patrons, including men wearing casual and work attire, contribute to the lively scene, some engaged in conversations while others focus on their meals or drinks.\n\nAt the bar area, there are multiple bartenders and staff members providing service, which includes preparing drinks and attending to customers. The interior design includes exposed brick columns, ceiling fans, and a classic pressed-tin ceiling, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Natural light seems to be streaming in through the windows, enhancing the visibility and mood within the space. Various posters and signs are visible in the background, adding to the authentic diner feel. The image portrays a moment of daily life and social interaction, encapsulating a vibrant community gathering spot.","title":"Afternoon scene at Poole's Drugstore in Rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["553518","556613","547779","554278","547796","548234","547794","554219","554866","545457","551320","547184","543990","547789","547760","547376"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["bar","diner","patron","drink","ceiling","essential","tin","press","fan","utensil"]}
