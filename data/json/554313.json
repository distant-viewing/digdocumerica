{"path":"554313.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of an urban street excavation, likely for utilities or infrastructure repairs. The foreground prominently features a large, open trench dug into the asphalt of a city road. The trench is surrounded by wooden and metal barricades, including orange safety barriers and wooden planks to presumably prevent pedestrians from accidentally falling in.\n\nIn the trench, there is visible debris and layers of urban infrastructure, such as piping and possibly cables. A safety helmet is also seen inside the trench, suggesting the presence of work crews although no workers are visible in the trench itself.\n\nThe background contrasts the construction scene with the bustling city life. Yellow taxicabs are prominent, blurred slightly, indicating their motion along the street. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, including a group of what appears to be tourists orienting themselves using a map. Signs for businesses like “The Brass Rail” and “Theater” visible in the shot suggest that this scene is likely in a busy commercial area, enhanced by the presence of multiple storefronts with large display windows and neon signs.\n\nThe lighting and color saturation give the image a vibrant, almost cinematic quality, encapsulating a typical busy day in a vibrant urban environment, juxtaposed dramatically against the messy, gaping interruption of roadworks at the foreground.","title":"Consolidated edison at work on a midtown Manhattan street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551631","551951","549665","553886","547240","549913","547949","544968","549633","548373","547693","554308","551906","546252","553887","557742"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["trench","pedestrian","safety","interruption","barricade","theater","prevent","neon","infrastructure","map"]}
