{"path":"548395.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a large urban park surrounded by densely packed city buildings. In the forefront, the park features multiple baseball diamonds, abundant greenery with various paths weaving through it, and sizable rectangular and triangular manicured fields, possibly used for sports or events. The central section of the park includes a large oval water feature, likely a lake, which is surrounded by trees. Beyond the park, clusters of high-rise buildings delineate the cityscape extending toward the horizon. The overall scene is set against a backdrop where the city meets the skyline, showing the expansive scale of the urban area. The lighting in the photo suggests that it may have been taken in the late afternoon or early evening, giving a slightly shadowed, dim impression to the scenery.","title":"Central park, Manhattan, looking south.
