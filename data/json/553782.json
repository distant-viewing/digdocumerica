{"path":"553782.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant coastal scene. The view shows a beautiful, clear blue sea lapping against a curved shoreline. The water is relatively calm near the shore but shows some waves further out. The shore appears to be surrounded by steep cliffs or large hills, primarily barren or with little vegetation, giving the landscape a rugged appearance.\n\nSeveral people can be seen enjoying the water; some are swimming while others appear to be snorkeling, as suggested by the splashes and positions near the surface. The sky above the sea is a deep blue scattered with fluffy, white clouds, which suggests a bright and sunny day, perfect for beach activities.\n\nOn the sand, closest to the bottom of the image, the beach appears to be sparsely populated with visitors. The terrain's natural colors, from the blue hues of the sea to the dark tones of the cliffs and the lighter colors of the sandy beach, form a picturesque scene typical of a serene, natural coastal environment ideal for recreational activities.","title":"Koko head park in the hanauma bay marine life conservation district is a popular snorkelling and skin diving spot.
