{"path":"545822.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph features a textured, horizontal wooden surface that forms the background. The wooden planks are worn and show signs of aging, with variations in color from beige to gray and natural wood patterns visible. Notably, there are some markings or graffiti faintly visible on one of the planks, including what appears to be the name \"ROY\" written in a rough script.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently placed off-center to the right of the frame, there is a red circular tin. It's an old, used paint tin with the label \"Herb's in Red.\" The label shows signs of wear and rusting, particularly around the edges and the lid. Thereâ€™s no paint visible inside the can from this angle, but there are stains and residue that suggest it was previously used.\n\nThe color palette is mainly natural tones, with the red of the paint can standing out against the muted background. The lighting appears to be natural and casts soft shadows to the left, suggesting an outdoor setting or an area with ample sunlight. The composition uses simple elements to create a somewhat rustic and abandoned feel, possibly evoking themes of past work or nostalgia.","title":"View of side of abandoned cantina and rusted coffee can.","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["552511","543614","547506","556354","551246","543339","545521","554561","543330","552463","552512","552096","544720","554439","556353","551330"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tin","plank","paint","label","script","residue","lid","nostalgia","graffiti","beige"]}
