{"path":"554028.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man standing in a grassy field, with a substantial body of water in the background reflecting sunlight. The man, appearing engaged and using hand gestures, seems as if he is explaining or discussing something. He is dressed casually in a light blue buttoned shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is predominantly rural and serene. Behind the man, you can see a large, calm lake bordered by fields that indicate agricultural activity, likely cultivation. Hills with modest vegetation rise gently in the distance under a partly cloudy sky.\n\nThis view captures a blend of human interaction with nature, suggesting a possible discussion about the landscape, water resource management, agriculture, or environmental conservation. The overall mood is peaceful and educational, with a focus on the man's interaction with his environment.","title":"Harry Kealoha, officer of the Molokai Homesteaders Association, stands above Kualapuu Reservoir.
