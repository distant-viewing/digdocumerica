{"path":"550006.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic two-story wooden structure, possibly an old watchtower or guardhouse, with a time-worn appearance and rich history. The building features weathered dark brown wooden siding and a steeply pitched roof. Several windows with shutters are visible, some shutters hanging askew, giving an impression of neglect. The structure also includes a brick chimney protruding from the roof, indicating the presence of a fireplace or heating system inside.\n\nA wooden staircase with railings leads up to the second floor, appearing sturdy despite the building's overall aged condition. Beneath the staircase, there is storage space where various items might be kept.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a simple wooden fence, partially broken or sagging, enclosing a yard that has several bare spots of earth and scattered debris, hinting at a lack of maintenance. A large metal drum is visible behind the fence, adding to the cluttered, unkempt feel of the scene.\n\nThe property is located in a residential area, as suggested by the glimpse of houses with bright siding in the background. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day, which casts shadows on the building, enhancing its three-dimensional form and texture.\n\nThis description suggests the photograph captures a scene from a less maintained area amidst a neighborhood, possibly highlighting issues of urban decay or the remnants of a once-functional structure now in disuse.","title":"Switchhouse at the taunton railroad crossing","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552491","554707","546989","543339","552494","552488","550129","551115","543171","557633","557640","551111","549221","550113","557346","545233"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["shutter","staircase","siding","description","fence","heating","drum","disuse","roof","pitch"]}
