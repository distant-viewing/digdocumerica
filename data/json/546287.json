{"path":"546287.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In this photograph, we see a young man engaged in an experimental or laboratory activity. The setting includes a structured setup that dominates the foreground. This setup consists of a large black hexagonal table or platform, on top of which lies a complex arrangement of glass bottles and scientific apparatus. The bottles, some of which contain a green-colored liquid, are interconnected by tubes and are arranged systematically, suggesting a scientific experiment or process is being conducted.\n\nThe young man, appearing focused and meticulous, is adjusting or examining part of this apparatus. He is dressed casually in a striped, short-sleeved shirt and his hairstyle reflects a style typical of the mid to late 20th century. The environment around him is an industrial or laboratory-type room with a simple concrete wall and minimal decoration, emphasizing the pragmatic nature of the space.\n\nThe perceived purpose of his activity might involve chemical experimentation or perhaps some form of environmental testing, given the use of multiple fluid containers and the setup's complexity. His demeanor and the setup suggest a careful, precise approach to his work. The overall composition of the image focuses on the interaction of the person with the intricate lab setup, highlighting a moment of human ingenuity and scientific endeavor within a controlled setting.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
