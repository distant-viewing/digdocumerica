{"path":"552912.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a group of American White Pelicans congregated on a body of water. The pelicans are primarily white with some having patches of dark feathers. They appear to be floating together, facing various directions, which suggests social or feeding activity.\n\nThe background features a scenic landscape, including a hill or a small mountain with sparse vegetation visible at the upper part. Lower down, closer to the water level, there appear to be flat, green areas possibly indicating grasslands or marshes. The lake itself reflects a deep blue color, suggesting clear skies above.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo emphasizes the contrast between the large group of bright white pelicans and the darker, blue hues of the water, framed by the natural, green landscape and a hint of rugged terrain in the distance. This scene typically illustrates a peaceful, natural setting possibly indicative of a wildlife refuge or a similarly protected environment.","title":"Pelicans feeding on Pyramid Lake.
