{"path":"558021.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene suburban scene during autumn. In the foreground, a bed of fallen leaves blankets the ground, indicating the season, with hues of orange, brown, and yellow. A chain-link fence lines a small, maintained yard adjacent to the foremost house.\n\nTo the left, there is a white house with a visible chimney and sloped roofing. Behind this structure, another house, also painted white, can be seen partially. These residential homes convey a modest, peaceful neighborhood setting.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is an electrical pole and beyond that, a view opens towards more suburban housing and a large tree with dense, green foliage contrasting the autumn colors. This part of the scene is bisected by a quiet street.\n\nIn the distance, the spire of a church and another historic building peek above the residential homes, lending an architectural highlight to the otherwise serene suburbia. The sky above is partially cloudy, diffusing the sunlight and enhancing the overall calm, autumnal mood of the setting.","title":"G.a.r.
