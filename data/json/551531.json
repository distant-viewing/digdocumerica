{"path":"551531.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a riverside scene featuring environmental degradation. In the foreground, a wide, muddy brown river flows horizontally across the image. On the far bank of the river, a steep hillside cluttered with scattered debris and garbage slopes down to the water's edge. The debris includes various items that seem out of place in a natural setting, such as broken pieces of concrete, twisted metal, and discarded fragments of building materials.\n\nNear the top of the slope, there's a chain-link fence that appears to demarcate the boundary of a more controlled area. Beyond this fence, there is a prominent red brick building with a hipped roof, which looks relatively well-maintained compared to the surrounding landscape. The buildingâ€™s architecture suggests it might serve an industrial or utility function. \n\nThe composition of the image portrays a stark contrast between the natural flow of the river and the human-inflicted damage upon its banks, highlighting themes of pollution and environmental neglect. The sunlight and clear blue sky offer a natural beauty that is overshadowed by the impact of human waste, which dominates the scene. The photo may evoke feelings of concern and a call for responsible environmental management.","title":"Broken curbstones and sidewalks are dumped on the river bank behind the waterworks in suburban Fridley.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["544810","552098","550250","550947","545945","556419","550946","552082","552046","547485","548357","547907","546785","550950","550723","550352"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["slope","bank","river","fence","link","fragment","debris","riverside","garbage","damage"]}
