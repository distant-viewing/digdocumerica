{"path":"542892.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a group of small fish caught in a net. The fish are densely packed and appear to be freshly captured, with their silver bodies glistening subtly in what looks like natural light. Their eyes are shiny, and they are aligned in various directions, nestled tightly against each other.\n\nThe net surrounding the fish is a prominent part of the composition. It has a coarse texture and is likely made from a brown or similarly dark material. The netting covers part of the fish, emphasizing that they are caught and not freely swimming.\n\nThe overall color tone of the photograph is dark, focusing the viewer's attention on the reflective bodies of the fish and the intricate mesh pattern of the net. The background is entirely filled with more parts of the net and fish, creating a full and detailed scene without any distinct horizon or spatial indicators. The focus and framing capture a sense of the fishing industry's activity, highlighting both the bounty and the containment.","title":"California--Moonstone beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["545075","545063","546319","546792","546784","548142","553878","544987","543189","552271","547848","551364","547551","546214","553877","546846"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","net","catch","netting","indicator","containment","mesh","silver","glisten","swim"]}
