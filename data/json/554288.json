{"path":"554288.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet, snow-covered street scene at night, possibly in a small town or village with a wintry setting. The image shows a couple of traditional, timber-framed buildings on both sides, which suggest a quaint, possibly tourist-oriented area. The buildings primarily exhibit a charming architectural style with visible wooden beams and a combination of reddish-brown and white exteriors. Several of the buildings have their interior lights on, casting a warm glow onto the snow outside, adding a cozy and welcoming ambiance.\n\nThe street is blanketed in snow, reflecting the streetlightsâ€™ soft golden hue. In the foreground, there's a path that appears to be compacted with snow, making it walkable. The center of the pathway features what looks like large rocks or boulders protruding through the snow, lightly dusted in white, adding to the rustic charm. No vehicle is visible, indicating that this might be a pedestrian zone.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a figurine symbol or structure is protruding from the building, adding an element of local culture or shop branding, though its details are indistinct due to the angle and lighting.\n\nA lone individual stands near the center left of the frame, dressed in winter clothing, which suggests chilly weather conditions. The person appears engaged in observing or contemplating the surroundings, contributing to the serene and somewhat solitary atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a peaceful winter evening in a charming village, where architecture and soft lighting create a picturesque setting appropriate for leisurely walks despite the cold weather.","title":"Vail Village at night","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554281","554214","554233","554213","552607","554291","554279","551864","554232","557656","548245","548242","543640","550031","554275","551101"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["snow","village","winter","appropriate","streetlight","branding","walk","weather","timber","symbol"]}
