{"path":"553203.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a large, decorative bandstand with a striking red and white striped canopy. The bandstand is built with an ornate, dark metal frame, supporting the scalloped-edge canopy that dominates much of the image. On top of the bandstand lies a young man, seemingly asleep. He is dressed casually in a plaid shirt and blue jeans, with his brown shoes visible. His body is relaxed and sprawled out across the metal structure of the bandstand, suggesting he is in a deep sleep.\n\nAround the bandstand, lush green trees provide a vibrant backdrop, indicating that the setting might be a park or a similarly green, open space. The lighting suggests sunny weather, enhancing the brightly colored canopy and verdant surroundings. The scene is peaceful and somewhat whimsical, capturing a moment of rest in an unexpected yet picturesque location. The presence of the young man adds a human element to the scene, introducing themes of leisure and the use of public space for personal respite.","title":"Fountain square flower stall, which does business on weekdays only, makes a shady bower on sunday","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551922","555924","551860","556292","549321","553065","552723","557713","551015","551771","551265","558116","551770","556620","549911","552736"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["canopy","sleep","respite","introduce","sprawl","metal","space","shoe","plaid","colored"]}
