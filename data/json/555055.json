{"path":"555055.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The image captures a close-up view of a white flower bud, which is the central focus against a softly blurred background. The bud, set slightly off-center to the left, displays a delicate texture with fine, hair-like structures along its edges, adding a fringe-like appearance. The stem supporting the bud is slender, also covered in these tiny hairs, hinting at a protective or adaptive feature of the plant.\n\nThe background consists of deep blues and subtle whites, forming dreamy bokeh effects typical of macro photography. This bokeh casts a mystical and ethereal atmosphere around the subject, isolating and highlighting the sharpness and detail of the bud against the indistinct backdrop. There appear to be other flower buds or plants hinted at in the soft focus of the surrounding environment which contribute to a natural and slightly wild composition. This setting suggests that the photograph was taken in a rich, verdant location, possibly during a time of day when light is diffused finely through the canopy, enriching the colors and textures in the image.","title":"Salal flowers in a climax sitka spruce forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557617","543623","557618","545695","554587","555189","554576","553361","543597","545715","555034","545726","554574","550462","553368","555035"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bud","bokeh","flower","fringe","sharpness","hair","blu","stem","enrich","plant"]}
