{"path":"546418.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction site. In the foreground, several large white panels, possibly insulation or drywall, are laid out on the ground. These panels are propped up on wooden frames and extend into the distance. The ground around these panels is uneven and covered with gravel and scattered debris, including wood and other building materials.\n\nIn the background, there is an incomplete building structure. The building is large with tall white exterior walls, and part of its interior structure is visible, showing metal beams and raw construction elements. There's also some scaffolding on the side of the building, indicating ongoing work. To the left side of the image, it appears that there's a partially enclosed space possibly leading to other sections of the construction area.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting variable weather conditions which might influence the construction work. The overall impression is of an active construction site with work in progress on building large structures.","title":"Construction of Fodrea Community School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["547833","547829","550273","543583","546422","547977","546414","548552","550737","555373","556619","546411","553702","557730","553703","556642"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","panel","work","site","scaffolding","progress","building","gravel","beam","impression"]}
