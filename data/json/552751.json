{"path":"552751.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban street scene, infused with a sense of neglect and abandonment. In the foreground, a man is seated on the curbside, interacting with contents on the sidewalk. He appears to be reading a newspaper that is spread open upon the concrete. He is dressed in a plaid shirt, dark pants, and a beige bucket hat is placed beside him, suggesting a casual demeanor. As the focus of the image, the man seems engaged in his activity, oblivious or indifferent to his surroundings.\n\nThe background features a large brick building that stretches across the picture, characterized by numerous boarded-up and broken windows, indicating disuse or disrepair. The red and cream paint on the building is visibly peeling, adding to the derelict atmosphere. A row of dumpsters lines the base of the building, some tagged with graffiti, which reinforces the urban decay theme of the setting. \n\nA bright red fire hydrant stands out next to where the man is seated, providing a pop of color in an otherwise muted environment. A utility pole with hanging wires intersects the scene, enhancing the gritty, urban aesthetic.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a powerful narrative about urban decay, isolation, and perhaps resilience or normalcy under less-than-ideal circumstances. The setting and subject together deliver a poignant snapshot of life in a neglected or forgotten part of the city.","title":"Killing time in North Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550253","552749","550257","549785","553506","552748","552750","550246","549786","557351","557345","550264","552969","552971","555897","549784"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["dumpster","decay","hydrant","neglect","infuse","deliver","forget","pop","tag","disuse"]}
