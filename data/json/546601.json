{"path":"546601.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an interesting perspective inside a bus through the reflection in a convex mirror mounted on the busâ€™s ceiling. The mirror provides a fish-eye view of the passengers and interior.\n\nThe main focus of the image is the mirror's reflection. Inside the reflection, you can see numerous passengers seated and some standing, holding on to the overhead handles. The passengers appear to be adults, dressed in typical street clothes, some wearing coats. Their expressions are not clearly discernible, but they seem engaged in typical commuting behavior, some looking out the windows, and others conversing or lost in thought.\n\nThe bus interior has rows of seats, and the ceiling is equipped with handles for standing passengers. The windows of the bus allow natural light to fill the space, giving the scene a well-lit ambiance. \n\nThe mirror itself is surrounded by a black frame, and the top right section of the frame has what looks like an arrow pointing left, likely a part of safety signage. Below the mirror, you can see part of the bus's ceiling and top of the windows, emphasizing the curve and depth of the bus's interior architecture. The photograph cleverly uses the curvature of the mirror to encompass a wide view, providing a sense of space and busyness typically experienced during a bus ride.","title":"Driver's view of passengers on morning Shirley Highway (VA) express bus to Washington, DC","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556797","554241","556745","556795","556756","556789","554264","556743","555978","556802","554323","556748","554327","556739","554326","548256"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","mirror","passenger","ceiling","reflection","interior","busyness","handle","window","commuting"]}
