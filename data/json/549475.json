{"path":"549475.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of Niagara Falls, a famous set of massive waterfalls located on the border of the United States and Canada. The image captures the breathtaking span of the falls, showcasing both the American Falls, to the left, and the larger Horseshoe Falls, which are centered and to the right in the image.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the American side is visible with lush green trees surrounding the cascading water. A parking lot packed with cars signifies a popular viewpoint or tourist facility, adjacent to which are serpentine pathways leading visitors through scenic viewpoints.\n\nThe right side of the photograph displays the Canadian side, where the iconic curving Horseshoe Falls create a dramatic plume of mist. Below the falls, the river flows vigorously, marked by white foamy water patterns indicating the turbulence of the mighty falls.\n\nA notable landmark, a tall observation tower, stands prominently on the Canadian side. This tower offers visitors an elevated view of the falls and surrounding areas. The river shore on both sides is developed, with roads visible near the water that likely provide access to various facilities and additional viewpoints.\n\nThe background shows a wide expanse of gently developed landscape, hinting at the urban environments of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of natural majesty and popular tourist activity, intertwined with significant natural and built elements that define this famous location.","title":"Niagara Falls.
