{"path":"548968.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene taken from an elevated or aerial perspective. In the foreground, there is a large, prominent industrial structure that includes a tall chimney or smokestack painted in white and red stripes, emitting a substantial amount of smoke into the air. The smoke disperses into the atmosphere above. Adjacent to the chimney are several low, complex metallic structures, possibly part of a factory or power plant, indicative of heavy industrial activity.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a landscape that appears to be arid, with sandy and rocky terrain typical of a desert environment. There are small clusters of buildings that might be residential or commercial, suggesting the presence of a community living near the industrial site. These buildings are relatively sparse, spread out across the area, surrounded by patches of greenery, likely man-made oases in the desert landscape.\n\nIn the background, the terrain rises into barren hills or low mountains, further emphasizing the arid and rugged natural environment. There is no significant vegetation visible on the mountains, highlighting the dry and harsh climate of the region.\n\nThe overall scene creates a stark contrast between industrial development and the natural desert landscape, possibly pointing towards issues of industrial impact on natural environments. The photograph might be exploring themes such as industrial expansion, environmental degradation, or the coexistence of human development with nature.","title":"Mohave generating plant near bullhead city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["544777","544736","551026","544039","546760","543733","548376","543992","545354","557374","545013","544735","551567","557373","545239","545236"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["desert","arid","chimney","themes","development","smoke","expansion","mountain","disperse","live"]}
