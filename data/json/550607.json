{"path":"550607.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and natural scene featuring a fish leaping over rocky stream obstacles, presumably during a spawning run. The central focus is the fish, which displays splashes of color that contrast sharply with its surroundings. Its body is partially out of the water, highlighting the action and movement of the moment.\n\nThe backdrop of the image is composed of large, rounded rocks that are partially submerged in the water. These rocks are mottled with patches of moss and algae, suggesting a moist and perhaps shady environment. The water around the rocks is animated, with sparkling droplets and ripples created by the fish's vigorous effort to overcome the stream's flow.\n\nLight plays a significant role in this photograph. The sunlight filters through, possibly obscured by trees, casting glittering reflections on the waterâ€™s surface and creating a mosaic of light and shadow in the scene. This interplay of light adds a vibrant and almost magical quality to the photograph, enhancing the sense of movement and the natural beauty of this aquatic environment.","title":"After spawning the salmon dies.
