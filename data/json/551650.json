The café features numerous yellow and white umbrellas that create a cheerful and inviting atmosphere. These umbrellas are evenly spaced to provide ample shade for the patrons seated beneath them.\n\nThe tables are round and covered with green tablecloths, surrounded by matching green chairs that blend harmoniously with the overall color scheme. Each table is occupied by guests, who appear to be enjoying meals and conversations. The guests are a mix of men and women, some facing towards the camera, others away, engaging actively with each other.\n\nThe waitstaff, dressed in white shirts and black pants, are seen serving the guests, carrying trays and attending to the tables. This adds a dynamic element to the scene, indicating a well-maintained and attentive service environment.\n\nThe cafe is bordered by lush green plants and pink flowering bushes, which line a walkway and add to the fresh, outdoor aesthetic. The plants are well-kept and vibrant, contributing to the sense of an oasis in what might be an urban setting.\n\nOverall, the image captures a lively social scene, characterized by a colorful and relaxed outdoor dining ambiance, bustling with activity and surrounded by natural beauty.","title":"Rockefeller Center--5th Avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549677","549672","551634","549669","551637","549657","553190","551803","551846","551635","550037","551848","557664","551867","551834","557488"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["guest","cafe","table","umbrella","oasis","patron","tablecloth","café","tray","dining"]}
