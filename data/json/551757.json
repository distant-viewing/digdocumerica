{"path":"551757.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a senior citizens' lawn bowling game on a sunny day. The foreground prominently features a man in a yellow jacket and white hat, intensely focused as he bends forward to roll a black lawn bowling ball down the green. He is standing on a textured green mat, designed to aid his throw.\n\nThe midground features six individuals, who seem to be either waiting for their turn or already played their part. There are three men and three women, with the men typically wearing hats and the women donning sun hats or caps. Their attire varies, showcasing casual outdoor wear that includes trousers, skirts, and sweaters. Their poses and facial expressions reflect attention and anticipation as they watch the play.\n\nThe green itself is manicured and wide, bordered by trees that cast shadows and add depth to the scene. On the left background, there is a metallic, cylinder-shaped structure which could be a storage unit or utility building.\n\nOverall, this is a vibrant community scene filled with engagement and leisure, surrounded by a serene park setting. The image illustrates an active lifestyle among senior citizens and provides a glimpse into their social dynamics in an outdoor sporting environment.","title":"Members of the Bowling Green bowling club meet for a game in Central Park.
