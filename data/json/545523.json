{"path":"545523.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The image captures a rustic camping scene in a wooded area. The focal point is a woman sitting cross-legged on a red mat laid over a larger mustard-colored tarp. She is engaging in eating with her left hand raised to her mouth, holding what appears to be a piece of food, and she looks directly at the camera with a slight expression of surprise or interruption.\n\nShe is dressed casually in shorts and a light blue button-up shirt over a dark navy top. Her hair is loosely pulled back. The area around her has various camping essentials scattered about; to her left, there is a green can and an empty food container, hinting at a meal recently or currently enjoyed.\n\nIn front of her, there’s a small fire pit made of neatly arranged logs, unlit, with some remnants of burnt wood indicating prior use. Beside the pit, there’s a small pile of peelings and food bits, suggesting recent food preparation. Among the visible items, there's an empty tin can and a green glass bottle, which contribute to creating a lived-in, casual camping atmosphere.\n\nThe background is characterized by dense trees and some items of clothing hung up to dry, adding to the feel of an authentic campsite. The blending of greens and browns from the trees and the ground, along with the natural light filtering through the foliage, establish a peaceful, secluded outdoor setting.","title":"Member of gasp-organized weekend at bankhead national forest.
