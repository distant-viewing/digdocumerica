{"path":"556151.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures an African American woman prominently in the foreground with a crowd of people blurred in the background. The woman is wearing a light pink button-up shirt and a matching pink headscarf. Her facial expression conveys a mix of surprise and introspection, with her eyes slightly narrowed and lips parted as if mid-conversation or reaction. She is directly facing the camera, making her a strong focal point against the indistinct backdrop where various other people are slightly visible but not individually distinguishable due to the shallow depth of field focused on the woman. The lighting seems natural, likely outdoors, accentuating deep hues and creating shadows that add depth to the womanâ€™s features. The overall mood hints at a casual, perhaps public gathering where the woman's expressive demeanor stands out amidst the blur of community activity around her.","title":"A Black woman, one of the nearly 1.2 million people of her race who make up over one third of Chicago's population. It is one of the many Black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. The photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope, struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship, and faith. In short, they are portraits of individual human beings who are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556244","558291","556150","545373","556254","553154","553178","553499","556143","553321","544311","556414","553251","556737","557039","553275"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["woman","matching","reaction","lip","headscarf","introspection","blur","button","depth","crowd"]}
