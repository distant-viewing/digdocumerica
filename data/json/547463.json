{"path":"547463.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a sailboat navigating through open waters. The boat is tilted slightly to the starboard side, suggesting it is moving at a considerable speed with the wind at a favorable angle. The hull of the sailboat is white, complemented by a single main sail that is fully hoisted and a smaller jib sail, both of which are also white. The sea around the boat is a deep blue, with waves and whitecaps indicating moderate sea conditions.\n\nThere are two visible individuals onboard the sailboat, both seemingly engaged in active roles related to sailing. One person appears to be at the stern, possibly adjusting or holding on to the rigging or a line, while the other person is closer to the bow, engaged in a task that could involve navigation or adjusting the sails to optimize speed and balance.\n\nThe boat features standard sailing equipment such as a mast, boom, and riggings that are all integral for sailing efficiency. The sky is overcast, casting an overall muted light over the scene and giving a sense of solitude and vastness to the oceanic setting. There appears to be no land in sight, emphasizing the isolation and pursuit typical of open-water sailing. The photograph evokes a sense of adventure and the nautical skills required to manage a sailboat in such conditions.","title":"Sloop heels over in a stiff breeze on Chesapeake Bay in the early hours of","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549394","549421","549405","549409","549404","544667","549403","549393","547461","549426","549392","548062","548506","549398","547456","549406"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sailboat","sail","rigging","speed","boat","whitecap","sea","efficiency","pursuit"]}
