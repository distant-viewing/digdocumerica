{"path":"546776.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view showing a dense and cluttered settlement juxtaposed against a structured and modern highway infrastructure. In the top portion of the image, a river runs parallel with two bridges spanning over it. The river is dark in color, potentially muddy, reflecting minimal details on its surface. Adjacent to the river are multilane highways where cars can be seen traveling in both directions. The roads are divided by grassy medians and lined by trees.\n\nBelow the highways, there is a large area covered with numerous small structures that appear tightly packed and chaotic. These structures vary in size and shape, suggesting makeshift or temporary housing, commonly indicative of an informal or shantytown settlement. The colors of the roofs vary, with shades of blue, red, gray, and white predominating, creating a patchwork effect.\n\nThe area around the settlement and roads shows sparse vegetation and appears to be somewhat barren, hinting at a potentially underdeveloped or industrial region. The overall atmosphere evoked by the juxtaposition of the modern highway system and the improvised settlement highlights significant urban contrast, possibly pointing towards socio-economic disparities in the region. The photograph seems to capture a scene of urban complexity, with elements of development and underdevelopment coexisting closely.","title":"Auto junkyard","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552725","546369","548344","546704","546616","546569","555781","548363","555745","546698","548418","546713","548092","546678","557461","546689"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["settlement","highway","river","median","multilane","region","patchwork","housing","road","complexity"]}
