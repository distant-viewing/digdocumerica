{"path":"553357.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people in a forest setting. The forest is lush with dense greenery, comprising a variety of trees and underbrush bathed in sunlight, which filters through the leaves, casting patches of light and shadow.\n\nIn the forefront, there are four individuals. To the left, an elderly woman is pointing to something in the distance. She wears glasses and a floral blouse. Next to her, an older gentleman stands, looking in the same direction as the woman. He has slicked-back gray hair and is dressed in a blue shirt with suspenders, holding a camera by his side.\n\nBehind them, partially obscured by shadows and leaves, are two additional people. The first, a man with a beard, listens attentively, while the next figure, younger and slightly blurred, is looking toward the direction everyone seems focused on.\n\nThe overall mood is one of curiosity and exploration, as the group appears engaged in either a guided tour or an informal exploration of the forest environment. The natural lighting and dense foliage suggest it might be late morning or early afternoon on a sunny day.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["557005","554662","543331","557985","554663","543233","545512","544739","545290","554705","554665","553376","551764","543446","557007","542728"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["forest","exploration","direction","slick","suspender","tour","beard","group","listen","leave"]}
