{"path":"543267.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and vivacious scene of a gibbon swinging on a rope in a natural environment. The gibbon is suspended in mid-air, with one hand holding onto a horizontal metal cable and the other grasping a chain that dangles from the cable. Its body is stretched out in a notably agile pose, legs splayed and arms extended, exhibiting its natural acrobatic abilities.\n\nThe background consists of a softly blurred array of foliage. There are varied tones of green and scattered light patches which suggest sunlight filtering through the leaves of tall trees, creating a playful pattern of light and shadow on the gibbon and in the environment around it.\n\nThis lively depiction not only showcases the gibbon's physical agility but also emphasizes a moment of play and freedom within a forested habitat, providing a glimpse into the daily activities of a gibbon in the wild. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of vitality and an uninhibited connection with the natural world.","title":"One of the stars of \"lion country safari,\" a roadside tourist attraction","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553437","544336","553438","550830","551498","550829","553436","551530","551734","557737","543093","547188","551499","543791","549274","548800"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["cable","grasp","vitality","swing","wild","freedom","suspend","leaf","depiction","world"]}
