{"path":"552494.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated old wooden house in a rural setting. The house is weathered and shows significant signs of neglect and decay. It features a classic architectural style with a gabled roof and a covered porch. The roof shingles are in poor condition, many missing or in disarray, exposing the underlying structure. The wooden siding of the house also appears worn, with paint that has been long stripped away by the elements, leaving the wood gray and weathered.\n\nThe house has multiple windows, some of which are broken or missing panes, suggesting long-term abandonment. The porch columns are crooked and some are missing entirely, further indicating the deteriorating condition of the structure.\n\nAround the house, the grass and wild vegetation are overgrown, reaching up to the walls and steps of the porch, emphasizing the lack of maintenance. There are a few steps leading up to the porch suggesting a once welcoming entrance.\n\nIn the background, there's a large, majestic tree with a dense canopy, adding a touch of nature's resilience in contrast to the man-made structure's decay. The sky is overcast with visible clouds, casting a moody light over the scene, enhancing the sense of abandonment and time's passage.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the essence of neglect and the natural process of decay in an abandoned rural homestead, surrounded by an untamed natural landscape that slowly reclaims the man-made environment.","title":"Deserted house","placename":"Detroit (Ill.)","location":"Detroit, Illinois","nn1":["552491","554822","557640","552455","555632","551115","555612","557633","554707","546989","550113","557141","556491","542588","554788","554799"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","decay","step","abandonment","neglect","missing","stripp","reclaim","deteriorate"]}
