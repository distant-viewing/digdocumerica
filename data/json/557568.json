{"path":"557568.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a tranquil natural scene centered around a body of water, presumably a pond or small lake. In the foreground, there is a single, large swan resting on a small island of pebbles and debris, positioned almost at the center of the frame. The swan is preening or grooming itself, with its neck bent towards its body. The water surrounding the island is calm, reflecting a muted image of the swan and the island.\n\nThe background shows a lush green environment with dense trees along the far bank of the water. The trees appear to be in soft focus, providing a natural, serene backdrop that contrasts with the detailed foreground. The soft lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the peacefulness of the setting. The overall atmosphere of the image is quiet and contemplative, inviting the viewer to appreciate the simplicity and beauty of the scene.","title":"Bird at Malibu Lake in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located at the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in the county. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure. Several commissions have been set up to restrict coastal development.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546081","546086","550388","543918","551149","543063","555551","545991","557121","544838","547744","552993","553346","553777","554776","545142"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["island","pebble","peacefulness","neck","pond","simplicity","bank","water","body","lake"]}
