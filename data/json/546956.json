{"path":"546956.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat somber atmosphere. It depicts a person riding a bike along a path that appears wet, perhaps from a recent rain, as indicated by the shiny, reflective surface. The setting is an outdoor area heavily adorned with large, mature trees draped in Spanish moss, creating a dense and textured canopy overhead. The scene is fairly dark with low lighting, likely taken during dusk or under heavy cloud cover, giving it a moody and ethereal tone. The natural elements and the solitary figure convey a sense of quiet solitude and a connection with nature.","title":"Hanging moss is typical of st.
