{"path":"543391.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and energetic seaside scene. It presents three individuals on a jagged, rocky shore next to the ocean. The central figure, a young girl dressed in a bright red bathing suit and white shorts, is in motion, possibly jumping or dancing as the white ocean waves crash around her. To the right, another person, possibly a boy or young woman, stands on the rocky ledge observing the ocean. This person is dressed in a white shirt and blue shorts and appears calm, contrasting with the dynamic activity of the central figure. Furthest to the right, another individual, dressed in dark clothing, is engaged in fishing, standing at the edge of the water with a line cast into the sea.\n\nThe setting is a rugged coastline with a clear sky and bright sunlight that casts sharp shadows on the uneven surface of the rocks. The ocean is lively and forms white foam as the waves break against the shore. The overall atmosphere of the image is full of life and movement, showcasing a moment of youthful enthusiasm and serene natural beauty.","title":"Natural Arches Beach State Park","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["545086","543492","543458","543397","543225","543310","555892","557507","553951","543395","545218","543019","555923","557423","546378","543215"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","short","wave","enthusiasm","shore","figure","ledge","foam","person","coastline"]}
