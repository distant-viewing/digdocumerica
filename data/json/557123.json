{"path":"557123.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a large flock of birds in a wetland habitat. The scene is composed mainly of three layered elements: the vast flat expanse of brown grass or marshland in the foreground, a large congregation of birds mostly settled on the ground in the middle section, and another immense group of birds in flight, filling the sky with a dynamic swirl of specks and shapes.\n\nThe background features a line of trees or bushes that stretch horizontally, dividing the sky from the ground and adding a sense of depth. The sky is a clear light blue, suggesting either a sunny or slightly overcast day.\n\nThe primary visual activity is centered around the birdsâ€”both those covering the ground in the middle section of the image and those dynamically moving through the air above, possibly indicating migration, feeding, or some form of social gathering among the avian population.\n\nThe colors in the photo are muted, with a strong emphasis on natural tones of blues, browns, and whites, which portray a serene yet lively wildlife scene. The perspective of the photograph, taken from a distance, emphasizes the expanse of the habitat and the vast number of birds present, conveying a sense of wilderness and the scale of natural bird habitats.","title":"Flocks of blue geese stop at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state.
