{"path":"544592.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a dense cluster of water lilies covering a body of water. The leaves are broad and flat, primarily a rich green with some showing signs of yellowing or decay around the edges. The surface of the leaves shows some spots and natural blemishes, possibly from standing water or ecological interactions.\n\nReflective, calm water is visible around the edges of the mass of lily pads, showing a dark, almost black color that mirrors the sky and surrounding vegetation. On the upper right side of the photograph, the bank of the water body is visible, lined with lush green grass and undergrowth that suggest a healthy, natural wetland environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it was taken on a sunny day, indicated by the bright exposure and crisp shadows cast on some of the lily pads. The composition primarily focuses on the water lilies, filling much of the frame with their overlapping forms, which draws attention to their texture and the interplay of light and shadow on their surfaces. There is a peaceful and serene quality to the scene, characteristic of still freshwater habitats. The background includes soft-focus reflections of trees, enhancing the sense of a secluded, natural setting.","title":"Northern edge of Everglades National Park, Florida--near the TaMiami Trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543598","555080","550809","544588","544474","550808","554584","547639","558095","545387","554583","543561","550786","551352","542554","550785"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pad","water","overlap","mass","undergrowth","leave","edge","wetland","yellow"]}
