{"path":"546430.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a sunny day on a suburban street lined with well-maintained detached houses. The scene captures a vibrant contrast of blue skies speckled with white clouds above and lush greenery below. The street appears calm and quiet, featuring mature trees that create a canopy over parts of the road, casting shadows that add to the serene, small-town ambiance.\n\nAt the center and bottom of the picture, there is a main focal point: a utility vehicle pulls a small flatbed trailer loaded with some materials, driving away from the viewer's perspective towards a residential area. The vehicle and trailer take up the middle section of the street, suggesting some type of public or maintenance work might be occurring. \n\nResidential properties flank both sides of the street. These houses vary slightly in their architectural designs but share common characteristics typical of suburban dwellings such as gabled roofs and covered porches. Their front yards are well-kept, with lawns and various types of foliage suggesting a well-cared-for neighborhood.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with clear skies, a quiet street, and the presence of residential upkeep, evokes a sense of peaceful daily life and communal care in a suburban setting.","title":"Tree being moved by truck","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["556950","557668","547567","547433","556601","556435","557454","550315","556448","553705","550994","556433","548011","557405","549279","558157"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["street","trailer","gabled","public","flatbed","detach","dwelling","upkeep","type","porche"]}
