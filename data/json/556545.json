{"path":"556545.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a painted message on a board or wall. The background is a dark blue color and the text and images are painted in white, except for a red heart. The text itself reads: \"PUT YOUR HEART IN U.M.W.A. OR GET YOUR ______ OUT I PREFER A UNION MAN FOR A FRIEND, HOW ABOUT JOINING THE U.M.W.A. AND BE A GOOD FRIEND.\" The initials \"U.M.W.A.\" presumably refer to the United Mine Workers of America, suggesting this image has a context related to labor union advocacy or solidarity.\n\nThere is a simple, white drawing of a deer within the heart shape, which adds a visual element to the message. The text and deer drawing appear hand-painted, characterized by irregular lines and brush strokes, giving it a personal and grassroots feel.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a straightforward, heartfelt appeal promoting unity and participation in the labor union, indicative of union-related campaigns or community expressions often found in areas with strong labor ties.","title":"Closeup of a picket sign made by miners on strike against the brookside mine company in brookside, Kentucky, near Middlesboro in the southeast part of the state.
