{"path":"555973.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station where maintenance work is being performed. The image is taken during the day under clear lighting conditions. The focus of the image is on a worker who is engaged in washing a train. This worker, dressed in a dark jacket and a safety helmet, is using a high-pressure hose to spray water on the side of a train, creating a visually striking pattern of water droplets and splashes in the air.\n\nIn the background, several other workers can be seen walking along the platform, which runs parallel to the parked train. These workers appear to be wearing uniforms. The train itself features a corrugated metal exterior, and we can see multiple cars linked together, extending into the distance.\n\nThe platform surface looks wet, suggesting ongoing or recent washing activity. Various hoses are visible on the ground, and there are patches of standing water reflecting light, enhancing the feeling of an active maintenance operation. The scene is set against a simple backdrop of a clear sky, and distant utility poles and lamps, emphasizing the industrial environment of the train station. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of purposeful activity and industrial routine.","title":"The Southwest Limited, an overnight train from Los Angeles, California, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, makes an early morning stop at Winslow, Arizona, for a change of engineer, conductors and brakemen.
