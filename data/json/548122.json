{"path":"548122.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures the side view of a large ship named \"COLUMBIA,\" which is brightly painted in red with white text. The ship is floating on reflective blue water under a partially cloudy sky. It features two tall masts equipped with various antennas and rigging. The foredeck area includes a white superstructure, a bridge with several windows, and two visible funnelsâ€”one emitting a small amount of exhaust. The ship appears robust, possibly designed for research or expeditions, given the array of equipment visible on the masts and deck. The calm sea and daylight conditions suggest a peaceful setting in a harbour or near the coast. The surface of the water twinkles slightly under the sunlight, enhancing the serene nautical ambiance.","title":"Lightship Columbia at the mouth of the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["548124","549613","549619","551581","555801","557819","555811","549431","555789","549618","546040","550891","555721","557816","544657","551558"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","mast","funnel","expedition","superstructure","exhaust","rigging","antenna","coast","research"]}
