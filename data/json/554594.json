{"path":"554594.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a rock surface covered with patches of yellow lichen. The lichen forms irregular, amorphous shapes scattered across the surface, giving the image a textured and slightly abstract appearance. The dominant colors in the photograph are shades of yellow from the lichen and various tones of dark grey and black of the rock, which creates a contrasty yet natural palette. The detail of the rock surface and lichen suggests that the photo is taken in a natural environment, likely emphasizing the beauty and complexity of these small ecosystems. There are no human activities, objects, or people visible, as the focus is entirely on the natural patterns and textures of the lichen and the rock. The overall composition is somewhat random and organic, reflecting the natural growth and arrangement of lichen on the rock.","title":"Lichens atop Algonquin Mountain (elevation 5,114 feet) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550476","550484","555182","550474","550483","543149","554410","545589","555029","555018","543147","553582","552546","543151","544440","543421"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["lichen","rock","surface","complexity","yellow","grey","ecosystem","growth","arrangement","shape"]}
