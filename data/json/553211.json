{"path":"553211.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures a vibrant scene featuring a young woman eating outdoors. The woman is dressed in a vintage red and white outfit with a collared blouse and a red vest dotted with white polka dots. She wears her blonde hair partially pulled back and has a joyful expression as she takes a large bite from a hamburger.\n\nIn addition to the focal activity of eating, the photograph shows a partial view of a fountain in the blurry background, contributing to a pleasant, leisurely atmosphere typically found in a park or similar public setting. To her side, there is a drink cup with a striped pattern, likely containing a beverage to accompany her meal.\n\nThe lighting suggests the image might have been taken on a slightly overcast day, as the natural light softly illuminates the scene. The leafy greens slightly visible atop and around the area hint at an environment that is lush and tranquil, adding a sense of freshness to the composition.\n\nOverall, this photo evokes a sense of casual, everyday enjoyment and a moment of simple pleasure.","title":"Pause for a snack in fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551458","545742","557935","543631","551826","552614","551845","553204","544747","556816","551846","547813","545523","554220","553212","551419"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["dot","collared","freshness","pleasure","atop","polka","beverage","addition","eat","meal"]}
