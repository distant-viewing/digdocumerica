{"path":"544338.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a leisurely and somewhat dramatic scene by the sea on a bright sunny day. Two people, a man and a woman, are sitting on a large flat rock just at the water's edge. The man is seated in a relaxed posture, with one hand touching his chin, looking towards the woman. He is wearing a dark swimsuit. The woman, wearing a light-colored swimsuit, is seated across from him, angled slightly towards the man, with her legs bent.\n\nBehind them, there is a striking natural feature, a large vertical spout of water, akin to a blowhole, shooting up from the sea, spraying mist into the air and creating a dynamic backdrop. The fine mist partially veils the bright blue tones of the ocean and the sky. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of serene interaction against a powerful display of natural beauty.","title":"Bathers enjoy the Havasu Falls.
