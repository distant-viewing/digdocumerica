{"path":"554049.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals, both seemingly female, engaged in an outdoor activity, likely related to agricultural work or field study. The primary subject is a woman standing in the foreground looking towards the camera with a slight smile. She is wearing protective, weather-appropriate attire, which includes a large, patterned hat offering considerable coverage, possibly designed to shield her from sun or rain. Her outer garment is a long, light-colored coat and she wears gloves, indicating the work may involve handling materials or conditions that require protection.\n\nFurther enhancing her readiness for fieldwork, she carries a large, brown paper bag, suggesting the collection or transportation of samples or possibly harvested goods. She is also equipped with what appears to be a field tool or device partially visible in the bag.\n\nHer hat, uniquely adorned with circular patterns, adds a personal touch to what might otherwise be standard field gear. Another individual, also wearing similar protective and practical clothing, is observed from behind in the right portion of the image, partially turned away from the camera and focusing on something outside the frame.\n\nThe background reveals a very open landscape with a flat terrain, scattered with remnants of vegetation and under a cloud-filled sky, suggesting a rural or undeveloped area likely used for agricultural purposes. This setting provides some context about the type of work being conducted, possibly involving crop research, environmental collection, or agricultural maintenance. Overall, the image conveys a sense of active participation in an outdoor, possibly scientific or agricultural endeavor in a setting that demands practical attire and preparation.","title":"Sugarcane workers in bonnets of a kind customarily worn by the japanese who labored here a quarter of a century earlier workers are now mostly filipinos","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["546316","545721","558245","557097","554050","546300","546312","543864","543853","546345","554051","546343","551421","554108","550048","544085"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["collection","bag","field","involve","work","demand","fieldwork","readiness","participation","shield"]}
