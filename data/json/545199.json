{"path":"545199.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and vast landscape consisting mainly of sand dunes under what appears to be the early or late hours of the day, judging by the soft, ambient light and long shadows. The dominant feature is the sandy terrain, which undulates with gentle slopes and is textured with numerous footprints and small dunes, lending a sense of scale and activity.\n\nThere are several people scattered throughout the scene engaged in leisurely activities. In the foreground to the midground, three individuals are seen walking across the sand, their movements creating trails behind them which add to the myriad of other marks crisscrossing the area. Farther in the distance, tiny figures can also be seen on the dunes, perhaps further exploring or enjoying the expansive view.\n\nAdditionally, the composition includes sparse vegetation. On the right side, there's a prominent clump of dark bushes or trees atop a small hill, providing a stark contrast to the mostly barren sandy landscape. These greens serve as the only significant break in the monotony of sand and sky.\n\nThe sky itself adds a dramatic backdrop to the scene, with its gradient of deep blues near the top fading to lighter hues towards the horizon. This suggests that the sun may be setting or rising, contributing to the tranquil and slightly moody atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Sand dunes","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["550490","545203","547717","548230","549037","545207","545200","553058","543097","552897","557459","548906","544415","544873","547015","555399"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dune","sand","monotony","clump","myriad","atop","crisscrosse","footprint","trails","fading"]}
