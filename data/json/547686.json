{"path":"547686.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a vast car parking lot filled primarily with hundreds of cars that appear somewhat similar in design, suggesting they are new and possibly ready for distribution or sale. The cars are predominantly in shades of red, yellow, and brown. The close packing of the cars creates a colorful, repetitive pattern across the frame.\n\nIn the background of this sea of cars, there is an urban skyline with tall buildings, likely indicating that this parking lot is situated on the outskirts of a city. The view includes a few high-rise buildings and other smaller structures scattered throughout the cityscape. The sky is clear, hinting at good weather conditions.\n\nThe angle of the photograph is taken from an elevated perspective, looking diagonally across the parking lot towards the city, giving a broad view of both the cars and the distant buildings. This angle helps emphasize the mass of cars and the scale of the lot in comparison to the city skyline.","title":"\"mazdas\" awaiting shipment","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["546900","542635","556197","553303","546879","549875","546813","548432","549696","547742","547480","556721","550100","556722","547826","546685"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","car","parking","city","skyline","angle","comparison","mass","distribution","outskirt"]}
