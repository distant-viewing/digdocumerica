{"path":"556524.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a man who appears to be middle-aged, with a distinctive squinting expression and possibly a slight grimace. He has short, swept-back hair, which is blondish or light brown. His complexion is fair, and he has a prominent nose and flushed cheeks, likely indicating sun exposure or physical exertion. He's wearing a blue work shirt with white trim or stitching along the collar, which suggests a casual or labor-oriented environment.\n\nThe man is holding a baby's bottle filled with a light-colored liquid, likely milk. The bottle is somewhat small and has a yellow cap, and he is holding it in his right hand, gently cradling it with his fingers. This could indicate he is a father, caregiver, or involved in some sort of familial or caregiving situation.\n\nThe background is blurred and out of focus, but it shows a gathering of people, possibly at an outdoor event or public setting where families and groups congregate. There are indistinct figures and colors in the background â€“ hints of blue and white clothing, suggesting a daytime setting with other adults and perhaps children around him.\n\nOverall, the image has a candid, real-life quality, capturing a moment in the life of this man amid a presumably social or communal event. The holding of the baby bottle juxtaposed with his rugged and somewhat weary expression makes a striking and somewhat unusual image, perhaps hinting at themes of masculinity, caretaking, or everyday life.","title":"Wayne Gipson, a belt loader in the mines, attending the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company first annual picnic at a Tennessee Valley Authority lake near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
