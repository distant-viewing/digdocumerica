{"path":"551551.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This aerial photograph shows a large industrial area situated near a body of water, likely a lake or river. Two large, dome-shaped piles of what appear to be industrial materials are prominently visible. These are stark white and make a dramatic contrast with the surrounding landscape. There are traces of dust or a similar substance being dispersed into the air around these piles.\n\nThe background features a mixture of forested areas and developed land. There are several buildings, most likely industrial facilities, distributed throughout the scene. A connected system of roads and possibly conveyor belts are visible leading up to and between the sites.\n\nWater bodies can be seen surrounding the industrial sites, reflecting light, indicating either the presence of small waves or some disturbances in the water. Near the top of the image, a bridge crosses the river, alongside which various other human-made structures are noticeable.\n\nThe infrastructure visible includes a series of rail tracks running parallel to the industrial operations which can be seen housing numerous rail cars, likely used for transporting goods or materials in and out of the industrial area. Nearby, populated residential areas can be identified, characterized by rows of closely packed houses. The entire scene captures both the natural landscape of the area and its significant transformation due to industrial activity.","title":"Taconite tailings from reserve mining at silver bay are discharged into lake superior","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["551177","551585","549495","544471","549968","550890","555754","551173","551201","544788","549519","555769","552182","549526","552191","552209"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["rail","shaped","pile","transformation","transporting","site","good","trace","distribute","dome"]}
