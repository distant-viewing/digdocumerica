{"path":"553370.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaging in outdoor activities in a natural setting. The scene is set against a lush, verdant landscape, likely beside a river or lake, considering the visible body of water in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent rock formation slopes steeply upward, with several individuals navigating this terrain. On the left, a man wearing a striped shirt and carrying a backpack is climbing upward, using the rocks as handholds. In the middle of the image, another man in a red shirt and blue shorts is actively climbing. He appears to be carefully choosing his holds, showing a sense of determination or focus.\n\nOn the right, sitting at the top of the rock formation, a young man in a light blue long-sleeve shirt and jeans seems to be taking a rest or observing his surroundings. He is seated casually with one hand supporting him on the rock.\n\nInterspersed amongst these individuals are thick green foliage and trees, adding a sense of depth and wilderness to the scene. The environment suggests a popular spot for hiking or climbing, offering both a physical challenge and a way to engage with nature.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of active engagement with the natural world, emphasizing outdoor recreation and adventure.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["545782","558096","554672","554509","545700","545780","552334","544305","543998","549102","543383","545781","543234","544739","544925","544093"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["climb","rock","determination","choose","climbing","formation","consider","shirt","backpack","hiking"]}
