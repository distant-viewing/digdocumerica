{"path":"547355.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man sitting and relaxing on a bench outdoors. He is wearing a traditional denim railroad cap and overalls, suggesting a working-class or rural background. A pair of worn work boots and two walking canes, one positioned between his legs and the other held in his left hand, hint at mobility challenges. He is seated in a relaxed position, leaning back slightly on the bench, and looking off to the side with a calm expression.\n\nThe background provides a sense of a small-town setting. Adjacent to the bench is a wall with a combination of white cladding and a vibrant red-and-white striped pattern, which adds a visually striking element to the scene. The sidewalk is brick-paved, enhancing the rustic charm of the setting. Further down the sidewalk, a variety of objects are visible: parked vehicles, including a classic red truck; a bicycle leaning against the wall; and a rustic building with signage just barely readable, possibly an old store or shop. There are also trees and power lines, typical of a street scene. The overall ambiance is quaint and captures a slice of life in a perhaps older, laid-back community.","title":"On the main street of Diller, a rural community west of Lincoln.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552523","547313","547330","548615","558333","553090","557844","557713","547359","547067","555991","556489","557138","557115","549042","556488"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["bench","sidewalk","cane","lean","mobility","class","overall","wall","railroad","relax"]}
