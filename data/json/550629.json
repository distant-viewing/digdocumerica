{"path":"550629.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping aerial view of a rugged landscape characterized by a mix of natural features. Dominating the image are lush, dense forests that blanket rolling hills and valleys. A winding river, reflecting hints of the sky above, cuts through the terrain, enhancing the sense of wilderness and isolation. The background is dominated by majestic mountains, some of their peaks covered with snow, suggesting a high altitude and a possibly harsh climate.\n\nThe mountains cast shadows over some parts of the forest, creating a play of light and shade that adds depth to the scene. The overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and the warm hues bathing the landscape. The topography and the undisturbed nature of the land suggest this area is either a protected national park or a remote region not heavily impacted by human activity.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with no visible human-made structures or presence, evokes a sense of serenity and untouched beauty. It's a snapshot that emphasizes the vast, silent majesty of nature, inviting viewers to contemplate the raw beauty of the wild landscape.","title":"View south to the peaks towering above ernestine creek","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550513","550441","555677","550596","553570","550541","550510","550518","550529","556906","550413","550609","555660","543569","550511","550642"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["contemplate","majesty","serenity","mountain","forest","topography","protect","blanket","altitude","bathe"]}
