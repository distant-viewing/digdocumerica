{"path":"545276.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a close-up of a metal informational plaque mounted on what appears to be a frame or posts, possibly within a natural setting such as a park or forest reserve. The plaque is rectangular in shape and made of a material that has a dull metallic sheen, possibly stainless steel, with engraved text filled with dark, possibly black material to enhance readability. Four screws at each corner secure it to the backing.\n\nThe engraved title on the plaque reads \"COLONNADE,\" followed by a descriptive text which explains a natural phenomenon involving trees. The text states:\n\n\"Trees that germinate on nurse logs eventually send roots to the soil, growing into large buttressed root systems. These arch over ghost nurse logs that have rotted away. Someday, these trees in a long row or colonnade will fall and they too will serve the forest community as nurse logs. Thus, the cycle of hundreds of years will be repeated.\"\n\nThe background behind the plaque is softly blurred with hints of green, suggesting foliage or trees, emphasizing that the setting is outdoors amongst vegetation. This blurriness adds depth to the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the plaque and its message.","title":"Hoh rain forest, where sitka spruce western red cedar, and Douglas fir grow to great size","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544332","542749","542715","543504","555183","542568","542723","557589","557621","557776","555188","555063","542570","544913","554967","545278"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["plaque","nurse","engrave","root","text","logs","phenomenon","repeat","title","cycle"]}
