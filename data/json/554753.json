{"path":"554753.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene highlighted by a striking interplay of light and shadow. The image depicts a calm river or lake that gently meanders through the frame, reflecting the sky and forested hillsides that surround it. The waters are calm, with light ripples, suggesting a quiet, windless day.\n\nForeground silhouettes of coniferous trees frame the left side of the image, providing a natural border that draws the eye towards the center and the opposite bank. These trees, dark and shadowed, add depth and contrast to the otherwise brightly lit scene.\n\nThe background features rolling hills coated in a dense tapestry of autumn foliage. The trees on the hills are bathed in golden and amber hues, perhaps indicating either a setting or low-angled sunlight that richly illuminates the leaves, casting vibrant reflections on the water.\n\nOver the hills and through a clearing, the sky appears light, possibly suggesting late afternoon or early evening, enhancing the golden tones of the foliage and adding a warm, tranquil atmosphere to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition leverages natural framing, the contrast between light and shadow, and the reflection on the water to create a peaceful and visually captivating landscape. The scene invites the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of a secluded natural setting, possibly in a temperate climate zone during the fall season.","title":"Late fall sunglow on a mountain at little birch pond in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["546963","552599","550845","554749","552336","543611","552597","554527","557572","557159","550844","549446","553355","550389","554762","550746"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["hill","leverage","quiet","captivat","angl","coate","reflection","appreciate","tapestry","foliage"]}
