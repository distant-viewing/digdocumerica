{"path":"546283.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a laboratory setting focused on numerous scientific instruments and a human hand manipulating or adjusting the equipment. The main objects in the image are arrays of glass vials filled with a clear liquid, carefully arranged on a mechanical carousel or rack system. The mechanical system appears designed for processing multiple samples simultaneously, likely for chemical analysis or synthesis.\n\nThe human hand visible in the scene is wearing a watch and is engaged in precise work, such as positioning or retrieving one of the glass vials. This suggests the presence of a scientist or technician conducting experiments or overseeing the operation of the lab equipment.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dim, with a focus on the apparatus and the person's hand, highlighting the vials and giving a dramatic, almost moody effect to the scene. The background is dark and indistinct, which draws attention primarily to the illuminated parts of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the hands-on interaction with scientific tools, suggests a setting where careful, precise laboratory work is being carried out, possibly in a research or industrial environment. The atmosphere conveyed is one of focused activity and technological sophistication.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: The respirometer is measuring the oxygen released by algae that have been exposed to pesticides.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546275","542737","546344","546277","546269","546327","549608","546278","546284","555281","543834","549342","549611","543801","546287","542666"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["laboratory","hand","system","technician","scientist","watch","analysis","glass","experiment","lab"]}
