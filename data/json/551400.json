{"path":"551400.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a young child engaged in an outdoor activity at night. The child appears to be standing in a small puddle or body of water. They are dressed warmly, wearing a red knitted hat with a pom-pom, a brown jacket, and brown pants tucked into red plastic or rubber boots. The child is holding a long stick or pole that extends into a large net, suggesting that they may be attempting to catch something in the water, possibly engaging in a playful or exploratory activity like catching fish or insects.\n\nThe child is focused on their task, looking down into the water at the net. The background is predominantly dark, emphasizing the nighttime setting and placing the focus on the child illuminated by an unseen light source that casts gentle reflections on the water's surface.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is one of curiosity and youthful exploration, captured in a serene and somewhat mysterious nighttime environment. The use of lighting highlights the child and their activity, creating a sense of intimacy and the simple joy found in childhood play.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
