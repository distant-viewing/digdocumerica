{"path":"552141.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents a broad, elevated view of a large body of water surrounded by lush, densely forested areas. The viewpoint is high enough to overlook wide expanses of the water and land, suggesting it could have been taken from a hilltop or a low-flying aircraft.\n\nThe water body prominently featured in the image, possibly a river or a lake, branches into several inlets and is dotted with islands of varying sizes. The water surface appears calm, with minimal wave activity, and reflects a slightly cloudy sky. Light conditions indicate it might be either dawn or dusk, with the shadows cast across the landmasses suggesting this shot was taken later in the day.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, the shoreline curves gently into the picture, lined by dense tree cover which is typical of a temperate or boreal forest. The colors of the foliage are mostly deep greens, indicating the photograph could have been taken during the summer months when vegetation is in full bloom.\n\nOn the right, the forest continues along the undulating terrain around the lake or river. There are no visible human structures or boats, giving the scene a pristine, natural feel, untouched by overt human activity.\n\nOverall, the image captures a serene and unspoiled natural landscape, emphasizing water and forest in a harmonious balance, likely taken to highlight the peaceful beauty of this remote location.","title":"Waterways of lower Puget Sound near Olympia","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556928","550579","556931","556930","554526","542882","554527","556926","544557","555728","555702","555695","550601","554652","550612","554616"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","hilltop","month","lake","inlet","water","landmass","aircraft","bloom","balance"]}
