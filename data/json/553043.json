{"path":"553043.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a peaceful park setting on what appears to be a sunny day. The foreground is framed by the dark silhouettes of tree branches arching across the top of the image, adding a natural frame to the scene. An additional tree on the right side of the image has a complex, twisting structure, with its branches spreading out, partially covered with leaves.\n\nIn the middle ground, thereâ€™s an expansive, well-manicured grassy field peppered with scattered trees that offer shade and visual interest. Three small groups of people can be seen at various distances across the field, engaged in leisurely activities such as walking. The presence of these people adds a lively human element to the otherwise tranquil natural setting.\n\nThe background is made up of a clear sky with few clouds, casting bright and even light over the entire scene. This type of lighting enhances the vivid green color of the grass and the freshness of the outdoor space. The park offers a sense of openness and relaxation, ideal for recreational activities and enjoying nature.","title":"Municipal golf course built on sanitary landfill.
