{"path":"544755.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures three men engaged in activities at a riverbank with a boat. The central figure, wearing a bright yellow hard hat, plaid shirt, and dark jeans, is bending down towards the ground, reaching out with one hand seemingly towards a chain or some sort of fastening mechanism on the ground. His posture and expression suggest he is focused and exerting physical effort.\n\nThe other two men are positioned inside a small, white boat that is partially on the shoreline and partially in the water. The man closest to the viewer, also dressed in work attire that includes a blue shirt, is leaning towards the boat's interior, his hand submerged, as if he is adjusting or retrieving something from the water. The other man, located at the far end of the boat, appears to be sitting and observing or waiting.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a calm river and a hilly, somewhat barren landscape on the opposite bank, implying a remote, natural setting. The sunlight is bright and casts sharp shadows, emphasizing the outdoor, daytime setting. The overall composition focuses on the contrast between the men's manual labor and the serene natural environment around them.","title":"Small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["544763","552115","546302","547020","552863","550733","547246","544226","553405","546758","551282","543948","548164","550209","546079","551046"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","man","retrieve","closest","mechanism","outdoor","hand","chain","sort","reach"]}
