{"path":"551515.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial riverside scene. The foreground shows the rippling waters of a river, reflecting a deep blue hue under a clear sky. On the right, a large, leafy tree partially shades the view, framing the scene with its dense green foliage.\n\nIn the background, the riverbank is lined with various industrial materials and equipment. Most prominently, there are large mounds of what appear to be minerals or construction materials; one mound is notably white and resembles salt or sand. These mounds are roughly piled and span a significant portion of the bank.\n\nOn the river itself, there is a red and black barge, partially visible and resting next to the white mound. This barge appears functional and utilitarian, typical for transporting heavy or bulk materials.\n\nFurther in the background, various cranes and other industrial machinery are visible, suggesting ongoing construction or industrial activity. The backdrop also includes a bridge spanning the river in the distance, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene with its metallic structure and suggesting connectivity to other parts of this industrial area.\n\nOverall, the composition includes elements of nature and industry, highlighting human activity in a natural setting. There is a contrast between the serene river and the busy, equipment-filled riverbank.","title":"Mississippi river waterfront","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551993","550900","550673","552070","557223","548187","551519","550854","551532","550961","551038","553392","557309","544271","547242","547807"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["mound","barge","river","riverbank","material","rippl","bulk","construction","connectivity","heavy"]}
