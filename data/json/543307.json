{"path":"543307.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and rocky coastal scenery viewed through gnarled branches of what appears to be a weathered tree. The key focus of the image is a rugged, sharply pointed rock formation jutting majestically out of the sea. The formation comprises multiple jagged peaks, positioned close to the shore.\n\nThe viewpoint is framed by the dark silhouettes of twisted tree branches in the foreground, adding an element of depth and wilderness to the scene. These branches, devoid of leaves, suggest a harsh climate or a dormant season for the vegetation.\n\nThe sea surrounding the rock formation is choppy, with white waves crashing against the rocks, indicating strong winds or tidal forces at play. The color of the water is a deep blue, contrasting with the pale grey and white tones of the frothy waves.\n\nThe background shows a distant horizon where the sea meets the sky, under a light blue sky scattered with thin white clouds, hinting at a cold or breezy environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural framing and the rugged, untouched landscape, conveys a sense of isolation and the enduring beauty of coastal geology. The mood is serene yet powerful, evoking a feeling of awe toward the natural world.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["545173","545130","545122","543295","543243","543134","543153","543068","543092","543060","545126","543250","543067","543080","543061","543309"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["formation","sea","branch","rock","geology","wave","awe","force","world","framing"]}
