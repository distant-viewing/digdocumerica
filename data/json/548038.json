{"path":"548038.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"In the photograph, two men are pictured outdoors in a snowy, wooded landscape, engaged in a winter activity, presumably snowshoeing.\n\nThe first man on the left is facing towards the camera and appears to be in mid-motion or perhaps adjusting his gear. He is older, with a visible mustache and is wearing a black and white checkered jacket, a black beret, and dark pants. He also has red gloves and a partially visible red neck warmer. He's using a long, cylindrical metal pole that he holds with both hands.\n\nThe second man, on the right, is turned away from the camera, looking down and towards the first man, possibly engaging in conversation with him. He is dressed in a red jacket with a back flap, tan pants, and he's wearing a backpack. He also has eyeglasses and a beard. Court crampons are visible on his boots, indicating preparedness for traversing icy or snowy terrains.\n\nThe surrounding area is heavily wooded with large snow-covered trees, signaling that this activity is taking place in a cold, wintry forest setting. The overall composition suggests a moment during a winter hike or exploration, highlighting the active lifestyles of the individuals and the serene, natural environment around them.","title":"Members of the crag rats climbing club make winter snow surveys for the u.s.
