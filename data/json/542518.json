{"path":"542518.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a desert landscape. Dominating the scene is a large, rugged hill or small mountain located in the center. This geological feature has a somewhat irregular peak and slopes that appear rocky and barren, typical of arid regions.\n\nThe terrain around the hill is flat and marked by numerous intersecting dirt roads that create a grid-like pattern over the land. The ground is dense with small, scrubby vegetation, likely desert flora, which speckles the landscape giving it a textured appearance. There are no visible bodies of water or structures, emphasizing the natural, undeveloped state of the region.\n\nThe sky above the landscape is clear, suggesting a dry, sunny day without clouds, which is common in desert environments. The light appears to be either morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the softness of the shadows cast by the hill, smoothing out the rugged textures of the land.\n\nThis view offers a glimpse into a remote, less inhabited part of the world where nature dominates and human presence is minimal, as indicated by the simple dirt roads and absence of buildings. The vast openness and the repetitive patterns of roads intersecting might evoke a sense of isolation or the expansive scale of natural landscapes.","title":"Unused subdivision (1948)","placename":"Mojave Desert","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552923","549016","544027","544016","550585","545895","545575","549184","550397","545604","549179","545843","545809","555885","544428","544401"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","intersect","hill","smooth","road","dirt","region","softness","land","speckle"]}
