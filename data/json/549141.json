{"path":"549141.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic view of an expansive rural landscape under a clear sky. In the foreground, there is a dense, lush field of green crops, possibly wheat or barley, showing some variety in height and density which subtly shades from dark to lighter green towards the horizon. The middle ground of the picture features patches of cultivated fields showing different stages of growth, adding variety in color from vibrant greens to shades of brown and tan, indicating different types of vegetation or soil.\n\nBeyond these fields, the landscape rises gently to form rolling hills, which are predominantly covered in grass, giving them a soft, verdant appearance. These hills possess a gentle undulation rather than sharp, jagged outlines, suggesting a serene and tranquil rural area.\n\nThe background is dominated by a blue sky, which is vast and clear, without the presence of clouds, enhancing the overall sense of openness and calm in the landscape. The lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken during the day, with the sun providing bright and even light, enriching the colors of the landscape.\n\nThis setting appears peaceful and untouched, evoking a sense of tranquility and the natural beauty of an expansive, rural environment. No people or animals are visible in this serene scene, reinforcing the theme of undisturbed natural beauty.","title":"Hay and alfalfa fields in Sarpy Basin.
