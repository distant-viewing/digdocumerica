{"path":"553426.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, polluted river with a striking reddish-orange chemical effluent spreading across the water surface. In the background, there is a large industrial building with “Fitchburg Paper Company” prominently displayed on its side. The building is traditional in its architectural style, with rectangular windows and a flat roof. A tall chimney extending upwards suggests it might be a factory related to paper production. By the factory, there is a parking lot filled with cars, showing signs of operational activity.\n\nIn the foreground, thick foliage partially obscures the view, with tree branches and leaves at the top and immediately in front of the camera, hinting at the viewer observing this scene from a higher, possibly wooded area nearby. The river looks still, suggesting little water flow, and the pollution appears as a thin film that accentuates the stagnation. There are also patches of white foam scattered across the river surface, further indicating water contamination. The scene is set under a clear sky with ample daylight, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the contrast between the natural environment and the polluted state of the river.","title":"The Nashua river flows past the Fitchburg paper mill.
