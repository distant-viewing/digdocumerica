{"path":"543612.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features two young children, a boy and a girl, sitting on a large rock beside water. The boy, seated on the left, has light blonde hair and is looking directly at the camera with a surprised expression. His face is smeared with what appears to be chocolate, and he is wearing a white long-sleeve shirt decorated with colorful floral patterns along with blue trousers. The girl, seated to his right, has medium-length dark hair and glasses, and seems to be whispering something into the boy's ear. She is wearing a sleeveless pink and white floral top and blue trousers.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a tranquil, slightly blurry image of a water body; reflections of trees can be glimpsed on the water's surface, hinting at a natural, serene setting. The overall lighting and mood suggest this moment was captured during the daytime, with sufficient natural light enhancing the vividness of the figures and their immediate environment. The scene encapsulates a moment of childhood interaction, possibly sharing secrets or telling stories, in a calm and picturesque outdoor setting.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552332","545757","549299","545959","544200","544183","546043","543677","543538","547692","543875","551857","552702","543485","554900","544352"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","girl","trouser","sleeveless","ear","hair","childhood","vividness","daytime","length"]}
