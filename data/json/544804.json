{"path":"544804.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a polluted water scene quite vividly. The central focus is a body of water that displays an alarming juxtaposition of colors: a murky blue and brown, blending into a distinct red or rusty color along one edge, suggesting contamination. The red-tinted water is frothy, indicating possible chemical discharge or pollution.\n\nThe surrounding environment accentuates the dire state of the water. The bank is strewn with dry, brittle vegetation and some patches of green plants, which appear hardy enough to withstand the harsh conditions. There is also visible foam accumulating at the edge where the contaminated water meets the land, further implying the poor water quality.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a significant feature - a valve or some metal fixture partially buried under the soil and debris, possibly connected to piping that might be a source or conduit for the water or its contaminants. This human-made element suggests intervention or management of the water bodies, albeit poorly executed or maintained.\n\nThe environment does not show any human activity, further emphasizing the abandonment or negligence this area is suffering from. The overall composition and the elements within the image underscore significant environmental concerns, likely pointing towards industrial pollution and its unmanaged impact on natural resources.","title":"Outlet from Jordan Meat and Livestock Co., into Jordan River","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["543819","551077","550723","547493","544779","544810","548090","551562","544580","550812","551560","544175","552127","550371","547524","550193"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["water","withstand","pollution","valve","bury","discharge","conduit","contamination","accumulate","piping"]}
