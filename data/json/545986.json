{"path":"545986.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a home, featuring an elderly man seated at a wooden table. The setting appears to be a lived-in and cozy space, with a personal and casual feel, possibly in a rural or older residential setting given the style of the furniture and interior decor.\n\nThe man, who has slim build and a distinctive look with his dark, unkempt hair and deep facial lines, gives a sense of having lived a life full of experiences. He is wearing a plain long-sleeved blue shirt and black pants. His expression is serious and contemplative as he gazes outside the frame, lending an introspective air to the image.\n\nThe interior is warmly lit, probably by natural light filtering in through a window which is visible on the right. The roomâ€™s color palette is dominated by warm yellow and orange tones. There are personal belongings scattered throughout the background, including what looks like family photographs or plates displayed on the walls, and various objects on a shelf above a large refrigerator, which suggest a personal and homey atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a documentary feel, capturing a moment that reflects the personal environment and mood of the subject within his own space.","title":"Mr.  Tillman matherne, a lifelong resident of Bayou Gauche supports his 9 children by fishing","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["545974","555532","548454","552104","547427","545970","544232","555297","553517","544202","552105","552628","548252","552684","548218","553030"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["refrigerator","belonging","liv","decor","plain","shelf","furniture","plate","space","feel"]}
