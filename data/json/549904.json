{"path":"549904.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a busy scene at a metro station or a similar transit area featuring several people using escalators. The composition mainly consists of two escalators positioned side-by-side, one moving upwards and the other downwards, framed by a modernist, architecture-style setting with railings and clean lines.\n\nOn the left side of the image, several individuals are descending on the escalator, actively walking or standing. These people appear to be commuters, mostly dressed in business attire typical of a professional setting, carrying briefcases or bags.\n\nOn the right, the ascending escalator carries fewer individuals, suggesting a varied flow of traffic. Some commuters on this side are also shown in business wear, and one individual is notably reading a newspaper, suggesting early morning or late afternoon commuting hours.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes other architectural elements like guardrails and an overpass, which resonate with the typical design of public transit facilities in urban environments. The lighting in the photo creates shadows and highlights which add a dynamic element to the scene, enhancing the sense of movement within the busy station.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a common urban experience, highlighting the movement, attire, and activities of city dwellers as they navigate public transportation.","title":"Commuters at the Staten Island Ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan's Battery Park area","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551880","556696","556697","551885","551884","556820","551882","556823","551881","551883","549670","551890","551879","556054","551886","556815"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["commuter","transit","business","dweller","station","carry","commuting","briefcase","guardrail","movement"]}
