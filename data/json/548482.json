{"path":"548482.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph showcases a scene featuring two older individuals engaged in conversation outdoors. The woman, who is in the foreground, has an expressive look, possibly of concern or agitation. She has curly red hair, wears a stylish pair of black-rimmed glasses, and is dressed in a red jacket over a white blouse. She uses her hands to gesture as she speaks, which suggests a dynamic or intense conversation. \n\nThe man, seen from the side and partially from the back, appears to be listening to the woman. He wears a light-colored fedora hat and a patterned gray sweater over a collared shirt. His focus is directed towards the woman, indicating engagement in the conversation.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, featuring green hues typical of a park or garden setting, with walkways and possibly some benches or trees providing a serene setting for their interaction. This choice of setting contributes to the overall intimate and private feel of the exchange between the two characters.","title":"Two long-time residents of Neptune Road.
