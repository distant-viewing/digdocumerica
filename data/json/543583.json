{"path":"543583.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a construction site where several buildings are in various stages of being framed. Unfinished wooden structures can be seen; these frameworks are presumably the skeletons of future houses or buildings with exposed beams and plywood roofing. The site is busy with scattered building materials, particularly a large quantity of gray cinder blocks organized in stacks at the foreground. These blocks are likely intended for use in the construction foundation or walls.\n\nIn the background, a line of tall pine trees and a clear blue sky suggest that the construction site is located in a mountainous or wooded region. The ground is uneven and dug up, possibly for the installation of plumbing and electrical systems.\n\nNumerous trenches and wooden supports crisscross the site, emphasizing ongoing groundwork. Additionally, there are a few construction vehicles and a white trailer, possibly used as a temporary office or storage unit. The overall scene is one of active development, with no active human figures visible, focusing solely on the structural and material aspects of a building process in a natural setting.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543591","543584","546988","553703","547833","553922","557730","553702","547829","550273","556940","548551","550737","547858","543593","556635"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["site","construction","block","cinder","quantity","trench","foundation","roofing","building","material"]}
