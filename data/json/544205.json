{"path":"544205.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a family portrait inside a room with a light blue wall. There are six individuals visible in the image, two adults and four children, along with a small dog. The family consists of an older man and woman seated at the back on a couch, with the man slightly leaning forward without a shirt and the woman also leaning forwards, wearing an orange sleeveless top. The children are in front, with three boys and one small dog. The boy on the left is wearing a blue and white checkered shirt and holding the dog, which is partially in his lap, looking directly at the camera. The other two boys are shirtless; one is in the middle, sitting upright, while the other is seated with a small toy gun, legs crossed. The interior setting includes some additional details such as a curtain to the left, a small framed picture hanging on the wall, and another framed image partially seen, adding a personal touch to the scene. The photograph communicates a candid and relaxed family moment, sharing a sense of closeness and casual domestic life.","title":"Fisherman of Bayou Gauche and his family","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["556173","556609","557353","556610","548312","545985","556235","552612","556171","556496","544356","556561","556531","552615","547398","556576"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["dog","family","boy","gun","couch","lean","closeness","toy","child","framed"]}
