{"path":"548754.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene seascape, characterized by its expansive view of the ocean under a vast sky. The foreground shows shallow, crystal-clear water, revealing sandy bottom interspersed with areas of darker seaweed or coral. The water, shimmering under the sunlight, transitions from a pale translucent hue near the shore to richer shades of blue as it extends towards the horizon. \n\nThe sky dominates the upper half of the photo, filled with sweeping, soft cumulus clouds that vary in shade from bright white to dark gray, suggesting a dynamic, possibly changing weather situation. These clouds are scattered across the sky, creating a dramatic and picturesque composition against a light blue background. \n\nNo people or man-made objects are visible, giving the scene a natural and untouched appearance. The wide open spaces evoke a sense of tranquility and isolation. The framing and the perspective of the photograph emphasize the vastness of both the sea and the sky, highlighting the natural beauty and scale of this coastal landscape.","title":"Looking seaward from Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key.
