{"path":"552412.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid street scene centered around a vintage luxury car, possibly from the mid-20th century. The car features a prominent grille and classic, rounded headlamps, with additional mounted lights near the bumper. Its bonnet is adorned with a notable hood ornament, which adds to its antiquated charm.\n\nThree individuals are interacting or positioned near the car, each distinctly dressed. To the left, a young boy stands within what appears to be a secondary vehicle, leaning slightly outward with a curious expression, dressed in a casual plaid shirt. To the right, a man and a woman are engaged in a conversation. The man wears a casual blue t-shirt and checkered trousers; he is inspecting something in his hands that could be a camera or perhaps small binoculars. The woman, standing opposite him, is elegantly dressed in a light-colored checked coat or long blazer, with her hair styled in a high bun, suggesting a neat, sophisticated appearance.\n\nThe background of the scene shows vibrant storefronts painted in bright colors with visible signage, contributing to a lively urban vibe. This setting might suggest a special event or gathering focused on vintage or classic cars, drawing the attention of varied participants and spectators. The overall atmosphere appears relaxed and engaging, with the vintage car being a focal point of interest, connecting the people around it.","title":"Handsome old touring car attracts attention in the entertainment section of Center Street, in Niagara Falls, Ontario.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["555475","557052","557874","555476","557841","555944","549882","554389","546665","552795","543471","552782","547797","553488","549881","556538"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["car","bonnet","bun","ornament","luxury","binocular","headlamp","grille","bumper","blazer"]}
