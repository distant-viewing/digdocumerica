{"path":"546474.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure, presumably a young woman, seated against a vast dark brick wall. She is positioned on a narrow ledge, her posture relaxed, with legs crossed. The woman is dressed in a casual outfit consisting of a blue jacket and blue jeans. She is holding a book in her hand, suggesting that she may be reading or taking a break from reading.\n\nNext to her on the ledge, there is a small stack of books, indicating that she might be a student or a keen reader enjoying some time outdoors with her books. The fact that she's engaged with a book gives a serene and studious atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the image is striking due to the large, monotonous brick wall that occupies most of the frame, setting a distinct and textured backdrop that sharply contrasts with the small, colorful figure of the woman. The lighting appears natural, enhancing the warmth of the scene and focusing attention on the person against the simplicity of the background.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a moment of solitude and tranquility in an otherwise stark urban setting, emphasizing themes like contemplation and the personal joy of reading.","title":"First Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546478","553156","546564","553535","546555","546554","546492","553222","551448","553534","546500","543835","546566","556027","546470","545510"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["book","reading","ledge","woman","brick","student","figure","wall","relax","warmth"]}
