{"path":"545376.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a modern skyscraper, the Southern National Building, which dominates the scene with its vast, reflective glass facade that stretches skyward. The building has a rectangular form and is framed against a clear blue sky. In front of the building, set on a raised, darker structure that appears to be part of the building's base, are two flagpoles with American flags fluttering in the breeze.\n\nOn the right side of the image, in stark architectural contrast, is another tower. This building features a series of horizontal window lines and is topped by a logo or insignia that is circular in shape, hinting that it might be a corporate logo.\n\nBelow, on the street level, there is a vintage car parked, that appears to be from the mid-20th century, adding a historical layer to the image. The car's presence suggests a timeframe for the photo, possibly around the mid to late 20th century. The lighting in the image casts strong shadows from the buildings, indicating that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, which also adds a dramatic effect to the overall composition.","title":"Skyscrapers","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550024","550007","546448","549991","545881","551455","552042","546329","551442","558125","549856","550118","542580","546440","550038","545333"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["logo","insignia","timeframe","flagpole","building","century","breeze","skyscraper","car","flag"]}
