{"path":"548186.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a large barge loaded with what appears to be sand, navigating a waterway. The perspective is from behind, looking forward towards the bargeâ€™s journey. The barge occupies the lower part of the image and is moving on a river, leading into the distance where the river narrows and bends slightly.\n\nThe scene takes place on a clear day under blue skies, and the sunlight sparkles on the surface of the water, creating a shimmering effect. The riverbanks on either side feature sparse vegetation and some bare trees, suggesting it might be late fall or early spring. On the left side of the river, there is a developed area with what seems to be a logging operation visible, with logs piled at the edge of the water and some equipment. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, dominated by the natural setting and industrial activity.\n\nThis image provides a striking view of river transportation, emphasizing the scale of the cargo relative to the river, and showcasing an interaction of natural landscapes with commercial activity.","title":"Sawdust barge in camas slough near the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550951","548187","557235","544271","548200","557309","550952","551515","548201","551170","551148","549814","550912","556481","551038","546830"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","river","log","narrow","sparkle","journey","cargo","load","navigate","waterway"]}
