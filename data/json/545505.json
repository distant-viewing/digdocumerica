{"path":"545505.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an urban street scene featuring two African American men engaged in a musical performance. The older man on the left is playing a drum set, which consists of at least one drum and some attached cymbals, positioned on a wheeled cart. He is dressed in a formal dark suit, white shirt, and tie, and he wears a light-colored cap. His expression is focused and serious as he concentrates on his drumming.\n\nThe younger man on the right stands slightly apart, watching the elder drummer intently. He sports a stylish 1970s era outfit, consisting of a dark blazer over a paisley patterned shirt. His afro hairstyle and beard add to his fashionable appearance of the time.\n\nThe background suggests this scene is set in a public space, possibly on a commercial street, hinted by parts of neon signs and storefronts slightly visible in the periphery. The overall ambiance is one of an artistic street performance, with the elder musician possibly sharing his craft or performing for a public crowd, while the younger man learns or enjoys the music.","title":"Customer buys snack from elderly peanut vendor","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553238","546780","553231","548262","557265","551018","551479","557264","556312","553152","551014","553234","551020","551012","553232","551015"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["drum","performance","street","periphery","musician","man","neon","music","blazer","cart"]}
