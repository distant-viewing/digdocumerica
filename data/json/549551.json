{"path":"549551.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a city bridge or walkway, probably from the late 20th century given the clothing style and overall ambiance. The image primarily features an older woman, dressed smartly in a dark blue jacket and a knee-length plaid skirt, walking across the frame from right to left. She carries a white handbag, has her hair styled short and is wearing white slip-on shoes.\n\nThe bridge features large concrete barriers on both sides, covered with graffiti which includes names and possibly dates written in different colors. Prominent among the graffiti are names \"Bob + Pam\" and \"Rick + Janet,\" suggesting a common practice of people inscribing names as a public declaration or memory of personal relationships.\n\nFurther back, beyond the woman and on the right side of the frame, are groups of younger people gathered and in motion, likely just going about their daily activities. The individuals appear casually dressed, indicative of a relaxed social setting.\n\nIn the background, through gaps between trees and over the barriers, glimpses of a natural landscape or park area can be seen, suggesting the bridge may be located in an urban park or similar environment. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on graffiti and the solitary figure of the woman in contrast to the groups of younger people, gives a vivid depiction of everyday urban life during the era.","title":"Parapet bedaubed with spraycan graffiti at goat island, a tourists' mecca at the brink of the famous falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553474","549923","549645","556742","553184","555945","545231","547190","556199","557039","557279","546431","556725","551835","551822","551723"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["graffito","bridge","barrier","name","woman","memory","handbag","gap","relationship","people"]}
