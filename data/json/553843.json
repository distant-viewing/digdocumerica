{"path":"553843.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a large forest fire engulfing a woodland area. Dense smoke and flames dominate the scene. The fire is widely spread across the terrain, visible as a progressive line of intense orange and red flames consuming the undergrowth and reaching the base of taller trees. Significant smoke, tinged gray and blue, billows upwards, blending into a cloudy sky, creating a dramatic and intense atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, numerous thin trees, primarily coniferous, are scattered across the landscape. These trees appear dark against the bright contrast of the flames, some already being licked by the fire at the base. The middle and background portions of the image are obscured by the heavy smoke, giving the impression of an expansive fire.\n\nThe environment suggests a dry or conifer-rich forest, and the severity of the scene communicates a powerful natural disaster, likely causing significant ecological impact and indicating potential threats to nearby human settlements or wildlife. The tone of the photograph conveys urgency and the destructive power of wildfires in natural terrains.","title":"Burning field in the Everglades.
