{"path":"542579.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a view from an elevated position within a building, looking out towards a vast urban landscape during the daytime. Three silhouetted figures are visible in the foreground, positioned at the bottom of the frame. They appear to be seated behind a large window or glass barrier, looking out over the city. These figures are dark and featureless due to backlighting, which emphasizes their outlines against the brightly lit vista beyond.\n\nThe cityscape itself is expansive and stretches across the width of the frame, showing a mix of residential and commercial structures. The buildings vary in height but are mostly low-rise, except for a few mid-rise structures that stand out due to their size. The area is dense with lush green trees scattered throughout, adding a touch of natural ambiance to the urban environment.\n\nThe background reveals a wide, open sky that gradients from a light pink near the horizon to a deeper blue at the top, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon lighting conditions. The color of the sky casts a warm hue over the city, enhancing the calm yet vibrant feel of the scene. No distinct architectural landmarks or specific geographical indicators are visible, giving the city a generic but inviting appearance.\n\nThe parking lot in the immediate foreground is filled with cars, indicating the popularity or busy nature of this location. This element adds a layer of everyday life and activity to the otherwise serene and picturesque view. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the silhouetted figures set against the urban backdrop, creates a sense of contemplation and awe, encouraging the viewer to imagine the thoughts and perspectives of the figures as they gaze upon the scene.","title":"View of smog from Universal City Hotel","placename":"San Fernando Valley (Calif.)","location":"San Fernando Valley, California","nn1":["548384","549971","552394","547103","553845","542802","557271","556193","548417","549846","552363","549317","557260","551509","545499","549310"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["figure","city","popularity","indicator","backlighting","vista","awe","width","pink","landmark"]}
