{"path":"558284.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and bustling dance scene within a large indoor venue. The room is filled with numerous people, mostly couples, engaged in dancing. Most individuals appear to be middle-aged and older, and they are dressed predominantly in casual, comfortable attire that varies widely from simple, plain clothes to dresses and patterned shirts.\n\nThe setting is adorned with various decorations that include American flags and multiple large, circular beer brand logos and signs displayed prominently on the wood-paneled walls in the background. The room is illuminated by a combination of overhead lighting fixtures and is slightly blurred, which conveys motion and the lively energy of the dance.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a perspective that overlooks the dance floor, offering a snapshot of the festive atmosphere and social interaction among the attendees. The image has a nostalgic feel, reflecting a community or social gathering, possibly in a setting like a dance hall or social club.","title":"Polka dancing at the Gibbon Ballroom at Gibbon, Minnesota, 20 miles north of New Ulm. It was headquarters for Gibbon Polka Days, four days of dancing to both German and Polish polkas. The event attracted dancers from throughout the upper midwestern states. Polka dancing is an old New Ulm tradition which has regained popularity with young and old after a decline in the 1950's and 60's. More than 26 professional polka-waltz bands have formed and worked out of New Ulm since the 1930's.","placename":"Gibbon (Minn.)","location":"Gibbon, Minnesota","nn1":["547387","547334","547403","558286","547317","547371","547386","558285","547383","547271","547274","557790","551710","553241","557789","551019"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dance","room","dancing","club","beer","hall","venue","attendee","fixture","brand"]}
