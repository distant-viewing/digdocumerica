{"path":"555541.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph showcases a rural agricultural landscape, primarily focusing on a large garden or crop field. The field is segmented into neat, long rows, which appear to be delineated by white agricultural fabric laid on the ground to perhaps suppress weeds or retain moisture. The rows are interspersed with patches of dark soil, and crops are visible sprouting up in organized lines.\n\nWooden stakes vertically line the rows, possibly serving as supports for the plants or as markers. Toward the left side, lush greenery, potentially tall grasses or crops, lines one side of the field, suggesting the border of the cultivated area.\n\nIn the background, a rural scene is visible with a modest pale-colored house or mobile home amidst a grove of trees. The treesâ€™ foliage suggests it might be late spring or summer. The ambiance is serene and agricultural, hinting at a focus on small-scale farming or gardening. No people are visible in the shot, emphasizing a quiet and calm rural environment. The lighting is natural, indicating it is daytime, enhancing the vividness of the greenery and the contrast with the soil and white fabric in the fields.","title":"Truck garden on property adjoining the pennwalt corporation was contaminated from storage plant chemicals and resulted in dead and dying plants.
