{"path":"554204.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The image captures a rural farming scene where a man is operating a large agricultural tractor. The tractor is pulling a farm implement equipped with multiple seeding units that are mounted in a row. The tractor and implement are actively engaged in plowing or planting, as there's freshly turned dark soil visible behind the tractor and a clear demarcation line between the tilled soil and the untouched grassy field. The untouched grass is long and a lush green, contrasting sharply with the dark, fertile soil being worked by the tractor.\n\nThe man on the tractor is wearing typical outdoor farming attireâ€”darker clothing suitable for fieldwork. He is standing on the tractor, overlooking the equipment to perhaps monitor the planting process.\n\nThe background is fairly flat and expansive, typical of many agricultural regions, with a cloudy and overcast sky suggesting either early morning or late afternoon work. The horizon is straight and unbroken, emphasizing the width and open space of the farmland. The mood conveyed by the image is one of productivity and rural tranquility, underscored by the simplicity and focused activity of farming.","title":"On a farm near grygla, a retired farmer supplements his income by working land belonging to another man","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["557521","552577","555878","555879","553665","544319","544888","547436","554202","547297","554203","545893","548950","543667","547301","555619"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","farming","implement","planting","soil","plowing","productivity","demarcation","fieldwork","farmland"]}
