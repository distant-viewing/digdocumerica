{"path":"555181.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a natural scene focusing on a textured tree trunk and its surroundings. The tree trunk has a rugged, dark surface, showing deep, weathered creases and cracks that suggest age and exposure to the elements. On the tree, there is a cluster of small, light-colored mushrooms growing out, which adds a touch of brightness against the dark bark. These fungi are likely thriving in the damp, nutrient-rich environment provided by the tree's aged bark.\n\nAbove the mushrooms, there is an overhang of fern leaves displaying a reddish-brown color, which might indicate that it is either autumn or the ferns are dying. The ferns’ serpentine and overlapping fronds create a textured canopy over the section of the tree where the mushrooms grow.\n\nThe image is rich with natural details and textures, emphasizing a sense of depth and the intricacy of woodland ecosystems. It captures the essence of forest life, where organisms like fungi and plants coexist in a symbiotic relationship, contributing to the biodiversity and ecological balance of their environment. No human presence or human-made objects are visible, reinforcing the image’s focus on the tranquility and complexity of nature.","title":"Fungus growing on a stump burned with slash in a five-year-old clear-cut in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557616","555006","554974","554593","550792","555057","555188","557624","542749","555179","555001","555183","555008","555000","545288","551355"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["fern","bark","trunk","organism","frond","intricacy","biodiversity","tree","overhang","crack"]}
