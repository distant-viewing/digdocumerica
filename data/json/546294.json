{"path":"546294.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This image captures a group of four people engaged in an outdoor activity by the edge of a body of water, likely involved in some form of environmental study or water sampling. The backdrop features a serene waterscape with grassy shorelines and a cloudy sky, hinting at a natural, spacious outdoors setting.\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n1. A bare-chested man holding a long, metallic object, appearing to be either a pole or net handle, which extends out of the frame. He wears denim shorts and is partly in the water. His attention is directed towards the center of the group.\n\n2. A woman, centrally positioned, is dressed in a long-sleeve shirt and bell-bottom jeans. She wears eyeglasses and is visibly involved in examining something in the water, leaning forward with a focused expression. Her long blonde hair hangs loosely.\n\n3. Another man, also immersed in the task at hand, squats by the water. He is dressed in dark trousers with his sleeves rolled up, and his hair is notably tousled. He seems to be either placing or retrieving something from the water.\n\n4. Finally, a man on the far right is wearing a striped shirt, glasses, a bucket hat, and shorts. He is bending over the water, smoking a pipe, and holding some type of container, possibly collecting a sample from the water.\n\nCollectively, they display a scene of cooperation, possibly for environmental research, given their earnest engagement with their surroundings and the equipment in use. Their dress suggests a casual, practical approach suitable for fieldwork.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory biologists are on a field trip to a salt marsh.  Dr.  Al w.
