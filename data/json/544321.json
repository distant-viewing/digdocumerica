{"path":"544321.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph features an elderly woman standing in a sandy desert landscape during what appears to be late afternoon or early evening, judging by the soft lighting and long shadows. The woman is dressed in bright red clothing—a buttoned jacket and what looks like a skirt or pants—with a patterned scarf wrapped around her head and neck in shades of red, blue, and white. She gazes directly at the camera with a subtle, closed-mouth expression that conveys a sense of calm and dignity.\n\nThe background is a vast expanse of desert, with ripples in the sand indicating wind activity. Sparse vegetation is scattered throughout the sandy ground. In the distance, there are low-lying mountains or hills that form a natural horizon line under a sky beginning to change colors, possibly due to the setting sun.\n\nThe image itself shows signs of age or wear, with visible grain and minor spots, suggesting it might be a scan of an analog film photograph. The composition centers the woman both vertically and horizontally, emphasizing her presence against the vast, open landscape that surrounds her, highlighting a sense of isolation or solitude. The overall mood is serene yet poignant, capturing a moment of everyday life in a rugged environment.","title":"Navajo woman","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["545196","544404","544946","545755","554051","557157","545300","549037","555530","542548","548230","545753","547717","543864","551439","545199"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["desert","analog","woman","scarf","begin","grain","wrap","neck","mouth","button"]}
