{"path":"552760.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a group of about ten children crowding together to fit into the frame, all facing the camera with various expressions ranging from joyful smiles to curious gazes. Most of them are of African descent. They have different hairstyles, including closely cropped hair and natural curls. Their clothing is casual and colorful, featuring an assortment of patterns like stripes and plaids. Some wear solid color shirts, and one child has a jacket. The children’s expressions are engaging; several are smiling broadly, showing their teeth, while others have more subdued smiles or curious looks. The setting is quite plain, possibly an outdoor area with a pavement but the background is largely out of focus, putting the emphasis on the children’s faces and their dynamic expressions. The light appears natural, suggesting an overcast day which casts a soft illumination, accentuating the liveliness and innocence in the children's faces.","title":"North Philadelphia children","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556301","556437","552759","556135","545379","556265","546857","546821","556140","545509","553315","552958","547146","556139","555941","553511"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","smile","expression","face","tooth","descent","liveliness","innocence","put","curl"]}
