{"path":"551774.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a garden or flower exhibition under a large, striped tent. The tent's fabric, draped in bold alternating stripes of a dark gold and cream color, forms sweeping curves overhead, giving a vibrant and festive ambiance to the setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman is slightly out of focus. She is dressed in a light-colored coat and is seen from the side, looking towards the interior displays. Her presence adds a sense of scale and brings a human element to the scene.\n\nThe main focus of the image is the rich and colorful display of flowers arranged meticulously within the exhibition space. On the right, various flowers including chrysanthemums and other blossoms in shades of red, white, orange, and pink fill the scene, creating a lush and vibrant visual. The flowers are organized in carefully planned beds, segmented by small fences, possibly to guide viewing and preserve the exhibits.\n\nIn the background of the tent, other attendees can be observed. They appear to be browsing, walking, or standing as they enjoy the displays. The environment reflects a casual, yet orderly gathering, typical of a public exhibition or fair.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its dynamic tent structure and the arrangement of flowers under the soft lighting, creates a welcoming and festive atmosphere that highlights the beauty and allure of horticulture. The image immerses the viewer into a vibrant scene full of color, texture, and the enjoyment of nature curated for public appreciation.","title":"Annual flower show at Bryant Park, behind the main branch of the New York Public Library in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551773","551687","551698","551746","555372","550044","551833","550027","552400","552408","557792","553737","554111","551705","554106","553242"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["tent","exhibition","flower","display","allure","exhibit","blossom","appreciation","gold","attendee"]}
