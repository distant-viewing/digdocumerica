{"path":"546378.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a coastal scene dominated by the interaction of natural and man-made elements. On the left side of the image, a stack of large, weathered boulders stretches from the foreground into the midground, serving as a barrier between the beach and the churning sea. Scattered debris and smaller stones litter this rough barrier, possibly left by rising tides or previous storms.\n\nAdjacent to this natural barrier, a row of dilapidated buildings lines the coast. These structures, exhibiting signs of wear and exposure to harsh weather, vary in height and color, with peeling paint and rust evident, indicating long-term exposure to the coastal environment. The architecture suggests a mix of residential and possibly commercial uses. These buildings contribute to a sense of a lived-in, hardy community that faces the constant challenges of coastal life.\n\nIn the waters, four individuals (likely children based on their sizes and playful demeanor) are captured engaging with the sea. They appear to be in mid-motion, with arms raised, possibly throwing something into the water or playing a game. Their involvement with the sea underlines a scene of daily life where the ocean serves as a playground despite the evident roughness of the environment.\n\nIn the background, the sea extends to the horizon, meeting a sky scattered with clouds, indicating variable weather conditions typical of coastal regions. Toward the right, the coastline curves out of sight, hinting at a wider geographic context. The overall mood is a blend of stark resilience and vibrant daily life, encapsulating a coastal community's interaction with its harsh, yet playful, seaside environment.","title":"Atlantic beach","placename":"Arecibo (P.R.)","location":"Arecibo, Puero Rico","nn1":["552955","557423","543492","543139","553765","543288","543389","543310","547083","543309","547118","543242","545111","543291","545086","547602"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sea","barrier","exposure","weather","serve","churn","playground","life","throw","sight"]}
