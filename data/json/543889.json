{"path":"543889.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor camping scene by a river. The image shows a large, classic canvas tent with rolled-up flaps, positioned on a clearing by the riverside. The tent is erected amidst a natural setting with dense forest and fallen logs in the background, suggesting a remote or wilderness area.\n\nIn front of the tent, on the riverbank, there are four people. Two of them seem to be sitting close to each other, engaged in conversation, while the other two are slightly apart, seeming to be in a relaxed or contemplative pose. They all appear to be enjoying the setting and the company, engaging casually.\n\nThe river in the foreground is a prominent element of the composition, its waters appearing rough and choppy, indicating either a windy day or a swift current. The lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with the sunlight casting a warm glow and deep shadows in the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and leisurely, evoking a sense of escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and immersion into nature and tranquility.","title":"Camping along the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["549450","554464","548796","550977","544855","548748","548797","545293","545684","554480","545698","554181","545500","557147","554863","557743"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["tent","flap","immersion","canvas","escape","hustle","camping","current","company","riverside"]}
