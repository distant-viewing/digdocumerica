{"path":"547745.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a solitary egret in flight, captured against a clear sky with a gradient of blue tones. The egret is positioned near the center of the image, slightly towards the left, and is depicted from a side view with its body oriented horizontally. Its wings are gracefully outstretched, with the wingtips slightly upturned, illustrating the bird's delicate yet powerful flying posture. The egret's long neck is stretched forward, aligning with its pointed beak, while its legs extend straight back, following the line of the body.\n\nThe background is a smooth, plain sky with no clouds or other elements, which accentuates the simplicity and elegance of the bird's form. The lighting in the image suggests a daylight setting with ample natural light, enhancing the whiteness of the egret and casting subtle shadows that define the bird's structure and feathers. The overall composition emphasizes tranquility and the beauty of natural motion.","title":"Egret in flight over the Colorado river indian reservation","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544616","544631","548732","544842","544482","544516","547593","544478","545967","543922","557204","544486","545142","544846","548731","544489"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","bird","beak","elegance","feather","wing","flight","fly","ample","neck"]}
