{"path":"543902.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man standing behind a glass door with hand-written messages. The man, wearing glasses and a dark suit with a light-colored shirt and a tie, is waving his hand, visible through the glass. On the glass are several messages written in white, possibly with paint. The visible texts read \"FISH\", \"BAKED-HAM\", \"ORDERS TO-DAY\", \"THIS IS AN EMERGENCY TO EVACUATE SAT. MON.\" â€” suggesting a context of urgency or an emergency situation, possibly related to an evacuation directive.\n\nThe door frame is metallic blue, and there are additional snippets of paper and notices pinned or taped to the inside of the door, less visible and partially obscured by the reflections and writings on the glass. The ambiance suggests a commercial setting, possibly a small shop or food establishment, as indicated by the context of food in the messages. The use of the door for communication, the casual attire of the man, and the informal handwritten notes suggest a personal or small business environment dealing with a crisis or important public message.","title":"Bud herling, a Portland evacuee closes his restaurant.
