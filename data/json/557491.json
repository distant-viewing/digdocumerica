{"path":"557491.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene with a vintage tan or beige colored car on the right-hand side of the frame. Inside the car, we see a man sitting in the driver's seat, looking directly towards the camera. He is wearing sunglasses and appears to be either talking or smiling. \n\nThe foreground of the photo is dominated by three geese. These geese are mostly white with some grey feather accents. They are standing on what looks like a dirt road or a muddy surface, pecking at the ground. The middle goose is facing towards the left, while the other two are directed more towards the camera as they forage. \n\nThe background of the image is shadowy and indistinct, with only a hint of some sparse vegetation or trees seen in very soft focus, suggesting the setting is either a rural or a semi-rural area. The lighting in the image suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, providing a warm tone over the scene. The overall ambience of the image captures a quaint and somewhat serene moment, bridging human elements with nature.","title":"Motorist feeds birds at the Buena Vista Lagoon. The wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. There is concern for the body of water because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["556987","557122","557120","553346","546086","552585","558091","546093","547185","555823","557126","557370","546092","557490","548303","552780"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["tan","feather","ambience","accent","camera","seat","driver","car","sunglass","dirt"]}
