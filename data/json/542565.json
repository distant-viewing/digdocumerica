{"path":"542565.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural waste management, specifically involving the disposal or recycling of chemical containers. The image shows multiple large, open containers filled to the brim with discarded plastic and cardboard packaging. These containers appear to be standard industrial bins mounted on trailers for ease of transportation.\n\nThe setting is a wide-open area with a flat and barren dirt ground, which suggests an outdoor facility possibly located on a farm or near an agricultural processing area. The background features a large, flat horizon under a clear sky, indicating that the location is likely rural and expansive.\n\nEach bin is overflowing with materials, including boxes that once contained products like \"Milk Guard\" and other agricultural or dairy supplies, as evidenced by the readable labels on the discarded packaging. The containers are organized in a line extending down the left side of the image, leading the eye towards the back where more containers and some agricultural machinery can get glimpsed.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the volume and types of waste produced by agricultural processes, highlighting environmental challenges related to disposal and recycling of farm chemicals and supplies.","title":"Fresno County does not provide a dumping place for chemical containers.
