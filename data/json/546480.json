{"path":"546480.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This image depicts a tranquil, scenic view featuring an intriguing architectural setup on a lush, grass-covered hill. At the forefront, there are three distinct, unusually-shaped structures with sharply angled, pyramid-like roofs. Each building is adorned with a steeply pointed spire that enhances its unique, geometric form. These structures create a striking contrast against the simplicity of the surrounding landscape.\n\nPositioned around these unique buildings are bare trees, which appear to be in a dormant state, suggesting that the season could be either late fall or early winter. The leafless branches of the trees contribute to a slightly stark, yet peaceful atmosphere, adding an organic texture against the smooth lines of the building roofs.\n\nThe sky above presents a diffuse, soft light, likely from an overcast day, casting gentle hues across the scene. There is no immediate presence of people or animals in the image, which adds an element of solitude and quietness to the overall environment.\n\nThis photograph captures a moment of architectural curiosity blended seamlessly with a natural landscape, likely designed to evoke a sense of serenity and contemplation. The composition balances man-made structures with natural elements effectively, creating a harmonious and visually engaging scene.","title":"First baptist church, designed by harry weese and built in 1965","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546463","546473","546472","556644","546468","557952","544565","546464","544561","546484","546455","556628","546534","546469","543580","546481"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["sharply","quietness","roofs","spire","serenity","intrigue","curiosity","diffuse","contemplation","simplicity"]}
