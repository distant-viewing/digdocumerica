{"path":"543926.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a series of towering electricity pylons captured at either sunrise or sunset, based on the ambiance and positioning of the sun. The setting sun, centrally placed within the frame, casts a warm golden light and creates silhouettes of the pylons. The composition emphasizes the intricate metallic structure of these pylons, which consist of numerous crossbars, beams, and wires. The arrangement of these interconnected pylons forms a complex grid, with the sun appearing amidst this grid, adding depth and a focal point to the scene. The background is washed in a hazy sky, indicating that the image was either taken during an early or late part of the day. The overall effect of light and shadow highlights the industrial nature of these structures within the context of their environment.","title":"Power lines at the P.H.
