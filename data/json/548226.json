{"path":"548226.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of an elderly man. He has aged facial features, including prominent wrinkles and a gentle expression. His eyes look directly at the camera, creating an intimate and engaging connection with the viewer. His face is partially illuminated, accentuating his facial details and expression.\n\nThe man is wearing a distinctive hat with a floral pattern in shades of red and yellow, adorned with a brown pom-pom on top. This adds a quirky and colorful element to his appearance. He is also dressed in what appears to be a dark, possibly navy blue, sweater which is visible at the lower edge of the photograph.\n\nThe background of the photo is quite simple, a uniform, possibly foggy or overcast sky, contributing to the focus primarily being on the man. The lack of distinct background details ensures that the viewer's attention remains on the man and his expressive face and unique hat. The overall composition of the photograph, the lighting, and the depth of field used focuses the viewer's attention effectively on the subject's face and hat, creating a portrait that is both characterful and visually arresting.","title":"Swedish painter now living in rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["554857","547282","548236","548224","552103","547179","548616","556133","548251","554858","544409","542613","556452","556563","553091","548218"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hat","viewer","face","man","intimate","wrinkle","portrait","ensure","expression","attention"]}
