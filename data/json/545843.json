{"path":"545843.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph showcases a desert landscape. In the foreground, the terrain is covered with patches of dry grass and clumps of shrubbery, interspersed with open, dusty ground that appears light grayish-white, possibly indicating dry or salty conditions. In the middle ground, there are numerous thicker shrubs and a few sparse, thin trees scattered across the area. The background is dominated by a broad, flat landscape, upon which a distinct mountain rises. This mountain is symmetrical in shape and has a soft silhouette, suggesting distance and a hazy atmosphere, typical of arid regions. The sky above appears clear. The lighting in the image is natural, with the landscape bathed in sunlight, enhancing the textures of the ground and vegetation. Overall, the composition effectively conveys the barren and dry nature of the desert environment.","title":"Hail storm in desert","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544027","544401","544016","545895","552923","545789","545579","547717","549183","545771","545583","545575","555642","544874","544879","552897"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","clumps","grayish","mountain","ground","shrubbery","bath","shrub","intersperse","landscape"]}
