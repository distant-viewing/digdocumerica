{"path":"549345.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph showcases a quiet, intimate moment between two people on the bow of a boat. At the forefront, there are two individuals, a woman and a man, standing close together. The woman, wearing a bikini, is leaning slightly into the man as they both gaze out towards the sea. The man, clad in a casual white T-shirt and jeans, has his arm gently wrapped around the woman, adding a sense of closeness and protection.\n\nThe background features a serene seascape with calm blue waters. In the distance lies a rocky island upon which a lighthouse is situated. This structure seems to be a classic stone building, topped with a prominent lighthouse beacon. The lighthouse and the island help to create a peaceful maritime setting, indicating the vastness and beauty of the sea juxtaposed with human navigation aids. This setting and the positioning of the couple suggest a shared exploration or travel theme, highlighting moments of leisure and discovery.","title":"Zoology students from the University of Vienna participate in a scientific cruise on the hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II.
