{"path":"556127.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant urban scene, possibly from a city's downtown area. The focus of the image is on a large red brick tower with a clock, prominently displaying the time. On the tower, there is a sign with the text \"GO BY TRAIN\" and \"UNION STATION,\" indicating that this is likely a historic or central train station.\n\nThe foreground shows a busy street lined with vehicles typical of a late 20th-century setting. Cars are seen parked along the side of the street, and there is also some distant traffic. Street signs and traffic lights are visible, enhancing the urban feel.\n\nThe background includes other buildings with varying architectural styles and a distinct sky that is clear and blue, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day.\n\nStreet lamps are aligned along the sidewalk, and there are minimal pedestrians visible, focusing the viewer's attention more on the architecture and the station's tower. Additionally, some greenery is visible, which adds a touch of nature to the urban environment.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a slice of city life centered around a significant public transportation hub.","title":"Union-station in Portland, Oregon, one of 450 passenger train terminals serviced by amtrak in 1974.
