{"path":"555460.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a retro urban scene featuring a man seen from behind, standing in a parking lot. He wears a fashionable long brown coat over a dark shirt paired with blue jeans. In his right hand, he holds a red gasoline can. His attention seems directed towards a specific point or event outside the frame, possibly involving cars or a nearby building.\n\nIn the background, an array of vintage cars is visible, depicting a mix of models typical of the late 1960s or early 1970s. The most prominent vehicle, just in front of the man, is a brown Pontiac with a curved rear design and a license plate from Oregon, labeled \"EGK 207.\"\n\nBehind the scene of cars, an urban setting unfolds with visible signage for a Toyota dealership, hinting at the location typeâ€”a commercial area focused on automobile sales. The atmosphere hints at a cloudy or overcast day, given the muted lighting and soft shadows. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the back of the man and the assortment of cars, gives a glimpse into a moment of everyday life, potentially during an era when personal transportation and car culture held significant sway in American society.","title":"Some motorists ran out of gas such as this man in Portland and had to stand in line with a gas can during the fuel crisis in the Pacific Northwest.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["549885","553488","557834","555457","556201","549858","553833","555458","557016","555465","555475","553491","555502","545351","549882","555944"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","dealership","gasoline","sway","retro","license","unfold","automobile","culture","assortment"]}
