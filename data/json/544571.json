{"path":"544571.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring a prairie or meadow environment. The primary subject is a whitetail deer moving through the wetland, possibly grazing or searching for food. The deer, positioned towards the center-left of the frame, is depicted in mid-stride, suggesting movement. It is surrounded by tall grasses, which dominate the foreground and partially obscure lower parts of the deer's body.\n\nThe landscape is flat, indicating that the area might be a lowland or wet prairie. The colors in the image are muted, with a range of green and brown tones that suggest this photo could have been taken during late summer or early autumn. The background displays a line of trees and shrubs, providing a notion of the boundary of the meadow or the start of a forested area. The sky, although overcast with soft, diffused lighting, hints at a cloudy or overcast day, which complements the tranquility of the scene.\n\nThis setting and the lone deer contribute to a calm, undisturbed wild environment, potentially illustrating the natural beauty and solitude of wildlife habitats.","title":"White tail deer in everglades","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["545902","542955","558368","544114","549219","544623","543279","543369","544916","546163","545898","552697","544914","553808","542963","554621"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","prairie","meadow","notion","search","graze","start","wetland","food","boundary"]}
