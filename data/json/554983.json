{"path":"554983.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense thicket of woody shrubs or small trees. The foliage is lush, with a variety of green tones ranging from light to dark. New leaf growth can be seen, indicating it might be spring or early summer. The branches are thin and numerous, crisscrossing throughout the image, which provides a texture of natural chaos. There are no significant gaps in the vegetation, and the entirety of the frame is filled with plant material, showing no visible sky or ground. The background is completely obscured by the closeness of the shrubs, creating a sense of depth despite the uniformity in the content. There are no people, animals, or man-made structures visible in the image; it focuses solely on the dense vegetation. The overall impression is one of wild, untamed growth, possibly indicating a natural area or a less-manicured section of a park or rural environment.","title":"Natural willow monoculture caused by saturated soil in a wet bottom meadow of willows in the Simpson Sustained Yield Unit in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
