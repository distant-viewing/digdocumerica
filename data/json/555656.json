{"path":"555656.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking landscape dominated by a large, snow-covered mountain in the background, which stands dramatically against a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The mountainâ€™s peak and ridges are blanketed in a thick layer of snow, highlighting its rugged texture and massive scale.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense forest of evergreen trees covers the terrain, presenting varying shades of dark green. These trees appear thick and lush, stretching across the entire lower portion of the image and serving as a natural frame for the mountain in the distance.\n\nThe composition of the image emphasizes the contrast between the serene, untouched snow on the mountain and the dense, life-filled forest below. The perspective suggests the photo was taken from a considerable distance, allowing for a wide, unobstructed view of the natural scenery. No human activity or presence is visible, reinforcing the sense of remote wilderness captured in the scene.","title":"Mount drum (elevation 12,002 feet) seen from copper center looking east.
