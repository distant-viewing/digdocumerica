{"path":"558092.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image portrays a serene and somewhat mysterious scene centered on a single duck quietly floating on a dark body of water. The photograph is taken at a low light condition, likely either at twilight or night, enhancing the moody and tranquil ambiance of the setting.\n\nThe duck, which is the focal point of the image, appears to be a typical species, possibly a mallard, characterized by its distinct plumage textures and patterns illuminated by a subtle light source. The light is primarily hitting the side of the duck, highlighting its features in a gentle glow against the otherwise dark environment, which creates a striking contrast. \n\nThe body of the water is calm, with minimal disturbances or ripples around the duck, reflecting the light and contributing to the dark, mirror-like surface. The background is mostly obscured by the darkness, allowing the viewer to focus almost entirely on the illuminated figure of the duck and the reflective quality of the water.\n\nThere are no visible landmarks or additional subjects in the immediate surroundings, emphasizing a feeling of isolation and tranquility. This composition predominantly uses darkness and minimal light to evoke a sense of quietness and simplicity. The overall mood is peaceful, with a touch of mystery due to the dimly lit setting.","title":"Mallard drake (male) searches for food at a lake in the Virginia Kendall Park which is a part of the Akron, Ohio metropolitan park system.
