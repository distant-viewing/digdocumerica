{"path":"547408.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man outdoors collecting water from a resource. The man, who appears to be older with some facial hair, is wearing a dark uniform adorned with a badge on his left arm, suggesting he may be part of a service or organization. His headgear resembles a chef's hat with a striped pattern. He is kneeling on the ground amidst lush green vegetation, possibly indicating a water-rich area such as a wetland or spring.\n\nHe is holding a white plastic cup in his right hand and placing it under a clear, powerful stream of water that seems to be gushing out from a pipe or hose obscured by his body and the dense foliage. The expression on his face is focused and slightly intent, indicative of his engagement in the task. The surroundings are natural and open, with a flat horizon stretching across a wide landscape under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe entire scene presents a moment of human interaction with nature, possibly related to environmental monitoring, water collection for testing, or a similar activity. The uniform and badge suggest an official or professional undertaking, while the simplicity of the equipment (plastic cup) and the pristine environment emphasize a raw and direct interaction with the natural resource.","title":"Dick Christian takes a drink from an artesian well south of Beaver Crossing.
