{"path":"550429.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic natural landscape under what appears to be low light or nighttime conditions. The central visual element is the bright sun located at the top center-right of the image, positioned low in the sky, either during sunset or sunrise. It casts a vivid glare and light reflections over the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, the land is dark and primarily covered with rocky terrain, with small stones and debris visible; the details of these elements are mostly obscured by the dim lighting. A layer of mist or low clouds stretches horizontally across the middle ground, creating a thin, eerie strip of white which separates the land from the mountains in the background.\n\nThe background features a silhouette of a mountain range that spans the horizon from one side of the frame to the other. The mountains are uneven in height, contributing to a rugged and natural skyline. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is somber and mysterious, emphasized by the dark tones and the isolated bright light from the sun. The composition and lighting might suggest the photograph is capturing either an early morning or a late evening moment in a remote, wild location.","title":"Early morning (5 a.m.) sun over the Atigun Gorge and Galbraith Lake.
