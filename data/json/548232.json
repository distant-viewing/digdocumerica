{"path":"548232.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph depicts a seemingly tranquil scene centered around a window of a wooden-clad building. A young woman with long hair appears deep in thought or observing something intently outside of the window. She's inside the building, peering out. The window, divided into six panes by white-painted wooden frames, includes a sill adorned with various objects. On the sill, there's a potted plant with large leaves and a couple of other smaller items that might be decorative or functional, though they're not entirely clear in the image.\n\nThe exterior of the building is textured with wooden shingles, some tinted dark gray and others in a natural wood tone, suggesting weathering or varying materials. The interplay of these muted, natural colors contributes to a rustic and serene atmosphere. Light reflecting off the window pane adds a soft glow to the scene, enhancing the contemplative mood evoked by the woman's expression and posture. \n\nOverall, this is a detailed, homely image with a focus on texture, light, and the quiet moment captured of a young woman at the window.","title":"Simple Rockport window.
