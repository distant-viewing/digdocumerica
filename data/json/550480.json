{"path":"550480.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged mountain landscape characterized by dark, jagged cliffs forming a dramatic backdrop. The terrain is strewn with loose rocks and boulders, suggesting an inhospitable and desolate environment. The color palette is mostly composed of varying shades of gray and brown, adding to the starkness of the scene.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a canyon-like feature, where the rocky walls converge into a narrow passage that appears to lead deeper into the mountain. The sky is notably absent, which emphasizes the towering and oppressive nature of the cliffs around the edges of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting in the image is subdued, which might suggest that it was taken either during dawn or dusk, or under overcast conditions. There are no signs of vegetation or wildlife, and no human presence or man-made structures are visible, which underscores the natural and untouched aspect of the landscape. The composition effectively conveys a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of an untamed geological formation.","title":"Detail of the cliffs of peak 5308, where eagles and falcons nest.
