{"path":"548015.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area adjacent to a large river. The image prominently features a vast, organized parking lot filled with numerous cars in a variety of colors. These cars are neatly parked in rows and sections, separated by white lines painted on the asphalt surface.\n\nIn the foreground of the photo, there are several rows of empty parking spaces, suggesting a much larger parking capacity. The middle part of the image shows the packed car lots, while further back, there is a docking area with warehouses and storage tanks. Several trucks and cargo containers are visible near the warehouses, indicating ongoing industrial or shipping activities.\n\nTo the left side of the image, a portion of a river is visible, along with docks and a docked ship, enhancing the industrial vibe of the scene. The opposite side of the river features a lush tree line, providing a natural boundary across the horizon.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph offers a contrasting view of organized human activity with the chaotic natural environment, emphasizing themes of industry, transportation, and commerce.","title":"Portland's splendid port is deep enough for the largest ships.
