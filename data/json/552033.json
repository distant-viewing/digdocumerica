{"path":"552033.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting where various activities are taking place. In the foreground, there is a large tree on the left, under which a person is sitting on the grass and seems engaged in reading or a similar activity. This person is positioned at a distance from two other groups of people.\n\nOn the right side of the tree, toward the center of the image, there is a group of four children and one adult. The children are standing and appear to be interacting playfully, with some of the children seemingly bending down slightly, perhaps picking something up or inspecting the ground. The adult is standing nearer to the children, watching over them or possibly engaging with them.\n\nIn the background, an expansive grassy field extends towards a large body of water, which can be seen at the far end of the image. The water and the distant shoreline create a calm and scenic backdrop. The scene is bathed in soft, natural light, suggestive of either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph reflects a tranquil outdoor environment, emphasizing leisure and interaction with nature. The presence of both adults and children suggests a recreational outing or a family gathering in a park or similar public space.","title":"Children playing in the early evening on goat island surrounded by the niagara river, the island separates the american and canadian Niagara Falls and offers spectacular views","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553065","551682","552036","543892","557410","545293","554072","555947","547756","545267","557985","545311","550827","549716","551017","557939"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","adult","reading","pick","group","outing","person","inspect","outdoor","family"]}
