{"path":"547202.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an older male on the front porch of a residential building, engaging in the activity of sweeping the steps. The architecture of the building features a blue exterior with a central doorway flanked by two windows. Each window has blinds or curtains drawn shut. On the door, a red sign stating \"FOR RENT\" is visible.\n\nThe man is dressed in casual attire, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and shorts, and he is using a traditional broom to clean the steps. The porch itself is adorned with well-maintained flower pots placed symmetrically along the edges, adding a touch of color and life to the scene. The steps, made from a light-colored concrete or stone material, lead up to the wrought-iron railing that outlines the small, elevated porch. Adjacent to the staircase on the right side is a small patch of well-kept lawn, and a decorative white fence encloses a section of the yard.\n\nOverall, the scene captures everyday domestic life and maintenance, set against the backdrop of a quaint and modest home. The clear sky suggests a bright, sunny day, enhancing the vivid colors of the building and the surrounding environment.","title":"Sweeping the front steps","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["546437","547792","557638","548556","556488","557407","556489","545232","548660","557286","549845","546992","555580","547812","555615","556603"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["step","porch","broom","blind","sweep","clean","pot","iron","staircase","curtain"]}
