{"path":"548507.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant scene on the water featuring a group of people aboard a uniquely designed boat. The boat, prominently painted in red with black trimmings, features an ornate, dragon-inspired design likely meant to resemble a Viking or medieval-style ship. Notable details include its high, curved prow and stern, intricate decorations, and a red and black color scheme.\n\nA red flag with a black design flutters on a mast, and the boat is equipped with wooden oars lining its sides. There are multiple individuals on board: some appear to be rowing or adjusting parts of the boat, while others are engaged in handling the sails or ropes. The attire of the crew suggests a casual setting, with most wearing everyday, modern clothes like t-shirts and shorts, contrasting with the historical design of the boat.\n\nIn the background, the calm blue waters of a lake or sea stretch out, dotted by another small craft in the distance. The far shore is lined with trees and low-lying buildings, possibly indicating a suburban or semi-urban area. The sky is clear and bright, contributing to the overall vividness of the scene. This image captures a moment of active participation and enjoyment in a maritime setting, rich with historical overtones.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548509","549410","549411","549419","549414","549415","548524","549412","549418","549420","549413","550029","543952","548503","546809","549416"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","trimming","design","oar","participation","craft","crew","mast","maritime","stretch"]}
