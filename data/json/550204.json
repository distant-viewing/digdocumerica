{"path":"550204.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban riverside scene in what appears to be a deteriorating industrial area. The foreground shows a murky waterbody reflecting light, with debris floating on the surface. To the right, a large concrete pipe discharges into the river, surrounded by unkempt grass and a makeshift wooden retaining structure, suggesting neglect or disuse.\n\nThe midground features older brick buildings. One building has a visible advertisement for Marlboro, placed on its side, indicating commercial usage or occupancies in the area. Overhead power lines and a street lamp are also visible, contributing to the urban scenery.\n\nIn the background, dominating the cityscape, stands a tall historical building with elaborate architecture and a prominent tower, indicative of older metropolitan structures possibly from the early 20th century. This juxtaposition of the decaying industrial foreground against the historical urban setting provides a stark contrast that underscores themes of industrial decline and urban change.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber, enhanced by the overcast sky and a sense of quiet desolation, emphasizing themes of urban decay and environmental neglect.","title":"City pump station (low brick building) discharges sewage into the Cuyahoga River, Terminal Tower in background.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547582","546903","553393","547622","546785","553462","548357","557233","551559","550729","547890","546886","551562","550725","550947","550214"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["neglect","waterbody","discharge","decline","theme","disuse","usage","riverside","desolation","advertisement"]}
