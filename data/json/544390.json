{"path":"544390.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features an industrial or mining landscape dominated by rough terrain. The setting includes rocky hills with little vegetation, indicating a barren, possibly arid environment. The center of the image is occupied by a large, black area with a tar-like appearance, suggesting spilled or processed material, possibly oil or a related substance.\n\nThere are industrial machines at work: one that is visible in the distance seems to be either extracting from or depositing the black material. This machine is emitting smoke or steam, contributing to the gritty, industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nAdditionally, a trail or small road appears to be cut through the black material and the ground, leading toward the machinery, providing access across the rugged landscape. The lighting in the photograph suggests late afternoon or evening, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the earth and sky. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of industry set against a natural but stark landscape, highlighting the contrast between human activity and the raw features of the terrain.","title":"Cut in Moenkopi Wash","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["554764","544139","543642","552004","555634","554804","554811","554763","549965","544048","552427","543992","544418","555633","554765","554632"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["machine","material","substance","oil","trail","one","terrain","access","steam","mining"]}
