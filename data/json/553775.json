{"path":"553775.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning and rugged coastal landscape. The scene is predominantly composed of layered rock formations that appear to be sedimentary, indicating years of erosion and geological activity. The coastline is jagged, with steep cliffs descending to the ocean where the waves crash energetically against the rocks, creating white foam.\n\nThe ocean is a deep blue, with multiple shades evident due to the play of light and the depth of the water. The waves vary in intensity and size, suggesting a strong current and possibly windy conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe clarity and color saturation of the image suggest that it might have been taken on a bright, sunny day, given the shadows and the vivid contrast between land and water.\n\nIn the scene, there are at least two individuals visible, appearing minuscule against the vastness of the natural landscape. They are located on a flat section of the rock, close to the waterâ€™s edge, which points to the scale of the cliffs and the height above sea level.\n\nThe backdrop features more of the rugged terrain slowly fading into the distance under a clear sky, which adds to the remote and windswept atmosphere of the location. This secluded and dramatic setting conveys a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of a natural, untouched coastline.","title":"Part of a conservation zone along highway 72.
