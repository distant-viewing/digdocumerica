{"path":"553288.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a yellow van, focusing particularly on the passenger's window area overflowing with colorful balloons. The balloons inside the van are decorated with symbols and phrases promoting peace. Notably, one balloon is adorned with the American flag another with prominent peace symbols.\n\nThe window decals add further interest to the scene; they include floral patterns and a prominent sticker with the peace symbol integrated into the design, along with the word \"Peace\" in bold script. The window pane partially reflects nearby surroundings and displays light artifacts which add a gleaming effect, enhancing the overall vibrant setting of the image.\n\nThe interior of the van remains largely hidden, obscured by the multitude of balloons, suggesting a festive or celebratory occasion, possibly part of a peace rally or a public, social event based around themes of unity and peace. The scene evokes a sense of the 1970s American counterculture, focused on peace and community events, conveyed through the symbolic imagery and the vintage style of the van.","title":"Balloons will be released in Fountain Square at noontime to announce opening of Carthage Fair in Cincinnati.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["554391","557709","543856","555477","557715","546991","548802","547758","545335","544329","548272","552615","553272","543132","554368","557148"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["peace","balloon","symbol","van","decal","unity","script","window","imagery","sticker"]}
