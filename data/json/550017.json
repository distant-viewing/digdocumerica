{"path":"550017.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and active winter scene at a ski slope. The foreground features silhouetted figures of two individuals, likely a couple, seated and facing away from the viewer towards the snow-covered slope. They appear relaxed, possibly enjoying a break or watching other skiers. Between them, to the right, an ornate lamp post adds an element of quaint charm to the setting. They are partially framed on the left side by what appears to be a wooden fence, and ski equipment is liberally strewn or standing nearby, suggesting they are skiers taking a rest.\n\nBeyond this intimate foreground, the main activity unfolds on the ski slope itself. Numerous skiers are scattered across the wide, white hill, some descending while others are stationary or climbing. The slope is equipped with ski lifts, shown by cables and poles that rise up the hill, facilitating access to the higher reaches of the hill.\n\nThe environment is brightly lit by what seems a clear, sunny winter day, casting sharp shadows and giving the snow a gleaming quality. Trees line the sides of the ski run, their bare branches hinting at the season. The overall mood is one of lively winter recreation, a common sight in ski resorts where enthusiasts of all ages engage in skiing.","title":"The great blue hill ski slopes are 10 miles from the center of Boston, and can be reached by street car and bus.
