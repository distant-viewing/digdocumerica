{"path":"552549.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The image features a scenic outdoor landscape characterized by a variety of dense vegetation, primarily made up of shrubs and flowering plants in the foreground. These plants exhibit a rich array of greens and are interspersed with yellow flowering tops, likely wildflowers. The landscape gradually descends to expose a curving dirt road that meanders through the terrain, bordered by similar dense shrubbery. \n\nIn the background, the terrain extends into a distant horizon, showing slight variations in elevation and a vast expanse that suggests a panoramic view of a large natural area. The horizon is faint, likely due to the atmospheric conditions or the time of day. The sky is visible and notably clear, adding a sense of depth and openness to the image.\n\nThis photograph captures a typical natural setting that might be found in a large park or rural wilderness area, emphasizing the calm and secluded environment away from urban areas. The overall composition uses the curving road to draw the eye towards the distant landscape, hinting at exploratory pathways and a connection with nature.","title":"Federal oil shale lease site in Piceance Basin, semi-arid land covered with sagebrush and small pinon and juniper trees.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552553","549225","557099","549236","549123","550536","557189","552903","545588","544860","547540","557549","557098","557537","555671","550614"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["shrubbery","openness","plant","wildflower","elevation","horizon","variation","road","terrain","connection"]}
