{"path":"549447.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and adventurous scene of river rafting. The setting is a turbulent river characterized by frothy, white-capped waves dominating the foreground. This rough water reflects the sunlight, creating glittering sparkles across its uneven surface.\n\nIn the background, a group of people is visible on a raft, navigating through the choppy water. The raft appears small in comparison to the surrounding landscape, emphasizing the vastness and wildness of the environment. The rafters, though distant and not distinctly visible in detail, show a sense of motion and teamwork as they seemingly paddle through the challenging river currents.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features steep, rocky mountain slopes covered with patches of lush green vegetation. These mountains rise dramatically on either side of the river, casting shadows and adding to the rugged and enclosed feel of the river valley.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the powerful river in the foreground and the human activity subtly integrated into the harsh natural setting, highlights a moment full of action and interaction with nature. The color palette is rich with deep blues and greens, punctuated by the white of the rapids, conveying a cool and adventurous atmosphere.","title":"Raft begins dizzying plunge down wild sheep rapid on the snake river.
