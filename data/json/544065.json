{"path":"544065.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of a traffic light against a clear blue sky. The traffic light is displayed in a vertical orientation with three sections, although only the upper two parts are visible in the image. The top section is illuminated with a red light, indicating that it is currently signaling 'stop'. Attached to the sides of the traffic light, and somewhat obscuring it, are a few large spiderwebs, indicating that the light has not been cleaned recently and suggesting an urban environment with some level of neglect or low maintenance.\n\nIn terms of the traffic light's details, it is housed in a dark casing, likely a durable material to withstand weather conditions. The casing has a flat front but rounded edges, typical of many modern traffic light designs. Thereâ€™s a horizontal arm that extends from a pole, which the traffic light is mounted on, emphasizing the often robust infrastructure required for such urban fittings.\n\nThe sky behind the traffic light provides a stark, vivid backdrop, giving a crisp contrast to the dark-colored traffic light and its slightly grimy appearance. This composition draws attention both to the functionality of the traffic light as a crucial element of traffic management and to its interaction with the natural environment, shown by the spiderwebs.","title":"Bird rests in traffic light at Roosevelt and 23rd Street.","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["554308","557881","548057","557276","557431","547666","557278","546725","549281","550200","549861","556193","546707","556194","546730","548445"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","light","withstand","fitting","orientation","clean","section","require","signal","stop"]}
