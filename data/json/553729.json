{"path":"553729.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a rectangular sign prominently displayed in the foreground on the left side of the image. The sign is attached to a slender metal pole and reads, “UNLAWFUL TO LITTER HIGHWAY $100 FINE” in black lettering on a beige background. Beneath this statement, additional text provides a legal section reference: \"SEC. 267-9R. L.H.55.\" \n\nThe sign is situated beside a road, with its background showing a grassy area littered with various pieces of trash, which includes paper and plastic items, effectively highlighting the irony of the sign’s message against the litter-strewn environment. The surrounding area features a road on the left, flanked by tall green foliage and shrubs, which form a natural border. The composition captures the contrast between the clear admonition of the sign and the visible disregard for this directive on the ground. The image evokes themes about environmental conservation, regulations, and societal behavior concerning public cleanliness.","title":"Kamchamcha Highway south of Mililani Town is littered","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["545517","552084","545298","547895","546386","557551","544813","548158","546805","544177","550258","547992","545617","547827","543664","544845"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","disregard","statement","reference","cleanliness","behavior","regulation","litter","conservation","border"]}
