{"path":"545002.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph portrays a man seated at a laboratory table, engrossed in his work. He has an analytical demeanor, closely ogling something on the table. The man is dressed in a smart, short-sleeved orange shirt and wears glasses. His posture and facial expression suggest deep concentration.\n\nAround him are various scientific apparatus and laboratory equipment that establish the setting as a chemistry laboratory. In the background, different sizes of beakers, a funnel, test tubes, and racks filled with chemicals can be spotted, all arranged on the table and on shelves near a window. The light from the window enhances the visibility of the lab tools and chemicals, giving a natural lighting effect to the scene.\n\nOn the table directly in front of him, there is a notebook or ledger open with notes or data visible. Next to the notebook, there is a mechanical device, possibly a scale or another measuring instrument. In close proximity, there are more laboratory supplies, such as bottles with chemicals, in a holder.\n\nOverall, the composition and objects visible suggest that the man is a scientist or researcher performing experiments or making observations, possibly related to chemistry or a related field. The surrounding laboratory paraphernalia supports his activity, emphasizing a professional and meticulous work environment.","title":"Bill Parks, from Oregon State University in his Mobile water testing lab.
