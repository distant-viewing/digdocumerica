{"path":"544908.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene presumably in a natural, rocky outdoor setting. The image is dominated by a snake, which is coiled and winding across the frame. The snake's skin is marked with a pattern of dark and lighter brown patches, effectively camouflaging it against the rocky terrain.\n\nThe texture of the rock where the snake lies is rough, featuring a mix of gray and light brown tones. The rock surface is interspersed with various small plants and mosses, adding to the complexity of the scene. Some dead leaves, yellow flowers, and strands of what appear to be dried grass or roots are also visible, contributing to the diversity of the natural environment depicted. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph is natural, possibly captured during daylight given the bright and clear visibility. The background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the snake in the foreground and giving a greater depth to the image. This photograph portrays a moment in the wilderness, highlighting the adaptive and camouflaging abilities of the snake in its natural habitat.","title":"Harmless bull snake great sand dunes national monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["549459","544904","543286","555065","544900","545561","551375","551366","543778","545553","543549","551250","551374","558083","554596","551331"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snake","camouflage","coil","strand","root","rock","skin","diversity","dry","moss"]}
