{"path":"556401.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at an industrial site, specifically what appears to be a coke plant or a section of a steel mill. The setting is robust with industrial activity and features multiple key elements:\n\n1. **Foreground Equipment**: In the foreground, several arched openings, possibly furnace doors, are glowing with the fire or heat emanating from within. These doors are arranged in a row, and smoky fumes can be seen escaping from the openings, suggesting active operation.\n\n2. **Central Machinery**: Above the furnace, there are multiple rectangular structures, likely to be part of the coke oven machinery. These structures seem to be vents or chimneys releasing flames and smoke, a common sight in coke production where coal is heated to high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment to produce coke.\n\n3. **Railway Cars**: To the right and slightly elevated on a trestle or platform, there are several railcars (labeled \"NW\"), indicating this facility likely uses a railway system to transport raw materials or finished products. This aspect underscores the industrial scale and logistics involved in the operations.\n\n4. **Workers and Activity**: There are workers visible in the scene, emphasizing human involvement in the otherwise mechanized process. One worker is discernible at a nearby structure, likely engaged in monitoring or operating the equipment. Their presence highlights the labor-intensive nature of industrial operations.\n\n5. **Background Elements**: The background is less distinct but shows a hillside devoid of vegetation, possibly due to the industrial environment. Additionally, there are further industrial structures and multiple chimneys, contributing to a dense industrial tableau.\n\n6. **Atmosphere**: The overall atmosphere of the photograph is gritty and smoky, typical of heavy industrial sites, especially from mid-20th century manufacturing. The image communicates the intense and sometimes harsh conditions associated with industrial manufacturing processes.\n\nThe composition and elements together provide a vivid depiction of a working industrial environment, focusing on the operation of a coke plant or similar facility within a larger industrial complex.","title":"Coke furnaces at keen mountain, near Richlands, Virginia made from coal, the coke will be sent for use in the furnaces at the steel mills.
