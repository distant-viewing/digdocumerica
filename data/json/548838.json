{"path":"548838.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photo captures a rural scene in which four individuals on horseback are visible, riding along a dusty, gravel road. Each rider appears to be dressed in traditional cowboy attire, including cowboy hats and long-sleeve shirts, suitable for ranch work.\n\nFrom the left, the first cowboy, in a plaid shirt, raises his hat slightly as though adjusting it or shading his eyes from the sun. The second rider, centrally aligned and wearing a light-colored shirt, holds the reins casually and has a relaxed posture. The third, slightly behind and to the right of the center, dons a dimmer shirt, and his hat casts a shadow on his face, giving him a focused look. The fourth rider is dressed in blue attire, and appears to be younger than the others, aligning on the far right of the composition.\n\nBehind these riders, a large herd of cattle forms a blurred, somewhat dusty background, suggesting movement and the arduous nature of handling livestock. The landscape is flat and expansive, typical of pasture land, with only a few sparse trees interrupting the horizon.\n\nThe setting implies a cattle driving situation common in rural, agricultural areas. The feel of the photo, with its hazy light and dominating blue and earth tones, reflects a hot, sunny day, adding authenticity to this glimpse of cowboy life. The composition of the photo, focusing on the line of riders against the backdrop of moving cattle, highlights their role and the environment in which they operate.","title":"Moving cattle raise dust along the highway","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548828","548830","553103","543634","549033","548878","543776","548987","553104","548829","553109","553110","557047","552698","543779","552565"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["rider","cattle","cowboy","align","hat","shirt","rein","horseback","authenticity","herd"]}
