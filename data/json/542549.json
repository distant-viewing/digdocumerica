{"path":"542549.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at what appears to be a waste disposal or dump site. The area is cluttered with debris and various discarded items, creating a chaotic and untidy atmosphere.\n\nIn the forefront of the image, several large, weathered barrels, displaying a range of colors from red to black, are scattered about. These barrels add a sense of industrial decay to the scene. Behind these, wooden pallets and broken furniture such as chairs and what could be parts of wooden frames or boxes contribute to the mess.\n\nThe middle ground features a man dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants, actively participating in clearing or sorting the area. He is holding what looks like a metal rod or pole, possibly using it to move or break apart the debris. A red pickup truck, which seems to be from the 1970s or 1980s based on its design, is parked next to him. The truck's bed is open and filled with assorted items, suggesting it is being used to transport the debris.\n\nIn the background, another individual is barely visible, further emphasizing the active nature of this site. Beyond these figures, piles of earth and more rubbish stretch towards a hilly area, under a clear sky which indicates that the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a strong sense of ongoing activity in an area dedicated to handling large amounts of waste, illustrating a moment in the process of managing and possibly recycling or disposing of materials.","title":"Local residents dump trash in Clyde Kepley's sanitary landfill.","placename":"Pinedale (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542550","549750","547159","549936","547983","546761","547208","553433","543828","545299","548210","549945","553041","556640","546235","542494"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrel","debris","waste","recycle","break","pallet","truck","site","item","1980"]}
