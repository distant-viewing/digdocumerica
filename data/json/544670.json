{"path":"544670.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a coastal landscape with distinct industrial and natural features. In the foreground, there is a beach with white sand next to greenish-tinted shallow coastal waters through which a boat is moving, creating a white wake as it speeds along the coastline.\n\nJust beyond the shoreline, the landscape transitions to an industrial area with large geometric water-filled ponds or canals, likely used for purposes such as aquaculture or salt extraction. These enclosures are separated by raised dirt paths, allowing access between them. The area is extensive, showing some signs of construction or excavation, as evidenced by the presence of bare soil and earthmoving tracks.\n\nThe background of the image shows a dense vegetative area, possibly a mangrove forest or coastal woodland, which marks a contrast with the meticulously organized ponds. Farther in the distance, a large body of water—possibly a bay or lagoon—can be seen, and beyond, the land extends into the horizon, hinting at a flat, expansive coastal geography.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph juxtaposes the naturally formed coastlines and vegetation with man-made industrial layouts, highlighting interactions between natural environments and human industrial activities.","title":"Marco Island, housing development","placename":"Marco (Tex.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547508","548779","548602","554157","548636","551606","554156","544635","557504","548635","554022","548787","551607","551574","551575","544650"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["pond","coastline","mangrove","lagoon","aquaculture","geography","enclosure","salt","extraction","canal"]}
