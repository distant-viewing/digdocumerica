{"path":"558077.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a plant in a natural setting, likely taken during or shortly after a rainfall, given the presence of water droplets. The focus is on a vertical stem which bears several small, delicate green leaves that are oriented horizontally. Each leaf holds a small amount of water, creating visible droplets at the edges that catch and reflect light, adding a sparkling effect to the image.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph hints at either early morning or late afternoon, as there is a gentle, soft quality to the light which enhances the dark, blurred background. This background provides a strong contrast with the vivid green colors and the translucence of the water droplets, emphasizing the freshness and delicacy of the scene.\n\nCompositionally, the image employs a shallow depth of field, maintaining sharpness only on the closest part of the plant, which draws the viewer's attention directly to the texture of the leaves and droplets, while the rest of the scene fades into a soft, indistinct bokeh. This artistic choice suggests a sense of intimacy and tranquility, inviting contemplation of the small, often unnoticed natural details.","title":"Closeup of the plant touch-me-not (Impatiens pallida) sparkling with morning dew in Deep Lock Quarry, part of the Akron Ohio, Metropolitan Park System.
