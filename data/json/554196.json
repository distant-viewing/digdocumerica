{"path":"554196.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a wooden boat with two men aboard, set in a large body of water under a cloudy sky. The boat appears to be moving, as evidenced by the choppy waters and spray visible around it.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is seated facing sideways. He is wearing a light-blue shirt and a striped hat in shades of red, yellow, and blue. The expression on his face seems contemplative as he gazes out towards the water.\n\nTowards the rear of the boat, another man is standing and looking out over the water. He is dressed in a white shirt and khaki pants, and he appears to be engaged in some activity, possibly managing the boat's direction or observing something in the distance.\n\nThe boat itself is packed with various objects: fishing gear, a red fuel can, a blue tarp or cloth, and some additional unidentifiable items that contribute to a sense of the boat being used for work, perhaps fishing or transportation.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is one of movement and quiet activity, with a focus on both the human and environmental elements interacting during the boat ride.","title":"Peter black and philip findeg fishing for whitefish on red lake","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["547566","544269","547557","554199","545179","546976","554200","544270","546317","545057","546324","548553","547559","549417","549373","547564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","sideway","tarp","khaki","cloth","fuel","rear","spray","water"]}
