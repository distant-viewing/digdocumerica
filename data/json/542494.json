{"path":"542494.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a large, disordered pile of discarded industrial containers and waste, sprawling across an arid, outdoor environment. The scene is cluttered with various sizes and types of metal and plastic drums, many stained and rusted. These containers, some with faded and peeling labels, carry remains of different substances, potentially chemicals or oils, suggested by the various markings such as \"Ketone\" and other partially visible text.\n\nForegrounded in the image are numerous barrels tipped over and lying on their sides, creating a chaotic and cluttered appearance. The landscape around the waste is dry and dusty, with sparse vegetation in the background, reinforcing a sense of neglect and environmental degradation. The sky is visible at the top of the frame, showing a clear day, which casts natural light on the scene, highlighting textures and colorsâ€”ranging from muted earth tones to the harsh reds and blues of the containers.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a severe case of industrial pollution, evoking discussions around environmental care and the consequences of industrial waste mismanagement.","title":"Discarded pesticide cans","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552883","543806","553433","543762","553045","552884","546000","556324","552248","551247","544637","557307","550801","547907","549307","542549"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["container","waste","case","consequence","remain","drum","barrel","care","substance","label"]}
