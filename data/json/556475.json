{"path":"556475.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts the scene reflected in a large, ornately framed mirror. The mirror, with a dark, carved wooden frame in a semi-circle shape, occupies the upper part of the composition and shows a room behind it.\n\nIn the foreground, resting on a surface that appears to be a dresser or table, there is a collection of items. Prominently displayed is a heart-shaped box with a bright red color and a large decorative bow on the top, suggesting a gift or a package typically associated with celebrations or romantic gestures. Next to this box are various items, including what seems to be a black accordion file or folder and a small, open white box that might contain jewelry or small personal items.\n\nAlso visible are other less distinct objects that contribute to a sense of clutter or varied possession accumulation on this surface. The mirror reflects an interior space that features more furniture, curtains, and a wall hanging or art piece, which adds depth to the scene but remains blurred and somewhat indistinct. The overall mood is personal and somewhat intimate, with an emphasis on the objects rather than the space itself.","title":"A valentine candy box brightens the dresser in the bedroom of the hershal and mai shrewbury home near Beckley, West Virginia just outside a coalmining area.
