{"path":"546792.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a dense collection of small, silvery fish scattered across the entire frame. The fish are predominantly dead and appear to be in a pile, possibly on a surface like a deck or a dock, given that their arrangement suggests they were recently gathered or caught. They are tightly packed, covering the image from edge to edge, with their bodies shining from reflected light, enhancing the silvery color of their scales.\n\nThe fish vary slightly in size and orientation, but they are mostly uniform in appearance. There is a presence of wetness, possibly water droplets, on the fish, indicating that they might be fresh or that they have been sprayed or are still in a wet environment. The background is indiscernible due to the dense accumulation of fish covering the entire view, making it challenging to discern any further details or context about the location or specific activity involved beyond the collection of fish. No human figures or other objects are visible in the image, focusing solely on the fish.","title":"Dead fish on the shore of Middle Branch, near Port Covington in Baltimore Harbor.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546784","545063","546846","542892","547704","544987","553878","548142","555560","553877","546930","546782","545075","544995","543189","546779"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fish","collection","wetness","orientation","droplet","accumulation","edge","deck","arrangement","dock"]}
