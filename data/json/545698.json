{"path":"545698.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and picturesque camping scene set against a backdrop of uniquely shaped rock formations, characteristic of rugged desert landscapes. The foreground features a family involved in typical camping activities. A blue tent is pitched on sandy ground, surrounded by native shrubbery and small bushes which reflect the natural vegetation of the area.\n\nA group of individuals, appearing as a family, is gathered around a picnic table situated near the tent. A woman in a red shirt is standing, possibly organizing or preparing food, while two children and another adult, seated at the table, are either eating or engaging with the activity at hand. The table is covered with items that suggest a mealtime setting: plates, cups, and a cooler are visible.\n\nThe background presents a stunning vista of tall, eroded sandstone formations, standing starkly against a clear sky. These natural pillars and rock walls have a reddish hue, harmonizing with the desert theme. The late afternoon sun casts soft shadows, enriching the textures and contours of the rocks and landscape. The depth and tranquility of the scene are enhanced by the mix of natural, earthy tones and the vivid green of the trees, which subtly highlight the arid environment. The scene is an inviting portrayal of outdoor living and adventure in a strikingly beautiful setting.","title":"Devil's Garden campground is beautifully situated, has fireplaces, and is well-maintained.
