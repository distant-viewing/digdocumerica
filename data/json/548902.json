{"path":"548902.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of an agricultural landscape. The image is split mostly into two parts by a diagonal division running approximately from the bottom left to the upper right of the image. On the left side, there are large green fields segmented into neat rows, suggesting crops that are in a relatively mature state of growth. These fields are divided by several perpendicular and parallel dirt roads, forming a grid that structures the farmland.\n\nOn the right side of the image, we see a different scene. This section primarily consists of brown fields, marked with the linear patterns typical of recently plowed or sown land. One particularly striking feature in this section is a tractor in motion, expelling a large cloud of exhaust or dust, which creates a dramatic, billowing white trail behind it. The tractor is oriented such that it's moving downwards in the frame, further accentuating the linear perspective added by the neat rows in which it operates.\n\nThe overall color palette of the photo is natural, dominated by shades of green and brown, reflecting the earthly tones typical of farm landscapes. The aerial perspective gives a vast sense of scale to the farm operations, underlining the expanse and organization involved in agricultural production. The photograph also conveys a sense of dynamic activity through the moving tractor, an element that breaks the static nature of the neatly lined fields.","title":"Fertilizing","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548898","548820","548907","548903","547297","548908","549104","558414","554029","548905","557517","549094","554015","544552","542517","553881"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","field","farm","exhaust","row","plow","division","section","farmland","perspective"]}
