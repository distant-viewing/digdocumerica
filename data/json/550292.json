{"path":"550292.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene sunset scene over a body of water. The sun is vividly displayed as a large, vibrant, orange-yellow sphere dominating the sky, which graduates from deep red and orange hues near the sun to darker tones near the top of the image. Below the sun is its shimmering reflection dancing across the water in a dazzling, narrow path that leads directly to the foreground of the photograph.\n\nIn the center of the image, a lone figure is seen paddleboarding, positioned almost directly beneath the sun, adding a sense of scale and peaceful human activity against the majestic backdrop. Their presence contributes to an ambiance of tranquility and solitude amidst nature's grandeur.\n\nTo the left of the sunset, the silhouette of a landmass juts into the frame, possibly an island or a peninsula, which partially frames the scene. The overall composition gives a sense of peaceful simplicity, focusing on the interplay between nature's elements and minimal human intervention. The photograph captures a moment of reflective quietude, invoking feelings of calm and awe at the natural beauty displayed.","title":"Lake erie at sunset.
