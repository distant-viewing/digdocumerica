{"path":"557101.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up of a small, spiral-shaped fossil partially embedded in dry, cracked earth. The fossil resembles a snail shell with multiple whorls diminishing in size towards the center, indicating past marine or terrestrial life. The shell stands out due to its whitish-beige color, which contrasts sharply against the reddish-brown mud. The upper left of the image includes a dark brown, weathered stick or plant stem hovering slightly over the shell, perhaps used as a pointer or part of the scenery. The texture of the earth around the fossil is finely detailed, showing various sizes of dirt clumps, suggesting the ground might be hard and arid. The overall composition focuses on the ancient relic, with natural lighting highlighting the contours and textures of both the fossil and its surrounding soil.","title":"Closeup of evidence of sea life embedded in a small loess Bluff, a glacial-formed solid earth Bluff in Doniphan County Kansas, near Troy in the extreme northeast part of the state.
