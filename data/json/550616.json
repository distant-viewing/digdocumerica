{"path":"550616.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, aerial view of a meandering river cutting through a lush landscape. The main feature of the image is the river, which flows in serpentine loops, clearly visible against the surrounding terrain. The riverbanks are densely forested with clusters of trees, predominantly conifers, appearing in dark green hues.\n\nThe landscape around the river is a mix of various shades of green and brown, indicating different vegetation types and possibly some marshy areas. In the distance, the terrain seems to flatten, and lighter patches suggest grasslands or scrublands.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or man-made structures in the photo, which conveys a sense of a pristine, untouched natural environment. The lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with sunlight casting shadows that enhance the winding pattern of the river.\n\nOverall, the composition through a high angle captures the grandeur and tranquility of the natural setting, emphasizing the curvaceous path of the river through the landscape.","title":"Crossing the west fork of the gulkana river.
