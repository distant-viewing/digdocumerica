{"path":"543032.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in front of a building that appears to be the \"Environmental Center\" as indicated by a sign on the fa√ßade. This single-story building has a plain, light-colored exterior with windows covered in various posters advocating environmental and political causes. One poster promotes a policy action, saying \"Yes on 9 Clean Environment Act.\"\n\nThree individuals are present in the shot, distinctly dressed in styles that suggest the photo might be from the 1970s or 1980s. From left to right: the first person, leaning against a tilted street pole, wears a yellow knit hat, a brown leather jacket, jeans, and is holding a shoulder bag. The second person is in the middle, standing with a bicycle, and dressed in a checkered shirt, dark pants, and has shoulder-length hair. The third person, on the right, leans against a rugged wooden barricade, holds a football, and wears a light-colored sweater, wide blue pants, and boots.\n\nThe location and look suggest a casual, possibly collegiate environment. Each person displays a relaxed posture and the setting shows signs of a community actively engaged in environmental and civic activities. The image carries an informal, grassroots vibe, reflective of social activism likely during the 70s or 80s. The overall composition of the image, with its vintage feel, relaxed subjects, and context-rich background, offers a window into a moment of social engagement and everyday life of the time.","title":"Cyclist in front of environmental center","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543921","549909","551646","558293","544235","553183","552948","543236","550082","544800","551852","543440","553155","551124","543176","553321"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["poster","person","shoulder","football","activism","80","lean","barricade","70","leather"]}
