{"path":"551605.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a modern building, which is identified by a sign as the \"National Water Quality Laboratory.\" The structure features a mid-century modern architectural style with two primary sections. The main section of the building is rectangular with a flat roof and is primarily constructed from red bricks. Extensive windows are integrated throughout, providing a transparent and open facade. Adjacent to this part, there is a smaller, one-story section that includes a unique design element of white paneling contrasted with natural stone columns, visually breaking up the extensive use of glass in this part of the building.\n\nIn front of this added section, there is a round, elevated sign prominently displaying the name of the laboratory, enhancing its visibility and significance. The building is surrounded by a well-maintained lawn, complete with trimmed grass. In the foreground, a tall, metal street lamp is visible on the left, contributing to the overall modern aesthetic of the scene. There are also large, mature trees near the building, adding a touch of natural beauty and providing contrast to the man-made elements. \n\nThe setting and lighting suggest that this photo was taken during dusk, as the sky behind the building is still partially illuminated, offering a serene and calm atmosphere. The overall composition of the photograph underscores the functional and aesthetic aspects of the building, set within a tranquil, green environment.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory, a government facility","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["548866","546464","546531","546473","546702","546456","549687","546481","546543","553744","546470","546460","546542","557329","546539","543580"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["section","building","paneling","laboratory","significance","lamp","lawn","column","visibility","sign"]}
