{"path":"547136.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures two children peering out from the rear door of a school bus. The vividness of the yellow bus dominates the frame, with a significant portion of it showing door details such as a metallic handle and a hinge. Notably, the word \"BUS STOP\" is written in bold, black graffiti-style lettering on the door. The two visible door windows display the children; the child on the left is smiling and partially covering their face, while the child on the right peeks through the narrow window crack, almost as if hiding. The expression and positioning of these children suggest a playful or cheeky moment caught during the routine of a school bus journey. The overall composition of the image, featuring elements of everyday life and spontaneous emotion, framed within the institutional context of a school bus, gives the photograph a candid and lively feel.","title":"Children playing in rural school bus stop","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547133","557665","558208","558215","543026","558241","553315","555568","552743","558206","556797","552505","547032","556789","556738","556743"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bus","school","child","door","emotion","peer","hide","graffiti","positioning","journey"]}
