{"path":"550837.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph focuses on a textured surface that appears to be a mixture of mud and water. The mud exhibits a cracked, dry texture with some areas still wet, suggesting that water may be evaporating or receding from this location. The surface is colored in shades of dark gray and brown, highlighting the natural patterns formed by the drying process. No significant reflections are evident, but there are patches where perhaps a slight sheen of water remains.\n\nIn this image, there is no discernible background activity or other subjects; the entire frame is filled with the close-up view of the mud and water texture. The lighting is soft, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, which gently enhances the details of the mud's surface and texture. Lighting and shade variations contribute to a rather serene and natural feel to the photograph, emphasizing the organic and possibly arid environment in which the photo was taken.","title":"Algae on the fox river below montello in central Wisconsin","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["544992","554347","545850","552983","543523","555545","552066","544176","548089","553582","544729","553581","542869","553867","545597","544858"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mud","texture","surface","sheen","crack","recede","water","variation","shade","remain"]}
