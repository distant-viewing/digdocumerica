{"path":"544677.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph presents a compelling view down a pair of old, slightly rusty railroad tracks. The tracks run straight into the distance over what appears to be a salt collection area, where shallow pools are partitioned off to allow for salt harvesting. The surfaces of these pools show various textures and colors, largely whitish possibly due to salt crystallization, with patches of brown water visible in some pools. The edges of these pools are defined by dirt and mud barriers, segmented at intervals where the wooden planks, the ties of the railroad track, meet them.\n\nAround the railroad ties, salt crystals can be seen accumulated, indicating that this area is either adjacent to or part of a salt processing operation where seawater might be dried out. The wooden ties are weathered and worn, which, alongside the rusted rails, suggests they have been exposed to harsh saline conditions for an extended period.\n\nThe overall atmosphere and the quality of light suggest this photograph was taken during broad daylight. The background shows what appears to be industrial equipment or infrastructures, possibly related to the salt harvesting process. There is a hazy sky, hinting at either fog or mist likely influenced by the location's proximity to a large body of saltwater or the evaporative processes of the salt flats themselves.","title":"Boat launch ramp","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544706","544324","543725","545623","552532","556873","555887","544681","556853","556783","556851","554356","556877","549206","544687","549131"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["salt","pool","railroad","harvesting","tie","track","process","interval","flat","accumulate"]}
