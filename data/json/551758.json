{"path":"551758.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman engaging in the sport of lawn bowling. She is in the middle of an active play, bending at the knees and waist, with her right arm extended forward as she bowls the ball. The woman is dressed warmly with a white knit hat and a white sweater, contrasting with her bright red pants. Her outfit suggests a cool but sunny day, appropriate for outdoor activities.\n\nThe setting is an immaculately maintained grass bowling green. To the right of the playing field, a collection of black lawn bowls is neatly arranged, suggesting that others might also be participating or waiting for their turn. In the background, there are lush, green trees partially shedding their leaves, indicating that it could be either late spring or early autumn. A simple blue structure and a park bench can be seen behind the trees, along with a chain fence that marks the periphery of the bowling area.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright, casting a sharp shadow of the woman onto the green, accentuating her dynamic pose. This suggests the photo was taken during the day when the sun was fairly high. The picture captures a moment of concentration and activity, highlighting an enjoyable pastime that provides both physical exercise and social interaction.","title":"Member of the Bowling Green Bowling Club poised for a bowl on the club turf at Central Park.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551759","551757","551760","548579","548580","548567","552398","551293","558320","548566","548564","547385","558329","551973","552024","554149"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["lawn","exercise","woman","playing","bowl","periphery","green","ball","waist","turn"]}
