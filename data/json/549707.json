{"path":"549707.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a pier where a large ferry, named the \"Columbia Belle,\" is docked. The background features a clear sky and calm waters. Several flags, including the Canadian flag and the American flag, are visible flying on the mast of the boat and around the dock.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a group of people on a deck, most likely observing the arrival or departure of the ferry. This group consists of men and women, many in casual and colorful attire typical of warmer weather, suggesting the photograph might be taken during summer. There's a mix of fashion, from plaid pants to bright red pants, which adds a lively, varied aesthetic to the scene.\n\nThe people are focused on different activities. Some are looking towards the ferry, engaged in conversation, while others seem to be waiting or just enjoying the day. The composition of the image provides a good sense of movement and everyday liveliness, giving a snapshot into a moment of leisure and travel likely in a North American location by the presence of the flags.","title":"From the top deck of the SS St. Claire passengers watch the SS Columbia (built in 1902).
