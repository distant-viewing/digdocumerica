{"path":"544538.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of children walking along a curved, elevated concrete walkway that spans across a natural setting. There are four children visible: three are walking closely together while one trails slightly behind. They appear to be engaging with each other, possibly in conversation as they walk.\n\nThe scene is set in a vast flat landscape, likely a grassland or wetland, extending towards a horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The vegetation in the area is sparse, with short grasses covering most of the ground, interspersed with occasional bushes. \n\nThe lighting is bright, suggesting this photograph was taken on a sunny day. A strong shadow of what appears to be part of a viewing tower is cast on the grass below, adding a vertical element to a largely horizontal scene. The body of water, possibly a small creek or pond, can be seen next to the walkway, reflecting hints of the blue sky above.\n\nThe overall setting is serene and open, giving a sense of calm and space, and the composition of the photograph, with the walkway leading into the distance, adds a dynamic element by drawing the viewerâ€™s eye along the path the children are taking.","title":"Shark valley ranger station","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["552407","554072","551736","551764","546449","557987","557410","544312","543466","544739","552033","543233","557771","543473","544821","554423"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["walkway","child","walk","creek","viewing","hints","trails","curved","grassland","grass"]}
