{"path":"551031.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a lively, gritty scene in a rugged outdoor setting, possibly within a low-income neighborhood or a rural area. In the foreground, two young people are engaged in playing basketball. They are jumping and reaching towards a basketball that is in mid-air, aiming for a makeshift basketball hoop mounted to what looks like a salvaged piece of equipment or post, with its backboard rigged from a dark-colored piece of material.\n\nBeside them, dominating the scene, is a disheveled and heavily damaged vintage car; it is rusted and missing parts, with its doors open. The paint on the car is scraped off in large patches, revealing the metal underneath. The car’s trunk is also open, adding to the sense of abandonment.\n\nThe background features an old residential structure, possibly a house, which appears dilapidated and in a state of disrepair, with boarded-up windows and faded walls. The environment around the house and the car is unkempt and littered with debris, scattered elements, and overgrown plants, suggesting a lack of maintenance.\n\nAbove, the sky is cloudy, casting an overcast light on the scene and reinforcing a mood of neglect and resilience. Overall, the photograph tells a story of making the best out of what’s available, where joy and play continue amidst physical decay. It also suggests themes of community and childhood resilience.","title":"A basketball game on unpaved Church Avenue near an abandoned autoMobile.","placename":"Rand (W.
