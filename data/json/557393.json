{"path":"557393.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing beside large, vertical structures that resemble industrial pipes or architectural columns. The man, wearing what appears to be a uniform with a badge and several pens pocketed on the shirt, is looking up intently at one of the columns. He is wearing a cap, eyeglasses, and has a short haircut. The columns are illuminated softly and uneven shadows are visible on their surfaces, suggesting a dim, perhaps indoor, lighting environment.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in a bluish tone, casting a cool atmosphere over the image. The background is dark and nondescript, focusing all attention on the man and the towering columns beside him. The composition uses a low angle perspective, emphasizing the height of the columns relative to the man, and creating a sense of scale and perhaps awe or contemplation.","title":"Closeup of precipitator bags which inflate like vacuum cleaners at the metallurgical furnaces of the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant.
