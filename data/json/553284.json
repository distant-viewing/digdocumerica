{"path":"553284.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively outdoor event, capturing a moment where a band is performing on a stage. The setting is an urban area as indicated by surrounding buildings and a glimpse of a prominent sign reading \"Standard Federal\" in large letters, suggesting the venue could be near a bank or in a commercial district.\n\nThe stage is centrally positioned at the far end of the photo, adorned with a red curtain backdrop, and is illuminated by stage lights making it the focal point. On the stage, band members are visible â€” one seems to be playing the drums and another the guitar, although it's a bit hard to make out all the details due to the distance and lighting.\n\nIn the foreground, a diverse crowd of spectators is gathered, standing and watching the performance. The audience appears engaged, with some people turned towards the stage, enjoying the music. The presence of parked cars beside the crowd gives a casual, street-side feel to the event.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is communal and vibrant, with the event taking place during twilight or night, as indicated by the dim sky and artificial lighting used in the area. The cobblestone-like paving on the ground adds an urban aesthetic to the scene. The surrounding architecture includes multi-storied buildings, which create a backdrop that encapsulates the typical city night life environment.","title":"Jazz group performs on a summer evening at Fountain Square, downtown Cincinnati's popular public plaza.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553297","551674","551012","551708","553296","551673","551671","551670","551672","553286","556308","551709","553201","551018","557264","551014"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["stage","band","night","event","crowd","cobblestone","paving","guitar","drum","music"]}
