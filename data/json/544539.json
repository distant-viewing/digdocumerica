{"path":"544539.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a bird standing in a body of water. The bird, appearing to be a heron or a similar wading species, is medium-sized with a long neck and sharp bill, which is slightly open as though it is calling or has caught something. Its plumage is dark with specks creating a textured look; the bird’s posture is upright and alert.\n\nThe bird is surrounded by water that reflects light, creating a shimmering effect with numerous small, sparkling highlights. There is floating vegetation and debris on the water surface around the bird, suggesting a natural, possibly wild habitat. The background is predominantly dark and blurred, likely a dense growth of vegetation or trees, focusing the viewer's attention on the bird and the water’s surface.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is one of serene natural beauty, emphasizing the grace of the bird in its natural environment. The lighting and focus give the scene a vivid yet slightly mysterious quality.","title":"Green heron","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544543","550388","557495","543922","544477","543063","548832","544489","545142","547630","547593","557448","557604","553777","543918","548731"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","heron","grace","plumage","call","speck","neck","specie","water","habitat"]}
