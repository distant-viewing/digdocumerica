{"path":"547085.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a damaged house situated on a beachfront. The house is two-storied, clad in beige siding with a steep gabled roof. A large segment of the house, including part of its foundation and first floor, is visibly missing, exposing the interior. The exposed section on the first floor shows remnants of walls and possibly some household items within.\n\nThe house appears partially uplifted from its foundation, supported haphazardly by cinder blocks under the front, with debris scattered around the base, including some wood planks and miscellaneous trash. Several windows are visible; one on the upper floor is still intact, while the windows on the missing section are absent.\n\nThe backdrop features a gray, cloudy sky and a desolate landscape. The beach upon which the house sits consists of large stones and gravel, extending into a bleak shoreline that stretches off into the distance. Leafless trees and a few distant houses are visible in the far background, suggesting a cold or post-storm setting. The overall atmosphere portrays a scene of destruction and abandonment, possibly resulting from a natural disaster such as a storm or flooding.","title":"Beach-front home after severe storm on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547119","547079","547038","544797","547030","547040","547036","546969","544463","551963","552436","547149","544464","557346","544467","554823"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["house","foundation","storm","floor","beachfront","cinder","section","household","flooding","disaster"]}
