The focus is on a group of divers performing different tasks in and around the ocean:\n\n1. **People**: There are multiple divers in yellow and black diving gear. Some divers are in the water, appearing to be either just entering or preparing to do so. One diver is submerged up to the torso, positioned near the side of the boat. On the deck, more individuals are evident; some are assisting the divers, while another observes or manages equipment.\n\n2. **Boat Structure**: The vessel features a sturdy, industrial design with various functional components visible. There is a platform area that extends over the water, likely used for diving operations. Above this, there is a higher deck where other crew members stand, overseeing the activities below. The boat is equipped with metal railings, a thick vertical pole possibly used for navigation or communication purposes, and other maritime devices.\n\n3. **Equipment and Accessories**: The divers are equipped with standard diving gear including tanks, fins, and suits. On the boat, technical equipment such as hoists or winches, lights, and communication devices are mounted for operational use. Notably, thereâ€™s a large crate on the deck, contents unseen, possibly holding additional gear or samples.\n\n4. **Background**: The environment suggests overcast weather with a grayish, misty backdrop, focusing all attention on the activities and colorful gear of the divers contrasting against the subdued tones of the sky and sea.\n\n5. **Atmosphere**: The scene conveys a sense of coordinated activity and readiness, typical of a scientific or explorative marine operation. The presence of various diving and nautical equipment emphasizes a prepared, professional setting focused on maritime tasks.\n\nThis image provides a vivid glimpse into the logistics and teamwork involved in marine and diving operations, highlighting the role of human and technical resources in challenging environments.","title":"The Vila Velebite II, the hydrobiological research ship of the Ruder Boskovic Institute, conducts several scientific projects for EPA.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["552862","555831","555834","549336","549616","555832","555833","549369","555827","555830","544129","552861","544388","555829","543065","549347"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["diver","diving","gear","deck","communication","device","boat","vessel","operation","equipment"]}
