{"path":"548340.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area. The dominant features are massive buildings and structures associated with industrial activities. Near the center, a large building with three tall, narrow chimneys emits plumes of white smoke or steam into the air, contributing to a slightly hazy atmosphere.\n\nA prominent water body, presumably a river, runs through the scene, bordered by industrial buildings and structures. Several ships and barges are moored along the river, indicating active waterway transportation. Adjacent to the water, there are various cylindrical storage tanks and other industrial machinery and infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, two distinctive cylindrical buildings with patterned tops stand out against the otherwise flat industrial landscape. These structures appear to be part of the industrial complex or potentially office buildings related to the industry.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is muted, dominated by blues and grays which might suggest either the time of day being either early morning or late afternoon, or the industrial activity might be affecting the air quality and light diffusion. There is no visible vegetation or residential areas in immediate proximity to the industrial facilities, highlighting the area's dedicated industrial use. The overall impression is one of a busy, functioning industrial sector with heavy machinery and significant production activity.","title":"Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550890","552187","555770","555776","546862","551566","555769","551183","548423","548379","550886","552181","549968","547066","552179","544999"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["diffusion","air","sector","building","machinery","affect","barge","production","river","moor"]}
