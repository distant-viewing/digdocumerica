{"path":"558003.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph presents a somewhat industrial and natural waterway scene, possibly a canal or small river, with multiple focal points of human intervention and nature.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, there is a decrepit wooden dock or platform extending into the water. The structure appears aged and partially submerged, suggesting neglect or disuse. The water around the dock is calm and reflects the green foliage and clear sky above.\n\nDirectly beside the platform, a rusty metal guardrail runs along the edge of the embankment, which gradually transitions into a stone or concrete embankment as the view extends to the right. Overgrown plants are visible at the base of this barrier, indicating a lack of regular maintenance.\n\nA sizable amount of debris, including branches and logs, has accumulated against the embankment, suggesting recent heavy rain or flooding that might have washed these materials down the river.\n\nIn the mid-right portion of the image, a large steel truss bridge spans the waterway. The bridge is painted green and carries a sign that reads \"ADAM ST.\" suggesting it might be located in an urban area. This infrastructure piece provides a sharp contrast to the natural elements around it and underscores the interaction between human-built environments and nature.\n\nBeyond the bridge, the background reveals a more urban setting with multiple vehicles visible parked along a road, utility poles, and distant buildings, possibly shops or businesses. The presence of power lines and their reflections in the water adds another layer to the composition, emphasizing the intertwining of nature and urban development.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a scene where industrial, residential, and natural elements come together. It highlights themes of neglect, the passage of time, and possibly the resilience of nature amidst human civilization.","title":"Driftwood accumulates where the Ohio-erie canal crosses tinker's creek at canal road near Cleveland, Ohio.  The canal connected the great lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business.  The area is now a part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area in the 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547890","551533","558000","546865","548071","552240","551519","550214","547622","558006","545988","553393","546112","546067","555730","552071"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["embankment","bridge","waterway","platform","civilization","decrepit","neglect","dock","nature","guardrail"]}
