{"path":"547256.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape that includes a residential area and a river. In the foreground, the prominent feature is a muddy river with noticeable patterns possibly created by the flow of water, giving it a textured appearance. The riverbank shows erosion with some exposed cliffs.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a road running horizontally that marks the transition from the natural landscape of the river to a more urban setting. Alongside the road, there are numerous residential homes lined in an orderly fashion â€” mostly detached houses with ample yard space, surrounded by trees. The properties look well-maintained, suggesting a suburban environment.\n\nIn the background of the photo, the residential area continues with more homes visible. The layout of the community is typical of suburban residential areas with wide streets and detached single-family homes. The density of the houses decreases slightly as the area extends into the distance. \n\nOverall, the composition includes a contrasting view of nature (the muddy river and erosion) directly alongside human habitation (the tidy, organized suburban homes), illustrating how these environments coexist. The setting appears peaceful and quiet, likely a small to medium-sized suburban community.","title":"Aerial view of potomac shoreline in mt.
