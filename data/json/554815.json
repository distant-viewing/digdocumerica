{"path":"554815.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a strikingly expansive landscape, likely a large-scale strip mining operation. In the foreground, the setting is characterized by undulating grass-covered hills, exhibiting various shades of green and hints of yellow. The grass has traces of vehicle marks, suggesting recent activity or pathways.\n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a more industrial scene with exposed earth and large piles of dirt suggesting excavation work. A large crane is visible to the right, pointing towards giant heaps of moved soil. Adjacent to the crane, the land shows signs of significant disturbance, potentially from mining or construction efforts, featuring open earth, various color patches, and terraced layers that indicate the depth and scale of the operation.\n\nIn the background, the landscape gradually recedes into distant hills dotted with vegetation under a vast, partially cloudy sky. The sky, occupying the upper third of the photo, adds a serene blue contrast to the earthy tones of the mining area, softened by the presence of fluffy white clouds. \n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural beauty with industrial activity, highlighting human impact on the environment in the form of large-scale extraction or excavation. The photograph may serve to document or critique environmental changes due to such industrial operations.","title":"Reclaimed land with stripping in process behind it.
