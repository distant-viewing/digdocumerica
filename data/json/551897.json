{"path":"551897.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a mature man seated at a desk in an office setting. The man appears to be concentrated and looking off to the side, as if in thought or listening intently. He is dressed in a white shirt with its collar open and no tie, suggesting a formal yet relaxed work environment.\n\nHis desk is populated with various objects that suggest his profession possibly involves detailed work or administrative tasks. There's a large, open ledger or notebook in front of him, alongside multiple pens and other writing utensils. A desktop computer, likely from the 1970s or 1980s given its design, is placed beside the ledger. Although not currently in interaction with it, the computer's presence indicates the modernity of the setting.\n\nOn the wall behind the man, a large framed painting or print of a cityscape is visible, featuring historic buildings which gives an aesthetic or cultural import to the office ambiance. The room's walls are a plain light color, and the office furniture looks typical of the mid-to-late 20th century, functional but unremarkable.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the pensive demeanor of the man and creates a portrayal of a professional at work, possibly in a field that involves planning, analysis, or management. The blend of technology (computer), traditional tools (ledger, pens), and the artistic touch (painting) effectively connotes a well-rounded intellectual workspace.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day, controls all traffic lights, receives remote TV inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["553088","557317","542690","547720","556250","547353","555297","555233","548864","547366","544326","556668","549378","556551","545471","556573"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["office","painting","pen","desk","modernity","profession","work","professional","notebook","utensil"]}
