{"path":"543585.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a wooded area in which several groups of wooden poles, possibly fence posts, are organized into bundles and stored upright, distributed across the forest floor. The scene is sunlit, suggesting itâ€™s during the day. The background is filled with green trees showing some spaces in between that partially reveal multi-story buildings, suggesting proximity to a residential area or perhaps a resort. The poles are wrapped with protective bands to keep them in bundles. The ground is covered with brown pine needles and small patches of grass, and a few fallen branches are visible, adding to the natural, somewhat rustic setting. There's a hint of mountains in the very back, slightly obscured by the haze, giving a sense of a mountainous or hilly region. The setting is calm with no people or animals in view, creating a serene and possibly abandoned or unused space within a forest-like environment.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542596","543541","545262","557978","555139","555138","542859","552163","543489","555086","552197","545060","542604","555144","542603","556918"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["bundle","pole","resort","forest","needle","pine","band","space","proximity","post"]}
