{"path":"549762.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph displays a large, sprawling landfill foreground, densely filled with various forms of debris and discarded materials. The debris includes broken pieces of wood, metal objects, scattered pieces of paper, and miscellaneous waste material, creating an uneven, cluttered terrain. There's no visible presence of people in the landfill area, emphasizing a sense of abandonment and disuse.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the chaotic landfill scene, is a clear view of a city skyline dominated by tall, well-defined skyscrapers. Prominent among them are the twin towers, standing out due to their significant height and iconic form. The cityscape looks orderly and calm, in stark opposition to the disorder in the foreground. The sky is relatively clear with a hint of smoke rising, possibly from industrial activities, which blends subtly into the skyline.\n\nThis juxtaposition highlights the stark divide between urban development and waste management challenges, illustrating a scene of environmental and urban complexity.","title":"Illegal dumping area off the New Jersey turnpike, facing Manhattan across the Hudson River.
