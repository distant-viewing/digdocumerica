{"path":"556124.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a railway scene capturing the essence of a small-town train station. The photograph is taken from a low angle, close to the railway tracks which are prominently visible in the foreground. The tracks are standard gauge, made of steel rails secured on wooden ties (sleepers) embedded in gravel. The rail is gleaming, suggesting it is well-used.\n\nIn the middle distance, centered in the image, is a compact, single-story railway station building labeled \"SKAMOKAWA.\" The station is painted in light mint and muted yellow colors, featuring a gabled roof. Adjacent to the station building is a longer, narrow structure that might serve a warehouse or utility function for the station.\n\nThe station platform appears well-kept, edged with a fine turf grass and bordered by a neatly trimmed hedge. A paved road runs alongside the platform, on which a car is parked, indicating some activity or presence at the station.\n\nThe background offers a glimpse of a residential area with houses, visible under a partly cloudy sky that suggests varying weather conditions. Trees and greenery are abundant, indicating a lush, rural landscape. The scene conveys a sense of quiet and calm typical of small rural stations, likely serving a community that values its railway service for connectivity and transport. The overall composition of the photograph draws the viewerâ€™s eye along the railway tracks towards the station, emphasizing the connection between the rail service and the community it serves.","title":"Passenger depot at mount vernon, Washington, north of Seattle.
