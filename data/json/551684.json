{"path":"551684.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and picturesque outdoor scene, likely in a park during springtime. Two young children, possibly boys, are playing amid a flurry of cherry blossom petals. The child on the left is shown in a moment of movement, with some petals appearing to be tossed or falling around him, while the child on the right is running happily towards the camera with a delighted expression.\n\nThe surrounding environment is richly detailed, featuring a variety of trees including cherry blossoms and evergreens, hinting at a diverse and well-maintained park. The ground is thickly carpeted with pink cherry blossom petals, enhancing the springtime feel. In the background, there is a glimpse of a serene body of water, possibly a lake or pond, accompanied by distant, indistinct figures of other park visitors, which could suggest the park's popularity and communal atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of joy and the carefree nature of childhood, set against a beautifully natural backdrop, symbolizing renewal and the fleeting beauty of the cherry blossom season.","title":"Youngsters wade through fallen redbud petals in central park","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557410","551678","552942","554072","554669","543551","551713","552540","551736","550033","549274","551857","545307","557983","551769","553078"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["blossom","petal","child","park","renewal","popularity","evergreen","carpet","symbolize","childhood"]}
