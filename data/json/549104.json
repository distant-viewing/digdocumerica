{"path":"549104.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an agricultural scene, specifically focused on crop rows in a large field. The rows are neat and parallel, creating a textured pattern across the expanse. Two tractors are in the field, engaged in activity that appears to be either planting or spraying, as evidenced by visible trails of dust or mist dispersing behind them. The tractors cast long shadows due to the angle of the sunlight, suggesting that the photo was taken either in the early hours of the morning or late afternoon. The overall scene captures a moment of agricultural work, highlighting the scale and organization of modern farming practices. The vastness of the field and the meticulous care in the field management are prominently displayed.","title":"Fertilizing","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553048","548903","548898","553881","548900","548902","544548","548820","548907","545893","548997","554056","557478","548991","554202","542710"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","field","spraie","row","trails","disperse","organization","farming","care","practice"]}
