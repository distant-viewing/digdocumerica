{"path":"556553.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene with various activities and subjects. At the center, a man with dark hair and a beard is straddling a small black-and-white pony. He wears a light pink polo shirt and dark pants. To the left, a young girl with blonde hair stands by herself, wearing purple pants and a dark top while clutching something with her hands. Further to the right of the image, there are three individuals engaged in interacting with the pony; particularly, a woman with dark, mid-length hair is feeding or petting the pony, and next to her, a young boy in blue jeans and a beige shirt looks on with a joyful expression.\n\nIn the background, a concrete building with some green foliage around it can be seen, along with several parked cars, including a prominent dark-colored car. The location looks like a parking lot adjacent to a lightly wooded area, possibly on the outskirts of a town or near a communal area. The scene conveys a casual, perhaps spontaneous gathering focused on the interaction with the pony, adding a sense of community and leisure to the setting. The brightness of the day and the shadows indicate it's a sunny day, contributing to the lively, outdoor atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"A miner who had completed his work shift is shown on a pony belonging to the family of the tavern operator.
