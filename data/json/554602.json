{"path":"554602.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a toad in a natural environment. The toad, positioned in the center of the frame, has a robust, textured body predominantly covered in bumps and creases, which contribute to a natural camouflage. Its skin is mottled with various shades of brown, tan, and dark patches, enhancing its blend into the surrounding environment. The dorsal view of the toad shows its distinctive leathery skin and the parotoid glands behind its eyes, which often secrete a defensive toxin.\n\nThe toad is sitting on what appears to be damp, dark mossy stones, providing a stark contrast to its dry, bumpy texture. Small patches of green moss or possibly algae are visible enhancing the sense of a moist, natural habitat. The background is softly blurred but suggests a similarly dim and verdant environment, indicating the photo might have been taken in a shaded or overcast setting, typical of a forested or similarly vegetated area. The overall composition focuses on the texture and form of the toad, utilizing a shallow depth of field to isolate the subject and highlight its details against the indistinct background.","title":"America toad (Bufo americanus) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549145","555066","551362","557606","551363","544280","555197","557587","555067","543778","546161","551366","544622","544908","555196","545553"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["skin","mossy","camouflage","algae","isolate","utilize","vegetate","moss","patch","habitat"]}
