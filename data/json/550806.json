{"path":"550806.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a discarded beverage can partially submerged in a murky, stagnant body of water, likely a pond or marsh. The can is lying on its side in shallow water, and the top appears to be open and angled toward the camera. It is a shiny, metallic surface with a visible logo, possibly red and white, though specific details cannot be clearly made out.\n\nThe immediate surroundings of the can consist of various natural elements. There are reeds and grasses, both submerged and emerging above the waterline. The water itself looks dark and somewhat reflective, possibly indicating the presence of oils or other pollutants. The bottom of the pond or marsh area where the can rests is covered in organic debris, including rotting plant material and mud.\n\nThis image evokes a sense of neglect and environmental degradation, highlighting the issue of pollution in natural aquatic environments. The contrast between the natural setting and the man-made object underscores the intrusion of human waste into nature. The overall mood is somewhat somber, drawing attention to the impact of such actions on the environment. The lighting is dim which may suggest that the photograph was taken either in the early morning, late evening, or on a cloudy day, enhancing the melancholic feel of the scene.","title":"Beer can and other refuse among the lily pads--unwelcome mementoes of a Fourth of July celebration at a county park along the Wisconsin River.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550805","550812","550807","544647","546920","550811","552126","543302","555257","543877","555149","551246","543616","550352","547513","555224"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["pond","waterline","intrusion","pollutant","marsh","beverage","reed","mud","can","degradation"]}
