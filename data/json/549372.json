{"path":"549372.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph showcases a middle-aged man, likely a ship officer based on his attire, casually leaning on a railing aboard a ship. He is dressed in a light khaki uniform with a matching peaked cap adorned with a badge, suggesting his official role on the ship. His expression is relaxed and contemplative, with a slightly furrowed brow, as he gazes directly at the camera.\n\nIn front of him, there is a life-ring attached to the railing, prominently labeled \"VILLA VELEBITA PULA,\" indicating the name of the ship and possibly its home port. The life-ring is weathered, with visible signs of wear and discoloration, hinting at exposure to the elements and frequent use.\n\nThe background behind the officer is slightly out of focus, featuring a portion of the ship's structure, including elements like white railings and a vertical pole, which all contribute to a maritime ambiance. The sky overhead is overcast, giving the scene a muted, soft light that enhances the subdued color palette of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the officer centered and framed by maritime elements, clearly conveys a sense of his environment and role aboard the ship. The image captures a moment of quiet amidst the responsibilities of life at sea.","title":"The Vila Velebita II, research ship of the Ruder Boskovic Institute, is partially supported by EPA funds.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549617","546763","547554","551955","549603","546921","549602","548278","548279","551046","555828","555802","545728","546861","545219","547559"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["ship","officer","railing","ring","role","responsibility","matching","discoloration","khaki","life"]}
