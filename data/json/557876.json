{"path":"557876.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man seated in the driver's seat of a classic car. The viewpoint is from the outside near the driver's side rearview mirror, emphasizing parts of the car such as the shiny, dark blue body and chrome details. The carâ€™s window is partly rolled down. In the side mirror's reflection, a partial image of the car and background illuminated by other car lights can be seen, suggesting a nighttime setting.\n\nThe elderly man appears focused, looking straight ahead, possibly indicating that he is driving or about to drive. He wears a white shirt and the car's interior is also visible, showcasing a vintage design with leather-lined seats and a glimpse of the steering wheel, suggesting a blend of functionality and style reflective of a past era.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of movement and activity through the surrounding lights and the sharp focus on the car and its occupant against a blurred, dark background. The subdued lighting adds a moody atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Motorist gets in line for the safety lane at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
