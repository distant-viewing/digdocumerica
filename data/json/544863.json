{"path":"544863.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic desert river flowing in a shallow stream across the image foreground. The riverbed is visible through the clear water, filled with pebbles and small rocks that glisten under the sunlight. In the distance, the background is dominated by rugged red rock formations, typical of desert mountain landscapes, which rise dramatically with tiered layers and rounded contours.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright blue, enhancing the arid yet striking natural beauty of the scene. There are no visible plants or wildlife; the scene focuses purely on the geological and water elements. The perspective of the photo, taken near the surface of the water and looking slightly upward, gives a immersive feel, placing the viewer right within the serene and untouched landscape. The composition highlights a peaceful coexistence of water and stone under the vast sky.","title":"Escalante river","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["544929","545301","543793","543976","543977","545632","543789","543716","548933","545640","545633","545629","548924","545329","544752","553653"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["desert","riverbed","pebble","rock","glisten","strike","coexistence","water","wildlife","contour"]}
