{"path":"554258.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a street scene set in an urban environment during winter, evidenced by the presence of snow and slush on the roads and sidewalks. The image shows three people: two women seen from behind walking into a doorway and a man walking on crutches, moving across the street.\n\nThe man is positioned on the right side of the photo and is dressed in winter clothing including a jacket and jeans. The women walking into the doorway are dressed casually, one of them wearing plaid pants and both have long hair. The focus on the man with crutches suggests his movement through the street as a primary element of the photograph.\n\nThe background reveals urban buildings with storefronts, and there are visible elements of street furniture including a newspaper vending machine and a trashcan. A parked truck on the right side of the image and a stop sign further furnish the urban context. The lighting is natural, possibly indicating a bright winter day with enough sunlight casting shadows and highlighting the icy conditions on the street. The overall composition and elements provide a glimpse into everyday life and mobility in an urban, wintery setting.","title":"Casts and crutches are part of the skiing scene.","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554260","554229","549863","556226","554275","556199","549907","549916","547191","543890","546672","554291","554227","557279","553822","553486"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","winter","doorway","vending","wintery","mobility","stop","storefront","newspaper","furniture"]}
