{"path":"543339.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a derelict wooden structure, possibly an old cabin or shack, set against a natural landscape that hints at a remote, possibly arid location. The building features weathered wood planks, with the walls and roof showing signs of significant wear and exposure to the elements. The roof is fashioned from corrugated metal sheets, some of which appear rusted and aged, indicating the passage of time since the building was last maintained.\n\nThe structure includes a front facade interrupted by barred windows, wooden shutters, and vertical timber supports that add to the feeling of decay and disuse. The color palette is primarily natural tones, with the aged wood providing a rich texture of browns and grays, while the rusty roof contributes darker shades of red and brown.\n\nThere is no visible activity within or around the building, suggesting abandonment. The background includes sparse vegetation, possibly scrub or low bushes, typical of a dry region. The focus and framing of the photograph emphasize the rundown state of the structure, highlighting its rustic beauty and the stark contrast between the man-made construction and the wild landscape surrounding it.","title":"Ghost town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543171","543350","554707","543344","551111","551330","545233","542588","552494","554561","554786","545818","556354","554822","551115","554788"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["roof","corrugate","shack","derelict","scrub","interrupt","wood","disuse","shutter","sheet"]}
