{"path":"554645.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a Downy Woodpecker, highlighting intricate details of its features. The bird's eye is prominent, reflecting light and showing complex patterns in its iris. Its plumage is primarily black and white with fine, precise patterns that look speckled on its face and back. Notably, there is a distinct red patch on the back of its head, a characteristic feature of male Downy Woodpeckers. The bird's beak is sharp and pointed, slightly open, contributing to a sense of the bird possibly being in a moment of alertness or activity.\n\nThe bird is positioned against a stark, dark background which contrasts sharply with the lighter tones of its feathers. This plain background helps in focusing all attention on the fine details of the woodpecker's plumage and facial features. The foreground is minimally visible; only a hint of a surface on which the bird might be resting is seen, further directing focus towards the woodpecker itself. The composition effectively captures the texture and colors of the bird's natural appearance, emphasizing its wild beauty.","title":"Closeup of hairy woodpecker's (dendrocopus vilosus) head and beak.
