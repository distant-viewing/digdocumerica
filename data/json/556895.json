{"path":"556895.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a group of workers engaged in maintaining or constructing railroad tracks. The image, taken from an elevated angle, shows the workers among large machinery on the railroad tracks. There are multiple tracks visible, filled with gravel.\n\nThe workers, wearing hard hats, are distributed along the tracks. Most are focused on tasks at hand involving various pieces of machinery that appear to be either repairing or assembling the tracks. Some workers operate mechanical equipment, while others are observing or guiding the operation.\n\nThe setting is clear with no buildings or natural landscapes in the immediate background, suggesting that the photo might have been taken in a more isolated or industrial section of the tracks. The lighting suggests daylight, which illuminates the workers and machinery vividly against the grayish color of the gravel and tracks. This image provides a detailed look at the intricacies and teamwork involved in railroad maintenance or construction, highlighting the industrial environment and the labor-intensive work.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way work crew with machinery laying new quarter mile long sections of rail to replace the old shorter track.  On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel track, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day.
