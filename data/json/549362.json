{"path":"549362.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque coastal town scene, predominantly shown in a gradient of soft, vintage colors. Dominating the upper section of the image is a hill dotted with tightly-packed, old stone buildings, giving a rustic charm to the landscape. The focal point of the town is a striking, tall bell tower that rises prominently above the other structures. This tower is equipped with a spire and arched windows, representative of classical architectural style.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene shifts to a more functional and industrial setting. The harbor area is busy, featuring a few boats and ships moored near the shore. One notably larger boat is docked directly at the waterfront, which is lined with building materials, possibly for construction or repair work, indicating the area also serves commercial purposes. The presence of a crane and piles of materials like gravel further suggests ongoing construction or industrial activity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is a vivid blend of historical architecture backdropped by daily, contemporary port activities, presenting a living town that respects its heritage while continuing to thrive and develop. The lush greenery scattered throughout the town and hazy sky adds to the serene yet lively setting of the photograph.","title":"The hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II docked at Rovinj on the Adriatic Sea coast","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549377","550318","542913","542878","542907","542910","549264","550314","550322","554102","542877","543362","550307","543361","542905","548229"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["town","representative","tower","heritage","bell","construction","spire","boat","repair","harbor"]}
