{"path":"545279.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a nature scene with a foreground of densely clustered, small white flowers that appear delicate and windblown. These flowers are well-lit by natural sunlight, highlighting their fluffiness and the gentle motion implied by their position. Above and behind these flowers stand tall trees with thin trunks and spreading branches with needle-like dark green leaves. The trees form a somewhat silhouetted frame against a softly lit sky, peering out over a calm body of water visible in the background. The ocean or large lake in the backdrop is serene, with small waves or ripples barely discernible at this distance, and stretches horizontally across the view framed by the trees. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening, with a tranquil, peaceful essence suffusing the scene. The composition is vertically oriented, enhancing the feeling of height and depth created by the layers of floral foreground, mid-ground trees, and distant water.","title":"Wild flowers along the coast of San Juan island","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547540","553997","557099","545101","557098","555040","542615","543199","542968","547592","557618","550536","545703","547642","543203","550746"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["suffuse","flower","pee","needle","flowers","tree","essence","height","ripple","trunk"]}
