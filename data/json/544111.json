{"path":"544111.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph presents a large open-pit mine terraformed into multiple terraced layers. The landscape shows a vast excavation site characterized by earthy tones and steep, layered drops to access various mining levels.\n\nAt the forefront, we observe a network of winding unpaved roads used for the movement of mining vehicles, snaking their way down towards deeper sections of the pit. On one distinct level, a large deposit of reddish-brown material is noticeable; such deposits are usually either excavated earth or ores.\n\nThe background features a mountainous terrain under a clear blue sky, which complements the earthy browns and reds of the mining pit. Far beyond the immediate pit, you can see industrial structures possibly related to the mining operations, such as processing plants or storage facilities. The entire scene is depicted under bright sunlight, casting sharp shadows that enhance the dimensional feel of the terraced layers.\n\nThe photograph does not include any easily discernible human figures, emphasizing the grand scale of the mine in comparison to individual human presence. Overall, this image captures the intense human modification of a natural landscape for resource extraction, highlighting both industrial might and environmental impact.","title":"The phelps dodge corp.'
