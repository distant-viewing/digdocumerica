{"path":"543604.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and scenic landscape during twilight. The image shows a vast expanse of a calm lake stretching into the distance, flanked by densely wooded mountain slopes. The view is taken from a high vantage point looking downward across a slope covered in dark silhouettes of coniferous trees.\n\nIn the foreground, the trees appear prominently against the lighter sky, with their branches and needles clearly defined. Further into the middle ground, the lake becomes visible, its surface reflecting the hues of the sky, transitioning from a deep navy to a lighter blue at the horizon, representing a seamless blend with the water. The lake curves gently and extends to the right of the frame, leading the eye towards a distant coastline.\n\nIn the background, the surrounding landscape is composed of multiple layers of mountains, which fade progressively into misty shades of blue and purple due to the atmospheric perspective. This creates a sense of depth and serenity. The sky, washed in a gradient of subdued, dusky blues and violets, adds to the calm evening ambiance. Visible in the sky is what appears to be a faint moonrise or perhaps an early evening star, adding a pinpoint of brightness in the otherwise subdued twilight scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of peacefulness and natural beauty, typical of a pristine lake environment at dusk, inviting contemplation and appreciation of the natural world.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543577","543590","554397","554405","552142","554752","557570","554403","552319","551280","550777","554760","552336","543618","554404","542994"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lake","twilight","violet","evening","slope","navy","appreciation","blue","become","wash"]}
