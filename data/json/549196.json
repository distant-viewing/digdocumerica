{"path":"549196.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image features a quaint and rural setting depicting a small building, which functions both as a post office and a store, located in Decker, Montana, as indicated by the signage. The building has a charming architecture with a peaked roof and is mostly constructed from white wooden planks, paired with a portion that has red brick walls. \n\nThe front of the building sports a large sign hanging from the roof, clearly labeled \"POST OFFICE and STORE\" in bold black letters, with the location \"Decker Mont. 59025\" underneath. There are two main public entrances visible, each under its own small gable-covered porch that mirrors the primary roof. The windows and doors are framed with simple, functional trim.\n\nVisible on the side of the building are two large chests promoting \"Coca-Cola\" and \"ICE.\" These vintage-style promotional chests suggest that the store not only serves as a mailing hub but also offers groceries or refreshments. A classic blue USPS mailbox stands out front, enhancing the functional role of the building as a local postal facility.\n\nThe surroundings include a well-maintained lawn with a few deciduous trees, suggesting a peaceful, small-town environment. The atmosphere captured in the photo, with its bright sunlight and clear skies, conveys a serene, nostalgic small-town American vibe typical of many rural communities across the United States.","title":"Decker's post office and general store","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["550991","556370","549006","549005","556984","555640","557760","555377","557567","557759","556368","542702","558029","558037","552518","552517"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["chest","store","roof","town","refreshment","mailbox","grocery","building","charming","promote"]}
