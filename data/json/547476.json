{"path":"547476.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image displays a collection of severely damaged vehicles, presumably in a junkyard. The cars are crushed and stacked in layers, showcasing a high degree of deformation and destruction. The assortment of vehicles, evident from the various recognizable parts like hoods, trunks, and a distinctively mangled radiator grille, suggest that these vehicles have suffered extensive damage due to extreme force, possibly from a compactor or a heavy collision.\n\nThe colors in the image are quite muted, with shades predominantly in dark blues and blacks, reflecting the metallic nature of the vehicles under low or artificial lighting. There doesn't appear to be any human activity or natural elements like trees or ground visible; the focus is entirely on the crumpled mass of metal. This setting gives the photograph a somber, eerie atmosphere, emphasizing themes of decay, abandonment, and the end of utility. The overall composition presents a chaotic tangle of metal, creating a dense texture and complex visual patterns that draw the viewer's eye across the frame.","title":"Auto shredder on Fields Point will turn these flattened cars into scrap metal for export.","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["552738","554311","542656","545303","555492","553006","545365","553005","542590","554352","545340","546268","555491","552739","554305","552999"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["vehicle","compactor","junkyard","grille","degree","mass","black","destruction","hood","assortment"]}
