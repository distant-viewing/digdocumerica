{"path":"551876.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a vintage tramcar. The primary focus is a woman standing in the aisle, facing toward the tram's front. She wears a light brown coat and matching hat, and appears to be engaging with a tram machine, possibly to validate a ticket.\n\nAround her, other passengers can be seen seated, suggesting a moment of daily commute. The seated passengers are indistinct, with one person on the left wearing a grey coat and having a bag resting between their feet.\n\nThe interior of the tram is characterized by wooden benches and steel poles, both of which reinforce the vintage look of the tram. Overhead, lights are fixed to the ceiling, and hanging straps are provided, presumably for standing passengers. Natural light enters through the windows, bathing the tram in a soft glow and contributing to the calm, everyday life ambiance of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition and the attire of the passengers suggest a setting from the mid-20th century, reflecting a common public transport scene of that era.\n","title":"Rider purchases ticket from automatic vendor on trolley","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["554174","549655","551875","556834","549893","556061","556671","556780","555974","556665","556095","554326","556745","555982","556656","549658"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["tram","passenger","coat","commute","aisle","ticket","fix","vintage","strap","standing"]}
