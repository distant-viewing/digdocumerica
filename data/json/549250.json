{"path":"549250.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling field covered in dense, yellow-flowered plants, possibly a crop like rapeseed (used to make canola oil), under a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds. There are no people or animals visible in the image. The view extends towards the horizon, where a line of dark green trees and possibly some low hills can be faintly seen in the distance. The lush greenery of the trees contrasts with the vivid yellow of the field and the azure sky above, creating a vibrant and colorful landscape. The lighting suggests it is a sunny day, enhancing the vivid colors of the natural scene.","title":"Alfalfa field near the Tongue River","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549158","542641","552503","549251","542645","549233","549229","549141","542704","544439","557160","544552","555648","542642","549252","550781"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["field","oil","crop","yellow","animal","hill","plant","tree","cloud","greenery"]}
