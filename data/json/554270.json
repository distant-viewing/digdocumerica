{"path":"554270.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman standing outdoors on a sunny day, taking a photograph with a small camera. She is dressed in fashion suggestive of the 1970s, wearing flared jeans, a black leather jacket adorned with patterns on the sleeves and back, and a patterned, knit shoulder bag. Her hair is long and styled with loose waves, and she appears to be focused on her subject.\n\nThe setting includes a backdrop of a store with various colorful clothing items displayed in the window, including what looks like a red dress and an orange shirt. The ground is partly covered with snow, indicating it could be winter or early spring. The building's exterior has a combination of wood and brick elements, and there is a wooden frame around the store display area. Her shadow is clearly cast on the ground beside her, emphasizing the brightness of the day. The overall mood is casual and lively, reflecting a moment of leisure activity in an urban setting.","title":"In the village","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["550079","553157","551821","553191","557039","551648","552398","549888","550048","556765","553165","553204","548483","556453","557114","543509"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["store","suggestive","leather","covered","knit","brightness","combination","shoulder","fashion","display"]}
