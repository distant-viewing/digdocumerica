{"path":"547404.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene rural scene, featuring a weathered wooden fence post in the foreground that dominates the composition. The fence post, which is old and worn, stands vertically, sloping slightly towards the top. It is connected to strands of barbed wire, extending into the background, integral to a traditional barbed wire fence.\n\nThe ground is covered with lush green grass interspersed with patches of taller, dried, light-brown grass that suggests it might be either late spring or early autumn. The natural lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows and enriching the colors of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a small house or farmhouse surrounded by a few trees, giving a sense of rural habitation. The house appears to be quite simple, perhaps indicative of older architectural styles found in rural areas. Near the house, there are some indistinct structures that could either be other buildings or machinery, typical of a farm setting.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with a few whisps of clouds, creating a tranquil and open atmosphere. Power lines can faintly be seen running across the top left corner, hinting at the connection between rural and developed areas. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the rugged fence post in the foreground against a pastoral backdrop, effectively captures the essence of rural life and landscape.","title":"Abandoned farm five miles south of rural community of grafton","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["543414","557212","557946","546154","542895","549154","545823","549156","547522","543660","555635","549142","547658","545828","543122","555609"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["fence","barbed","post","wire","house","strand","farmhouse","slop","near","enrich"]}
