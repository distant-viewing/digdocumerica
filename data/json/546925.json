{"path":"546925.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling maritime scene likely taken from a river or port area, showcasing a variety of ships and the city skyline in the background. In the foreground, there are several large vessels, including what appears to be a tanker and cargo ships. One of the ships prominently features the name \"PELHAM\" on its hull in bold, white letters against a dark background. A tugboat is visible next to the cargo ships, likely assisting in navigation or docking.\n\nBehind these ships, the urban skyline displays a mix of architectural styles ranging from modern skyscrapers to older, ornate buildings. Prominent in the skyline is a tall building under construction, evident from the construction crane at its top. Other notable features of the cityscape include a variety of high-rise buildings with different fa√ßades, windows, and structures, suggesting a diverse and densely populated urban setting.\n\nThe water is calm, with reflections lightly visible, and the overall lighting indicates it might be midday given the brightness and clarity of the surroundings. The image evokes a sense of activity and transport, typical of a major commercial port area.","title":"Tugboats help move a cargo ship out of the Baltimore harbor through the northwest branch.
