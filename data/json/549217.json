{"path":"549217.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image depicts a vast, open grassland under an overcast sky. The landscape is predominantly flat with a gentle slope, covered in dense, tall grasses that display shades of green and brown. Notably, there are no trees or significant structures in the immediate vicinity, contributing to the sense of wide, open space.\n\nNear the horizon in the center of the image, there is a solitary windmill standing, a common feature in rural settings for water pumping. The sky is filled with grey clouds suggesting an overcast weather condition, which casts a dim light over the scene, muting the colors of the grassland.\n\nThe photo composition places the horizon slightly above the midpoint of the frame, with the grassland dominating the foreground, enhancing the feeling of expansiveness and isolation of the terrain. Overall, the setting evokes a serene, natural environment typical of a rural or undeveloped area.","title":"This ranch in the powder river basin is threatened by plans for massive strip-mining operations","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["549210","545828","549216","549186","552903","549142","549238","557087","549227","549218","549157","549181","545040","549141","549236","546129"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["grassland","windmill","expansiveness","mute","standing","horizon","vicinity","feeling","slope","isolation"]}
