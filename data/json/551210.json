{"path":"551210.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil river scene at dusk. The focal point is a large body of water that appears smooth and reflective, colored in shades of gray and pink due to the soft light of the setting sun. Moving towards the left of the frame is a tugboat, noticeable due to its size relative to other elements in the water. The tugboat creates a trailing wake behind it, indicating motion.\n\nOn the right side of the image, near the horizon line, is a seemingly dense forest that forms a dark silhouette against the sky, harbingering the onset of night. This line of trees runs across the background horizontally, interfaced with the river, underscoring the tranquility of the landscape.\n\nIn the sky, two aircraft can be seen, one clearly in the upper right corner and another, partially visible, in the upper center, which looks like itâ€™s carrying a banner with faint, illegible text. The presence of these planes adds a layer of activity and human presence in the otherwise serene natural setting.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of peacefulness and simplicity, juxtaposed with subtle signs of human activity, all bathed in the gentle light of the evening. The composition leverages the horizontal layering of water, land, and sky, delivering a balanced and calming visual experience.","title":"Late afternoon on the main Osage arm of Lake of the Ozarks near Horseshoe Bend.
