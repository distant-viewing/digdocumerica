{"path":"544749.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet striking river landscape, presumably taken from an elevated position or possibly an aircraft given the visible shadow of a helicopter in the bottom central part of the image. In the river, there are two boats; one appears to be a standard motorboat, predominantly white with people visible inside, likely engaged in a leisure or travel activity. Adjacent to this boat floats a circular, red raft, which adds a vibrant spot of color against the muted tones of the river.\n\nThe river itself has a smooth surface, reflecting a dusky hue, possibly owing to either the time of day or the sediment within the water. The banks of the river are mostly barren with sparse vegetation, suggesting a semi-arid or desert environment.\n\nBehind the river, the landscape dramatically rises into rugged red cliffs and rocky terrains, indicative of a canyon or a similar geologically rich area. The cliffs display layers of sediment, showcasing a variety of earthy colors from deep red to lighter tan, which might suggest erosion over time. The sky above is mostly clear with a hint of clouds, suggesting fair weather at the time the photograph was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition relays a peaceful moment in a striking natural setting, likely intended to capture the essence of outdoor adventure and exploration in a desert river environment.","title":"Small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["549460","545744","548916","548933","545745","548050","550989","548935","543716","544929","545640","549461","548939","543793","545654","549532"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","sediment","cliff","desert","time","helicopter","raft","motorboat","boat","aircraft"]}
