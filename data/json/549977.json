{"path":"549977.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph offers a wide-angle, aerial view of a heavily industrialized area. In this comprehensive scene, multiple large, cylindrical storage tanks dominate the landscape, suggesting they might be used for storing oil, gas, or chemicals. These tanks are neatly arranged in clusters throughout the center of the image.\n\nSurrounding the storage area, a network of roads and highways is densely packed with cars, indicating heavy traffic congestion. These roads curve and intersect intricately, creating a complex transportation hub. To the top left of the image, the infrastructure continues beyond the frame, pointing towards more industrial or urban areas.\n\nIn the background, partially visible through a hazy sky, a large body of water stretches horizontally across the image. The atmosphere has a dull, muted color palette primarily due to overcast or polluted air, which somewhat obscures the distant details.\n\nAdjacent to the roads and among the storage tanks, there are also several smaller buildings, possibly related to the operation and management of the storage facility or other industrial purposes. The overall impression is of a bustling, dense, and highly industrial region, bearing the marks of significant economic activity and environmental impact.","title":"Gulf and Arco plants.
