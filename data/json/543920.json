{"path":"543920.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This image captures a vibrant scene inside what appears to be a classroom or educational setting. A group of young people, mostly girls, is focused on sorting or assembling pieces of paper on a large flat surface at the center of the room. The mat they are working on displays painted sections and some text, suggesting it may be part of a project or artistic activity. \n\nThe background provides a glimpse into a busy school environment with several other students engaged in various activities around the room. Some students are seated at desks, appearing to be concentrating on writing or studying, indicating an active learning atmosphere. Notably, there's a mix of vintage desks and chairs, typical of classroom furniture from a few decades ago.\n\nThe entire setting is indoors under artificial lighting, contributing to the somewhat subdued color tones in the photograph. Various educational posters and decorations can be seen adorning the walls, adding to the educational ambiance of the scene. A teacher or instructor is also visible in the background overseeing the activities. The composition of the photograph and the activities it captures reflects a moment of learning, creativity, and collaboration among students.","title":"Public school students work on ecology project","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543919","546548","552946","554838","548243","558214","554332","544322","544314","546556","544798","543928","552592","545547","558216","553269"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["student","classroom","learning","desk","room","teacher","collaboration","mat","creativity","indoor"]}
