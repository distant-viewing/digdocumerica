{"path":"556471.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photo depicts a woman seated at a desk in an office, viewed from behind. She is facing a window which fills most of the frame with bright light, making the details outside the window indiscernible and lending a silhouette effect to the scene. The woman has long hair, wearing a yellow short-sleeved shirt, and appears to be holding a small child in her lap, although both their outlines are partially obscured by the dark interior lighting. \n\nThe desk is cluttered with various items including stacked documents, files, and what appears to be a phone with a spiral cord on the right, suggesting a dynamic work environment. Near the desk, there are partially open filing cabinets filled with papers and files, indicating a busy, utilized workspace. The room has a wooden floor, and there is a darker area that can be observed partially, likely due to the interior shadows. The overall ambiance suggests a scenario where the woman is possibly managing work as well as the care of a child, highlighting a personal and professional multitasking situation.","title":"Ms.  Gail falk seltzer, a black lung benefits staff lawyer for the united mine workers field services office in Charleston, West Virginia.
