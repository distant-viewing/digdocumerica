{"path":"552624.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant social scene indoors, likely at a public or community event. The focus is on a senior woman wearing glasses and a traditional white headscarf, who is shaking hands with a younger man. The man appears cheerful and is dressed in a dark suit with a black tie, sporting long hair and large glasses indicative of a style perhaps popular in the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nTo the right, another woman is slightly out of focus, smiling broadly while engaging with other attendees. She is wearing a light-colored suit and glasses. The atmosphere is warm and congenial, with several other individuals partially visible in the background, suggesting a crowded room.\n\nThe setting has a feel of an indoor gathering space with natural and artificial lighting contributing to an overall warm tone of the photograph. The background is softly blurred, drawing attention to the interaction between the two main subjects in the foreground. This scene likely represents a cultural or community event where individuals of various ages are interacting warmly.","title":"Minister Green of the United Methodist-Presbyterian Church greets members after Sunday morning service.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["547358","545384","547371","556247","556028","551337","557031","552646","543932","553761","553202","547437","553275","557177","550679","551460"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["glass","suit","event","headscarf","community","attendee","woman","tie","1960","room"]}
