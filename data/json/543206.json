{"path":"543206.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, dense wildflower meadow. The meadow is abundant with orange and white blooms spread throughout, creating a colorful, textured tapestry of nature. The orange flowers dominate the scene with their bright, bold hues, while the white flowers add a delicate contrast. These white blossoms seem to be smaller, and are scattered in clusters among the taller, orange blooms.\n\nThe flowers are in full bloom, suggesting it is spring or summer. The field is lush and green, with grass and foliage intermingled among the flowers, adding depth and variety to the verdant background. Sunlight appears to dapple through, highlighting portions of the meadow and giving the scene a warm, inviting glow.\n\nNo man-made objects or people are present in the image; it's a pure representation of natural flora in its undisturbed state. The focus and composition primarily center on capturing the explosion of color and the density of the wildflowers, showcasing natureâ€™s beauty in a wild setting.","title":"Flowers along swanton road, north from Santa Cruz","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550781","557541","544443","544574","542645","552503","557098","553076","544439","549230","542704","545847","545723","544876","549232","545291"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["meadow","bloom","flower","intermingle","dapple","warm","blossom","tapestry","wildflower","wildflowers"]}
