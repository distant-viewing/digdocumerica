{"path":"543091.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and muted beach landscape during a hazy twilight or possibly predawn moment. The ocean is relatively calm, displaying a smooth surface marred only by the occasional gentle wave, which gives a sense of peaceful motion to the scene. The beach is littered with numerous rocks and boulders of varying sizes, some partially submerged, creating interesting shapes and textures in the shallow water.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dim and moody, predominantly in hues of blue and purple, suggesting either early morning or late evening hours. The sky is largely obscured by mist or fog, which blends seamlessly with the sea at the horizon, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn the distance, the silhouette of a mountainous landscape can faintly be seen, adding depth and a sense of scale to the composition. The right side of the frame features a faint light source, possibly from a setting or rising sun, which casts a subtle reflection on the water, enhancing the tranquil and slightly mysterious aura of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of isolation and tranquility, inviting the viewer to contemplate the natural beauty and quietude of this coastal environment.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547492","547483","543081","543025","543244","543078","547638","547496","542890","543287","557509","550458","544985","557508","542993","545081"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","aura","quietude","boulder","fog","purple","hour","source","twilight","mist"]}
