{"path":"550037.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph shows a vibrant outdoor scene at a sidewalk café, likely captured on a sunny day given the sharp shadows and bright light. The setting is an urban environment, evident from the storefronts and signage visible in the background, including \"Travis Restaurant\" and \"Commonwealth Bank.\"\n\nThe foreground prominently features various groups of people seated at folding tables and chairs that are lined along the sidewalk. The chairs and tables are casually arranged, some with sun canopies and others open to the sky. The seating appears comfortable, with striped cushioning on some chairs.\n\nThere are multiple patrons enjoying their time at the café. They are dressed in casual and semi-formal attire, suggesting it might be lunchtime on a weekday. The patrons include men and women, some engaged in conversation, while others are alone, possibly taking a break or enjoying a meal. Drinks and light meals can be seen on the tables, indicating a relaxed dining experience.\n\nA man stands in the middle of the frame, dressed in dark clothing and carrying a camera, which he seems to be adjusting or preparing to use. His presence and action suggest that he might be a photographer capturing the scene or a participant in the environment.\n\nThe environment overall is lively yet relaxed, capturing a typical urban moment where people unwind in the middle of a busy day. The architecture and signage represent a mid-20th century American city setting.","title":"Sidewalk cafe on Newbury Street, between Claredon and Dartmouth","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551634","551846","549657","551635","549669","551637","549677","549672","551848","551803","553190","551650","551834","553204","551829","551823"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["patron","café","chair","table","meal","sidewalk","signage","middle","photographer","dining"]}
