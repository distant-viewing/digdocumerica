{"path":"546732.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a large parking lot and building complex. The main area consists of a vast car park filled predominantly with cars, arranged in neat rows separated by white line markings. Some vacant spaces are scattered throughout the parking lot. Along the perimeter, different sizes and types of buses and vans are neatly parked.\n\nTo the left of the parking lot, there are several large buildings exhibiting a commercial or industrial aesthetic, likely warehouses or distribution centers. One of the buildings, appearing to have multiple loading docks, is surrounded by more white trucks uniformly parked in rows. This suggests that the facility maybe used for logistics or shipping purposes.\n\nThe surroundings of the lot are predominantly urban, with other smaller buildings, some greenery, and residential houses visible in the distance. The roads around the parking area are visible, with a few moving vehicles, enhancing the urban characteristic of the environment. The overall scene gives a bustling, yet organized impression typical of a business or industrial area in a city.","title":"Bus yard off New York Avenue, NE","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549875","548433","550100","548015","546708","546671","548434","555759","542635","548444","546715","548432","556978","546685","547686","556197"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lot","parking","park","row","perimeter","distribution","logistic","loading","shipping","characteristic"]}
