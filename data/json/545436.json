{"path":"545436.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures three children sitting on a weathered wooden porch next to an old house. The house's exterior walls are made of dark, weather-beaten wood with white trim, showing signs of wear and age. One of the windows with a white frame is partially visible in the background.\n\nThe child on the left is wearing a striped long-sleeve shirt with horizontal stripes in shades of orange, white, and brown, and knee-length shorts. His expression is serious, and he is looking slightly to the left of the camera.\n\nThe middle child, a girl, wears a faded red tank top and a multi-colored skirt with a torn hem. Her expression is solemn, and she gazes directly at the camera.\n\nThe child on the right is wearing a blue and yellow shirt, cut at the sleeve and neckline, and patterned shorts. He sits slightly turned away from the camera, with a neutral expression and looking off to the side.\n\nAll three children are barefoot, and their postures and expressions convey a quiet, reflective mood. The photograph likely aims to evoke a sense of their lives and environment, highlighting aspects of childhood, resilience, or community in a rustic or impoverished setting.","title":"\"Little Korea\", an area of sub-standard housing in South Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545509","545379","543538","553498","545383","545526","551130","545319","552958","546043","550137","551001","552959","551729","546994","550109"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","expression","camera","short","neckline","beat","sleeve","tear","sit","house"]}
