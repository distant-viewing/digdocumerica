{"path":"549663.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph primarily features two street signs at the forefront against an urban backdrop. The upper sign, which is larger and rectangular, has a dark blue background with a white-edged letter \"P\" indicating parking. Below the \"P\" the words \"Parkhaus Garage Am Beethovenplatz\" are written in white, and below that, the word \"Frei\" which means \"free\" or \"available\" in German. This sign indicates the availability of parking spaces in a garage located at Beethovenplatz.\n\nThe lower sign, attached to the same pole but positioned slightly forward and to the right in the image, is smaller and also has an arrow pointing to the right. It is labeled \"Einbahn\", which translates to \"one way\" in English, suggesting the direction of traffic flow.\n\nIn the blurred background, there is a portion of an architectural structure. The visible part shows a well-maintained building facade with multiple windows featuring classic detailing.\n\nThe photograph is taken in broad daylight and provides a clear view of the signage setup, commonly seen on urban streets to guide drivers. The focus and composition emphasize the function of the signs in directing traffic and parking within the city environment.","title":"Entrance to the underground parking lot which was built beneath the famous beethoven statue and park","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549648","549661","546619","555450","549660","549647","546716","556720","555448","557824","550126","558138","556723","546708","557826","546715"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","sign","word","availability","traffic","pointing","arrow","mean","garage","street"]}
