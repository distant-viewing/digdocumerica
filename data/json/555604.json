{"path":"555604.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a rural landscape visually dominated by a large excavation or mining operation with a prominent strip mining shovel visible in the background. The mechanical shovel, colored red and white, stands out amidst piles of rubble and exposed earth, depicting a stark contrast against the natural green surroundings. In the foreground, two white houses with dark roofs are noticeable: one is partially visible behind lush green trees, while the other, more fully in view, stands to the right. The scene communicates a tension between residential life and industrial activity.\n\nBetween the houses and the mining operation, gentle slopes covered with grass and patches of trees fill the middle ground, suggesting a somewhat undisturbed natural state that sharply contrasts with the disrupted earth in the distance. Additional elements such as utility poles and thin, barely-visible wires cross through the area, hinting at the integration of infrastructure.\n\nThe overall composition and the juxtaposition of industrial machinery against a rural residential setting not only highlight a landscape undergoing significant transformation but also hint at the sociocultural and environmental impacts of such activities. The lighting in the image suggests a bright, clear day, which enhances the vividness of the contrasting natural and industrial elements.","title":"Coal shovel and strip mining form the backdrop of this house at the intersection of Interstate 70 and Route #800 near Morristown.","placename":"Morristown (Athens County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["554816","554829","554808","554769","543857","555633","554815","554763","554765","555590","543639","556467","554826","549255","549148","544139"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","shovel","earth","transformation","tension","disrupt","integration","house","undergo","operation"]}
