{"path":"543886.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures two women standing on a concrete sidewalk, viewed from an elevated perspective. The scene is diverse in textures and elements, giving a detailed snapshot of an urban environment.\n\nThe ground is divided by color variations in the pavement and interspersed with some manhole covers and possibly utility accesses. It is littered with numerous white and some colored papers scattered all over, suggesting a chaotic moment, possibly post-event dispersal or littering after some activity.\n\nThe two women are at the center of the frame. One woman is dressed in a vertically striped, multicolored sleeveless dress, looking down towards the ground, with her hand blocking the sun from her eyes, potentially indicating a bright day. Holding papers in her other hand, she seems to be busy, maybe searching for something amidst the clutter on the ground. The other woman is wearing a short-sleeved, light blue dress with matching blue sandals and is carrying books or folders, clutching them close to her body. She is looking up with a concerned or bewildered expression.\n\nThe backdrop includes a street lamp to the left of the image and a gray utility box anchoring the corner of the scene, adding to the urban infrastructure theme. There isn't much more in terms of background detail, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the two individuals and the scattered papers.","title":"Magazines and newspapers litter the intersection of sixth & broadway after debris was spilled from a passing truck","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543890","549916","549907","547190","557904","551444","551817","546563","549806","556808","551815","543036","553164","556199","553474","551436"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["paper","woman","litter","folder","utility","clutch","sleeveless","search","sandal","clutter"]}
