{"path":"556491.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat rustic and neglected rural setting. The focal point is a small, worn-out house with dark wooden siding and a tin roof, parts of which appear rusted or aged. To the left of the house, there is a covered area that could serve as a porch or an extension, featuring some items that are not clearly distinguishable due to distance and shadow. \n\nIn front of the house, a large yellow blanket, which looks old and riddled with holes, is prominently displayed, hanging from what seems to be a makeshift clothesline. The blanket has noticeable tears and a generally tattered appearance, indicating possible long-term use and exposure to the elements.\n\nThe grass around the house is overgrown and unkempt, scattered with random debris including wood logs, a few bricks, and what appear to be discarded personal belongings. No people are visible in the scene, giving the photograph a sense of abandonment.\n\nThe background is partially obscured but suggests a somewhat forested area with trees beginning to fill out, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken in spring. The general atmosphere is one of neglect and disrepair, hinting at economic hardships or abandonment.","title":"A tattered blanket hung on a line in fireco, West Virginia near Beckley, symbolizes the decline in the area after the coal mines gave out.
