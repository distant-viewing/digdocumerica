{"path":"545312.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted or chemically contaminated outdoor area, likely a spill site or waste disposal area. At the forefront, there is a large expanse of what appears to be heavily contaminated soil or ground. The surface is mottled with swirling patterns of white, gray, and dark pollutants which have possibly seeped into or mixed with the soil. The pollutants create a pattern resembling foam or sludge, indicative of chemical waste or effluent.\n\nIn the middle ground, you can see a concrete structure that might serve as a barrier or part of a containment system for the waste. This suggests an attempt to control or manage the pollution, although the spread is extensive in the photographed area. \n\nThe background shows tall vegetation and might be indicative of a rural or semi-industrial area. There is a structure visible at the very back, possibly related to waste management, storage, or processing facilities, supported by its industrial look and the presence of large containers or tanks. At the top of the image, there's a wire fence, perhaps indicating restricted access to this polluted site.\n\nThe overall scene emits a sense of environmental neglect and the harsh impact human activities can have on natural landscapes. There's no presence of people in the image, focusing entirely on the environmental issue depicted.","title":"Here the Denver Metro Sewage Treatment Plant discharges into the South Platte River.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["543773","552989","551561","550259","549624","550193","551559","544775","548205","552019","543762","551562","555847","550248","548206","547907"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollutant","waste","spill","containment","soil","attempt","site","spread","disposal","foam"]}
