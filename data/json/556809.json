{"path":"556809.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene featuring several people engaging in various activities. On the left side of the image, a woman is stepping off a bus. She is dressed in a light pink dress and is holding a black handbag, reaching for the door as if to close it behind her. The bus itself is white with some minimalistic colorful designs and the word \"Marta\" visible on its side, indicating it's likely a public transit vehicle.\n\nIn the middle and on the right side of the frame, a number of other individuals are depicted in dynamic poses. A woman in bright red pants and matching top strides energetically towards the bus, suggesting she might be rushing to catch it. Behind her, several other figures can be seen walking and interacting. A man in casual attire is walking in the opposite direction, away from the bus, and near him, a younger woman in a white dress and holding a purse walks in stride. A more distant group, comprising primarily younger people, are sitting and standing around on what looks like a city bench.\n\nThe background is dominated by an office building, lending an urban feel to the setting with its squared, modern architecture. Adjacent to the bus stop, a grassy patch and a sidewalk give some sense of the public nature of this area. At the far left, signs and other urban furnishings contribute to the busy atmosphere typically found in city environments. The photo captures a moment full of activity, perhaps during a typical day in a city where public transport is a common scene.","title":"Passengers leaving a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus in Atlanta, Georgia.
