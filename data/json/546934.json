{"path":"546934.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph displays an industrial maritime scene featuring a large, docked cargo ship and a towering crane structure. The ship is a sizable, predominantly white bulk carrier or cargo vessel, and it's positioned along a dock. Its build includes a tall central superstructure where the bridge and crew accommodations are likely housed, marked with various antennas and signal lights atop. The ship's hull displays some visible rust, highlighting its industrial use.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is an imposing crane structure, intricately assembled with multiple beams, platforms, and mechanical components, suggestive of heavy-duty loading and unloading capabilities. The structure is complex, with visible signs of wear and possibly exposure to harsh environmental conditions.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the scene is somewhat obscured by dust or mist, possibly emanating from the ongoing activities at the dock or the general maritime environment. This haze adds a gritty, industrial quality to the visual, enhancing the feeling of a bustling, working waterfront.\n\nIn the background, the vague outlines of other industrial or dock structures can be glimpsed through the mist, suggesting the ship and crane are part of a larger industrial port complex. The water in front of the dock reflects the somber tones of the scene, with ripples indicating a gentle movement in the otherwise calm maritime setting.","title":"A cloud of dust attends the unloading of a grain ship at Port Covington terminal.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547474","550910","547113","555283","545147","546828","546755","546881","552015","548127","552244","549305","550021","555797","555285","555261"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["dock","ship","crane","cargo","mist","accommodation","capability","superstructure","assemble","unloading"]}
