{"path":"552327.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features three people on a boat engaged in a fishing activity. The individual on the left is a woman, smiling broadly, wearing a gray rain jacket with a hood, red gloves, and a red hat. She proudly holds a fishing rod in one hand and a large fish in her other hand. Beside her, standing closer to the center of the boat, are two men, also smiling. Each man is dressed similarly in gray rain jackets and hoodies; one wears a red baseball cap. The setting appears to be a rainy, overcast day, likely in a river or lake environment given the visible water and land in the background which is lush and green, suggesting a natural, outdoor setting. The mood is cheerful, showcasing a successful fishing trip despite the inclement weather.","title":"Winter steelhead trout fishing on the Skagit River.
