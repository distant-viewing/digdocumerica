{"path":"546764.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking vista of mountainous terrain cloaked in layers of haze or mist. The scene consists of multiple ridges that recede into the distance, each layer progressively fading into a lighter shade, creating a sense of immense depth. The foreground shows slightly darker contours of mountains, which become increasingly obscured by the atmospheric conditions as they stretch back. The light source, likely the sun, is not directly visible but illuminates parts of the clouds and some mountain tops, enhancing the ethereal quality of the view. The sky above the mountains is subtly graduated, possibly due to the time of day, adding to the serene and tranquil atmosphere of the landscape.\n\nThe composition is rich in natural gradations of blue and gray tones, emphasizing the play of light and shadow across the various surfaces and volumes. There are no discernible human activities or man-made structures, giving the image a pristine, untouched look. The overall mood evoked by this photograph is one of quiet majesty and timeless beauty in the natural world.","title":"Smoke from copper smelters in Globe-Miami area drifts toward Phoenix","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544070","542676","552695","555378","542923","543023","554398","554402","557558","553825","542848","542681","554962","554634","555130","554647"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountain","layer","gradation","majesty","vista","volume","world","ridge","source","contour"]}
