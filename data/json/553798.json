{"path":"553798.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph takes place inside what appears to be a ferry or a small passenger ship. The scene captures a casual but busy atmosphere with multiple people engaging in various activities. \n\nThe focal point is two men seated at a table. One man, in the foreground, is wearing a blue t-shirt and is handling a stack of playing cards, possibly shuffling them. You can see only the back of his head and his hands actively involved with the cards. The man sitting across from him, more visible and centrally located in the image, is dressed in a striped short-sleeved shirt and sports watches on both wrists; he also has a badge hanging around his neck, suggesting he might be a crew member or someone with an official role on the ship. He looks intently at his own set of cards, displaying a pensive facial expression typical of a card player focusing on his move.\n\nAround these two, the environment is quite lively. To the left, another part of the ship is visible where several other passengers are seated at tables, some are conversing, and others are just sitting. The background suggests motion, as people seem to be in various states of activity, including walking and standing.\n\nThe interior design of the ship features simple decor with plain walls and large windows, which pour natural light into the cabin. The overall ambience is informal and communal, characteristic of public transport where strangers share a confined space for the duration of their journey.","title":"\"sea transit\" ferry has been operating for one year between downtown Honolulu and pearl harbor - an alternative to freeway congestion.
