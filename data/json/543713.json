{"path":"543713.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man with a deeply contemplative expression. His head is resting on his left hand, with his elbow supported by a surface out of view, possibly a chair armrest. He is balding, with some hair visible at the sides and back of his head, and he has a pale complexion.\n\nThe man is wearing a checkered shirt with hues of blue and green, slightly peppered with what looks like reflective dust or small particlesâ€”suggesting that he might have been working in an industrial or dusty environment. In his mouth, he holds a toothpick angled towards his left cheek.\n\nThe background is out of focus, enveloping him in soft, warm tones that might indicate a room lit by indoor lighting or through a window during late afternoon. The shallow depth of field focuses attention on the man's face and his thoughtful gaze, capturing a moment of introspection or perhaps weariness.\n\nThe intimacy and framing of the photo evoke a sense of candidness and unguarded emotion, highlighting the man as the central subject without the distraction of numerous background details. The portrayal could be interpreted as a personal moment of rest or reflection from either work or life's challenges.","title":"'Uranium miner'","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553052","557035","556563","543701","546636","552871","556443","557034","542784","556540","556452","548616","545974","555297","552104","557648"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["head","cheek","complexion","emotion","elbow","distraction","introspection","man","intimacy","particle"]}
