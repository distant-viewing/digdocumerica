{"path":"545632.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, arid landscape featuring a wide river twisting through a valley. The river, partially swollen with sandy, silt-laden waters, meanders in the foreground and continues through the center of the frame, surrounded by desert terrain. Its banks are irregular and dotted with patches of green vegetation, contrasting starkly with the overall barren surroundings.\n\nThe landscape is enclosed by tall cliff formations, characterized by layered sedimentary rock, hinting at geological processes over millennia. These cliffs exhibit shades of brown, red, and orange, contributing to the earthy palette of the scene. The terrain around the river is uneven and covered with sparse vegetation patches, rocks, and sandy areas, rendering a textured appearance to the ground.\n\nIn the distance, the sky is overcast with large, billowing clouds, suggesting possible weather changes. No human presence or artificial structures disrupt the natural scenery, emphasizing its remote and untouched feel. The meandering paths on the banks of the river could be trails or natural formations rather than man-made paths, underscoring the area's wildness. This photograph portrays a scene of natural, rugged beauty typically found in canyon or desert river environments.","title":"In October, 1972, a pipeline of the Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Company burst, releasing 285,000 gallons of crude oil into the San Juan River.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545633","543977","545629","545640","543793","544752","544744","552908","552548","545301","545636","543716","549456","544748","545787","543647"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","cliff","desert","bank","laden","millennium","formation","wildness","path","render"]}
