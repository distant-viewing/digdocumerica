{"path":"547045.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural setting with a slightly nostalgic feel, accentuated by the grain and color saturation typical of film photography. The scene is set in a wooded area with dense underbrush and a diversity of plants, some with leaves tinged with autumn colors.\n\nThe composition focuses on a narrow, winding dirt path that cuts a rugged route through the forest. Along this path, two individuals are seen; one sitting closer to the foreground and another lying down beside the path, partially covered by foliage. Both individuals are facing away from the camera, their identities obscured, adding a layer of anonymity and universality to the scene. It appears to be a peaceful moment, with both individuals seemingly engaged in relaxation or contemplation amidst the quiet of the woods.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, inviting the viewer's attention primarily towards the figures and the immediate surroundings. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be a sunlit day, with patches of sunlight filtering through the canopy and illuminating parts of the path and the forest floor, enhancing the feeling of depth and texture. Overall, the image evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature and a pause from the hustle of everyday life.","title":"Trail through lakeside wash--in area near ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["551942","553373","553464","555215","557940","545512","543446","554663","554720","543490","557018","554718","545293","554394","542732","557822"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["path","anonymity","woods","identity","underbrush","tinge","individual","forest","hustle","pause"]}
