{"path":"543351.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a ghost town comprising an array of weathered wooden buildings, showcasing a glimpse into a bygone era. In the foreground, part of the scene is framed by unspecific blurred flora elements, likely wild shrubs or flowers. Prominently in the middle ground stands a tall, white gravestone, marking a cemetery plot, suggesting the historical narrative of the town and its residents. Beyond the gravestone is a series of vernacular wooden structures; these include residential homes, barn-like constructions, and possibly a church or community hall distinguished by its pitched roof and steeple-like architecture.\n\nThe buildings are dispersed across a gently sloping landscape that indicates this town was set in a valley surrounded by hills, visible in the distant background. The natural landscape is arid, characterized by scant vegetation and a hilly terrain, which creates a stark contrast with the dense cluster of timber constructions. Each building exhibits different states of decay, with some retaining intact roofs while others appear near collapse, reinforcing the ghost town's abandoned and derelict condition. The entire setting is bathed in bright, natural light, suggesting a clear day, which highlights the rustic textures and muted colors of the wood and dry landscape. This scene vividly captures the essence of a deserted settlement, evoking a sense of quiet nostalgia and lost history.","title":"Southern California -- Bodie","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543367","543341","543349","543342","543356","543353","545233","548239","543354","544137","556330","554707","543344","554822","547522","554823"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["town","gravestone","lose","cemetery","retain","collapse","hall","construction","nostalgia","resident"]}
