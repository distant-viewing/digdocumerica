{"path":"549935.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor fishing scene by a body of water, possibly a river or a lake. The setting looks tranquil with a lush environment that includes large trees and a grassy bank visible across the water.\n\nOn the foreground and focusing on the left side of the image, there are three individuals engaged in fishing activities. One individual, a shirtless man with a muscular build and striped pants, stands beside the water, facing towards the center of the image but looking down, possibly at some fishing gear or a catch laid out on the rocks. He is holding what looks like a fish or some fishing equipment in his hands. To his immediate right, another man wearing a white shirt and vibrant red-striped pants is actively casting a fishing rod into the water, demonstrating a focused and dynamic posture. This man's positioning and form suggest he is mid-cast, emphasizing the action of fishing.\n\nFurther to the left, partially obscured and in a sitting position, is a third individual, more passively participating and possibly watching the fishing activity. This individualâ€™s attire includes a striped shirt, contributing to the casual, leisurely nature of the outing.\n\nThe natural light appears soft, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, lending the scene a peaceful, leisurely aura. The background features calm water reflecting the overcast or mild sky, a vegetated bank, and a constructed wooden pier or walkway running along the edge, enhancing the sense of a well-used recreational area.\n\nIn the distant background, beyond the water, there is a thin line of cars and perhaps people, indicating other recreational activities or the presence of a park or public gathering space. The far bank is lined with trees and hints of civilization, such as a light pole and faint structures, which integrate the scene into a broader community context.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of outdoor recreation and bonding, characterized by the tranquility of nature and focused activities.","title":"Croton Point Park on the Hudson River","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["542564","553081","550666","550313","548737","551025","550848","551024","543516","550665","554519","543164","542560","544274","552291","550217"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","bank","individual","bonding","civilization","water","build","catch","aura","pant"]}
