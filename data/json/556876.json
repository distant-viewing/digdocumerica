{"path":"556876.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a scene of railway maintenance or construction. It features a long, narrow railway bridge constructed with red steel beams and trusses. The bridge spans from the foreground deep into the background, tapering slightly as it recedes.\n\nIn the middle and lower part of the image, you can see two workers engaged in what seems to be the inspection or repair work on the bridge. The worker closest to the foreground is facing away from the viewpoint and appears to be wearing blue work clothes and a light-colored cap. The other worker, also facing away, is wearing a red helmet. Both are focused on the tasks at hand, highlighted by tools and construction materials scattered around them.\n\nDirectly beneath the walkway on which they stand, the structural elements of the bridge are visible in great detail, including bolts, crossbeams, and the open spaces between the ties that reveal the ground or water below.\n\nThe surrounding area includes some greenery and trees in full autumnal colors, indicating the season, with a slightly overcast sky. Also observable in the background is the continuation of the railway track running parallel to a road, heading towards the horizon, where a vehicle can be glimpsed in the distance. The environment suggests a quiet, rural setting.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way workmen attend to a car loaded with rails. In 1974 the company had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of railroad. Old track was replaced with quarter mile long sections of rail. Southern that year spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on maintaining the rails, the highest percentage in the industry. Virtually all the company's track can be traveled at a maximum of 60 miles per hour.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556888","557970","556869","556860","550966","556872","556874","556889","556873","546112","557975","552064","556901","550066","556877","556862"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["bridge","railway","worker","bolt","truss","continuation","construction","inspection","repair","work"]}
