{"path":"548996.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of two people sunbathing. There is a man lying on his back on a yellow towel, wearing sunglasses and no shirt, with what appears to be a knee brace on his left leg. His head is positioned towards the bottom-right of the frame, and his left arm is extended upward, holding hands with a woman beside him.\n\nThe woman, lying on her stomach to the man's left, is partially visible with her head near the center-left of the frame. She has curly black hair and is wearing a vibrant floral swimsuit. Her legs are bent at the knees, and she appears to be holding onto the man's hand.\n\nBoth individuals are on a textured surface that could be pavement or a type of mat, suggesting they might be on a poolside or similar outdoor area intended for lounging. The background is neutral and out of focus, enhancing the intimacy and relaxed mood of the scene. The focus and composition center on the interaction and close contact between the two individuals, capturing a moment of leisure and connection.","title":"Sunning on the lake shore","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552977","548465","554901","548624","550923","551306","547507","547935","543517","543460","544338","548533","551967","551016","551093","547680"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["knee","leg","head","mat","contact","intimacy","swimsuit","towel","pavement","hand"]}
