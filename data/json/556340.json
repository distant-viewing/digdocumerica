{"path":"556340.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a group of coal miners at the end of their shift, emerging from the entrance of a mine. There are approximately ten miners visible in the image. They wear traditional mining gear including hard hats with lamps, some covered in dust and soot, signaling a long day's work underground. Many of the miners have visible smiles and seem to be in good spirits, suggesting a sense of camaraderie or relief at the end of the workday. Some are carrying lunch boxes.\n\nThe lighting in the image is subdued with a focus on the natural light that highlights their faces and reflective safety stickers on some of their helmets. The background is industrial, with vague structures and masonry that look worn and aged, indicative of a long-standing mining facility. The colors are muted, dominated by grays and browns, which enhance the gritty feel of the environment these workers operate in.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of respite and human connection amidst the stress and hazard of coal mining, emphasizing themes of labor, industry, and friendship.","title":"Miners just leaving the elevator shaft of Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia at 4 p.m. There are three mine shifts. The first two are employed in digging and removing the coal. The midnight to morning or \"hoot-owl\" shift works on cleanup operations. These miners are headed for the company shower room to clean up before going home. The younger miners run to the showers and knock down anyone in the way; the older miners walk.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556393","556338","556377","556337","556374","556372","556375","556392","556348","556373","556339","556359","556346","556376","556363","556347"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["miner","mining","coal","end","masonry","respite","friendship","lunch","hazard","stress"]}
