{"path":"543338.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a modern house perched on a coastal hillside, captured during either sunrise or sunset. The house's architecture includes multiple levels, large windows, and an extended section that seems to jut out, supported by beams. The silhouette effect renders the house in dark contours against a lighter sky, which has a gradation of colors typical of moments near dawn or dusk.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes sparsely scattered trees, which are also silhouetted against the sky, contributing to the overall moody and serene atmosphere of the scene. In the distant background, a calm ocean horizon is visible, enhancing the tranquil and isolated feel of the location.\n\nThe composition uses the rule of thirds, with the house positioned to the right, balancing the visual weight of the trees on the left. The simplicity of the silhouettes combined with the natural scenic beauty evokes a sense of solitude and peace. The photograph also portrays a striking contrast between human-made structures and natural elements.","title":"Southern California -- Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543336","553931","546748","545019","557669","544448","546546","548241","545052","552464","551963","548664","556645","545041","543334","553458"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["house","silhouette","rule","gradation","weight","peace","third","sunrise","hillside","contour"]}
