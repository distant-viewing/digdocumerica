{"path":"556600.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of six men in an outdoor setting who are engaged in a discussion or briefing. They are gathered around several rows of bright yellow equipment housed in rugged, open cases laid out on the ground. These items appear to be heavy-duty, professional equipment, possibly related to mining, construction, or emergency services due to their robust nature and the context of the setting.\n\nFour of the men are wearing hard hats, indicating a work environment that requires protective gear. The hard hats of three men are yellow, and another man's hard hat is white, which might indicate different roles or ranks within their team. Their attire varies slightly, including shirts and work trousers; some wear uniforms with visible numbers (\"8\" clearly displayed on one individual), suggesting they could be part of a team or unit. One man, unique in the group, is dressed in a lighter blue shirt and blue pants, which could signify a different role or a visitor status compared to the others in green or khaki clothing.\n\nIn the background, there is a large tarp-covered structure or equipment, partially visible next to a white van. The setting includes lush green vegetation and a glimpse of hills or mountains, suggesting a remote or rural location.\n\nOverall, the scene is busy and industrially oriented, with a focus on preparation or inspection of the equipment before use. The people engaged in conversation reflect a sense of purpose and teamwork, likely discussing the operation or tasks at hand that involve the use of the equipment shown.","title":"Members of the Beth Elkhorn Coal Company begin donning their equipment to prepare for the Kentucky State Mine Safety Contest at Benham, near Cumberland. Each team has different colored coveralls that differentiate them during the competition which is fierce, but good-natured. The aim is to save life in the event of a mine accident. These men will go to any mine disaster in their vicinity, no matter who is involved.","placename":"Cumberland (Ky.)","location":"Cumberland, Kentucky","nn1":["542607","545672","556596","545537","556864","548277","542562","553636","543995","556335","553112","544003","557727","554666","546824","544969"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["equipment","team","role","hat","man","case","status","tarp","khaki","emergency"]}
