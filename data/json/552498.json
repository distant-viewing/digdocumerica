{"path":"552498.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a rustic and textured brick wall that appears to be part of an aged or possibly abandoned structure. The wall is adorned with various artistic and architectural elements creating a somewhat eclectic appearance. A prominent feature in the center of the image is a round, sculpted face, resembling a serene mask or head, set within a halo-like circular frame, giving it an aura of an artifact.\n\nJust below the face, there's an architectural relief that suggests classical influence, possibly mimicking the form of a small column or pedestal, adding to the ancient feel of the setting. This is further decorated with a sculpted fruit or floral motif. There are also large leafy green plants, likely elephant ears, in the foreground that add a touch of life and vibrancy against the weathered, brick backdrop.\n\nThe overall composition, with broken bricks and irregular openings—including one that looks like a circular window and another like an arch—gives the scene a blend of abandonment and historical depth. The mossy tones and subdued colors suggest that this might be an outdoor scene, exposed to elements over time. The photograph has a slightly blurred, dreamlike quality, adding to its mysterious and historical atmosphere.","title":"Sculpture by nick vergette at his home near Carbondale where he teaches at southern Illinois university","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["558013","543345","552530","557140","543348","546971","551330","544945","545355","558010","551344","553479","547518","546497","553478","544911"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["brick","halo","sculpt","mimic","mossy","relief","pedestal","fruit","artifact","mask"]}
