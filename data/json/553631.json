{"path":"553631.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene centered around two people engaged in the laborious task of handling large logs, specifically unloading or securing them on a truck. The truck is loaded with several massive logs that vary in size and have rough, uneven cut ends, indicating that they have been freshly chopped.\n\nOne man, wearing a hard hat and a light shirt paired with dark pants, is actively involved in affixing a cable or a chain around a log. His posture and the reach of his arms suggest the physical effort being exerted in maneuvering the heavy logging equipment. The second individual, dressed in a gingham check shirt and light-colored pants, assists or observes the process. Both individuals appear deeply focused on their task, indicating the serious nature of their work owing to the potential dangers involved in handling such large and heavy materials.\n\nThe backdrop of the photo appears to be a forested area with dark foliage, reinforcing the woodland setting typical of logging activities. Overall, the image captures a moment of intense physical labor characterized by the raw, rugged elements of the logging industry.","title":"In august, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora, California salvage operations on acreage owned by the pickering lumber company of standard, California., began promptly.
