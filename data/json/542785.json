{"path":"542785.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lumberjack at work in a forested area. The worker, who appears to be a male, is seen from his left side as he operates a large, yellow chainsaw to cut through a massive tree. He is wearing essential safety gear, including a hard hat, and is dressed in a blue long-sleeve shirt and brown pants, both of which are slightly dirty from the nature of his work.\n\nHe is bent over slightly, focusing intently on his task. The scene is filled with sawdust and wood chips, which are being ejected from the cutting site, creating a cloud of dust around the area where the chainsaw meets the tree. This adds a dynamic and somewhat gritty texture to the scene.\n\nThe background is dimly lit, suggesting it might be a cloudy day or that the dense foliage is blocking a significant amount of sunlight. Sparse undergrowth can be seen around the worker and smaller trees are visible in the misty, shadowy background, emphasizing the depth and the density of the surrounding forest.\n\nOverall, the image captures the intensity and the rugged environment of forestry work, highlighting both the physical effort involved and the scale of the trees being handled.","title":"\"Faller\" D.
