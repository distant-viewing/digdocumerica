{"path":"550620.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view over a river and a vast forested landscape. The curving river, featured prominently, has muddy banks which indicate possibly recent erosion or sediment deposits. The river is a medium shade of blue-gray, possibly due to the reflection of the overcast sky. On the banks of the river, you can see zones where the earth is exposed, showing lighter colors compared to the surrounding dark green foliage.\n\nThe forest is dense and expansive, extending to the horizon. It appears mostly uniform, suggesting it might be a boreal forest, made up mostly of coniferous trees. This type of forest typically includes species such as spruces and pines, which contribute to the dark green hue dominating the landscape.\n\nWithin and beyond the forest, there are a few small clearings visible. From this vantage point, they look like small patches of different vegetation, perhaps marshland or mineral-rich soil patches, reflecting the diversity within the ecosystem. There are also a couple of lakes or large ponds scattered throughout, their surfaces gleaming slightly, which contrasts with the matte texture of the forest.\n\nThe photograph appears to be taken from a considerable altitude, providing a wide view of the natural scenery below. The upper portions of the image fade into the distance under a hazy sky, suggesting either the limit of visibility or perhaps the onset of fog or clouds. This composition allows the viewer to appreciate the solitude and untouched nature of the area, emphasizing the remote and wild character of the landscape.","title":"Pipeline crossing at the Tazlina River southwest of the highway junction town of Glennallen, visible in the upper right of the frame.
