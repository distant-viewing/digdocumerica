{"path":"552988.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil lakeside scene partially framed by two trees and pine branches. In the foreground, a \"For Sale\" sign is attached to a tree trunk. The sign mentions 'ASA M. CLARK, Jr. Realtor' and provides an address along with a phone number, encouraging interested parties to call \"ED SHERMAN.\" The serene backdrop of the image features a calm and expansive body of water, presumably a lake, under a clear sky. The colors are vivid; the blue of the lake provides a stark contrast to the rich browns and greens of the tree and its branches.","title":"Realty is big business. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
