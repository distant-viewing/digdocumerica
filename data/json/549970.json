{"path":"549970.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a cityscape enveloped in a hazy, smoggy atmosphere, likely captured during the early morning or late evening, given the dim light and the dusky tones that pervade the scene. The city is dense with buildings of various heights, including both high-rises and shorter structures. There's a visible blend of architectural styles, from modern, glass-fronted skyscrapers to older, more ornate structures with distinct roofs.\n\nThe atmosphere is murky, casting a dull purple-gray hue over the buildings, suggesting either heavy pollution or fog descending upon the city. This ambiguous light obscures finer details but accentuates the forms of the buildings, creating a silhouette effect against the lighter sky. The sun, barely visible, appears as a faint, diffuse glow in the sky, struggling to penetrate the haze.\n\nThe composition of the photo creates a feeling of depth, as the buildings recede into the fog, becoming less distinct in the distance. No human figures or moving vehicles are discernible, which adds to the eerie, quiet character of the cityscape. The overall mood is somewhat somber and mysterious, emphasizing the urban expanse and its interaction with natural or environmental elements.","title":"Center city, Philadelphia at sunset","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545499","548385","549620","553021","552394","551141","545428","548365","545406","550186","548384","548360","548383","548339","548337","542683"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["fog","cityscape","pervade","struggle","penetrate","become","city","descend","building","recede"]}
