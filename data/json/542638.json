{"path":"542638.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a densely packed lot of Volkswagen Beetles in a variety of colors including yellow, orange, blue, green, and red. These cars are closely arranged and fill the majority of the foreground, suggesting a storage or shipping area for new vehicles. \n\nIn the background, a large suspension bridge spans across the scene, supported by tall towers and thick cables. The bridge arcs gracefully over a wide body of water and is flanked by hilly landscapes and light urban development. A few vehicles can be seen traveling on the bridge, offering a sense of scale and activity relative to the quiet static of the Beetle lot in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the colorful, cramped foreground of cars against the expansive and more monochromatic background featuring the bridge and surrounding natural and urban elements, creating a visual juxtaposition between the manufactured order and the open environment.","title":"Volkswagens on pier","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["542634","550908","542637","550909","542817","551912","547480","547327","553019","542636","546900","542633","546665","547469","547686","553022"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bridge","lot","suspension","order","majority","shipping","cable","car","vehicle","tower"]}
