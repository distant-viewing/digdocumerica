{"path":"548592.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a forest landscape engulfed in smoke and flames, likely depicting a controlled burn or wildfire. The foreground features a grassy area with flames visible, consuming the dry grass and spreading across the terrain. Billowing smoke rises prominently, obscuring part of the landscape and creating an atmospheric haze.\n\nTall pine trees dominate the scene. They are sparsely distributed across the field, standing somewhat isolated from one another, which suggests this might be a managed forest area. The trees appear to be relatively unaffected by the flames directly, indicating that the fire might be low-intensity or controlled, primarily affecting the underbrush and ground layer.\n\nThe colors in the image convey a moody and somber tone, with muted greens and browns of the trees and land juxtaposed against the grey and white smoke. The sky is not visible due to the density of the smoke filling the air.\n\nOverall, the photograph likely serves to document a fire event in a forest setting, capturing the interaction between natural landscape elements and the dynamic, often destructive force of fire.","title":"Forest fires in the everglades, collier county.
