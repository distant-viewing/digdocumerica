{"path":"552473.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a quaint, old church, presented in a calm and serene mood. The photo's focus is centered down the aisle, leading the viewer's eyes straight to the altar at the far end. \n\nThe flooring, possibly wooden, adds a warm contrast to the otherwise pale-toned walls and ceiling. Wooden pew rows, symmetrically arranged on either side of the aisle, have white paint with heart-shaped cutouts on the pew ends, contributing an element of charm and quaintness to the setting. Each pew is unadorned, suggesting a humble and simple decor approach typical of smaller, rural churches.\n\nOn either side of the nave, tall, narrow windows with small stained glass panels cast soft, colorful light into the room, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. The walls are minimally decorated; apart from the stained glass, there are a few religious artworks and a large circular object on one wall, potentially a decorative plate or emblem.\n\nThe altar area is modest, with a central altar table adorned with a simple white cloth and a small religious statue. There is also a pulpit on one side, crafted of wood and metal, which stands beside the altar.\n\nA unique addition to the scene is a black stove with a pipe extending towards the ceiling, positioned near the pews, probably used for heating the space.\n\nOverall, this church's interior is notable for its plain yet heartfelt and traditional aesthetic, designed to provide a peaceful place for worship and reflection.","title":"Interior of small church in Kickapoo","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["558026","558027","547752","558384","554209","558406","546467","558400","558024","558383","552623","554035","558404","554207","558382","550376"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["pew","altar","church","aisle","ceiling","wall","end","interior","stove","flooring"]}
