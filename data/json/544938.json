{"path":"544938.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph showcases a natural landscape scene dominated by a cluster of vibrant yellow flowers in the foreground. These flowers, characterized by their large, rounded petals and prominent, sunny centers, are part of a green, leafy plant with broad, sturdy leaves at the base. It appears to be a type of wild sunflower or similar species.\n\nThe midground reveals a rocky terrain scattered with some bare, white-branched bushes and sparse greenery under what appears to be overcast lighting, hinting at a high-altitude or possibly cold, arid environment. The rugged terrain gently slopes and contains sporadic green shrubs and small plants growing among the rocks and dry soil, adding hints of life to this wild setting.\n\nThe background of the image is more dramatic and atmospheric, featuring a panoramic view of distant mountains under a cloudy, moody sky. The mountains, capped with white, suggest recent snowfall or lingering snowpack, and they create a stark contrast against the darker hues of the hills leading up to them. These distant elements lend a sense of depth and expansiveness to the scene, evoking the grandeur of a remote, untouched wilderness.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vivid floral foreground and sweeping, mountainous backdrop, offers a striking portrayal of natural beauty and wild, rugged terrain. This scene might be representative of ecosystems found in regions such as the American West, where diverse climates and landscapes converge.","title":"Flowering arnica herb","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["545723","544881","544443","545296","555666","555186","549225","545703","544574","549228","545718","550781","550439","557098","545562","552442"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["flower","climates","terrain","snowfall","overcast","expansiveness","centers","hints","converge","mountain"]}
