{"path":"546359.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of an industrial harbor area. The photograph features several components:\n\n1. **Water and Docking Areas**: On the right side of the image, there's a large body of blue water adjacent to concrete and paved docks where ships are moored. One prominent ship, painted white, is docked parallel to the shore. Two smaller ships or boats are also visible nearby.\n\n2. **Industrial Buildings and Infrastructure**: Sprawled throughout the image are numerous large industrial buildings with various structural designs, including some with flat roofs and others with sloped ones. Many areas within the facility are dense with smaller structures and mechanical equipment.\n\n3. **Smoke and Emissions**: Several locations in the industrial complex are emitting smoke or steam, contributing to a sense of heavy industrial activity. These emissions vary in density and color, suggesting different processes or materials being handled.\n\n4. **Vehicles and Equipment**: Spread throughout the complex are various types of vehicles, including what appear to be trucks and possibly cargo handling equipment. These indicate active transport and logistic operations.\n\n5. **Natural and Urban Background**: Beyond the industrial area, the background shows a mix of lush green hills and a developed urban environment. Residential or commercial buildings are scattered across the landscape, merging the industrial forefront with a more suburban backdrop.\n\n6. **Atmospheric Conditions**: The lighting in the photo suggests it might be midday, with the sun casting clear shadows and highlighting the structural and natural features of the area.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a bustling industrial harbor scene with active shipping, manufacturing, or processing facilities, set against a rich natural and urban landscape.","title":"The catano industrial area is across the bay from old San Juan","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["549472","551609","551976","552153","555724","550021","552007","556912","555773","549969","550890","555766","548346","552181","547058","550886"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["ship","harbor","equipment","complex","dock","forefro","sloped","smoke","process","designs"]}
