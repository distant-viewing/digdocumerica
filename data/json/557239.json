{"path":"557239.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil river scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and subdued color palette. The river itself is the dominant feature, taking up the majority of the frame and reflecting the light from the sky above. On the river’s surface are gentle ripples and some areas of foam, which catch the light and create contrasting textures against the smooth water.\n\nThe banks of the river are framed by steep hills which slope down to the water’s edge, covered in dense foliage that is silhouetted against the lighter sky, indicating low light conditions and enhancing the sense of depth and enclosure in the composition. The background is slightly hazy, blurring the details of the distant trees and hills, which adds to the atmosphere of tranquility and mystery.\n\nOn the right side of the image, at a distance, there’s an industrial element visible - a large structure with a tower, possibly part of a bridge or factory infrastructure, creating a stark contrast to the natural environment. This man-made structure introduces a note of human presence in an otherwise natural and serene setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and the lighting create a reflective and peaceful mood, inviting contemplation of the interplay between natural and human elements in the landscape.","title":"Monongahela River shows discharge from a sewage treatment plant at McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.
