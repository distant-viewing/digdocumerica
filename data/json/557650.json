{"path":"557650.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The image captures an old and weathered Victorian-style house, showing signs of significant wear and decay. The architecture features intricate details typical of the era, including ornate woodwork with scroll designs and carved columns supporting the overhanging roof.\n\nThe house is two-storied, painted white, though much of the paint has peeled away, revealing the grey, weather-beaten wood beneath. Several windows are visible; some are boarded up while others are intact but look old and not well-maintained. The front porch spans the width of the photograph and includes a railing that appears unstable or broken in parts.\n\nA set of wooden steps leads up to the porch, where a sign that reads “ROOM FOR RENT” is noticeable, hanging crookedly next to the main entrance. The roof above the porch shows broken and missing tiles, and the eaves are adorned with intricate, yet deteriorating, wooden lacework.\n\nDebris and unkempt foliage are visible around the perimeter of the house, adding to the eerie, abandoned feel of the setting. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of neglect and desolation, suggesting the house has been uninhabited for a considerable time.","title":"Boarding house in Galveston, Texas.
