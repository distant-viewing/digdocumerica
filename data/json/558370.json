{"path":"558370.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features an industrial setting where a quality control or sorting operation involving large quantities of cranberries is taking place. The image displays large metal bins filled with cranberries; these bins are mounted on mechanical devices for processing. Among these bins, one is filled with white cranberries while the middle bin is filled with a large amount of red cranberries. \n\nIn the foreground, a large piece of machinery, possibly a washer or sorter, is shown with its lid open revealing a swirling motion of water or liquid, likely part of the processing of the berries.\n\nA young woman with long dark hair and eyeglasses is present in the scene. She is leaning forward, peering down into the machinery, possibly monitoring or controlling the process. She is dressed in casual attire.\n\nIn the wider environment, stacked plastic crates and additional equipment can be seen, suggesting a well-organized industrial floor. The setting indicated by the photograph likely points to a food processing facility focused on cranberries, involving sorting, cleaning, or perhaps packaging processes.","title":"Interior of the 3m co.( Minnesota mining and manufacturing) plant showing a machine being monitored by an employee.  3m has 1,377 employees which make it the largest industry in the town.
