{"path":"557486.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a multi-story, seemingly residential building overlooking a body of water. The building, which is large and elongated with multiple levels, is a classic architectural style featuring rows of balconies and a symmetrical facade. Each balcony has balustrade railings, and the structure is painted in white with a contrasting dark roof.\n\nThe building is situated on a lush hillside with abundant vegetation surrounding it, blending into a natural setting. Shrubs and tall grasses are visible at the bottom of the building, suggesting a semi-rural or suburban environment.\n\nIn the foreground, a large body of water likely a lake or a calm river, spans across the width of the photograph. There are no visible boats or people on the water, contributing to a serene and untouched look. The water's surface reflects the light and the silhouettes of the scenery around it.\n\nThe image is taken during daylight with good illumination highlighting the details of the building and its surroundings, creating a peaceful and secluded impression of the location. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is tranquil and quiet, evoking a sense of isolation and retreat from busier urban settings.","title":"Buena vista lagoon, suffers from septic tank seePage, erosion and other ills, it is an example of one of the last lagoons in southern California.
