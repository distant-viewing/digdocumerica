{"path":"553710.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up side profile of a person lit in a dramatic and moody style. The person is wearing a large, ornate hat with a vivid red plume that curves over their head, dominating the upper part of the frame. This hat casts a shadow over the person's face, emphasizing the contours of their facial features that are visible.\n\nThe person's face is partially illuminated, highlighting their prominent cheekbone, nose, and mustache, which add to the person's distinguished look. Additionally, the photograph shows a part of the person's garment at the bottom, which appears to be of a plush, deep orange or red material, suggesting a uniform or ceremonial outfit.\n\nThe background of the photograph is entirely dark, ensuring that all attention is focused on the person and their striking headgear. The lighting is very selective, creatively playing on darkness and light to enhance the mysterious and dramatic effect of the image.","title":"Dressed for aloha day parade during annual aloha week festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["548226","556268","558270","556318","553115","549730","554858","554340","547437","554857","551300","556137","549199","547028","552561","558278"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["person","headgear","nose","mustache","garment","hat","ensure","darkness","face","profile"]}
