{"path":"549194.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a rural scene featuring two barns set in a lush, green landscape. The main barn, which is larger and situated in the foreground, has a traditional white facade with vertical siding and a steep gabled roof topped with a weather vane. This barn has two visible doors: a larger one that is slightly ajar and a smaller regular door, both painted in a contrasting dark color. A small hayloft door is visible under the gable. An array of wooden ladders is leaned against the building next to the smaller door.\n\nAdjacent to the main barn is a smaller building that mirrors the style and color scheme of the larger one, suggesting it may serve a supportive, possibly storage-related function.\n\nThe barns are enclosed by rustic, weathered wooden fencing, which contributes to the pastoral charm of the setting. The ground is covered with well-maintained grass, enhancing the vibrant and fresh rural atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, rolling hills dotted with trees under a clear blue sky can be seen, suggesting that the location is a part of a larger agricultural or pastoral area.\n\nOverall, this scene embodies a peaceful, bucolic farm setting, typical of rural landscapes.","title":"A picturesque old barn in the heart of the area where massive strip-mining operations are planned.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["552537","557991","555577","552536","550019","556963","547128","552462","548065","555571","555646","549237","555635","551305","543343","557946"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","door","one","gable","fencing","ladder","scheme","function","siding","charm"]}
