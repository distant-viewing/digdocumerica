{"path":"550923.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a casual moment on a sunny beach. In the foreground, there is a young couple closely examining something in the woman's hand, which looks like a small object, perhaps a camera or smartphone. The man, shirtless and wearing dark swim shorts, leans over slightly towards the woman. The woman, in a blue bikini with a distinctive pattern, is holding the object and seems to be showing or explaining something to the man.\n\nThe background is bustling with typical beach scenery; many beachgoers seated under colorful umbrellas that are yellow and maroon, scattered across the sandy beach. People seem to be relaxed, enjoying the beach environment possibly sitting on sun loungers or beach chairs. The atmosphere is vibrant yet relaxed, indicative of a warm, leisurely day at the beach. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a perfect sunny day. The texture of the sandy beach is visible, with footprints and small debris scattered throughout, adding to the natural beach setting.","title":"Stewart beach, on the eastern end of Galveston island Galveston's 30 miles of ocean front makes it one of the most popular of gulf coast resorts","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["547507","546413","550936","548541","543534","547503","550932","547491","552977","547628","547680","553685","548624","546794","550928","547688"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","woman","maroon","beachgoer","bikini","footprint","explain","umbrella","object","relax"]}
