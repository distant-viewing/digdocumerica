{"path":"557431.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial area with a clear focus on infrastructure and traffic. In the foreground, a traffic light prominently displays a red signal against a backdrop of multiple utility poles, which are heavily lined with power lines. These poles create a repeating pattern that runs parallel to the road, emphasizing the infrastructure.\n\nSeveral vehicles, indicative of the era from which the photograph might date, are visible. These include various cars and trucks that appear to be from the mid-to-late 20th century, suggesting the historical context of the image. The vehicles are captured in motion, heading towards or away from the viewer, along the road that cuts through the center of the photo.\n\nBeyond the traffic, the middle portion of the image presents a large, open industrial site. There are mounds of earth, excavation equipment, and temporary structures, possibly associated with construction or mining. This middle ground between the road and the distant landscape emphasizes ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThe background shows a hilly landscape with patches of greenery, which contrasts with the built and industrial environment in the foreground. This distant backdrop might suggest the outskirts of a city or a less urbanized area where industrial operations merge into the natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the image captures a blend of transportation, industrial activity, and infrastructure, set against a natural landscape that hints at the encroachment of industrial development into more pristine areas. The presence of old vehicles and the style of the utility poles lend a vintage feel to the scene.","title":"Highway traffic on a road near Newport Beach. Road widening in this area has occurred in the past few years as a large shopping center and business complex was developed above the all residential area at the harbor. Regulation of development within 1,000 yards of the coastline has resulted in increasing restrictions since the implementation of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in early 1973 in California.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["546212","546076","550175","550171","552001","547651","550167","545988","550183","557224","548850","556520","546866","552819","546055","545455"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["traffic","pole","infrastructure","utility","road","vehicle","date","encroachment","signal","outskirt"]}
