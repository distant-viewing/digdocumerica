{"path":"545092.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural scene on a coastal mudflat. The focal point is a weathered piece of driftwood, standing vertically, with its roots heavily clustered and exposed, dangling towards the ground. These roots are entangled with seaweed and other marine debris, highlighting the interaction between terrestrial and marine environments. Prominently in the foreground, there's a pink crab tangled in green sea grass, emphasizing the wildlife and the ecological interactions in this habitat.\n\nThe background features a vast expanse of the mudflat under a bright blue sky speckled with a few clouds, stretching towards a distant horizon. This backdrop gives a sense of the wide, open environment typical of coastal ecosystems. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of raw natural beauty and the resilience of life in a harsh intertidal zone.","title":"Oyster beds of willapa bay, where large numbers of \"ghost shrimp\" are endangering the oyster population by disturbing the beds and suffocating the oysters.
