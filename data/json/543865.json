{"path":"543865.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and stunning natural scene characterized by dramatic geological formations. It features a large boat floating on a tranquil body of water, encased within a narrow canyon. The canyon walls rise steeply and majestically on either side of the boat, showcasing stratified rock faces with prominent vertical grooves and varying hues, predominantly in a deep reddish brown color, indicative of sedimentary rock formations typically found in canyon landscapes.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph enhances the mystical quality of the scene, with the upper portions of the canyon walls brightly illuminated by natural sunlight, contrasting with the darker, shadowed lower portions that envelop the boat and water. The water itself mirrors the subdued lighting, appearing in deep shades of blue and violet, rippled gently by the movement of the boat.\n\nA silhouette of a person is visible, standing in the boat, suggesting a moment of solitary reflection or exploration. The overall composition of the image, with the towering canyon walls and the small scale of the boat and its occupant, emphasizes the grandeur of nature and the relative insignificance of man in such a vast, awe-inspiring environment.\n\nThe background of the scene is a continuation of the canyon, fading into darkness, which adds to the depth and mystery of the environment. This setting might be a part of a larger river system, commonly found in arid regions, potentially popular among adventurers and nature enthusiasts for its stunning natural beauty and the unique experience it offers.","title":"Acid from the Union Carbide uranium mill has polluted portions of the San Miguel River.","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["544749","545744","545798","545301","544125","545765","554466","544383","544895","544931","550989","545654","548050","544929","544142","545745"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canyon","boat","find","wall","portion","formation","encase","groove","enthusiast","inspire"]}
