{"path":"545855.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up scene of the desert floor featuring a patch of sand with distinct ripple patterns. These ripples are likely created by wind, exhibiting a harmonic, wavelike texture across the surface of the sand. There is a small shrub or cluster of plants centrally located in the frame, anchored in the sand. The plants are casting long shadows which accentuate the low angle of the light source, probably sunlight, indicating that the time of the day is either near sunrise or sunset. The natural light enriches the color contrasts and adds depth to the textures of the sand. The overall composition focuses on the interplay between light and shadow, patterned textures, and the sparse, resilient plant life in the desert environment. The background is uniformly filled with more sand, emphasizing the vastness and perhaps the isolation of the landscape.","title":"Dune in Monahans Sandhills State Park","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["543096","543097","550490","544886","547717","544879","555399","545843","545199","545207","545748","545789","552923","553058","548906","545203"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["sand","desert","plant","texture","sunrise","source","wind","ripple","sunset","vastness"]}
