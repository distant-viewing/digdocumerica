{"path":"548581.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features two older women engaged in a game of Rummikub, an activity depicted by the tiles and racks visible in the foreground. One woman, seated to the right, is focusing intently on the game, adjusting the tiles on her rack. She has gray hair styled in a practical way, possibly with a hairnet, and is wearing glasses along with a blue tank top.\n\nStanding behind her is another woman, who appears to be in a helping or observing role. She is dressed in a flower-patterned sleeveless dress and her hair, which is pink, is styled up, possibly in curls or rollers covered with a hairnet or scarf. The emotional expression on her face suggests engagement and perhaps advising or conversation about the game.\n\nThe setting implies an informal, relaxed environment, possibly during leisure time at a home or community setting. The background is softly out of focus, emphasizing the players and the game, which directs the focus on the social and recreational aspects of the scene. The lighting appears natural, contributing to the casual, daytime ambiance.","title":"\"mah-jong\" at the club-house of the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["558227","548582","558320","548586","558329","556702","552627","558342","546155","547358","553484","557362","556176","557153","558327","547392"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["game","rack","roller","woman","tiles","curl","player","scarf","tile","hair"]}
