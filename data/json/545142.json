{"path":"545142.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment over a large, tranquil body of water that appears to glisten under either early morning or late afternoon light. The primary focus of the image is a heron mid-flight, just as it is taking off from the water's surface. The birdâ€™s wings are widely spread and its legs are trailing beneath it, creating subtle ripples on the water's surface.\n\nThe overall ambiance conveyed by the image is peaceful, emphasized by the stillness of the water and the open space surrounding the bird, suggesting a sense of quiet solitude. The composition of the photograph places the heron slightly to the left of center, drawing the viewer's attention directly to its graceful action.\n\nThe color palette is cool, dominated by shades of blue, with the water reflecting a textured pattern that hints at a gentle breeze. The edges of the photograph exhibit slight wear and markings, possibly indicating the age of the photo or the style in which it was developed or processed, adding a vintage or timeless quality to the image. The background is simple and uncluttered, emphasizing the heron's movement and the expanse of the water.","title":"Blue heron in rain","placename":"Tillamook Bay (Or.)","location":"Tillamook Bay, Oregon","nn1":["543922","548731","547593","543063","547630","551379","550388","544543","544539","548832","545991","551378","557495","544683","543918","557604"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["heron","bird","water","wing","breeze","glisten","flight","marking","stillness","vintage"]}
