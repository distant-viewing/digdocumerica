{"path":"543494.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a young girl interacting with a coin-operated viewing machine, often found at tourist viewpoints. The viewing machine, mounted on a sturdy base, has a distinct anthropomorphic face-like design that includes two large circular \"eyes\" through which one can look, and a central \"nose\" that probably functions as the sight adjustment or focus mechanism. It is designed to resemble a face, adding an element of whimsy to the device.\n\nThe girl, whose face is obscured by the viewer, is holding onto the sides of the machine, likely adjusting her view. She is wearing a casual short-sleeve, yellow t-shirt and vibrant patterned pants. Her hair, visible on the side and top, appears light in color and is being swept slightly by the wind, indicating it might be a breezy day.\n\nIn the background, the sky is a clear, bright blue, suggesting it is a sunny day without clouds. Directly behind the girl, a partial view of a red vehicle, possibly a classic car, adds a splash of color to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of curiosity and exploration, typical of scenic areas where such viewers are placed to enhance visitors' experiences by providing magnified views of distant attractions.","title":"California -- Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["547125","547124","555990","553192","543495","543979","546835","549314","552950","547192","549711","556139","543218","556763","549718","557843"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["machine","girl","face","adjustment","attraction","nose","sight","mechanism","tourist","viewer"]}
