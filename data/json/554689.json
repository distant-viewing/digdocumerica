{"path":"554689.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic outdoor scene involving two people and a horse. A young woman is sitting atop a brown and white pinto horse. She has long, straight blonde hair and is dressed in a casual, dark blue jacket. Her expression is concentrated and calm as she looks downward, possibly observing something about the horse or adjusting her seat.\n\nBeside the horse, there stands a man who appears to be assisting the woman. He wears a light brown cowboy hat, a beige jacket, and jeans. He is holding onto the horse's bridle, interacting either with the horse or the woman, offering guidance or support.\n\nThe setting is a dirt enclosure, suggesting a location used for horseback riding or a similar equestrian activity. The ground is muddy, imprinted with numerous hoof marks and footprints, emphasizing the outdoor, natural environment. In the background, a lush tree line and a road with a visible traffic sign can be seen, indicating that this area is on the outskirts of a more populated area or near a roadway. There are other horses partially visible in the left side of the image, adding to the impression of a horse riding facility.\n\nThe overall ambiance is of a peaceful, pastoral setting, where equestrian activities are taking place, possibly a horse farm or riding school. The interaction between the figures suggests a moment of learning or casual riding, emphasizing a connection between human and animal.","title":"Local cowboy helps a rider get ready for a fall morning trail ride at the Sit 'n Bull Ranch in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Warrensburg (N.Y.)","location":"Warrensburg, New York","nn1":["557988","544362","556562","543841","543678","552564","557051","553064","553116","544308","557992","543787","553118","554010","543783","554885"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["horse","riding","guidance","bridle","woman","horseback","learning","footprint","jacket","enclosure"]}
