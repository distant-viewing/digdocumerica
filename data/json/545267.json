{"path":"545267.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a shoreline, likely a lake or river bank. It shows a group of people - predominantly children, along with a few adults - engaged in various activities in a natural, outdoor setting.\n\nIn the foreground, numerous large logs, possibly driftwood, are strewn across the sand, providing seating and climbing spots for the group. Several children are playing and sitting on these logs, closely attended by adults who appear to be overseeing the activities. One adult, seen from the back, is seated on a log, surrounded by children who seem to be engaged in conversation or play.\n\nOn the right side of the image, near the water's edge, stands a child looking at two anchored boats: one rowboat on the shore and another small boat slightly offshore in the water. The child's attention is directed towards these boats, suggestive of curiosity or contemplation of a boat ride.\n\nTo the left, a woman is walking along the log-strewn beach, holding a box that likely contains supplies or food, contributing to a picnic-like atmosphere. Another child accompanies her, creating a sense of movement and activity within the scene.\n\nThe background showcases a calm water body with a dense forest lining the opposite shore, providing a serene and secluded setting. The clear sky and bright sunlight enhance the vivid colors of the natural surroundings and contribute to a cheerful, summery vibe.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its mix of action and tranquility, portrays a leisurely day by the water, enjoyed by a group of diverse ages gathered amidst a picturesque landscape.","title":"San Juan Park on San Juan Island","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543943","543892","544442","553446","550827","554499","543692","550228","553431","558233","543609","551543","551538","543998","550227","552033"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","log","boat","adult","strew","group","shore","climbing","play","rowboat"]}
