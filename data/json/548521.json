{"path":"548521.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene on a body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea area. The focus is on a small sailboat prominently positioned in the foreground, tilting slightly due to the wind catching its sails. The boat has a clean, white hull and a single mast with two sails unfurled: a main sail and a smaller jib in the front. The sails appear pristine, predominantly white with some markings and a logo near the head of the main sail.\n\nA solitary sailor, a middle-aged Caucasian male with grey hair, is seated near the stern of the boat, actively handling the boat by holding onto the tiller. He wears a casual, light-colored shirt which is suitable for a warm, sunny day out on the water.\n\nIn the background, another similar sailboat can be seen, but it’s further away and slightly out of focus, giving a sense of depth to the scene. The background also hints at a distant shoreline, subtly suggesting that this body of water is enclosed and not very broad. The water itself is textured with ripples and small waves, indicating a gentle breeze - ideal conditions for leisurely sailing.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a haze that mutes the colors, giving the entire scene a soft, calm aesthetic. There’s a peaceful, relaxed vibe throughout the composition, with the central activity being the sailing itself, demonstrating a quiet enjoyment of the sport and the natural environment around.","title":"Chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["552345","547273","543941","544669","544667","544224","549411","548506","548516","548510","548118","551539","549386","552343","543937","545900"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailing","sailboat","boat","unfurl","sailor","stern","mute","mast","demonstrate"]}
