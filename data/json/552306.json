{"path":"552306.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene by a large body of water, capturing a unique and slightly surreal moment. In the foreground, a person wearing a yellow hard hat is partially submerged in what appears to be a muddy or marshy area of the shoreline. The individual is dressed in dark pants and a light-colored jacket and seems to be engaged in a task or possibly stuck in the mud, given their position with arms extended forward as if pushing against the ground.\n\nThe background provides a view of a calm, expansive water body under an overcast sky. A boat is visible floating in the distance, further emphasizing the expanse of the water. Another thin, vertical object (possibly a post or marker) stands alone in the water to the right. The horizon is lined by a faint outline of land or hills, contributing to a sense of vast open space.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image, enhanced by the natural light and overcast conditions, lends a somewhat dramatic, almost eerie quality to the scene. This, combined with the person's unusual position in the mud, evokes curiosity about the context and the story behind this moment.","title":"Ray longmire of olympia digging a geoduck clam on dosewallips tide flats on the hood canal at brinnon.
