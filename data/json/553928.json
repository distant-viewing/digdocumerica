{"path":"553928.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a residential area leading toward a body of water, likely an ocean, visible on the horizon. A myriad of houses with brown shingle roofs densely pack the landscape. These houses are mostly single-story and feature various shades of brown and beige.\n\nThe layout follows a structured, suburban pattern with roads neatly winding through the neighborhood. The foreground shows a particularly prominent road lined with houses leading through the community. The area appears calm without visible cars or people, emphasizing the residential nature.\n\nIn the middle ground, more of the neighborhood can be seen, interspersed with patches of greenery and sporadic palm trees, adding a tropical feel to the environment. Towards the background, a bridge spans what appears to be an inlet connecting to the ocean, suggesting proximity to coastal features or a lagoon.\n\nThe ocean in the background meets a clear sky, hinting at a peaceful, scenic location ideal for residential purposes. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is that of a quiet, orderly, and scenic neighborhood situated in a possibly tropical or temperate coastal area.","title":"Hawaii-Kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast-growing area east of downtown Honolulu.
