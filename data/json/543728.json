{"path":"543728.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic and moody landscape under a dimly lit sky, possibly during twilight. The composition highlights the silhouette of a series of electrical power lines and pylons stretching across rolling hills. The foreground shows the dark outline of the hills, which create a wave-like pattern across the image.\n\nThe power lines create sweeping curved lines, contrasting sharply against the sky. Some lines are distinctly visible as they travel toward a cluster of transmission towers. The towers themselves are set at varying distances along the ridges, further emphasizing the depth and scale of the landscape.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are subdued; the sky is a deep blue or gray, suggesting the photo was taken during a low-light time of day or under heavy cloud cover. This muted palette adds to the somewhat somber and desolate atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of isolation and industrial intrusion into nature, highlighted by the stark, mechanical structures of the power towers and the natural, undulating contours of the hills. There is no presence of human activity or life, reinforcing a lonely or remote vibe. The photograph is an effective study in contrast and scale, and a commentary on the interface between human progress and natural environments.","title":"Power lines","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544355","549110","544613","553830","553028","549213","549011","558107","553820","557525","542643","557977","543903","555574","547940","543007"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["power","tower","hill","line","pylon","interface","transmission","intrusion","commentary","scale"]}
