{"path":"554423.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a serene woodland scene. In the foreground, there is a wide expanse of lush green vegetation, resembling tall grass or wild undergrowth, which partially fills the bottom frame of the photograph. A curving dirt path stretches from the foreground into the distance, lined by dense trees that dominate the landscape with their rich, green leaves.\n\nIn the center of the path, a child stands alone looking towards the camera. The child appears small against the expansive backdrop of the forest, wearing what seems to be a dark colored outfit. The overcast sky subtly diffuses the light, creating a calm and moody atmosphere.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the winding path and the solitary figure of the child, draws the viewer's eyes towards the center, emphasizing the peaceful solitude and the scale of the natural environment surrounding the child.","title":"Log loading area of the Litchfield Paper Company near Tupper Lake, three years after loading operations.
