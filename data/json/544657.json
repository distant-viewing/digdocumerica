{"path":"544657.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a clear nautical scene with a dramatic, moody atmosphere, likely taken around dusk or in overcast weather. The main subject of the image is a large, grey naval ship, possibly a supply or auxiliary vessel, anchored or docked near a port facility. The ship is viewed from the front, showing its imposing bow and superstructure, which includes a bridge tower rising prominently mid-ship equipped with various antennas and radar equipment. \n\nIn the immediate surrounding, there are other maritime elements visible such as cargo handling cranes sitting idle on a quay just behind the ship, hinting at commercial or military port activities. Also visible in the background to the right of the image is another similar, yet smaller, naval vessel. \n\nHighlighting the scale of maritime operations, the waters in the foreground shimmer under unclear lighting, likely reflecting either the setting sun or subdued ambient light, adding a shimmering texture to the scene.\n\nIn the backdrop, faint cityscape silhouettes are discernible through a haze, which could be either natural fog or pollution, typical of harbors. Noteworthy are the outlines of a prominent bridge and the dense high-rise buildings suggesting a significant urban setting, indicative of a large city. Above the primary ship, a solitary bird flies, lending a touch of life and motion to the seemingly serene and static marine setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image conveys a strong industrial and maritime theme, characterized by the juxtaposition of nature (water and bird), industry (ships and cranes), and urban development (cityscape and bridge). The muted tones and soft lighting add to the atmosphere of tranquility and solemnity.","title":"Oakland Inner Harbor","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544234","550910","544672","544655","555721","551990","547064","547572","550034","548127","545147","549892","547667","547061","550918","546934"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","bridge","port","bird","vessel","cityscape","crane","marine","solemnity","superstructure"]}
