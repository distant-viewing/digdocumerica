{"path":"554026.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a sunny, daytime outdoor scene featuring three elderly men engaged in conversation. The setting appears to be a rural area, suggested by the dusty earth on which they stand and the untamed vegetation in the background. One of the men, at the far left, has white hair and wears a white short-sleeved shirt and darker pants. He is pointing at something off-camera, leading the viewerâ€™s eye in the direction of his gesture. The second man, in the middle, is slightly looking towards the man to his right while smoking a cigarette. He's dressed in a light blue shirt that is slightly unbuttoned. The third man, positioned partially behind the second, looks in the direction the first man is pointing. His attire consists of a greyish-blue shirt and he also sports white hair.\n\nBehind these individuals, there is a partial view of a vehicle, possibly a yellow or cream-colored pickup truck, which might suggest they are near a farmhouse or a similar rural setting. Several shrubs and trees provide a natural backdrop, and the sky is clear, indicating nice weather. Overall, the image gives off a casual, relaxed atmosphere, with these men possibly discussing matters pertinent to their surroundings or daily life.","title":"Sam Peters (left), Harry Kealeha and Eddie Pelekai, officers of the Molokai Homesteaders Association","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["547359","554865","547443","542562","555287","545088","549293","557145","549292","553208","557856","553182","554860","555546","548625","553167"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["man","direction","farmhouse","matter","shirt","cigarette","hair","pickup","gesture","cream"]}
