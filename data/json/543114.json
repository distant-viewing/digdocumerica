{"path":"543114.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The image captures an active construction site primarily featuring two large, yellow bulldozers (Caterpillar D7 models). Each bulldozer is operated by a person who is visible within the protective cages of the vehicles. The foreground shows one bulldozer with a visibly clear operator, while the other, slightly deeper in the scene, is positioned to the right with another operator. The machinery occupies a central position in the photo, emphasizing their prominent role in the landscape work.\n\nThe background reveals a partially wooded landscape with a variety of trees predominantly green in color indicating lush foliage, possibly indicating this photograph was taken during a warm season. Beyond the immediate construction area, there's a winding dirt road curving beside a body of water, likely a small river or large stream, reflecting sunlight and flanked by more greenery.\n\nThe terrain where the bulldozers are operating appears to be a mix of bare earth and dirt roads carved into the landscape, likely part of the construction or landscaping activities. The area looks like it is being prepared either for further development or for restoration. The terrain, combined with paths and natural elements, suggests a large-scale outdoor project.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of organized activity amidst a serene natural backdrop, showcasing a juxtaposition of human intervention and the natural environment.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["551947","547939","543105","545652","551262","555601","543107","545665","554544","553619","543760","555608","547254","545664","544138","545662"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bulldozer","operator","operate","construction","restoration","cage","dirt","winding","landscaping","carve"]}
