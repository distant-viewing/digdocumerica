{"path":"549995.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This image portrays an urban scene, likely taken from an elevated perspective, showing a busy cityscape with many architectural and vehicular elements. The photograph captures a mix of commercial and residential buildings. On the right, there is a large brown multi-story apartment building with typical rectangular windows aligned evenly across its facade. \n\nOn the left side and center of the photo, the focus shifts to a bustling street level seen from above what appears to be a highway or large road. Several trucks, cars, and trailers are visible on this road, indicating active traffic. Various commercial vehicles, including a red truck and a white truck with a ‘Holmes’ logo pointing towards the camera, are noticeable.\n\nThe background showcases a diverse skyline filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes, including some high rises. There are no distinct landmarks immediately recognizable which makes it hard to pinpoint the exact location. The environment suggests a clear day with bright sunlight casting shadows on the roads and buildings, enhancing the depth and detail of the urban landscape.","title":"Looking toward the southeast expressway and quincy market restoration","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556193","555743","547764","550153","553721","548392","553001","553016","549476","546707","545382","551507","547765","546723","548382","556807"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["truck","trailers","caste","landmarks","building","shift","apartment","road","elevated","align"]}
