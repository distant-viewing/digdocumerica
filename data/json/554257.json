{"path":"554257.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a group of skiers on a snowy slope surrounded by dense evergreen trees laden with snow. The image is set in a mountainous region, likely at a ski resort given the groomed appearance of the snow.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals are preparing or resting by arranging their skiing equipment. Two of them are standing and one is kneeling, all are dressed in warm, bright-colored ski jacketsâ€”one predominantly in red and the others with varying hues of red and orange, making them stand out against the white and green backdrop. They appear engaged in either setting up their skis or adjusting their gear.\n\nThe skis, poles, and a sled are visibly part of the group's equipment, scattered close to them on the snow-covered ground. Their presence suggests an active day of skiing, and the sled indicates possible variations in activities or a means to transport gear or perhaps a younger participant.\n\nThe surrounding environment enhances the winter sports theme, with tall trees fully coated with snow, suggesting recent snowfall. The slope itself looks moderately steep, marked with tracks from previous skiers, adding to the impression of a popular skiing spot. The overcast sky hints at the potential for more snow, adding a touch of anticipation to the setting.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment of leisure and sport, emphasizing the enjoyment of winter activities in a serene, natural landscape.","title":"Ski patrol taking an injured skier down the mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554253","554236","548153","550004","550017","554235","554292","554242","554251","554254","554245","554276","554275","554252","554234","554247"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["skiing","snow","skis","skier","winter","gear","sport","slope","potential","groome"]}
