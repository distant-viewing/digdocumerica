{"path":"547810.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph features a large commercial airplane captured from a low-angle shot, giving the viewer a clear view of its underside as it is apparently in the process of either landing or shortly after takeoff. The airplane has a predominantly white body with a red and blue design on the nose section. The jet is equipped with four engine nacelles, visibly mounted on its wings, which are each generating a small trail of dark exhaust, indicating that the engines are active.\n\nThe airplane's landing gear is extended and visible in the shot, suggesting an imminent landing. The leading edges of the wings are equipped with extended flap mechanisms, which help to slow the plane during landing procedures by increasing the surface area and drag of the wings.\n\nThe background of the image is a clear blue sky, with no clouds or other objects in sight, directing the focus purely on the aircraft. This photograph likely captures a moment typical in aviation, showcasing the technical aspects and aerodynamic features of the aircraft in action.","title":"Jet plane comes in for landing at Love Field over Bachman Lake","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["542720","547824","542670","542719","549621","546178","553731","548448","554092","545935","548447","544606","548130","548485","542717","544491"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["landing","airplane","wing","engine","aircraft","shot","underside","aviation","procedure","exhaust"]}
