{"path":"544057.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat unusual scene on a rural or semi-industrial street. The image shows a large, white utility truck with an oversized, cylindrical object strapped to its back, causing the truck to lean dangerously to one side. This object resembles a large industrial tank or drum. The precarious positioning of the load suggests that the truck may be struggling with the weight or balance of its cargo.\n\nThe truck is on a dirt road lined with wooden poles supporting multiple electrical or telephone wires that crisscross above. On either side of the street, there are fences and greenery: one side has a metal chain-link fence partially obscured by dense shrubbery, and the other side features a wooden slat fence. Beyond the fences, there appear to be residential premises or possibly small commercial entities suggesting the area is not heavily urbanized.\n\nThe background and general environment suggest a sunny day, as evidenced by the clear skies and the visible dust around the moving truck. The overall setting evokes a sense of a working-class neighborhood or an area on the outskirts of a more developed urban region.","title":"Mechanical \"arm\" of garbage truck picks up 320-gallon trash container and dumps contents into truck.
