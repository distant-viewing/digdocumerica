{"path":"548562.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene featuring two elderly individuals engaging in leisure activities in a living room. On the left, an elderly woman is seated on an ornate upholstered armchair, focused on knitting. She wears glasses and her curly hair is pulled back. Dressed in a patterned dress, she has a calm demeanor, with the knitting material and needles in her hands.\n\nOn the right side of the image, an elderly man is playing the violin, seated on a similar but plainer chair. He is dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and glasses, deeply focused on the music, with a music stand in front of him that holds sheet music. The violin playing seems absorbed and skilled, indicating experience with the instrument.\n\nThe room has a distinctly lived-in feeling, furnished with a mix of mid-century and possibly older styles. The background is soft-focused with a sheer curtain filtering daylight, creating a luminous but diffused lighting effect. A lamp with a yellow shade stands between and slightly behind the two individuals, adding to the room's ambient lighting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene moment of domestic life with each individual involved in their respective pastime, suggesting a sense of harmony and quiet companionship.","title":"Ben and Hildred Ratner in their apartment in the Century Village retirement community.
