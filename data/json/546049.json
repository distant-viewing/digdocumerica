{"path":"546049.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene with a focus on a white boat traveling at a high speed over a large body of water, which appears to be an ocean or large lake. The boat, which seems to be a mid-sized powerboat or lake cruiser, is prominently positioned towards the left side of the frame. It is generating white frothy water in its wake, showcasing its brisk movement through the water. \n\nSignificant to note is the thick black smoke billowing from the boat's exhaust, indicating engine activity, and perhaps some environmental or mechanical issues as the amount of smoke appears excessive. This smoke stretches across the middle to the right side of the image, forming a dark trail in the air.\n\nThe background displays a clear, deep blue sky that fills the upper part of the frame, unobscured by clouds, suggesting favorable weather conditions. The calmness of the water and the clarity of the sky together create a serene yet dynamic marine setting. To the far right, there is a small visible structure that could be a buoy or small lighthouse, just above the horizon line, adding to the navigational context of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of motion and activity in a tranquil natural environment, possibly during a sunny day, given the brightness and clear visibility in the photograph.","title":"Small pleasurecraft pollutes the air with heavy diesel exhaust fumes.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["545156","546317","548520","550840","555715","545057","542697","547685","552050","547674","549380","548525","556911","547708","544142","552292"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["smoke","boat","marine","cruiser","lighthouse","exhaust","lake","buoy","generate","calmness"]}
