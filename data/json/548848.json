{"path":"548848.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a railroad crossing sign located on a rural road. The sign is a traditional crossbuck style with the words \"RAILROAD CROSSING\" prominently displayed on two crossing white boards. The sign is equipped with two red circular lights that are designed to flash when a train is approaching to warn drivers. Above the crossing sign is another smaller, cylindrical device, possibly a bell or additional signal light.\n\nThis railroad crossing is situated in a sparsely populated area as indicated by the lack of vehicles and buildings in the vicinity. The road itself is a two-lane paved road extending into the horizon, flanked by telephone poles and a fence running parallel to the road on the right. The landscape appears arid and flat, suggesting a desert-like environment with minimal vegetation.\n\nThe photograph's setting is characterized by a clear blue sky, and the visibility is good, although there appears to be a slight haze near the horizon, possibly due to dust. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests isolation and the stark simplicity often found in rural or undeveloped areas. The light and shadow indicate it might be either morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the light.","title":"White dust on railroad crossing has floated over from gypsum plant at plaster city","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548849","558258","547944","556090","544681","550010","558020","547940","544245","556851","552005","544262","552819","556988","544292","555647"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["crossing","railroad","road","sign","warn","bell","softness","telephone","pave","signal"]}
