{"path":"555149.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor natural setting with a focus on an abandoned aerosol can lying among a tangle of wet, thin tree roots. The background and most of the frame show a densely intertwined mass of dark-brown roots, some of which are submerged in a small pool of water, reflecting light to create a shimmering effect. The soil in the image is dark and appears moist, possibly suggesting recent rainfall or a wet environment, like a swamp or marsh.\n\nForegrounded in the image, nearly centrally placed at the bottom half, is a discarded aerosol can. It has a solid blue body with some white near the spray button and vertical red and blue text on its label, suggesting it's a commercial product, possibly a pesticide or lubricant. The presence of the can highlights issues of pollution and neglect in natural settings, contrasting the natural elements of the roots and soil with the man-made, discarded item.","title":"Unreforested clear-cut on Washington State Department of Natural Resources' land. The stream that ran down the hillside is polluted with oil and clogged with logging debris, east of Clearwater River Road and south of Shale Creek, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551246","550806","550805","544640","543614","555257","546920","542978","544651","544648","543616","550812","544644","544647","556639","550807"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["root","pesticide","swamp","soil","mass","marsh","spray","rainfall","label","half"]}
