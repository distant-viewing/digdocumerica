{"path":"551766.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"In the photograph, three children are closely studying or viewing something, giving the scene a sense of focused attention. The central figure, a young girl with wavy hair, is holding a clipboard or possibly a large book closely to her chest; she is wearing a blue unbuttoned jacket over a pink sweater. She appears to be reading or writing intently, using a pencil.\n\nTo the left of the girl, another child is partially visible, peeking over at the clipboard. This child has curly hair and wears a blue jacket over a lighter shirt, only the top of their head and one eye clearly visible.\n\nTo the right of the girl with the clipboard, another young girl, wearing a pink cardigan over a plaid shirt, is also intently looking at what the central girl is holding. She stands slightly behind the girl with the clipboard and looks over her shoulder.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, emphasizing the children in the foreground. There are hints of a natural setting, possibly a park or an outdoor classroom environment, suggested by the diffuse greenery and sunlight filtering through the leaves, providing a serene and calm setting. \n\nOverall, the composition highlights cooperation and curiosity among the children, drawn together around a common point of interest. The photograph captures a moment of learning or discovery in an outdoor setting.","title":"Studying nature at High Rock Park on Staten Island. This group is from PS 163 in New York City.
