{"path":"543349.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and scenic view of an old, abandoned town set against a hillside. In the foreground, there's a grassy area with wild shrubs and a dirt path leading up towards the main focus of the image, which is a group of distressed wooden buildings.\n\nThe center of the composition prominently features an old wooden church with a bell tower and a clock face, showing signs of weathering and age. Its roof appears partly metal and partly wooden, with visible deterioration. To the left of the church, there are several other wooden structures, including what looks like residential homes or community buildings, all similarly weathered and in varying states of collapse or disrepair.\n\nOn the right side of the church, the landscape continues to show more wooden structures that blend into the hillside. The entire scene is set against a backdrop of a barren hill, which provides a stark contrast to the wooden architecture.\n\nIn terms of human presence, there is one person visible in the image, standing near the church, enhancing the sense of abandonment and solitude that pervades the photograph. The setting evokes a sense of forgotten history, with the buildings and the environment telling a story of a once-bustling community that is now quiet and untouched by modern changes.","title":"\"ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543353","543367","543341","543342","543351","545813","545233","551111","543344","556330","543354","554000","543339","554707","551330","543171"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","hillside","pervade","deterioration","forget","bell","tell","collapse","clock","community"]}
