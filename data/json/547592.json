{"path":"547592.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant and picturesque coastal scene. The foreground is densely filled with shrubbery and flowers, notably pinkish-purple blooms that add vibrant color against the greenery. The plants are sunlit, with hints of dew or moisture on them, suggesting an early morning setting or recent rain.\n\nBeyond the lush foreground, a sandy beach stretches across the middle of the image, serving as a boundary between the vegetated area and the sea. The beach appears quiet and only lightly visited, with a few people visible at a distance. These individuals are small figures against the vastness of the landscape, grouped together near the water's edge, possibly engaged in leisure activities like walking or playing.\n\nThe ocean is visible as a thin strip, lined by gentle waves that suggest a calm day. The water shades from dark blue near the shore to a lighter tone as it meets the horizon.\n\nThe sky is bright and expansive, filled with a light gradient of blue, enhancing the overall serene and natural atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph draws the viewer's eye from the rich details of the flora in the foreground, across the simplicity of the sandy beach, towards the expansive ocean and sky, suggesting a peaceful coexistence of natural elements at the seaside.","title":"Wild roses and beach grass on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547596","554081","543066","543255","545101","543401","542968","545280","554082","553805","543193","543389","543303","547697","547603","543074"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","ocean","dew","seaside","blue","shrubbery","bloom","moisture","coexistence","strip"]}
