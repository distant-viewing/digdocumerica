{"path":"547454.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a sailing yacht in action on a hazy day. The yacht, which is tilting slightly due to the wind, features a large sail that is predominantly white with bold lettering partially readable as \"AM... NA5...\" indicating some kind of registration or identification. The yacht appears sleek and well-maintained, its hull slicing through the water, creating a spray around it.\n\nFour people are visible on board, engaging in various activities likely associated with managing the sail and navigating the yacht. They appear focused and coordinated in their efforts. The crew is dressed in casual sailing attire, suitable for a day out on the water.\n\nThe background of the scene is hazy, possibly suggesting early morning mist or just a foggy day which diffuses the details of the landscape beyond the water. There are other smaller boats or buoys faintly visible in the distance, but details are minimal due to the atmospheric conditions. The overall tone of the photograph is serene with a focus on the grace and teamwork involved in sailing.","title":"Setting a course south toward the open ocean on Chesapeake Bay in the early","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547458","547457","549391","549427","547460","549398","547448","549429","548494","548513","549435","549404","549390","549394","549397","549428"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["yacht","sailing","sail","grace","identification","registration","buoy","crew","teamwork","spray"]}
