{"path":"545198.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two men actively engaged in fishery work, set within a large, circular tank. Both men are clad in dark, shiny rain gear which suggests that the conditions might be wet or that they are protecting themselves from water splashes. The man on the left is holding a large, silvery fish horizontally across his body, handling it carefully with both hands. His expression appears focused and slightly strained, pointing to the weight or the slipperiness of the fish. The man on the right looks down as he leans slightly forward, possibly preparing to either receive the fish into a yellow container next to him or to help the other with handling the fish. \n\nThe tank they are in has a high, dark rim and a net-like structure visible above it, possibly to prevent the fish from jumping out or to protect the area. The water's surface is visibly disturbed, reflecting the actively ongoing work. The environment looks functional and utilitarian with no decorative elements, focusing purely on the task at hand. The subtle daylight suggests an outdoor or openly sheltered setting, enhancing the natural working environment of fishery activity.","title":"Jerry bouck and don stevens in research station on pollution and supersaturation, part of the national environmental research center.
