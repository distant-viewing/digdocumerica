{"path":"554643.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a serene sunset scene featuring silhouettes of mountain peaks. The sun is positioned close to the ridge of one of the mountains, half-visible as it sets, casting a warm golden glow in the sky around it. The mountains are completely silhouetted, showing no details other than their smooth, sweeping outlines. The sky transitions from a rich orange near the sun to deeper shades of purple and blue as it stretches away from the light source. There appears to be a flare or a halo effect around the sun, adding to the mystical feel of the scene. The overall ambiance of the photograph is peaceful and evocative, highlighting the beauty of natural landscapes at dusk. The positioning of the sun and the simplicity of the composition emphasize the grandeur and tranquility of the mountainous horizon.","title":"View looks from the top of phelps mountain (4,100 feet) towards algonquin mountain (5,200 feet) in the high peaks Wilderness area of the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["557560","542678","545864","553844","545860","552895","542680","550646","548909","555070","544047","557957","552927","549106","553816","548181"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","mountain","halo","flare","positioning","half","transitions","ridge","orange","source"]}
