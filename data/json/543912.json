{"path":"543912.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of a person holding a crab. The crab appears to be a blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), identified by its blue claws and olive green shell. The person's hand is partially visible, with a glove covering the thumb and forefinger, which are pinching the crab's shell near the rear.\n\nThe background of the image features what looks like a cage or trap, suggesting the setting might be related to crabbing or marine research. The cage material has a hexagonal mesh pattern, and parts appear to be coated with moisture or sea spray.\n\nThe lighting in the image seems natural, likely outdoors, enhancing the details and textures on the crab's shell and the metallic sheen of the wet cage. The focus is primarily on the crab, showing detailed textures and natural coloration, while the background is less sharply focused, emphasizing the crab in the composition.","title":"Marine life taken from water near the p.h.
