{"path":"551457.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures the stark architectural contrast between two skyscrapers in an urban environment. In the foreground is the Foshay Tower, a historic building prominently featuring its name at the top beneath a series of setbacks that decrease in size as they ascend, resembling a classic art deco design. The material of the building has a stone facade with rows of repeating windows, and the structure is capped by a mast or spire.\n\nDominating the background is a much taller, modern skyscraper. It features a sleek and minimalist design with a dark, possibly glass exterior that reflects the light. The top of this modern building has a distinctive architectural detail that presents vertical lines and bands running down its height, adding a textural contrast to the smooth surfaces of the other areas. The juxtaposition of these two structures—one reflective of early 20th-century design and the other a representation of late 20th or early 21st-century architecture—illustrates the evolution of building design and technology. The sky is clear, placing the focus squarely on the architectural features of these buildings. This combination of architectural styles provides insight into the city’s development and history.","title":"Foshay Tower, once the tallest building in downtown Minneapolis, is dwarfed by the new I.D.S.
