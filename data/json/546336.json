{"path":"546336.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures three individuals wading through a shallow body of water, possibly a marsh or wetland. The environment around them is densely populated with tall, thin reeds that slightly obscure the view. The water level reaches about ankle or calf height based on visible cues.\n\nFrom left to right: the first individual is a woman dressed in a pink shirt and darker shorts. She is looking down towards the water, holding a pair of shoes in one hand and a stick or a similar object in the other. The middle person, possibly a man, is wearing a hat, an unbuttoned light-colored shirt over a darker one, shorts, and is somewhat obscured by the reeds. He is carrying a yellow bucket. The third individual, also a man, is dressed in a striped shirt and shorts with a hat and glasses, visibly trekking through the water and glancing slightly towards the camera.\n\nThe background shows more dense vegetation and a hint of a tree line under an overcast sky. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, giving a tranquil and somewhat adventurous allure to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood is casual and exploratory, possibly indicating a scientific field study or a nature walk. The focus and composition of the photo, with tall grass in the foreground and people engaging actively with the natural setting, highlight an interaction with a natural environment.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel on a field trip to a salt marsh.
