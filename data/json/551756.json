{"path":"551756.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph presents a scenic view from a lush garden or park overlooking an urban skyline. In the foreground, vibrant flowers, prominently roses in shades of yellow and cream, are beautifully illuminated by sunlight. The foliage is lush and green, indicating a well-maintained garden. To the left, a vine-covered structure adds a touch of natural, rustic charm, contributing to the garden's serene atmosphere.\n\nA focal point in the image is a decorative element resembling a classical urn or vase, prominently positioned on the right edge of the frame. This white ornament, featuring intricate designs possibly including leaves or flowers, stands atop a pedestal, enhancing the cultivated feel of the setting.\n\nBeyond the garden, a panoramic view of a city skyline unfolds. Multiple high-rise buildings, varying in height and architectural style, dominate this view, suggesting a dense, urban environment. The skyline suggests a substantial metropolitan area, with clear skies suggesting a bright, sunny day which gives the city a crisp and vibrant backdrop.\n\nThe overall composition masterfully contrasts the natural, verdant elements of the garden with the man-made skyline, creating a harmonious juxtaposition that celebrates both nature and urban development.","title":"Antique pottery sets off elegant hybrid roses and other flowering plants on this penthouse terrace at central park west and 59th street, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551743","551755","551746","551775","551784","551785","549516","557257","551644","551653","551767","557271","551685","550298","545429","551652"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","skyline","vase","ornament","rose","vine","flower","celebrate","pedestal","unfold"]}
