{"path":"556863.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely related to railway maintenance or repair. In the foreground, a person is welding, with bright sparks visibly shooting out from the point of welding, highlighting the intense heat and light generated by the process. This person is wearing protective gear that includes a dark welding helmet and gloves, ensuring safety during the operation.\n\nIn the background, three men are standing near a large piece of machinery which appears to be rail machinery, based on the tracks visible in the picture and the context of the equipment. The machine is predominantly red and features a variety of metallic components, chains, and other parts that suggest its use in heavy mechanical operations, possibly track laying or maintenance.\n\nThe men are dressed in work clothes; two of them wear white hard hats, suggesting a focus on safety, and all are seemingly engaged in a discussion or observation of the work being done. The background shows an outdoor setting with some foliage and open sky, indicating that the work is taking place in a rural or semi-rural area.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the intensity and industrial nature of the work, highlighting both the technical skill involved in welding and the collaborative aspect of the machinery maintenance or operation.","title":"Southern Railway track repair crew repair equipment used in laying quarter-mile-long sections of welded track on the company's right-of-way. In 1974 the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance, the highest in the industry. As a result, the maximum speed on Southern's 10,531 miles of track is 60 miles per hour. Virtually all the company's track can be traveled at that speed compared to another railroad company with some track that can be traveled at eight miles per hour.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556269","555955","558304","558303","554931","554918","556267","546023","556870","544316","544331","554930","549694","544004","556866","556871"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["maintenance","work","machinery","operation","safety","spark","skill","heat","glove","repair"]}
