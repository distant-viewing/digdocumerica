{"path":"544766.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph features a rugged desert landscape, dominated by a vast, flat expanse stretching towards towering, steep cliffs in the distance. These cliffs present layers of sedimentary rock, indicating geological strata, and appear in shades of red, brown, and slate gray, characteristic of desert plateaus.\n\nIn the sky, a large helicopter is captured in flight. It is a twin-rotor military helicopter, possibly a Chinook, known for its distinctive tandem rotor system which provides powerful lift capabilities. The helicopter is in the process of a cargo operation, as evidenced by a large object being airlifted. This object, attached to the helicopter by cables, is a long, black-and-yellow missile or rocket with stabilizing fins, hinting at military activity or a testing range scenario.\n\nBeneath the clear blue sky, the overall scene suggests a remote, possibly isolated area used for military training or testing, given the presence of advanced machinery and the nature of the cargo. The background is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the arid environment typical of desert terrains. The terrain and activities suggest a focus on functionality and the strategic use of vast, uninhabited lands for operations that require extensive clearance and safety protocols.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["544754","544771","545642","545637","544741","542577","552372","549016","542518","556917","545800","552923","544401","545575","544027","544016"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","rotor","testing","desert","cargo","cliff","training","protocol","fin","strata"]}
