{"path":"549057.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing outdoors on a sunny day with a clear, pale blue sky. He appears to be in a rural area beside a road, as evidenced by the grassy terrain and a partial view of two cars—one red, one white—visible in the background. The man, positioned off-center to the left side of the image, is dressed in workman-like attire; he wears a cap and a plaid shirt under a pair of denim overalls. He holds up a metal chain with a hook and counterweight, showcasing it with a proud, subtly amused expression on his face. His posture is playful and confident, legs slightly apart and one hand on his hip, enhancing the informal, dynamic quality of the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a moment of casual display or demonstration, possibly related to his work or interests.","title":"Successful fisherman--near el centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545087","548299","547277","553907","557138","552864","549051","552570","555824","545390","544835","552571","545401","548791","558333","545371"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["demonstration","hip","hook","overall","chain","plaid","leg","evidence","pair","interest"]}
