{"path":"548779.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image appears to be an aerial photograph of a waterfront area, showcasing a mix of natural and developed land. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, possibly from an aircraft, as part of the left edge of what might be a plane wing is visible at the top left of the frame.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a series of large, rectangular plots filled with a light-colored substance, likely sand, which could suggest ongoing development or industrial activity, such as salt evaporation ponds or construction sites. Intersecting these plots are various compact roads or pathways.\n\nTo the north of these plots is a built-up area with numerous small buildings compactly organized, suggesting a residential or industrial zone. The architecture is simple and utilitarian, typical of coastal communities or working areas.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features lush green vegetation and mangrove swamps, characteristic of tropical or subtropical climates. The clear, shallow waters indicate a healthy marine environment, possibly supporting diverse aquatic life.\n\nWater bodies encircle the land on almost all sides, presenting a network of waterways that integrate the natural and developed elements of this locale. These waterways could be naturally occurring or part of a controlled water management system to prevent flooding or for navigation.\n\nOverall, this image captures the interaction between human development and the natural environment in a coastal setting, illustrating the balance of urbanization and conservation in waterfront regions.","title":"Land development at plantation key in the Florida keys","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548636","548638","544670","544635","547508","548632","548643","548780","553945","557462","557451","557504","551574","548628","549528","551607"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["plot","waterway","waterfront","urbanization","mangrove","swamp","development","prevent","encircle","salt"]}
