{"path":"555566.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"In this photograph, the foreground features a grave adorned with artificial flowers in vibrant colors such as yellow, pink, and white. The headstone is horizontal, substantial, and appears to be made of granite with engraved floral designs and a barely visible inscription.\n\nThe landscape around the grave extends into a wide-open rural scene under a bright, clear blue sky. The area is characterized by undulating fields showing different shades of green and brown, indicating various types of vegetation or stages of agricultural cultivation. In the mid-ground, modest rural houses and a few structures are visible, one with a notably large, white roof. \n\nIn the background, the scene shows a wider, open area with dark smoke arising in the distance, possibly indicating industrial activity or burning. The overall mood is serene, highlighted by the contrasting natural beauty of the landscape against the subtle backdrop of human activity.","title":"Tombstone marking a grave in a cemetery at Cadiz, Ohio.
