{"path":"551405.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a middle-aged woman is engaged in the task of cleaning fish. She is seated on a makeshift seat, possibly a upturned bucket or a short stool, near the open back of a vehicle, which seems to be a type of truck or large van. Her attire suggests mild weather; she wears a long-sleeve green top and purple pants. \n\nShe is focused on her task, with her hands busy cleaning fish over a large metal trash can, which appears to serve as her workspace. Around her, there are several metal containers; two smaller pots in front of her contain fish, indicating they might have been cleaned or are waiting to be cleaned. On the side, there is a taller metal bucket with what looks to be a handle or grip of some sort extending out of it, maybe another tool used in her task.\n\nThe scene around her is nondescript with flat terrain and a very broad, almost cloudless sky visible in the background, suggesting a wide, open space typical of a rural or semi-rural area. There is no immediate vegetation or trees visible, highlighting the openness of the area.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of daily or routine work, possibly in a rural setting, focusing on the woman's engagement with her task amidst simple and functional surroundings.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
