{"path":"558326.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"In the photograph, an elderly woman is seated in a wheelchair at a round table. The table has a reddish-brown metallic edge with a gray center. On the table, several art supplies are organized: multiple cup containers filled with pencils and brushes, a couple of small cans, and another container with a larger number of art tools. The woman, wearing glasses and a floral blouse, is focused on a task at hand, holding what appears to be a pen or brush. She seems engaged in an artistic activity, possibly drawing or painting.\n\nThe setting appears to be an institutional or public space, suggested by the utilitarian wall color and floor tiles. The background shows a bulletin board with various papers and announcements, and a closed door with a window. The room is lit by natural light, possibly coming from a window not visible in the image, which provides a warm and serene ambiance. This suggests a calm, focused environment, ideal for creative endeavors.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community centers.
