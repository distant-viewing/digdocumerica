{"path":"547682.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of several reddish-brown ants on the rough, textured surface of a rock. The focus is on one ant prominently entering a hole in the rock, while others are either near this hole or scattered around on the rock surface. The rock's granularity and uneven fissures contribute to a detailed texture, enhancing the visibility of the ants against the stark, stone background. The surface coloration varies from lighter greyish tones to deeper brown shades, which resemble the ants' color, providing both contrast and camouflage for the creatures. The lighting in the image is natural, casting soft shadows and highlighting the rough texture of the rock and the delicate forms of the ants. The composition of the photo directs the viewer's attention towards the central action of the ant entering the hole, suggesting a moment captured within a larger narrative of these ants' activity.","title":"Ants in the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543149","544907","553582","550474","543151","555182","550475","544682","550476","555200","550483","545558","554410","543421","545597","555793"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hole","rock","enter","camouflage","texture","creature","surface","coloration","varies","resemble"]}
