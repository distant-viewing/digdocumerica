{"path":"552493.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image shows an old, abandoned stairwell inside a dilapidated building. The stairs, covered in debris and peeling paint, lead upwards to a darker upper level with a visible staircase landing. The walls to the side of the stairs are also in disrepair, with patches of paint peeled off, revealing the bare surfaces beneath. One side of the staircase has a wooden handrail which looks aged and worn out.\n\nThe scene is lit by natural light filtering in through a window near the stairwell, illuminating grit and decay in the environment. The overall tone and textures convey a sense of abandonment and neglect, reinforced by the eerie, faded colors and the somber atmosphere of the setting. The photograph likely conveys themes of decay, past habitation, and the passage of time.","title":"Interior stairway of deserted house","placename":"Detroit (Ill.)","location":"Detroit, Illinois","nn1":["556385","557342","545818","550719","557139","550129","551330","557343","549786","552450","552491","551944","557348","553555","547985","557344"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["staircase","stair","paint","decay","handrail","landing","filtering","disrepair","passage","habitation"]}
