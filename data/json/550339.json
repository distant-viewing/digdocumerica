{"path":"550339.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial facility with several prominent features. A number of large buildings dominate the composition, and multiple smokestacks are visible, releasing white smoke or steam into the air. The facility seems expansive, covering a large area with various sections connected by paved roads.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a sizable body of water, possibly a river, with visible rippling on the surface. Adjacent to this body of water are round storage tanks, and there are patches of cleared land and wooded areas surrounding the facility, indicating a somewhat rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe picture captures the contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity, showcasing elements like dense trees around the periphery of the premises. There are also visible residential areas with smaller buildings and homes in the distant background, suggesting the facility's proximity to a community. The overall lighting and shadows indicate that the image was taken on a clear day, enhancing the visibility of the details.","title":"Georgia pacific paper plant, looking east","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["546005","543764","549727","548195","543872","544495","551192","551173","551201","551576","549968","550856","549507","551567","545833","546087"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["facility","rippling","periphery","cleared","release","hom","featur","adjacent","pave","proximity"]}
