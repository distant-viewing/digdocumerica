{"path":"547618.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image depicts an industrial maritime scene focused on a water body with visible pollution. The water in the foreground shows vivid streaks and pools of iridescent sheen, possibly oil or chemicals, creating a mix of blues, pinks, purples, and browns on the surface. This rainbow-like oil slick covers a significant area of the water closest to the viewer.\n\nIn the background, there are two prominent industrial docks or jetties extending into the water. Each is equipped with large, metallic cranes that are used likely for loading and unloading goods. The cranes are tall, with angular structures and stark, functional design, painted in industrial colors. The jetty to the left in the image houses several vehicles and miscellaneous equipment, suggesting active use, possibly for transport or construction purposes.\n\nThe farther shore across the water is indistinct due to the focus on the water pollution and the industrial foreground. It appears to be an urban environment with low-rise structures, possibly another part of the industrial complex.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light on the scene which emphasizes the somber environmental impact reflected in the water. The overall impression is of a working industrial area with significant environmental challenges, highlighted by the pollution in the water.","title":"Oil from tanker terminal floats on Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551559","547626","551561","544803","552205","547614","546889","549524","552219","552127","544294","551560","552019","546836","551562","551183"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["jetty","pollution","oil","water","crane","rainbow","slick","unloading","streak","pink"]}
