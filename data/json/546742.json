{"path":"546742.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a rainy outdoor scene with several elements of interest, predominantly featuring people and vehicles. The setting seems to be a grassy area near a parking lot. The focus appears slightly softened due to the rainy conditions, contributing to a moody ambiance.\n\nOn the left, a female figure is central in the mid-ground, walking through the grass and holding a colorful red umbrella patterned with flowers over her head. She is wearing a dark coat, and her stride suggests movement through the wet grass.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a blurred side profile of another individual, perhaps male, holding a transparent red-trimmed umbrella. This figure is partially out of frame and wearing a light-colored coat.\n\nThe background is densely populated with various stationary vehicles, adding a mundane contrast to the vibrant umbrellas. Several cars and a camper van are visible. Each vehicle is parked, and the assortment includes different models and colors.\n\nThe background further back is occupied by a line of bare trees, shrouded in mist, which enhances the gloomy, overcast weather aesthetic. The atmospheric conditions and subdued natural lighting suggest late afternoon or evening during a dreary, rainy day. The overall mood is somber yet vividly accentuated by splashes of color from the umbrellas.","title":"\"Park and ride\" parking lot","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546643","546660","553145","546656","553188","551863","551933","546639","551868","546738","556730","556734","551873","546666","545875","546401"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["umbrella","coat","vehicle","camper","stride","figure","van","assortment","grass","male"]}
