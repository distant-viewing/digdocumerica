{"path":"552320.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a man fishing from a modest-sized boat on a large body of water, which appears to be a sea or lake. The fisherman, dressed in a plaid shirt, denim jeans, and a camo bucket hat, is actively engaged in fishing, as he is bent slightly forward with his arms extended, managing a noticeably bent fishing rod. The intense curve of the rod indicates that he is dealing with a significant catch or resistance from the water.\n\nThe background features a bright blue sky dotted with a few clouds and a densely wooded shoreline visible in the distance, suggesting a remote or natural setting. The water is choppy, with visible waves and ripples, hinting at a breezy weather condition.\n\nThe colors in the image are vivid, particularly the blues of the water and the sky which contrast with the darker tones of the boat and the fisherman's attire. The overall scene is one of action, nature, and outdoor adventure, capturing a moment of concentration and effort in a tranquil natural setting.","title":"Fishing for true cod in southern Puget Sound near Point Defiance.
