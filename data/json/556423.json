{"path":"556423.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a rural hillside setting, depicting a cluster of modest houses nestled on the slopes, surrounded by dense, leafy forestation. The houses vary in size and color, including shades of white, green, brown, and red. They are built close to each other, seemingly adapting to the geographic conditions of the steep terrain. A mix of architectural styles and states of maintenance can be seen, with some homes featuring porches or external staircases that contribute to their utilitarian appearance.\n\nEach house is positioned at different levels on the hill, suggesting a community that has developed organically over time. The backdrop is dominated by a thick cover of trees which seem to be in early spring bloom, giving a soft contrast to the more vividly colored homes. In the foreground, beneath the houses, there are informal pathways or dirt tracks, and certain areas appear to be used for storage or parking.\n\nNo visible human activity can be seen from this perspective, adding a quiet, serene quality to the scene. The photograph provides a glimpse into rural life in a region where the landscape plays a significant role in the daily lives of its inhabitants, influencing the architecture and settlement patterns. The overall mood is peaceful and somewhat isolated, emphasizing the natural environment and the simplicity of the architectural forms.","title":"Houses perched on a hillside in Logan, West Virginia.
