{"path":"546350.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an up-close, detailed view of two individuals engaged in handling small marine organisms, possibly for the purposes of environmental study or fishing. The hands of the individuals are the central focus of the image. One set of hands cupped together holds several small, clear fish larvae visible against the skin, while the other hand, wearing a watch, is carefully pointing to or selecting one of the larvae.\n\nThe larvae appear delicate and translucent, and the hands are wet, suggesting that they were recently immersed in water. To the left, part of a white net or mesh pouch is visible, hinting that it was possibly used to collect or temporarily store the larvae from a larger body of water, which is not visible in the shot. The background features a glimpse of a water container, reinforcing the aquatic setting of the activity.\n\nOther notable details include the wristwatch on one individual, suggesting a measure of preciseness or attention to timing in the activity. The background is mostly dark, focusing all attention on the action in the foreground. The overall composition emphasizes detail and care in handling vulnerable aquatic life, possibly for scientific research or conservation purposes.","title":"Mobile lab of the Southeast Water Laboratory in Athens, GA.
