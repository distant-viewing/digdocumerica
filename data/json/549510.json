{"path":"549510.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large industrial complex, likely a steel mill, located near a body of water. The image captures a sprawling facility with multiple large structures, including tall smokestacks and several massive buildings equipped with complex piping and machinery. The area is enveloped in a haze, with smoke and steam emanating from various points, contributing to an atmosphere of heavy industrial activity.\n\nIn the foreground, there are heaps of raw materials, possibly coal or iron ore, stored along the docks where a barge is moored. This suggests the transportation of these materials is closely linked with the operations of the facility. Adjacent to these heaps are cranes and other loading equipment, underscoring the ongoing movement and processing of materials.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by the main steel production facilities, characterized by lofty chimneys releasing plumes of smoke, and large buildings that house the furnaces and other equipment essential for steel making. The presence of smoke and steam is indicative of the production processes being actively engaged.\n\nIn the background, the landscape flattens and extends to more industrial infrastructure, though details are less discernible. Large open areas and piles of material can be glimpsed, suggesting storage or waste disposal areas. Beyond these, the terrain transitions into what appears to be a natural coastline, providing a stark contrast to the industrial foreground.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph highlights the extensive reach and environmental impact of industrial operations, set against a natural waterfront, emphasizing the interface between industrial development and natural landscapes.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant on the Lake Erie waterfront south of Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549511","549508","547101","546769","549968","555769","553891","549494","549966","557222","545236","555770","546827","555776","547696","549472"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["steel","heap","material","production","smoke","steam","facility","making","reach","ore"]}
