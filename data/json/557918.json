{"path":"557918.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts an indoor setting that appears to be a car dealership or showroom. A woman stands on the right side of the frame, interacting with a car. She is middle-aged, wearing glasses and a short-sleeved, plaid dress. She appears cheerful and possibly talking or smiling as she holds onto the door of a maroon-colored car, which is in the foreground of the image.\n\nThe car features a shiny exterior with chrome details and a clean interior visible through its open door. There is a reflection visible on its surface, suggesting a well-lit environment, likely due to the natural light entering through large windows in the wall and ceiling. The roof structure suggests an industrial type of building with its exposed steel beams and wide, spaced windows.\n\nTo the left rear of the woman, a man is bent over inside the hood of another car, which is dark blue. Only his rear and legs are visible as he seems engaged in inspecting or working on the car's engine or internal components. His attire is not distinctly visible, but his pose suggests a focus on maintenance or inspection tasks.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is that of a typical day at a car showroom or service area, with individuals engaged in activities related to car maintenance and viewing. The daylight and open structure of the building contribute to a busy yet airy environment.","title":"Motorist is happy after a 1976 inspection seal was pasted to the windshield after her car successfully passed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and be given a safety check. All other vehicles registered in the city must undergo only the safety check which has been in effect since 1940.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557861","554381","557862","557860","557831","554375","557927","557900","557850","542763","554376","557919","557905","557885","557864","557891"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","rear","dealership","maintenance","door","inspection","hood","chrome","talk","engine"]}
