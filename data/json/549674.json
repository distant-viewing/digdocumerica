{"path":"549674.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a young child, wearing a casual outfit consisting of a yellow top and dark bottoms, playing in an outdoor setting. The child is firmly hugging a large, upright, hollow red structure, which appears to be playground equipment. The large red structure resembles an oversized geometric shape (cuboid or cylinder with large holes), inspiring playful exploration.\n\nThe setting is an inviting outdoor area with a green artificial turf floor that suggests the space is designed for play and safety. In the background, partially obscured and out of focus, are two distinctive items: a traditional wooden structure, possibly another piece of playground equipment, resembling a pyramid or hut made of large logs; and a white statue of a figure standing on a pedestal, contributing to an ambiance that balances recreational space with elements of classical decor.\n\nThe environment is sunny and bright, enhancing the vibrant colors of the playground and the lush greenery that frames the scene. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes creativity and curiosity in childhood, juxtaposed with cultural or aesthetic elements in the form of statuary and structured play equipment.","title":"This playground was built above an underground parking lot at the plaza of the town hall.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["547188","547875","549666","551725","545867","555928","543496","557987","555931","548119","544354","556290","555946","551720","551726","556175"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["playground","play","equipment","hut","pyramid","creativity","pedestal","cylinder","child","hole"]}
