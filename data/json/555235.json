{"path":"555235.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a man engaged in an activity outside under natural light. He is crouching or kneeling on the ground, holding what appears to be a dark pair of binoculars or goggles up to his eyes. He is dressed in a short-sleeve, checkered, button-up shirt and dark pants. The man's posture and the intense focus he is directing through the device suggest he might be inspecting or observing something specific.\n\nBeside the man, to the right, there is a large can labeled with visible text, including the word \"ALGO,\" suggesting it may contain chemicals or some industrial product. Next to this can, there is a large stack of cardboard or possibly thin fiberboards, neatly tied together with a string, standing upright.\n\nThe background is nondescript, primarily in deep shadow which helps highlight the subject and the objects beside him with the direct sunlight they are under. This focal setup in the composition suggests a work-related, possibly inspection or quality control scenario in an industrial or construction context.","title":"Environmental protection agency pesticides inspector photographs the label of a container at the valley chemical company, greenville, Mississippi, during a routine inspection and will compare it with labels epa has on file","placename":"Mississippi","location":"Mississippi","nn1":["558108","556447","552110","553656","548879","552369","544835","555243","553603","553642","543802","544094","542664","550962","554622","542497"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["goggle","binocular","string","crouch","inspection","kneel","cardboard","product","inspect","scenario"]}
