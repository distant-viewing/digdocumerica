{"path":"546768.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene on a crowded beach. In the foreground, there’s a group of women lounging on the beach. On the far left, a woman is seated on a folding chair, wearing a blue swimsuit and sunglasses, animatedly talking with her hands. Next to her, a woman wearing a red bikini and a white hat is seated on the sand, looking towards the woman talking. In the center, another woman with a brown bikini adorned with pink and white floral patterns reclines on a beach towel, propped up on her elbow, looking slightly towards the camera with a somewhat stern expression.\n\nTo the right of this group, various personal items like beach bags, towels, and flip-flops are scattered across the sand. A towel with a prominent tie-dye pattern can be seen, indicating the era’s fashion.\n\nIn the background, more beach-goers are visible including some individuals standing and others seated on the sand. Notably, there are wooden platforms with more people sitting on them, including two individuals who appear to be having a conversation. The beach scene is not overly sunny, suggesting a cloudy day or overcast weather, as no harsh shadows are visible.\n\nOverall, the image has a relaxed, casual atmosphere typical of a beach setting, with people enjoying leisure time, sunbathing, and engaging in conversations. The attire and styling of the beach-goers provide a nostalgic feel, potentially pointing to the fashion trends of the mid-20th century.","title":"Maryland--Sandy Point State Park, east of Annapolis, near Annapolis.","placename":"Sandy Point (Md.)","location":"Sandy Point, Maryland","nn1":["546794","547507","550936","547503","548541","550928","550930","550929","547491","543534","550931","551972","546874","547680","550932","547628"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["beach","towel","goer","bikini","woman","sand","fashion","trend","folding","sunbathing"]}
