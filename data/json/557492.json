{"path":"557492.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring a large body of water set under a twilight or dawn sky. In the center, a person is seated in a bright yellow kayak, gently creating ripples in the calm blue water. The person appears to be paddling or resting with a paddle in their hands, wearing casual outdoor attire suitable for kayaking.\n\nThe background shows a lush environment with patches of tall, dense reeds on the nearest banks, leading to more open water. Beyond the reeds, the scene opens up to a distant view of an elevated shoreline dotted with buildings, trees, and street lights which are softly illuminated, suggesting early evening or late afternoon. A bridge spans part of the water, suggesting that this might be near a developed area, yet the overall ambiance of the setting remains peaceful and somewhat secluded.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is subtle, with the sky showing fading light that reflects gently on the water's surface, enhancing the overall tranquil and somewhat moody atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Youngster in an inflatable raft floats in buena vista lagoon.  The wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons in southern California.  There is concern for the body of water because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments.  Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900.  By the early 1970's it had decreased to about 125,000 acres","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["550674","554466","551280","550771","554474","547550","543537","552333","552311","547230","543143","550975","558068","552124","553334","550653"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["paddle","reed","kayak","water","person","open","remain","twilight","develop","dawn"]}
