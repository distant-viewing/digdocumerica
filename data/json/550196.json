{"path":"550196.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a vivid and somewhat stark contrast between a residential area and industrial activity. In the foreground, a bold, red stop sign is clearly visible, sharply focused, and centrally located in the image. It acts as a prominent visual element, its octagonal shape and distinct white lettering spelling \"STOP\" capturing immediate attention.\n\nBehind the sign is a residential scene which includes several houses. The houses are traditional with pitched roofs and appear to be two-story, sided with clapboard. They are closely nestled together, indicative of a dense suburban or urban neighborhood. The colors of the houses are muted, primarily in shades of yellow and beige, typical of residential architecture that might be found in many American towns.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the residential foreground, are large industrial structures including a significant factory or plant. Central to this is a large cooling tower from which a plume of dark smoke or steam is billowing into the sky. The smoke is greyish-black and spreads extensively, suggesting significant industrial activity. This tower, alongside other industrial structures, imposes itself into the scene, standing stark against the otherwise mundane residential setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, especially with the inclusion of the stop sign, can be interpreted as a poignant statement on environmental and social issues, symbolizing a call to attention or halt to the environmental impact of industrial activities on residential life. The juxtaposition of the sign with the industrial background serves as a powerful visual metaphor for conflict between human habitation and industrial expansion.","title":"\"Stop\" might be the plea of Lesher Avenue residents to the Republic Steel chimney that belches smoke over their neighborhood.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550200","550187","545388","544715","551151","551145","551075","551152","551146","557881","557300","546039","543013","551072","551074","552037"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["stop","house","sign","statement","interpret","tower","smoke","call","expansion","inclusion"]}
