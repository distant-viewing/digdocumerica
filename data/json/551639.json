{"path":"551639.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures four young children, likely in a public setting, with a visually striking large water fountain behind them. The background features a large, modern building characterized by its tall columns and a row of spherical lights. The scene is outdoors during the day.\n\nThe children are engaged in leisurely activities that suggest a warm, casual day out. Three of them are standing close to each other on an edge with the fountain's water jets in the background, while a fourth child is sitting down on the same ledge. They each appear to be enjoying ice cream. The standing group includes two girls to the left, one in a red dress with white polka dots and another in a similar style but predominantly red with a floral pattern. A boy stands to the right, dressed in a striped t-shirt and shorts. The sitting girl, also in a red floral dress, seems to be conversing with the others or looking at something one of the standing children is holding.\n\nThe image conveys a moment of childhood enjoyment and innocence, set against a backdrop of both architectural and natural elements. This blend provides a dynamic contrast between the playfulness of the children and the structured, imposing building in the distance.","title":"Lincoln Center plaza is enclosed by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
