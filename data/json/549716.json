{"path":"549716.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene by a water body, likely a lake or a large river, under what seems to be either the early morning or late afternoon light. The image captures a group of three individuals sitting on what appears to be a grassy slope, facing the water. Their identities are not clear due to their silhouettes against the bright reflection of sunlight on the water, but they seem to be engaged in a peaceful observation of the surroundings.\n\nTo the right side of the image, a dog is seen moving along the grass near the water's edge, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting. Overhanging branches from a pine tree on the top left frame the scene, while another bushy plant on the right also contributes to this natural frame, enclosing the scene cozily and leading the viewer's eye towards the group and the shimmering water.\n\nThe water itself is a focal point, reflecting the sunlight in a way that creates a sparkling effect, suggesting movement and life in the otherwise still image. The background across the water shows a line of thin trees or shrubs, partially obscured by distance and mist, which adds a layer of depth and mystery to the landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a calm and contemplative mood, capturing a moment of natural beauty and peaceful human interaction with the environment.","title":"End of the day at bob-lo island","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["554477","558093","543892","545229","546963","547217","545293","551516","550389","557493","554753","543951","543601","545038","543611","552033"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","sparkling","mystery","group","sunlight","dog","shimmering","observation","enclose","way"]}
