{"path":"552118.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This is a vivid, color photograph featuring two young boys on the shore of a body of water, presumably after a fishing trip. The boy on the right is holding up a string of large fish, giving the viewer a clear look at their catch. He is smiling and appears proud of their fishing success. He wears a white T-shirt, which is somewhat dirty, and dark pants, and is barefoot. The boy on the left, who is shirtless and wearing black shorts, has curly hair and appears pleasantly surprised or impressed by the size of the fish. Both boys have a natural, outdoorsy look, with mud on their clothes and feet, emphasizing that they have actively engaged in fishing.\n\nThe background shows the edge of the water, mud on the shore, and some vegetation, indicating a natural, rural setting typical for fishing activities. The lighting suggests it is a sunny day, casting natural light and shadows on the boys and the scenery around them.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo captures a joyful and successful outdoor adventure, a common childhood experience during fishing outings. The focus is directly on the expressions of the boys and the fish they caught, celebrating their achievement and the enjoyment of the activity.","title":"Warren Freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas River.
