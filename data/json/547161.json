{"path":"547161.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a construction or industrial scene featuring a large, yellow, wheel loader. The loader, marked with the label \"Allis-Chalmers,\" appears to be on the verge of slipping off or attempting to navigate a steep earthen slope. The slope is textured with apparent treads or tracks, indicative of prior activity by this or other similar vehicles.\n\nThe background of the image shows a waterfront setting, suggesting the loader might be operating near a beach or riverbank, with bare trees and gray skies indicative of a winter or early spring season. The general scene implies a land-moving or excavation operation, possibly related to erosion control, as the vehicle is at the edge where the land meets the water.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a stark, somewhat bleak quality, emphasized by the overcast sky and the barren trees, reflecting a utilitarian focus on the machinery and its interaction with the landscape.","title":"Army earthmover piles loose dirt to reinforce lake-eroded lake shore drive","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["554837","555638","543113","542539","551262","543107","555636","556430","547583","553619","556325","547922","551947","545665","556506","544138"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["loader","slip","slope","tread","attempt","land","excavation","operate","vehicle","wheel"]}
