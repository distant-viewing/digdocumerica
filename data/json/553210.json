{"path":"553210.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, colorful scene likely from the 1970s, evident from the fashion and overall ambiance. The image features a group of individuals engaged in an animated, joyful moment on a city street.\n\nIn the foreground, two men stand out due to their striking and colorful attire. The first man, positioned on the left, is wearing a safari-style cap, a patterned shirt with earth tones, camel-colored trousers, and distinctive striped socks with tan shoes. He carries a white bag slung across his body and seems amused, smiling broadly while watching the scene next to him.\n\nBeside him, another man is dressed in a flamboyant ensemble consisting of a black and white patterned shirt, bright yellow trousers, and a white cap worn tilted to the side. This man is in motion, perhaps dancing or making an expressive gesture, which adds a dynamic element to the photo.\n\nBehind these two figures, a diverse crowd of onlookers, including men and women of various ages, watches the event. A woman in a red and white checked shirt, holding her hands to her face in an expression of excitement, is particularly noticeable.\n\nIn the background, the urban environment is hinted at with a glimpse of a building and a striped tent or umbrella, suggesting the setting might be a street fair or public event. The mood is lively and festive, reminiscent of the vibrant street culture of that era.","title":"Far-out style setters groove to music of Fountain Square Band","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553761","556288","551124","553183","553155","553267","553264","553232","556277","549923","551835","551019","556221","549909","553184","545231"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["trouser","street","man","cap","ensemble","event","sock","onlooker","excitement","shirt"]}
