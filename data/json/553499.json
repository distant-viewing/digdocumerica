{"path":"553499.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up image of an adult woman, looking directly at the camera. The woman has short dark hair that appears somewhat unkempt, with strands blowing over her face. Her expression seems pensive, and she has a subtle half-smile or grimace. The features on her face show a bit of wear, possibly indicative of her exposure to outdoor elements.\n\nShe is wearing what looks like a casual, dark garment with a horizontal striped pattern in white and blue on her collar. The background is blurry and almost monochromatic, suggesting a soft, nondescript environment that prevents any further distractions from her face.\n\nThe lighting on the woman's face provides a warm complexion but with deep shadows, highlighting her features dramatically and giving the photo a somewhat somber vibe. The focus emphasize the textures of her skin and the windblown hair, adding to the naturalistic feel of the portrait.","title":"The watkins of mulky square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for i-635.
