{"path":"547983.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a chaotic scene of a landfill or dumpsite, showing a large pile of trash and waste materials. The waste primarily includes a massive accumulation of varied objects such as furniture, wires, paper, and scattered debris. A prominent feature in the photo is a large, overturned black dumpster that seems to have recently deposited more waste onto the heap.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a solitary man wearing a coat and a cap, standing beside the landfill, observing the scene, which suggests an element of human interaction or supervision of the site.\n\nThe background is minimal, primarily sky which is mildly overcast. The environment around the trash pile is not visible, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention predominantly on the waste and the activities at the site. Additionally, many seagulls are flying above the garbage, possibly scavenging, which adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static pile of trash.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph communicates a sense of abandonment and pollution, possibly raising environmental concerns regarding waste management and its impact on natural surroundings.","title":"Dumping garbage in landfill operation on Jamaica bay increased water pollution as well as serious ecological damage is feared","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549750","557307","550801","548210","550248","547971","546761","543824","549936","550798","549957","545299","544799","549748","550256","549746"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","trash","landfill","pile","dumpster","dumpsite","regard","site","seagull","deposit"]}
