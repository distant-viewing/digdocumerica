{"path":"552921.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a high-altitude view overlooking a large expanse of water and a mountainous shoreline. The body of water is a rich blue, indicative of either a large lake or a sea. In the water, there are two boats visible, each creating a distinct white wake as they move, which suggests they are traveling at a fair speed.\n\nThe background features a mountain range running parallel to the shoreline. The mountains appear rugged and barren with no visible vegetation, displaying various brown and beige tones that might indicate arid conditions. There's also a distinct light sandy or salt flat region between the water and the mountains, suggesting a possibly arid climate zone.\n\nThe sky, seen at the top edge of the frame, is clear and suggests that the photo was taken on a day with good visibility. The whole scene is bathed in natural light, presumably from the sun, enhancing the colors of the natural landscape and water. The photo composition skillfully contrasts the vast, tranquil blue of the water with the stark, rugged browns of the mountains, emphasizing nature's diverse palette and scale.","title":"Pyramid Lake seen from the air.
