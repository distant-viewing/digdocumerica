{"path":"557867.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features three men, who appear to be engaged in a professional setting, possibly related to emergency services or mechanics, due to the uniforms they're wearing. Two of the men are wearing white shirts with black ties and glasses; their shirts have badges and what may be a logo including the word “Service.” The third man is in a lighter blue short-sleeve shirt that also features a similar badge.\n\nThe two older men in white are standing together, one is partially obscured behind the other. The man in the foreground, presumably the one in charge, is pensively holding a pair of glasses near his mouth, suggesting a moment of contemplation or decision-making. His posture and facial expression convey authority and focus.\n\nThe younger man in blue stands slightly apart from the others, his body turned away as he looks off to the side, suggesting either a different focus or perhaps a moment of reflection.\n\nIn the background, there's a green metal structure (possibly a garage or a workshop facility) and part of a vehicle, enhancing the suggestion that these men are in an automotive or mechanical work environment. The setting has an industrial feel with metallic elements and a functional space.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment that seems both routine and critical, highlighting professional interaction and possibly a decision-making process among individuals in a service or emergency-related field. The mood appears serious and focused, typical of professionals engaged in specialized tasks.","title":"Three public works department employees check the reading for a car being tested on an exhaust analyzer at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. Since January, 1975, all light duty, spark ignition powered vehicles in Hamilton County must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Officials expected 74 percent of the vehicles in both Norwood and Cincinnati would be tested by the end of 1975.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557856","557902","556335","542757","557727","552382","546628","557897","552392","556266","549684","555234","557852","555233","549358","552368"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["decision","emergency","badge","man","service","charge","suggestion","making","professional","authority"]}
