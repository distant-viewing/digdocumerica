{"path":"545055.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene at dusk. The composition features a fishing boat in the foreground, silhouetted against the shimmering water which reflects the hues of the sunset. The sea appears calm, with gentle ripples and waves touched by the purples and oranges of the setting sun.\n\nOn the boat, there are several people engaged in fishing activities. One individual is prominently seen managing a fishing rod, suggestive of a calm yet focused fishing endeavor. The outlines of what appear to be fishing equipment or other maritime gear can be observed on the boat.\n\nIn the background, you can spot the horizon where the sea meets the sky, underlain by scattered clouds that add texture to the vista. Another boat is visible in the distance, enhancing the sense of depth and the fishing theme of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful and reflective, typical of maritime activities at sunset. The use of natural light and shadow in the composition adds to the dramatic and tranquil quality of the photograph.","title":"Gill net fishing on the Columbia River.","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["547555","543411","547549","552309","554147","552308","545120","545054","552124","550296","547556","543143","544251","545170","547230","547561"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","sunset","underlie","sea","vista","endeavor","rod","purple","calm"]}
