{"path":"545834.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large body of water densely populated with numerous oil drilling platforms and structures. The scene is dotted with various types of drilling rigs, many of which appear operational, with some rigs actively connected to large towers and others more isolated. The waters are calm, reflecting a muted light that suggests either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a shoreline where industrial and possibly residential buildings can be seen, alongside lush greenery. The atmosphere seems slightly hazy, possibly due to mist or pollution, which adds a soft blur to the distant landscape.\n\nThe entire area is crisscrossed by electrical lines supported by tall, thin towers that stand partially submerged in the water. These power lines add a geometric pattern to the natural and industrial composition of the scene. The multitude of structures and the complex network of power lines create a busy industrial tapestry that dominates this aquatic environment.","title":"Off-shore oil wells on Galveston Bay","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545838","552990","544512","552836","546245","544511","544272","547958","547668","551612","555862","552245","550761","544650","557484","551977"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["rig","power","tower","line","multitude","tapestry","blur","oil","network","mist"]}
