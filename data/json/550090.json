{"path":"550090.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph showcases an outdoor scene capturing a moment between two people, likely at a public event given the presence of other individuals and the seating arrangement. A woman and a young child are the focal points of this image.\n\nThe woman, who appears to be middle-aged, is dressed in traditional or culturally specific attire, featuring a dark headscarf and a navy blue dress. She is wearing prescription glasses with a noticeably serious or concerned expression on her face. Her posture suggests protectiveness or comfort as she holds the young child closely.\n\nThe child, whose face is not visible, seems to be resting against the woman, indicative of seeking comfort or showing affection. The child is dressed in a bright orange jacket and blue pants.\n\nThey are seated on a wooden bench, further suggesting a public setting, possibly waiting or taking a moment to rest during a larger gathering. Other individuals in the background, one dressed in a light jacket, hint at a cool weather setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of intimacy and care within a public or communal environment, capturing a personal moment amidst a broader social context.","title":"Amish mother and child in Middlefield","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553543","543863","552931","556144","556294","556593","553496","551473","552935","556299","551027","543854","554921","553523","558409","558292"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","comfort","woman","affection","navy","face","headscarf","intimacy","jacket","seating"]}
