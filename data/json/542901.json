{"path":"542901.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a striking Victorian style building painted in a deep red color. The architecture includes decorative trimmings, multiple windows with a protruding bay window section that creates an elegant and classic look. Two signs are prominently displayed; one hanging between the bay windows that reads \"Rosa d'Italia RESTAURANT\" with an additional tagline beneath stating \"Just a little bit of Italy,\" reinforcing the Italian theme.\n\nAdjacent to the restaurant, on the right side, is another shop with a sign that says \"Quality Meats Groceries.\" This shop has a traditional storefront with large display windows and a painted sign above that might suggest it offers groceries and meat products.\n\nThe surrounding area is brightly illuminated under a clear blue sky, and the buildings are designed in an old-fashioned style suggesting this might be in a historical or heritage part of a town. The neat and tidy appearance of the establishments suggests they are well-maintained. The scene is devoid of people, focusing purely on the architecture and commercial aspect of the street. The environment evokes a sense of stepping back in time, reflecting a nostalgic and quaint urban scene.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542811","557643","545339","557634","546440","558120","550107","557156","546436","557806","557635","555949","551870","545317","550115","557654"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["meat","bay","shop","window","trimming","protruding","grocery","heritage","sign","restaurant"]}
