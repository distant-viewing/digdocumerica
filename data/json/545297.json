{"path":"545297.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil winter scene in a forest. The picture captures a winding path covered with snow, encircled by tall, dense evergreen trees. These trees are predominantly conifers, characterized by their deep green needles and upright, sturdy trunks visible throughout the image. The forest floor appears uneven, with mounds of snow suggesting recent snowfall or wind-blown accumulations.\n\nThe path, blanketed with snow, meanders gently through the woods and creates a serene, inviting trail. The lighting in the image is diffused, likely due to overcast or cloudy weather, casting soft shadows and giving the snow a slightly bluish tint. There are no footprints or disturbances in the snow, indicating the picture was taken in a quiet, undisturbed natural setting. This scene is devoid of any human presence or activity, projecting a sense of calm and isolation amidst a winter backdrop. The overall composition emphasizes the stillness and beauty of the natural environment during the colder months.","title":"Forest near Wolf Creek Pass","placename":"Wolfe Creek Pass (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544918","543610","557613","557608","554720","557597","557020","554965","557018","554589","555123","555116","549234","557019","542753","555120"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snow","winter","picture","blow","wind","path","snowfall","month","footprint","encircle"]}
