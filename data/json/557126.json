{"path":"557126.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of a large flock of birds, predominantly geese, gathered on a body of water. The water appears calm, reflecting some birds and the light blue sky. In the forefront, there's a partial view of some thick, tall reeds on the left side, adding a touch of wild, natural texture to the image. The birds are densely packed, occupying most of the water surface visible in the picture. Their plumage predominantly features shades of white, grey, and black, typical of geese, and many of them are positioned with their heads up, suggesting alertness or activity.\n\nIn the background, you can see a deciduous forest with trees that have foliage in autumn hues—yellows, oranges, and remaining greens—indicating the season. This natural backdrop frames the scene and enhances the sense of a thriving, vibrant wildlife habitat. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on wildlife set against a seasonal forest, clearly conveys a moment of natural congregation and activity, possibly during a migration period.","title":"Flocks of blue geese and snow geese stop at the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state. The refuge is approximately 6,000 acres and a major stopover on the Mississippi Flyway for the migrating shore birds.","placename":"Mound City (Mo.)","location":"Mound City, Missouri","nn1":["557121","557124","553346","557122","557123","552238","558091","544838","553347","546086","557120","545991","557490","557125","557202","557203"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","wildlife","alertness","congregation","flock","plumage","forest","reed","yellow","habitat"]}
