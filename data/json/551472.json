{"path":"551472.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor urban scene. At the center of the image are two young women sitting closely together on a concrete planter that also serves as a bench, with a small tree growing from its center. This suggests that the setting could be a pedestrian area or a plaza.\n\nThe women appear to be relaxed and engaged in reading a book together, with one pointing something out on a page to the other. They seem to be enjoying each other's company. Both women have long hair and are dressed in casual, comfortable clothing typical of warm weather â€“ one in a long skirt and sandals, and the other in jeans and sneakers.\n\nThe surroundings include a large building as a backdrop, which has several stories and a facade made of large windows and masonry. This building, along with the presence of other people in the background who are sitting and walking, indicates the public and moderately busy nature of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photo convey a pleasant, leisurely moment in an urban environment where people are taking time to relax, converse, or move about their day. The use of natural light and the abundance of green foliage from the tree add a refreshing contrast to the urban architecture.","title":"Two high school students study together on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553164","553222","551815","551436","551434","547772","558211","553166","551741","550051","551823","551433","556776","556176","551705","551827"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["public","masonry","woman","sandal","planter","sneaker","abundance","plaza","company","skirt"]}
