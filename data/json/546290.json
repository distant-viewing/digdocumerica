{"path":"546290.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of three men engaged in activities on a sandy beach beside clear, shallow water. The man on the left, partially kneeling and bending over, is wearing a gray T-shirt soaked with sweat or water patches, plaid shorts, and green-and-white sneakers. He's handling a fishing net or similar gear, examining something within it. The focal point seems to be the contents of the net, as all three men concentrate attentively on it.\n\nThe middle man, also in a forward-leaning position, wears a white T-shirt and appears to be helping by holding part of the net. The man on the right is shirtless, showing a tanned back and wearing black swim trunks; he's squatting and also focused on the net.\n\nThe background features the beach, with sunlit water reflecting through the upper part of the image, which suggests it might be midday or early afternoon. The overall atmosphere is busy yet leisurely, with a focus on collaboration and perhaps the examination of a catch or findings in the net. The group's attire and the presence of water and sand suggest a warm, coastal environment, potentially during a recreational or work-related fishing activity.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory.
