{"path":"545089.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photo depicts a collection of crabs inside a large, gray, metal container that is assumed to be part of a commercial fishing operation. These crabs, varying slightly in size and mostly intact, appear to be Dungeness crabs, known for their purple-hued shells and white-tipped claws. The crabs are densely packed within the container, and some are captured in the act of being maneuvered by a metallic grappling device which is visible at the top right of the image.\n\nThis grappling device, possibly part of a crane or lifting mechanism, contains visible signs of wear and rust, suggesting it is frequently used and exposed to harsh conditions, typical in a maritime or seafood harvesting environment. The photo seems to be taken during a crabbing operation, portraying the moment where crabs are sorted or moved within or between containers on a boat.\n\nThe focus is primarily on the crabs and the immediate surroundings, with little background visible other than what appears to be more metallic surfaces, hinting that the photo was taken in a confined, industrial-like space, likely on a fishing vessel. The overall scene conveys a working atmosphere within the commercial fishing industry, focusing on seafood capture and processing activities.","title":"Commercially harvested dungeness crabs","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545182","544264","550316","546214","545175","543912","552285","543909","545189","545181","554005","545093","548767","546297","545063","545193"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["crab","seafood","container","fishing","device","claw","lifte","harvest","photo","shell"]}
