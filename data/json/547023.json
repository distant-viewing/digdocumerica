{"path":"547023.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing confidently in a wooden flat-bottomed boat on a calm body of water, presumably a lake or river. The man is outfitted in a horizontal-striped, long-sleeve polo shirt blended in white, black, and purple stripes; he also wears brown trousers and is holding onto what appears to be gloves in his left hand tucked into his pants. On his head, he sports a yellow cap with a dark bill, featuring a patch or emblem in the center.\n\nHis posture and gaze towards the camera convey a sense of readiness or pause from his activities. In the boat, various fishing or working gear can be seen, including another pair of gloves, some ropes, a red fuel can, and several wooden baskets, which might be used for holding fish or other catches.\n\nIn the background, another similar but unoccupied boat floats gently on the water, adding to the serene and somewhat reflective mood of the scene. The water is still, mirroring the boats and the hazy, probably early morning, sky with its soft light enhances the tranquil and isolated feel of the environment. The setting and equipment suggest that the man might be a fisherman preparing for or wrapping up his dayâ€™s work.","title":"A member of the black-owned oyster co-op at blufton.
