{"path":"549128.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The image presents a large construction scene featuring a towering, incomplete steel framework. The structure itself is quite voluminous, rising up prominently, and is made of several layers of thick steel beams that crisscross each other, forming a complex grid. Some parts of the framework are covered with metal plates, indicating partial completion of some sections.\n\nAt the top of the structure, you can see an open, flat platform with no walls or roof yet installed. The construction site is bustling with activity; however, specific individuals or detailed actions arenâ€™t distinctly visible due to the distance and scale of construction in the image.\n\nSurrounding the steel frame, there is a variety of construction equipment. To the right of the frame, a tall, thin crane extends into the sky, its arm positioned over the structure, likely used for hoisting materials. The ground around the site is cluttered with various construction materials, tools, and possibly other machinery, some casually scattered while others are neatly piled or aligned.\n\nThe background is a relatively clear sky with a few clouds, suggesting a fair weather conducive for outdoor construction work. This outdoor setting seems somewhat isolated, hinted by what appears to be a lack of other structures or urban development in the immediate vicinity, focusing the viewer's attention squarely on the construction activity.","title":"350 megawatt power plant under construction at colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549640","555373","546422","547235","544167","549166","547977","548431","548551","549127","553391","553924","549912","548552","556642","553703"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","steel","framework","completion","conducive","install","site","isolated","crisscross","material"]}
