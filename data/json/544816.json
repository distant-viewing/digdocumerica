{"path":"544816.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark, mountainous landscape with a populated area in the foreground. The setting appears to be a dry, arid region with prominent ridges and peaks in the background, suggesting a desert or semi-desert environment. The mountains loom over the scene, possessing rugged textures and are mostly barren, with sparse vegetation visible.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a residential area consisting of uniformly constructed, simple, box-shaped houses arranged in neat, ordered rows. The buildings are primarily white, likely reflecting the sunlight to keep the interiors cool. Closer to the viewer, there are numerous trailers or mobile homes lined up neatly along a dirt road. These homes are sandwiched between the residential area and a large, clear, flat land, possibly under development or used for another specific purpose. \n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of isolation and functional living, possibly in a newly developed or expanding suburban or rural area. The juxtaposition of natural, rugged mountain terrain against the orderly human settlement gives the image a sense of human resilience and adaptability to harsh environments. There are no visible people or moving vehicles, which adds to a sense of stillness and quietude in the scene. The presence of power lines running across the image also indicates the amenities of modern living reaching into remote areas.","title":"New housing development","placename":"West Sheridan (Colo. : Peak)","location":"West Sheridan, Colorado","nn1":["552603","553130","546756","557339","557527","545625","545809","555861","557516","544147","543658","557526","544400","544874","547652","545313"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["living","home","amenity","quietude","mountain","settlement","trailer","resilience","ridge","stillness"]}
