{"path":"558268.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged man drinking from a large, elaborately decorated beer stein. The stein is adorned with what seems to be traditional motifs and figures, possibly of a historical or folk nature. The man is focused on the action of drinking, his lips pressed against the stein's rim. He is dressed in a black, well-tailored suit indicative of formal or business attire, and he holds a lit cigarette in his other hand, between his index and middle finger.\n\nThe setting seems to be indoors, in a room that appears dimly lit, possibly a bar or a private club environment given the activity involving drinking. There is another person partially visible in the background, blurrily watching the man, which adds a social element to the scene. The background is subdued, with soft lighting that casts gentle shadows around, highlighting the central action.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a candid moment, emphasizing leisure and perhaps a break in a formal or semi-formal gathering, focusing on cultural artifacts represented by the stein and the communal nature of drinking.","title":"A beer stein is raised by a member of the concord singers, a group which sings german songs in New Ulm, Minnesota.
