{"path":"543764.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting an industrial or possibly agricultural facility, embedded in an expansive rural landscape. The facility, situated near the center of the image, features several prominent structures including large storage tanks and rectangular buildings. Among these, smoke stacks can be seen emitting smoke or steam into the air, hinting at operational industrial processes.\n\nSurrounding the facility are various holding areas filled with uniform rows of what appear to be cylindrical objectsâ€”possibly barrels or similar containers. These neatly arranged rows organize the space immediately around the structures and demonstrate significant storage or processing capacity.\n\nThe broader area extends into a rolling landscape punctuated by patches of different crops or grasslands, creating a patchwork of earthy tones that suggest a variety of land uses, possibly including agriculture. Towards the edges of the photograph, faint outlines of hills or low mountains are visible, suggesting a valley-like setting for the facility.\n\nThe photograph overall captures a vivid portrayal of human industrial activity nestled within a vast natural setting, showcasing both the scale of human enterprises and the surrounding environmental context. The lighting is somewhat dim, indicating early morning or late afternoon, casting longer shadows and enriching the colors in the landscape.","title":"Soft coal-burning power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543872","550339","549727","542620","543733","543159","544059","543768","544788","555774","552009","557374","547126","546122","555761","549960"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facility","storage","capacity","row","smoke","tanks","embed","patchwork","process","hills"]}
