{"path":"547980.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph offers a picturesque view from an elevated vantage point overlooking a coastal scene. The image features a rich array of natural and man-made elements:\n\n1. **Water Bodies**: There are several visible including:\n   - A calm expanse of sea that dominates the central to right portion of the image.\n   - A sandy spit that almost horizontally bisects the view in the distance, separating the sea from what appears to be a lagoon or bay on the other side.\n\n2. **Marina and Boats**: In the right foreground, there is a busy marina packed with numerous small boats primarily sailboats and yachts. Adjacent to the marina is a nicely arranged parking area filled with cars, suggesting a popular local attraction or a hub for water-related activities.\n\n3. **Beaches**: There are visible stretches of sandy beach along the sea and the edge of the spit. The beach next to the marina is more structured with possible facilities for visitors. \n\n4. **Vehicles and Infrastructure**: Apart from the marina and parking, there are few visible structures that could be facilities related to the marina or possibly small businesses catering to tourists and visitors.\n\n5. **Vegetation**: The lower and upper edges of the photograph are framed by verdant foliage, suggesting that the viewpoint might be from a hillside or elevated area with dense vegetation.\n\n6. **Colors and Lighting**: The photograph has a slightly vintage look with a dominant bluish tone possibly due to the time of the shot or the color balance of the film used. The lighting is bright, indicating it might be a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the location is serene, primarily focused on leisure activities related to the sea, and caters to an appreciation of natural coastal beauty and nautical pursuits.","title":"Sandy hook from the air","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["551610","548783","554018","545128","549528","548628","543059","552269","542907","547629","543362","544554","552192","552234","542870","554022"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["marina","sea","cater","beach","visitor","relate","parking","lagoon","yacht","pursuit"]}
