{"path":"549354.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a woman of apparent middle age standing in front of a shelf filled with scientific glassware and supplies. She has short wavy hair and is wearing a soft, light-colored sleeveless top with a high neckline and ornamental buttons down one side. Her expression is gentle and reflective, with a slight smile.\n\nThe background consists of a large shelf unit that holds various laboratory equipment. On the upper shelf, there are rows of translucent glass bottles of various shapes and sizes, some capped with metal. Below this, another shelf displays glass test tubes and flasks, some upright and others lying down. The lower part of the shelving unit has opaque white bottles and larger containers, suggesting a storage area for perhaps chemicals or other lab essentials. To the right, a part of a drawer or a cabinet handle is visible, hinting at more storage space. \n\nThe setting and her attire suggest she might be a scientist or researcher, working in a laboratory environment where she possibly conducts experiments or manages chemicals and solutions. The lighting is soft and the focus is on the woman, giving a calm and composed feel to the image.","title":"Dr.  Helga furedi-milhofer, is a laboratory chief at the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Zagreb (Croatia)","location":"Zagreb, Croatia","nn1":["548856","546323","548891","548860","548862","546288","542666","549607","546278","555253","546284","542737","555281","546291","548858","549339"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["shelf","laboratory","bottle","chemical","unit","neckline","essential","researcher","shelving","glassware"]}
