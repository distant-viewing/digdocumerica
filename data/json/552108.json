{"path":"552108.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil riverside scene. The river, which is the focal point of this image, appears calm with a gentle ripple on its surface, reflecting some light. The landscape on the other side of the water features a lush area densely populated with trees. Nestled among the trees is a small structure, possibly a house or a shed, that gives a sense of remoteness and quiet rural life.\n\nIn the foreground, right on the edge of the river, stands a striking white marker or post topped by what looks like a small, possibly wheather-beaten, sign or flag. This post might be used for nautical or territorial marking purposes. The shorelines bordering the river are uneven and natural, strewn with various greenery and hints of a grassy bank.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting suggest it might be mid-day, with the sun casting deep shadows and enhancing the colors of the scenery, giving the photograph a warm, vintage feel. The colors are somewhat subdued, largely dominated by the greens of the trees, the brownish hues of the earth and the structure, and the muted grays and blues of the river. No people are visible, adding to the secluded and untouched nature of the scene. The atmosphere is serene, suggesting a quiet spot away from busy urban life.","title":"On this island in the Kansas River between the 18th Street and East Kansas Avenue bridges, Warren Freeman, a loner, has built the home in which he lives.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["557106","550845","550839","557239","551526","542653","550656","545008","550782","550844","551067","549457","546963","557250","552318","554762"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","post","remoteness","marker","riverside","shed","vintage","flag","scenery","spot"]}
