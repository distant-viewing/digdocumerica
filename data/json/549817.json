{"path":"549817.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a waterway, likely a river, with a backdrop that includes the skyline of a city. The immediate foreground features the edge of a large barge or vessel loaded with a massive amount of garbage. This pile of garbage is predominantly organic and mixed waste, containing items such as decomposing bags, materials, and miscellaneous refuse that suggests a collection from a highly populated urban area.\n\nThe left side of the image affords a view of the river and part of another adjacent vessel or barge, also seemingly filled with rubbish, lined with a sturdy metal barrier. In the upper right quadrant, the skyline is visible, characterized by tall buildings and a notable chimney emitting smoke, contributing to the industrial feel of the scenery. The sunlight is bright, creating a sparkle on the water's surface and casting shadows that enhance the textures of the garbage heap.\n\nReflections on the water indicate it is a sunny day. The overall environment suggests an industrial or urban setting involved in waste management and processing. The scene portrays a stark contrast between the natural waterway and the human-generated waste, emphasizing ongoing environmental and urban challenges.","title":"Garbage is towed down the East River to Staten Island landfill, Manhattan in background.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548315","549808","549799","549818","549780","549801","549816","546785","549820","549824","548366","549822","548357","549783","547907","547899"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["garbage","waste","barge","waterway","vessel","skyline","quadrant","sparkle","rubbish","heap"]}
