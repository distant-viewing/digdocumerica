{"path":"542747.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an early morning scene at a forested campground, shrouded in a hazy atmosphere, possibly due to fog or smoke. Amongst the dense tall pine trees, various types of vehicles and camping equipment are visible, suggesting leisure or vacation activities.\n\nKey visual elements include:\n- A lineup of parked cars from a mix of eras, appearing to include models from the 1960s or 1970s, indicative of the photograph's vintage nature. The vehicles vary in size and build, from station wagons to compact cars.\n- A prominently positioned Volkswagen Beetle, painted in a light color, stands out due to its iconic shape.\n- Multiple tents are set up, with one in the foreground appearing to be a basic ridge tent. The tents, along with a camouflaged recreational vehicle (RV), imply that the area is being used for camping.\n- The atmosphere of the scene is misty, casting a soft, diffused light throughout, which enhances the sense of a secluded, serene setting, possibly early in the morning or amid mild weather conditions.\n- Typical forest debris like pine cones and small branches litter the ground, mingling with man-made objects, emphasizing a mingling of nature and human presence.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of peaceful coexistence between the natural environment and human recreational activities, enveloped in a tranquil, hazy morning atmosphere.","title":"Lodgepole camp ground during Memorial Day weekend","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["545500","542746","548748","548668","553133","554181","548802","548796","543599","548795","557514","554863","554681","554479","545160","544855"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["tent","camping","morning","lineup","vehicle","mingle","vacation","camouflage","cone","pine"]}
