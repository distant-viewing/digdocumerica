{"path":"549146.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a scenic rural landscape during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, judging by the long shadows and the soft, golden light. The foreground is dominated by a large, open field covered with tall grass and what might be wildflowers, amidst which some bright lens flares created either by dew or the angle of the sunlight can be seen.\n\nThere are several small hills rolling gently into the background. Each of these hills is capped with a few trees and some shrubs, possibly indicating a sort of pasture or meadow environment that is not densely wooded, but has scattered trees possibly used for shading animals or as windbreaks. Notably, there are no animals or people visible in the shot, nor any apparent agricultural activity at the moment the photograph was taken.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright blue, suggesting a clear day, and the visibility is excellent, allowing for a view deep into the distance. There is no sign of buildings or human-made structures, emphasizing the natural and possibly remote setting of the scene. The tranquility and unspoiled quality of the landscape suggest a moment captured away from the busyness of urban or suburban life. \n\nOverall, the composition and serene lighting of the photograph evoke a sense of peace and natural beauty, typical of a pastoral landscape.","title":"Sunset at the Redding ranch in Sarpy Basin.
