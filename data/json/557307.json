{"path":"557307.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, sprawling landfill or garbage dump, filled with an array of discarded objects and waste. The scene is densely packed with various types of debris, making the space look chaotic and cluttered. Throughout the image, one can see numerous crushed and rusted metal objects, fragmented pieces of wood, plastics, and other materials. Some specific items visible include tin cans, some still retaining their labels; larger metal drums with visible rust; pieces of cardboard; and a variety of broken household items.\n\nThere are several spots where the waste is piled up higher, forming mounds that vary in both size and content. The background hints at a rural setting, with bare trees suggesting it might be taken during the late autumn or winter months. This is reinforced by the lack of leaves on the trees and the overall dullness of natural colors, where the landscape is overshadowed by the overwhelming presence of trash.\n\nThere are no people visible in this scene, focusing all attention on the environmental impact of human consumption and waste. This image captures a poignant moment of neglect towards nature, illustrating the harsh reality of waste management and environmental degradation.","title":"Piles of discarded materials containing tin accumulate in the yards of Vulcan Materials.
