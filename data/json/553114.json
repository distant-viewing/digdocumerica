{"path":"553114.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image captures a rural outdoor setting featuring two men and two horses. The scene is composed of a dry grassy field under a bright, clear sky with light clouds. On the left stands a light yellow pickup truck and a cream-colored horse trailer parked on the bare ground. Adjacent to the vehicles, one man, dressed in a plaid shirt, denim jeans, and a cowboy hat, leans against the truck with his arms crossed. To the right, another man in a light-colored shirt, pale pants, and a cowboy hat stands next to a dark chestnut horse. The horse, appearing calm and fitted with a Western saddle, slightly turns its head towards the man. This rural setting and arrangement of subjects evoke a sense of relaxed conversation or a break in a day's work, likely related to horse riding or ranch activities. The overall ambiance points to a classic Western lifestyle or a scene out of cowboy culture.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
