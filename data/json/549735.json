{"path":"549735.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This colorful and dynamic photograph appears to capture a historical reenactment. In the foreground, there is a woman dressed in a wide, full-length period dress adorned with a vibrant floral pattern in yellow, blue, and other colors. She is wearing a white bonnet with her hair tied up, and poised in the act of aiming a rifle. The number \"640\" is prominently displayed on her arm, suggesting her participation in a competitive or organized event.\n\nTo her right stands a man in attire that suggests a military uniform from the mid-19th century, possibly indicative of the American Civil War era. He wears a dark blue jacket, light blue pants, and a darker cap, also with the number \"640\" displayed on his back.\n\nIn the background, other participants can be seen, including one in similar historical attire. There's a hint of smoke in the air near the center, which could be from the firing of weapons or other related activity. The setting is an open grassy area with trees in the far distance, portraying an organized, outdoor historical event. The scene seems lively and is likely part of a reenactment event emphasizing historical accuracy and education.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, June 24, 1973, is held on the Greenfield Village green adjoining the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn.
