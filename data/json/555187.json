{"path":"555187.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense thicket of vegetation, predominantly featuring tall grasses or weeds that are flowering, creating a soft texture throughout the image. The colors are lush, with varying shades of green at the bottom, transitioning to pinks and whites towards the tops of the plants, emphasized by the soft lighting. Several dark, woody branches that appear to be from a fallen or damaged tree contrast starkly with the lighter colors of the vegetation, adding a rough texture and visual complexity to the scene. The background is largely obscured by the dense growth, indicating the picture is taken in a heavily vegetated area, likely a natural or wild environment. The overall feel is somewhat wild and unkempt, typical of a natural, undisturbed setting. The image captures the beauty and intricacies of natural flora, focusing on the interplay of textures and colors.","title":"Fireweed growing on flat ground in a four-year-old clear-cut area in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557098","555042","555093","550459","549232","554993","544884","555040","551370","557191","554983","555007","545716","558088","547540","553084"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["thicket","intricacy","texture","weed","pink","flora","complexity","white","growth","vegetation"]}
