{"path":"553961.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a commercial airplane from Aloha Airlines parked at an airport. The aircraft is predominantly white with a red stripe running down its side, and the name \"Aloha Airlines\" is prominently displayed in bold, black lettering along the fuselage. Just beneath the windows, the plane's registration number, \"N73711,\" is visible. \n\nIn front of the airplane, there is a chain link fence and multiple cars indicating a parking area. A sign that reads \"PUBLIC OVERNIGHT PARKING\" is visible in the bottom left corner, providing guidance for airport visitors. Behind the airplane, a slightly darkened sky suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light conditions can be seen. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the stationary plane and inclusion of parking elements, highlights a common scene at an airport where planes are preparing for or have just completed travels.","title":"Aloha Airlines in one of the two major airlines connecting the islands.
