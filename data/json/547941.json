{"path":"547941.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene at what appears to be a boatyard. In the foreground, there is clutter consisting mainly of discarded items: a rusted barrel with opened paint cans piled on and around it, wooden planks, a plastic bag, empty cans, and other debris scattered about. Two boats on boat stands are centrally and prominently placed in the middle ground of the image. The boat on the left is painted white with a red and navy blue trim near the base. It has a cabin with closed windows and visible equipment on top. The boat to the right has a similar color scheme and design. Both boats are dry docked and display no signs of recent use.\n\nThe background is less focused and discernible details are minimal, but there appear to be other boats and possibly structures related to boat maintenance and storage. The setting suggests a busy working area of the boatyard where maintenance and repairs might be conducted.\n\nThe overall condition and maintenance of the space suggest a lack of cleanliness and order, as indicated by the presence of litter and unkempt surroundings. The atmosphere might imply off-season repairs or a less actively managed facility.","title":"Great Kills Park marina on Staten Island creates a garbage problem","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547955","548688","546802","547957","552128","543409","547961","547012","544181","551985","542911","542875","548105","549306","542873","548422"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["boat","maintenance","repair","can","cleanliness","order","clutter","litter","barrel","stand"]}
