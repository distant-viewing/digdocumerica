{"path":"547494.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image displays the rear view of a classic vintage car, parked and interestingly adorned with two bright red flags, one on each rear end. The car has a prominent two-toned paint job; the main body is a cream or beige color, while the bottom trim, wheel, and tire areas have a darker shade, possibly green or black. The car features chrome detailing, particularly visible in its sizeable, shiny bumper and tail fins, adding to its retro aesthetic. A spare tire is mounted on the back of the vehicle, partially covered with a matching body-colored tire cover.\n\nThe car sports visible tail lights and a chrome decoration below each light, typical of vintage American car designs from the mid-20th century. The vehicle's license plate is from Massachusetts, as evident from the visible text and registration tag. It indicates a historical layer to the car, linking it to a specific state and possibly a specific era. \n\nIn the background, an urban setting is suggested by the presence of railings and another car parked nearby, though details of the further surroundings are obscured, emphasizing the main subject, which is the car itself. The photograph captures an essence of nostalgia and celebrates the distinctive design elements of vintage automobiles.","title":"State pier--600 feet on Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555922","557052","557692","550152","557878","547797","556713","547954","546177","550683","556707","554384","546230","550148","557847","555475"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","tire","tail","chrome","vintage","fins","job","tag","registration","bumper"]}
