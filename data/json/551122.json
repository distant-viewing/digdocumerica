{"path":"551122.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a somber scene at a lakeside or riverbank. The ground is composed of gravel and small stones, with larger rocks and debris distributed unevenly throughout the image. There is visible water erosion at the edge where the ground meets the calm, murky water, suggesting the presence of a water body, possibly a lake or river.\n\nThe focus of the image is distressing as it shows a deceased young animal, resembling a fox, with its fur colored in shades of brown and white. The animal is partially submerged in water near the shore. Surrounding the carcass are various pieces of litter and pollution, including a rusted tin can and what appears to be a discarded piece of foam or a buoy, hinting at environmental neglect.\n\nFoliage partially borders the top left corner, protruding into the scene, which adds a natural element but also underscores the intrusion of human-made objects into natural spaces. Overall, the scene evokes a sense of abandonment and raises concerns about environmental degradation and wildlife impact.","title":"Untreated sewage flows into the kanawha river at glen ferris.
