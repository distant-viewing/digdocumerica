{"path":"550020.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a tragic scene involving two cars that have been involved in a collision. The setting appears to be in a dimly lit area, possibly a garage or an enclosed area with a dark, non-descript background that fades into shadow. \n\nIn the foreground of the image, there are two cars that have sustained significant damage. The car on the left is an older model, seemingly from the mid-20th century, painted in a deep black color. Its front end is heavily damaged; the hood is crumpled, and various components are visibly dislodged or bent. The headlight on this side is missing, and there's visible debris and damage on the chrome bumper. Despite the damage, the windshield seems intact. The car's license plate is bent and partially obscured, but numbers and letters are partially visible.\n\nThe car on the right is a light green color, likely a model from around the 1970s or 1980s, featuring a more contemporary design than the black car. Its front right side is severely crushed, with the hood buckled up to the windshield, indicating the point of impact was likely on this side. The windshield is shattered, and the front tire is intact but the front fender is severely mangled.\n\nThere is no visible presence or indication of people in or around the cars, suggesting the image is focused strictly on the aftermath of the accident. The surfaces of the cars and the ground appear wet, possibly indicating recent rain or that the scene has been cleared with water. There's a sprinkling of what looks like glass or reflective debris across the hood of the green car and the ground, adding to the chaotic and destructive nature of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph documents a severe and destructive car accident, highlighting the substantial damage to both vehicles and the somber mood of the scene.","title":"Auto accident on Storrow Drive, 9 a.m.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["554295","554303","554302","552083","544472","554321","547484","547476","554305","554355","549107","550016","543680","553863","547706","547597"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","damage","windshield","hood","accident","model","buckle","mangle","fender","shatter"]}
