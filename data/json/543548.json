{"path":"543548.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake scene, dominated by a motorboat cruising near the center of the image. The boat, which appears to be a small, sporty model, is moving at speed, creating a trailing wake that ripples across the calm surface of the water. Inside the boat, an individual is visible, likely piloting the vessel.\n\nThe lake itself is surrounded by a dense forest of coniferous trees, suggesting a location in a temperate forested area, possibly in a mountainous region given the presence of snow patches visible on the distant hills in the background. The snow hints that the season might be late spring or early autumn, where snow remains at higher elevations but the lower areas are snow-free.\n\nThe water of the lake reflects the clear blue sky and the trees around its perimeter, creating a mirror-like effect that adds to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall composition of the photograph, with its natural lighting and vibrant colors, evokes a sense of peacefulness and the beauty of an undisturbed natural landscape.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["551207","557253","552222","555693","546976","543626","549417","544195","543531","543579","557562","551219","550674","555704","555703","550324"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["snow","lake","pilot","cruise","perimeter","motorboat","boat","forest","peacefulness","wake"]}
