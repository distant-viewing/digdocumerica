{"path":"554231.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a wooden door that is extensively covered with a dense assortment of stickers of various sizes, shapes, and colors. The stickers feature a wide range of logos, symbols, and text, representing brands, events, and possibly places. Different types of stickers include circular logos, rectangular informational stickers, and uniquely shaped decals. Many stickers appear to be related to automotive brands (such as \"Mazda\" and \"MRP\"), events (\"American Gold Cup Tampa - March 12, '72\"), and products (\"Kodak\"). The stickers range from commercial branding to humorous or cryptic messages. The door itself features a dark, rich wooden finish that can be partly seen around the edges and through gaps between the stickers. The doorknob is visible on the lower left side of the door, without stickers covering it, contrasting with the heavily decorated rest of the door. The overall composition shows a sense of personality or history, hinting at the interests and possibly the travels and activities of the door's owner. The background outside the door is barely visible, maintaining focus on the adorned door.","title":"Ski emblems decorate door of donovans, an apres ski spot","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554368","552511","543986","552467","550008","545006","557081","557217","545821","544113","549870","552463","557148","557922","552932","555477"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sticker","door","brand","logo","decal","owner","branding","event","range","gap"]}
