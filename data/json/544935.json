{"path":"544935.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures a stunning natural rock formation speculated to be from Arches National Park in Utah. The photograph showcases a massive arch composed of sandstone, characterized by layers and striations in shades of red, brown, and beige, suggesting years of geological activity and erosion.\n\nThe arch dominates the frame, sweeping dramatically across the sky from one side to the other. Its underside reveals a beautiful, smooth wear, showcasing the power of natural elements over time. The curvature of the arch creates a dynamic diagonal line that draws the viewerâ€™s eye through the image.\n\nBeneath the arch and to the left of the composition, there are leafy trees, possibly indicating spring or summer, as some trees carry lush, green foliage. These trees add a touch of organic texture and color contrast to the otherwise stark mineral landscape. The clear blue sky visible through the frame of the arch and from behind the trees indicates a fair weather condition, enhancing the warm tones of the rock.\n\nThis photograph not only emphasizes the majesty and awe-inspiring scale of the arch but also provides a vivid example of natural arid landscape and rock formations, inviting exploration and observation of the effects of time and environment on stone.","title":"White Canyon, near the Sipapu Bridge Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544939","545568","545566","545572","553077","545551","545555","545559","545582","545573","545563","545580","545570","545569","545584","545793"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["arch","rock","underside","formation","example","sweep","striation","sandstone","curvature","inspire"]}
