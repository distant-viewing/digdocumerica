{"path":"547767.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic, rural scene that emanates a sense of passive solitude. In the foreground, there's an old, rusted plow laying on dry, sandy soil with sparse vegetation peeking through. The plow, indicative of agricultural labor, draws initial focus due to its prominent placement and contrasting rusty color against the pale ground.\n\nAt the middle ground, behind a humble wire fence, stands a dog. The dog appears to be of a medium build with a light-colored body and darker patches over its eyes and ears, notable for its attentive pose looking straight ahead. This pet adds a living element to an otherwise still and serene environment.\n\nThe background features a white wooden house that exhibits signs of wear, with peeling paint and wooden panels exposed to the elements. A screen door is slightly ajar, suggesting a glimpse into a homey, albeit aged, interior. The house is flanked by large, shadow-casting trees and the entire scene is bathed in natural sunlight, enhancing the textures of the house and the ground.\n\nAltogether, the setting depicts a quiet, possibly abandoned or seldom-used rustic environment, evoking a narrative of past labor and timeless pastoral life. The composition, with its focus on the agricultural implement and the dog before the backdrop of the house, portrays a scene of rural simplicity and tranquility.","title":"Plow and dog on Myrtle Springs Road south of I-20 near Tyler","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["551000","555528","552674","551100","555581","547658","554161","546102","554561","552673","543354","546992","549156","554782","546142","547404"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["dog","plow","house","labor","implement","pet","screen","ear","emanate","placement"]}
