{"path":"557752.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene featuring three individuals engaged in hay baling tasks on a grassy field. A tractor, painted red and partially visible on the right side, is pulling a flat trailer loaded with neatly stacked rectangular hay bales. Atop the trailer, one man, wearing a straw hat and a plaid shirt, stands overseeing or adjusting the hay bales. Another man, wearing a striped red shirt, is in the process of lifting a hay bale onto the trailer. A third man, also in a red shirt, stands by the first man, apparently assisting in organizing or stabilizing the stack of hay bales.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene is a lush, expansive field dotted sparsely with more hay bales, stretching under a slightly cloudy sky. In the distance, a line of dense trees marks the field's boundary, and a house or farm building is faintly visible amidst the trees. The overall atmosphere is one of rural productivity, showcasing a typical farming activity in a pastoral setting.","title":"Hired laborers gather hay on a farm owned by former Georgia governor hardeman who now lives in Florida and has the land managed by an overseer.
