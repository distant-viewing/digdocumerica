{"path":"555590.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The image captures a rural or natural landscape predominantly characterized by rolling hills and dense vegetation. In the foreground, there is a golden brown field, possibly indicative of recently harvested or dry vegetation. The middle portion of the scene features a mix of lush green shrubs or small trees, representing a vivid contrast with the foreground.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a large dragline excavator, which hints at some form of mining or large-scale earth-moving activity occurring within this seemingly natural setting. The excavator, which appears aged and industrial, has a long boom and a large bucket, suggesting its use in extracting material from the earth.\n\nBeyond the immediate focus of the excavator, the landscape rolls into more greenery and eventually fades into a background where a series of electricity pylons stand tall, following the lay of the land into the distant horizon. The presence of these structures introduces a layer of industrial activity and energy distribution, which cuts through the otherwise tranquil and pastoral scene. \n\nThe overall composition of the image presents a juxtaposition between the serene, natural environment and the imposing mechanical and industrial elements introduced by human activity. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, casting a gentle illumination over the entire setting.","title":"Coal tipple in the southeastern Ohio countryside off route","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555588","554829","549255","554815","555633","554804","555569","554807","554764","555629","554763","554769","555634","542553","544139","554811"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavator","introduce","roll","earth","extract","pylon","electricity","distribution","boom","harvest"]}
