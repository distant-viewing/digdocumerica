{"path":"542910.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a coastal village with a maritime foreground and a mountainous background. In the foreground, the calm waters of a bay or harbor are seen, hosting several boats including two sailboats and a larger fishing vessel nearer to a waterline dock facility. This water appears relatively tranquil, reflective of the serene environment.\n\nThe middle ground is densely populated with residential buildings and some larger structures that could be administrative or industrial; they appear vintage in nature, each with distinct roofing often in a shade of red or dark materials. The architecture suggests a historical or established community, characterized with color variations on house exteriors such as whites, reds, and natural wood tones.\n\nThe backdrop presents a large hill or mountain, sloping gently and covered in a blanket of greenery, possibly grassland or low scrub, which looks lush and is likely indicative of a relatively moist, temperate climate. The hill shows some signs of trails or roads cutting across, though they are subtly integrated into the vast natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the scene is typical of a coastal town that heavily relies on its maritime connections for livelihood and recreation, framed by a natural landscape that defines its horizon and adds to the tranquil and picturesque setting. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, adding to the warmth and depth of colors captured in the image.","title":"The hills overlooking Bodega Bay are slated for housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542878","542913","542907","542870","554102","542877","547984","554101","542876","542872","550322","548249","543402","545277","542903","549362"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["waterline","scrub","village","roofing","harbor","blanket","recreation","hill","warmth","bay"]}
