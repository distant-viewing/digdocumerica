{"path":"548761.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures two men engaged in manual labor in an outdoor environment that appears to be a developing or construction site. The setting is characterized by a sandy and rocky terrain. The skies are partly cloudy suggesting a fair weather day, and it's bright outside as indicated by the clear visibility and shadows cast by the objects and people.\n\nThe man in the foreground is wielding a pickaxe and appears to be swinging it down toward the ground, likely in the act of breaking or digging through the tough terrain. He is shirtless, wearing shorts, and appears focused on his task, displaying a gesture of exertion. The other man is bending over a metallic wheelbarrow filled with stones or rubble, preparing to work or organize them. He is also dressed for the task with simple shorts and seems engaged in his work.\n\nThe background features a calm body of water, likely a pond or a small lake, and there are some modest buildings or trailers near the shore, possibly used for storage or as worker accommodations. Vegetation is sparse, fitting the dusty, rocky construction site aesthetic. The overall composition of the photograph, from the positioning of the subjects to the natural and man-made elements, paints a vivid scene of manual labor and construction activity in a rugged environment.","title":"Trailer park under construction at Marathon in the central Florida Keys.
