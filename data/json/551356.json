{"path":"551356.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of broad-leaved plants, likely showcasing a deciduous species identified by their ovate to heart-shaped leaf structure. The leaves exhibit varying shades of green with hints of pink towards the tips and edges, suggesting either a change in season or a characteristic of the plant species. The leaf surface seems to have a waxy sheen and is speckled with small imperfections, possibly indicating natural wear or minor pest damage. \n\nThe arrangement in the frame is denser at the center, where leaves overlap tightly, creating a rich tapestry of colors and textures. As one's eyes move towards the edges of the image, the leaf placement appears slightly more sparse, allowing individual leaf shapes and venation patterns to be more distinguishable. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the natural green hues and illuminating subtle details like leaf veins and minor ridges.\n\nIn the background, shadowed foliage or possibly other plants provide a deeper green contrast, adding depth and emphasizing the foreground leaves. The overall composition is tranquil, focusing entirely on the natural elements without any human-made objects or disturbances, offering a snapshot of flora in a possibly moist, shaded environment commonly found in temperate forested regions or well-maintained botanical settings.","title":"Part of the luxuriant growth on the shore of a lake in the ha ha tonka region","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554744","554993","543620","544731","542688","555041","555040","557593","542686","555093","555192","557539","555037","555019","555042","554743"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leaf","leave","species","plant","imperfection","vein","heart","shape","tapestry","tip"]}
