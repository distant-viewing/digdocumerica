{"path":"546722.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides a bird's-eye view of an intricate roadway system, showing several overlapping layers of transport routes. It features a complex of bridges and tunnels, capturing a moment of urban transit and infrastructure.\n\nAt the top of the image, there is an overpass with several white buses in a line, indicating a likely bus route or rapid transit system. Below this overpass, a highway cuts through the frame, featuring various cars and smaller vehicles in motion, engaging in typical roadway travel. \n\nA stream or small river is visible beneath the bridges, adding a natural element to the urban scene. The river is flanked by green foliage and trees, providing a contrasting touch of nature amidst the concrete structures. \n\nAdditionally, there are small pedestrian pathways next to the river, barely visible under the bridges, hinting at the human scale in this grand infrastructure setup. The photograph captures the interplay of natural and built environments in an urban context, showing how transportation pathways intersect with the natural landscape.","title":"Rock Creek Parkway below overpasses.
