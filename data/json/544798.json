{"path":"544798.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene set within a rustic classroom environment. In the foreground, a woman stands at the left side, facing slightly to the right. She wears glasses, a checkered jacket, and a light-colored blouse. Directly behind her, on the stone wall, hangs a framed black and white portrait of a man wearing historical attire.\n\nThe room is filled with young students seated at old wooden desks. They appear to be listening intently or engaged in a learning activity. These students, both boys and girls, wear casual attire typical of a school setting, such as T-shirts and sweaters.\n\nTo the back and right side of the room, an open door lets in natural light, illuminating part of the interior. The structure of the room is prominently displayed, featuring heavy wooden beams across the ceiling and stone walls that suggest the building's aged character. Additionally, a blackboard is visible on the right wall, though it's not in use at the moment.\n\nOverall, the setting conveys a historical or heritage education scene where the students seem to be engaged in a field trip or a special classroom session designed to explore historical contexts and environments.","title":"Aurora school children at the plains conservation center here students observe former lifestyles of the plains - sod houses frontier Homesteads, etc","placename":"Aurora (Colo.)","location":"Aurora, Colorado","nn1":["558212","558214","548243","544322","552590","554838","546556","543920","543919","552592","545547","558210","548227","554332","546548","558410"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["student","classroom","room","wall","stone","education","let","session","heritage","learning"]}
