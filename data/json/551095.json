{"path":"551095.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people playing baseball on a dirt field in a valley-like setting. The baseball field is surrounded by a mesh fence, and there is a small building or dugout on the left side of the image. Several players can be seen actively engaged in the game, with some in fielding positions and others appearing to be running bases.\n\nIn the background, large industrial machinery and structures are noticeable. There is a substantial pile of coal and several high conveyors, indicating that this area may be near a mining operation. These industrial elements contrast starkly with the recreational activity of baseball happening in the foreground.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of lush green hills, suggesting a rural or semi-rural area. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a soft light over the entire scene, and there appears to be a touch of haze or dust in the air, possibly from the nearby industrial activity. This juxtaposition of a tranquil, traditional American pastime with the harsh industrial environment creates a poignant and somewhat surreal atmosphere.","title":"Glasgow little league field teams come from Rand, Belle and other towns of the kanawha valley.
