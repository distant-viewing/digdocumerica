{"path":"552448.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene featuring several aged buildings that are likely barns or farm storage structures. In the foreground, there is a weathered wooden fence that runs horizontally across the image, leading the viewer's eye towards the buildings. This fence appears to be in a state of disrepair with visible wear and missing sections, adding to the rustic aesthetic of the setting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large barn is positioned slightly off-center. The building has peeling white paint, revealing the weathered wood beneath. This barn has a triangular roof and is directly adjacent to the fence. To the right side, another similar barn is visible, also featuring weathered white paint and a simple, pitched roof design. These buildings display the characteristic architectural features of rural American farm structures.\n\nIn the background, between the two main barns, another smaller building is visible, adding depth to the scene. This smaller structure also matches the overall design and condition of the larger barns.\n\nThe setting is completed with a clear blue sky and green grass, suggesting a sunny, serene day. A solitary tire lies beside the fence on the left, adding a hint of abandonment or long-standing usage of the area.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of rural decay and nostalgia, typical of farmlands that have seen many years of use and exposure to natural elements.","title":"Farm in towanda","placename":"Bloomington (Ill.)","location":"Bloomington, Illinois","nn1":["554821","555612","554782","555627","555577","552515","552462","552537","547658","550019","556963","557946","550693","552536","554561","549194"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","fence","farm","building","paint","beneath","farmland","nostalgia","complete","usage"]}
