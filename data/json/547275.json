{"path":"547275.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts four elderly women outdoors on a sunny day, involved in the activity of holding and presumably examining a large quilt. Each woman is uniquely dressed in brightly colored, patterned outfits typical of leisure wear.\n\nThe quilt they are holding is expansive and adorned with various geometric patterns in a multicolored design, primarily featuring red, white, and beige hues with a solid beige border. \n\nThe background setting is a grassy yard in a rural environment, with a significant presence of tall, green trees and some flowering plants, indicating spring or summer season. A distinctive Victorian-style house with a two-storied structure, blue siding, and white trim is noticeable in the background. This house has architectural features like a pointed roof and rounded, arched windows, contributing to its charming, historic ambiance. The scene is calm and seems to be located in a tranquil, residential area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of social interaction and craft appreciation, set against a serene and picturesque rural backdrop, suggestive of community and cultural traditions.","title":"Members of Fairmont's Golden Circle Senior Citizens Club hold quilt they made.
