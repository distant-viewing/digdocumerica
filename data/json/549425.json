{"path":"549425.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This image captures a vibrant sailing scene with three small sailboats actively racing or cruising on a body of water. Each sailboat has a single sailor; all are clad in sailing attire suitable for water sports, including life vests.\n\nThe central boat, which is the closest to the viewer, has a sailor wearing a red and black wetsuit and cap. This boat's sail is predominantly white with a broad horizontal red stripe, and it displays the sail number \"21856.\" The sailor in this boat is crouched low, actively maneuvering or stabilizing the boat.\n\nTo the left in the background, partly obscured by the main sail of the central boat, is another sailboat with a similar design. Its sail shows a large numeral \"17830\" and a broader combination of green and white colors. The sailor here appears in a darker outfit, probably blue or black. This individual is also engaged in controlling the boat, visible leaning towards one side.\n\nThe surrounding water is relatively calm with slight ripples, suggesting light wind conditions, and the sky above appears mildly overcast, providing a soft, diffused natural light over the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of motion and focus, illustrating the thrill and concentration involved in sailing. The composition skillfully captures the dynamic interaction between the sailors and their environment.","title":"Running before the wind on chesapeake bay in the Annapolis-Newport race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549389","548510","549426","549421","548526","549424","549404","549386","549423","548532","549082","548513","549406","549400","548203","548522"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailor","sail","boat","sailing","sailboat","wetsuit","thrill","cruise","race","stabilize"]}
