{"path":"552001.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph captures a busy multi-lane highway bustling with traffic, including various cars and trucks in motion. The highway stretches horizontally across the image with lanes divided by white markings. Beyond the highway, to the left side of the image, is a significant industrial setting featuring various structures such as tall metal frameworks, spherical tanks, and other metallic infrastructure components that suggest a facility related to power generation or chemical processing.\n\nSeveral high-voltage power lines dominated by tall electrical towers line the background and continue through the right side of the image, emphasizing the industrial nature of the area. In the distance, further reinforcing the image's industrial theme, there are additional factory buildings and industrial structures under a slightly overcast sky.\n\nThe right side of the image shows road signs indicating an exit and a direction to Greenbrook Blvd, helping to contextualize the geographical location and suggesting this photo might have been taken near a significant urban area. The surrounding vegetation on the sides of the road is moderate, with scattered grass and small shrubs, providing a slight contrast to the predominantly industrial and transport-focused scene. The setting implies a moment frozen in daily commute and industrial activity, typical of urban outskirts or industrial districts.","title":"New Jersey Turnpike with Humble Oil Company tanks and high voltage electric towers in the background","placename":"Elizabeth (N.J.)","location":"Elizabeth, New Jersey","nn1":["547569","546612","547785","546608","546686","547811","546681","545455","546726","555437","547770","546713","549902","547780","549890","552719"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["highway","power","voltage","commute","exit","generation","side","outskirt","district","marking"]}
