{"path":"553599.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a foreboding and atmospheric scene in a forest blanketed by mist or smoke. Dominating the foreground is a person dressed in work attire, including a protective jacket and a safety helmet with a camouflage pattern. The individual holds a chainsaw, suggesting they are engaged in tree felling or forestry work.\n\nAround the central figure, there are numerous tree trunks that appear slender and tall, reaching upward and disappearing into the obscured, foggy background. Some trees stand intact, while others are broken or have been freshly cut, as indicated by the sharply pointed stumps nearby.\n\nThe lighting in the image is dim and moody, enhancing the sense of isolation and the slightly eerie quality of the setting. The color palette is subdued, with muted browns, greys, and hints of dark green, reinforcing the solemn nature of the environment and the activity being performed.\n\nOverall, the composition and atmosphere suggest a narrative of tough, possibly solitary work within a challenging environment, highlighted by the dense fog and the forester's focused expression and posture.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" has just cut down a giant tree which the flames had desTroyed. A cloud of soot and ashes billows up from the impact of the tree's fall.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553600","542771","542773","553602","542769","553597","553601","542770","553614","553625","553562","553611","542785","545060","542623","553604"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["work","chainsaw","camouflage","dark","stump","forestry","fog","grey","helmet","narrative"]}
