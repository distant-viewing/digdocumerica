{"path":"547110.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening scene by the water, likely at sunset. The image is bathed in a range of deep to soft pink and blue hues that reflect the time of day. The upper portion of the image is dominated by a sky filled with gentle clouds, artistically tinted by the fading sunlight. Below the sky, the expansive body of water is visible, calm and stretching to the horizon where it meets the sky, reinforcing a sense of tranquility.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, a distinct silhouette of a barge or small ship is outlined against the lighter background of the water. The vessel is lit by small lights, indicating that it might still be operational or moving, even at this hour. To the left and right of the watercraft, several rocky or artificial structures are visible, potentially part of a harbor arrangement or protective sea barriers, designed to break the waves and calm the shore water. In the far background, barely noticeable, are a few seagulls in flight, adding life to this peaceful maritime tableau.\n\nThis image beautifully captures the quiet majesty of a coastal evening, embodying the calm and expansive nature of the setting with a delicate interplay of natural light and shadows.","title":"Barge tug maneuvering behind breakwater at Ludington Consumer Power Plant","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547142","543956","543119","544251","545030","543143","545000","545170","544247","543411","543613","552293","545096","550039","552263","550296"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["evening","watercraft","majesty","seagull","tableau","harbor","barge","flight","water","hour"]}
