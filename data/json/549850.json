{"path":"549850.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a dimly lit urban alley scene focused on a lone man navigating between two large trucks. The man, dressed in a yellow short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, is handling a large, transparent cart filled with boxes, one of which is visibly labeled \"China,\" indicative of either the contentsâ€™ origin or destination. Both trucks flanking him are of a heavy-duty variety, one predominantly rusty orange and the other dark, possibly black, with grime and wear visible on their bodies, suggesting frequent use. The roadway is damp, reflecting some of the ambient light and colors, and adding a slightly glossy texture to the tarmac surface. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows and giving the image a moody atmosphere. This scene likely depicts a moment from everyday urban industrial life, emphasizing themes of labor and the unseen mechanisms that support city living.","title":"Manhattan's garment district on seventh avenue","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549867","547075","557687","557110","552360","547174","556025","549277","547666","546918","549866","546910","544161","549839","550128","548372"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["grime","tarmac","truck","origin","alley","cart","destination","mechanism","duty","roadway"]}
