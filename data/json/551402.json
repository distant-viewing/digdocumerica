{"path":"551402.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime beach gathering centered around a small, blazing fire. The image features three men seated close to the fire, seemingly engaged in a lively conversation. They are dressed in vintage outdoor clothing, predominantly shiny jackets, which suggest the photo could be from an earlier decade. The two men to the right are wearing red jackets, while the man on the left is in a dark-colored jacket.\n\nIn the foreground, two large sculptural objects resembling jellyfish or sea creatures, constructed with wire and possibly lights, are prominent and lend an artistic or celebratory element to the scene. These structures stand tall in the sand, set in what appear to be pots, possibly used as stands.\n\nBehind the group, several other partially visible individuals are gathered, dressed warmly for the evening. There are a few more elements scattered around the sand, such as cans and a bucket, which contribute to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of a social gathering.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a candid moment of enjoyment and social interaction, enhanced by creative lighting and the unique setting of a beach at night.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
