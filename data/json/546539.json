{"path":"546539.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features an architectural view where a modern building dominates the right-hand side of the frame. The building is notable for its repeating pattern of vertical, sloped concrete slats that contribute both to its texture and to the play of light and shadow on its surface. Below these slats are large windows, suggesting the building's use as a public or office space.\n\nTo the left of the image and in the background, there is a landscaped area with green grass and several young, leafy trees. A man is walking through this area, dressed in dark clothing, which provides a human element to the otherwise structural scene. In the midground, there are two round-topped street lamps, contributing to the urban atmosphere.\n\nIn the far background, somewhat central to the image but at a significant distance, is a large classical building, possibly an institution or government building, featuring a prominent, tall tower. This building's older, more ornate architectural style contrasts with the modernist approach of the building in the foreground.\n\nThe sky appears clear and the overall lighting suggests it's a bright, sunny day, casting sharp shadows and enhancing colors, especially the greens of the grass. The composition, with its mix of architecture, nature, and human presence, captures a dynamic urban environment.","title":"Cummins Engine Company research building","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546481","546506","546531","546542","546464","546473","546485","557267","551653","549317","551493","546521","557271","546535","546518","553537"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["slat","building","institution","government","approach","grass","lamp","midground","office","play"]}
