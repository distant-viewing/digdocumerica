{"path":"547629.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a narrow coastal strip, showcasing a diverse geographical layout from a high altitude. The scene is a blend of natural and built environments characterized by the following elements:\n\n1. **Coastal Line**: The photo captures a long stretch of beach bordering the ocean, with waves gently breaking against the shore. The sandy beach is relatively pristine in several areas, bordered by a clear blue ocean on one side. \n\n2. **Inland Water Bodies**: Adjacent to the ocean, there appear to be multiple bays or lagoons interspersed with patches of land and wetlands. These are primarily clustered in the upper middle and left side of the image.\n\n3. **Residential and Developed Areas**: Towards the bottom of the image, there is a structured layout of what seems to be a residential area. This includes rows of houses or mobile homes closely packed together, arranged neatly in lines. These houses are surrounded by roads and small patches of vegetation.\n\n4. **Roadways**: A main road runs parallel to the beach, separating the residential areas from the sandy shores. Smaller roads or paths can be seen weaving through the residential zones.\n\n5. **Vegetation**: The areas surrounding the water bodies and the residential zones have patches of green, suggesting grasslands or shrubbery, which adds a touch of natural element amidst the built environment.\n\n6. **Background Landscape**: In the distance, the landscape fades into a haze, possibly indicating a mix of land and water bodies extending into the horizon. The topography seems to show more natural terrain compared to the developed foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a vivid depiction of human settlements in close proximity to nature, illustrating the interaction between coastal life and residential development. The varying shades of blue, green, and sandy tones provide a colorful palette that highlights the diverse environment.","title":"Barrier beaches","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["554018","543427","557453","548628","554156","548629","554157","557451","557504","554057","554022","553983","557452","553982","547508","557429"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","beach","layout","zone","lagoon","shore","road","patch","house","grassland"]}
