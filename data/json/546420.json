{"path":"546420.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a modern residential complex. The image shows several high-rise buildings, likely apartment blocks, characterized by their brutalist architectural style with stark, geometric lines and extensive use of concrete. These buildings are organized in a somewhat clustered layout, enhancing the sense of density in the residential area.\n\nThe closest building in the foreground features a distinct design with a partial red and white façade, making it stand out from the predominantly gray color scheme of the surrounding buildings. The other buildings in the complex have balconies that stick out, providing a repetitive visual pattern across their façades.\n\nAround these residential towers, there are roads that appear fairly quiet with a few cars, suggesting a controlled traffic flow within the complex. A parking lot is visible with several cars parked, indicating the presence of residents or visitors at the time the photograph was taken.\n\nThe background of the image shows a mix of open spaces and some low-rise structures. The area beyond the residential complex appears less developed, with visible patches of green and dirt, which might indicate ongoing construction or undeveloped land. The absence of bustling activity suggests this area is either newly built or in a more isolated location.","title":"New apartment buildings","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556183","546416","548022","548424","553673","552730","548374","548425","553920","544629","556178","553693","550547","552728","546715","549972"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["complex","façade","building","resident","rise","apartment","scheme","stick","balcony","concrete"]}
