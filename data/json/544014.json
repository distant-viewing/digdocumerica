{"path":"544014.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene within an industrial factory setting, likely specializing in metalwork or material processing, implied by the presence of copper sheets and various machinery. The factory is expansive, with a large dark ceiling crisscrossed by an array of steel beams and supported by several vertical columns, providing an architectural element that suggests strength and resilience. The environment is illuminated by large windows and numerous overhead lights, creating patches of brightness that highlight the activity below.\n\nIn the foreground and middle of the image, multiple workers are engaged in tasks related to handling and processing sheets of copper. The main subject, a worker wearing a blue shirt and beige pants, is in the act of moving a large, flat sheet of copper, guiding it into a standing metal rack designated for holding such materials. His posture and the motion blur suggest the heaviness and physical effort involved in the task. Another worker, wearing differet colored clothing and a helmet, is standing nearby, overseeing or waiting to perform a subsequent step in the process.\n\nAround these central figures, the environment is densely packed with industrial tools and materials. There are several racks and makeshift tables filled with similar copper sheets, some stacked flat while others are stored vertically within partitioned sections of the racks. The floor appears to be concrete, functional and unadorned, suited to the industrial activities taking place.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of organized chaos typical of active manufacturing sites, where every item and person has a specific purpose towards producing or processing the factory's output. The composition, filled with lines and textures—from the steel beams overhead to the stacked copper and protective gear of the workers—creates a visual impression of robust, ongoing industrial endeavor.","title":"Desert 70 miles west of Phoenix","placename":"Congress (Ariz.)","location":"Congress, Arizona","nn1":["544026","544053","544018","544153","544826","544001","557388","554431","544331","546036","556314","544022","544048","549723","549694","546757"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["sheet","rack","worker","factory","steel","beam","material","processing","metalwork","output"]}
