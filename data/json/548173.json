{"path":"548173.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a gas station. The primary focus is a fuel pump with a prominent white sign that reads \"REGULAR\" with a handwritten note attached stating \"NO GAS.\" Below this central signage, there are additional, smaller details, such as a date sticker marked \"9 OCT\" and several promotional stickers, including one featuring a cartoonish lion character.\n\nIn the foreground, a metal trash can appears to the right, and there's a partially visible red-colored hose running across the ground. To the right of the pump, a red and white striped pole stands with a sign that reads \"STOP MOTOR NO SMOKING.\" Furthermore, there's another fuel pump, more distantly placed in the scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of the gas station, the background features a rather subdued neighborhood scene with a street extending into the distance. A yellow car is visible, driving away from the viewpoint, and houses line the street on the left side of the image. The general ambiance is typical of a cloudy, overcast day with enough lighting to cast mild shadows on the ground.\n\nOverall, the photo suggests a mundane day at a gas station captured during a period of fuel shortage, as evidenced by the \"NO GAS\" sign, and gives a glimpse into urban life possibly during the late 20th century, evoked by the style and design of the objects and vehicles present.","title":"Gas shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548171","548053","548169","555489","548174","555405","555465","555485","548049","555415","555434","555484","548047","550103","555467","555452"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","fuel","pump","sticker","station","no","smoking","shortage","date","sign"]}
