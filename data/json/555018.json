{"path":"555018.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a lush forest underbrush with a focus on various types of moss and lichen. The foreground is dominated by intricate structures of grey-blue lichen, which seem to spring up in column-like formations. These lichen branches are covered in fine, frosty textures that stand out against the darker background.\n\nSurrounding the lichen, there is a rich tapestry of green moss, which appears soft and dense, adding a vivid contrast to the muted colors of the lichen. The moss displays a range of green shades from bright lime to deeper forest green.\n\nIn the back, out of focus, there are hints of other vegetation, possibly small plants or the bases of larger flora, indicated by reddish-brown stalks that might be stems or small branches, slightly blurred presumably due to a shallow depth of field used in the photography.\n\nThe overall composition creates a microcosmic view into the forest's ground layer, emphasizing textures and colors that are often overlooked in broader landscapes. The lighting appears natural and dim, suggesting an overcast day or a shaded environment under thick foliage, enhancing the moisture-associated elements like moss and lichen in this habitat.","title":"Moss and lichen growing on a decaying Douglas fir at Green Mountain, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555026","554571","555025","543147","545271","554985","555058","555183","555054","554993","554991","555057","545285","554980","555000","554554"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["lichen","moss","forest","basis","underbrush","branch","stalk","tapestry","stem","photography"]}
