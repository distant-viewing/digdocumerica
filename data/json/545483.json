{"path":"545483.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up of a hand holding a large, fossil-like object. The object appears to be a section of a vertebra from a large animal, possibly a dinosaur, given its size and shape. It has a roughly circular form with a large, central hole and several protrusions that might be processes or spines of the vertebra.\n\nThe fossil is prominently textured, showcasing a detailed, cracked surface that indicates considerable age and fossilization. The colors on the fossil range from white to beige, with darker lines running through, suggesting sediment layers or mineral deposits.\n\nThe person holding the fossil is visible only in part, with the focus on their hand, which is dark-skinned. Only the fingers and thumb clasping the fossil are shown, with one hand securely supporting it from below. The background of the photograph is out of focus but hints at a dimly lit indoor setting with earthy tones, emphasizing the paleontological or archaeological context of the image. The overall composition focalizes the fossil, highlighting its historical and scientific interest.","title":"Enlarged lung of emphysema victim.
