{"path":"557603.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and mystical nighttime landscape. The composition is centered around a bright celestial body, likely the moon, which shines vividly against a dark sky. It casts a striking starburst effect, possibly due to the camera's aperture settings, which makes the light appear to radiate in four pointed beams.\n\nBelow the celestial body, a dense, wispy layer of fog hugs a valley nestled between darkened mountain silhouettes. The fog is illuminated from above, creating a gentle contrast with the surrounding darkness. Adding to the scene's ethereal quality, the celestial light is reflected in a narrow, winding body of water in the foreground. This reflection forms a bright, shimmering path on the water's surface, drawing the viewer's eye towards the lower third of the image.\n\nThe overall ambiance is quiet and tranquil, evoking a sense of solitude and stillness. The photograph uses natural contrasts and the interplay of light and shadow to create a dramatic and somewhat enigmatic nighttime scene in a mountainous landscape.","title":"The nitinat river flowing through timberland on vancouver island, british Columbia.
