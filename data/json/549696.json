{"path":"549696.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast car storage lot filled with numerous rows of new vehicles, mostly depicting cars from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s based on their design. The lot is organized in a grid-like structure with multiple levels of parking racks elevating the cars to maximize space. The cars vary in color, including shades of blue, red, white, yellow, and more, creating a colorful mosaic.\n\nThe facility looks operational and densely packed, suggesting it might be a hub for manufacturing or distribution of vehicles. There are simple buildings and infrastructure like poles and fences visible between sections of parked cars, possibly for maintaining order and providing necessary facilities for the operation of the lot.\n\nForegrounding the image is a shadowed area which makes it evident that the viewpoint is elevated, possibly from a nearby building or structure, offering a broad and comprehensive view of the storage area. The lighting in the image is bright, indicating a sunny day, casting sharp shadows that enhance the regimented linearity of the parked cars and racks.","title":"Fob Detroit--New cars are loaded onto railroad cars at Lasher and I-75.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["542635","546813","546900","547686","547469","546879","547480","547742","553303","555748","554349","553896","549688","556721","546685","548432"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","lot","rack","storage","order","distribution","facility","hub","viewpoint","manufacturing"]}
