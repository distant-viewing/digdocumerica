{"path":"546551.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in a seemingly urban setting featuring two people by a construction site on a wet day, observable by the wet pavement. A middle-aged man in a white long-sleeve shirt and dark pants stands confidently with his arms crossed in front of a construction barricade that prominently displays curious hand-drawn graphics of various sets of eyes and phrases like \"SIDEWALK SUPT\", \"WOMEN'S LIB\", \"SMALL FRY\", and \"K-9\". To his right, an older man with a cap leans on the barricade, looking off to the side, barely interacting with the other man.\n\nAbove them hangs a large blue sign that reads \"THE NEW HOME OF CITIZENS SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION\" amidst details about the construction project, including involved companies and engineers. Behind the barricade is the framework of a building in progress, featuring steel and plywood elements, suggesting the early stages of the construction. A traffic light showing a red light for pedestrians adds to the urban feel of the scene, indicating a controlled intersection.\n\nThe photograph is suffused with a slightly overcast light, hinting at recent or impending rain, which emphasizes the reflective wet surfaces and adds a moody, textural quality to the image. The scene captures a juxtaposition of casual, everyday human presence against the backdrop of urban development and architectural change.","title":"Bank construction along Washington street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546445","544968","553887","545520","553558","544959","557907","544969","553246","549665","551856","549292","545351","552781","543890","551933"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["barricade","construction","suffuse","engineer","phrase","progress","company","pavement","intersection","pedestrian"]}
