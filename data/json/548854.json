{"path":"548854.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic scene where large plumes of black smoke are rising from a fire in an open field area. The foreground shows a vibrant green grassy expanse, contrasting sharply with the heavy, dark smoke in the background. The fire appears to be consuming multiple points; one prominent area on the left has red flames visible, indicating the intensity of the blaze.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a small group of individuals, possibly firefighters or emergency responders, can be seen near a tractor towing a white tank, potentially containing water or fire retardant. A variety of structures, possibly including farm buildings or industrial equipment, and standard utility poles extend into the distance, forming a blurry background due to likely heat and smoke distortion.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of urgency and disaster management in what might be a rural or semi-rural setting. The color contrast, scale of the fire, and the responders' efforts to manage the situation are the key elements in this composition. The large amount of smoke suggests a significant incident, potentially hazardous, impacting air quality and visibility.","title":"Burning a field near El Centro.
