{"path":"545030.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and picturesque sunset over a coastal landscape. The dominant feature of the image is an expansive body of water that reflects the myriad colors of the sky at dusk, ranging from deep blue and purple to golden yellow and light orange, suggesting the sun is setting. Toward the horizon, the sky is decorated with soft, scattered clouds that are subtly illuminated by the sun's fading light.\n\nIn the foreground, a silhouette of lush, dense foliage is visible, suggesting that the viewpoint is from a higher elevation, possibly a hill or the upper part of a slope. This vegetation is dark against the sky, contributing to the layered visual depth of the scene.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows human activities and structures: there are piers or jetties extending into the water, and small buildings or huts can be seen at the ends of these structures and on stilts above the water surface. These features indicate some form of aquatic or fishing activity, possibly a small fishing community.\n\nOn the left side of the picture, at a greater distance, there are larger industrial structures, likely cranes, used for shipping or handling cargo, hinting at a commercial port area. These cranes stand tall against the skyline, and their appearance contrasts with the natural and small-scale human elements seen elsewhere in the image.\n\nThe calm water and the presence of both natural and man-made elements create a harmonious blend, capturing a moment of tranquility at the end of the day in a coastal environment. The overall mood is peaceful and reflective, emphasized by the soft light and shadow interplay.","title":"Sunset at the river mouth of the Columbia River between Astoria, Oregon and the state of Washington","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545000","545019","544707","545022","550296","548123","552263","552335","547110","552230","553989","543143","547147","557447","543956","543144"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["end","crane","fishing","hut","stilt","sun","jetty","shipping","port","water"]}
