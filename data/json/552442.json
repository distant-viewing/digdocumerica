{"path":"552442.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph presents a picturesque natural landscape dominated by two prominent hills or mountains with unusually vibrant red and orange striations, highlighting their geological composition. These hills occupy the middle and far background of the image, casting a majestic aura over their surroundings.\n\nThe foreground features a lush, grassy meadow dotted with numerous wildflowers, primarily white with visible yellow centers. The meadow appears rich and dense, indicating a healthy, vibrant ecosystem. A few taller green plants or shrubs intersperse among the flowers, adding variety and depth to the vegetation.\n\nThe environment suggests a serene, possibly remote location, with no signs of human activity or structures visible. The clear blue sky above further accentuates the vivid colors of the hills and provides a stark contrast to the earth tones below.\n\nOverall, the composition balances the vivid foreground filled with flora against the dramatic, textured backdrop of the hills, creating a harmoniously layered natural landscape.","title":"Mountain of clay and shale marks site of an abandoned deep mine near the town of Standard.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["550437","549225","555666","545723","555589","549228","550439","545703","544881","549134","544581","549155","550441","550478","550477","553994"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","hill","striation","aura","wildflower","flora","ecosystem","shrub","flower","earth"]}
