{"path":"556596.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a group of men, likely part of a fire department or emergency response team, gathered around a variety of tools and equipment during a daytime outdoor scenario. The setting includes a grassy area with trees in the background and a partially cloudy sky overhead.\n\nIn the foreground, there are numerous pieces of equipment spread out, suggesting a sort of staging area or supply cache. Notable items include hoses, a fire extinguisher, wooden blocks, ropes, and other tools possibly used for rescue operations. There is also a metal box with cables and various handles visible.\n\nSeveral men in navy blue uniforms and white helmets are seen. Some helmets display names, indicating individual identification or perhaps squad names like \"Crays,\" which is visible on one helmet. The men are engaged in different activities; one man is adjusting his helmet, another is looking at something in his hands, while others are conversing or overseeing the equipment. \n\nVehicles, including a blue and white truck and a silver car, are in the background, adding to the sense of an organized response effort. The overall impression is one of professionals prepared for an emergency response, with a focus on readiness and teamwork.","title":"Members of the peabody coal company team don their equipment in preparation for the Kentucky state mine safety contest at benham, near Cumberland, in harlan county.
