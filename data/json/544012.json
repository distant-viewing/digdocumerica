{"path":"544012.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an abstract view, seemingly taken from a low angle, looking upwards through a structure with irregular geometric shapes. The focus is on the negative spaces framed by dark silhouetted forms, likely parts of a modern architectural design, possibly an outdoor installation or a building with an intricate facade or canopy.\n\nThe composition primarily consists of multiple triangular and trapezoidal openings, which reveal fragments of a sky filled with clouds, tinted with hues ranging from bluish-gray to a soft cream or light orange, indicating a time around sunset or sunrise. Small, bright points possibly from light fixtures or reflections are scattered across the darker areas, enhancing the contrast between the solid dark forms and the soft expansiveness of the sky.\n\nNo people or moving objects are visible in this scene; the photograph presents a quiet moment focusing on the interplay of constructed forms and natural elements. The wires or thin structures that diagonally cross some of the openings add a subtle detail to the otherwise stark geometrical patterns, contributing to an overall sense of depth and perspective in the image.","title":"Smelter stack at Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["557333","548649","555329","557391","553839","553278","549880","546481","546472","557310","546531","546480","557318","542766","555714","549317"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["opening","form","expansiveness","fragment","fixture","cream","installation","sunrise","wire","orange"]}
