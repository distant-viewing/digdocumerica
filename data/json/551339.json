{"path":"551339.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This historic photograph captures a large construction scene focused on the development of a hydroelectric station by the Union Electric Light & Power Co., part of the Osage Development. It dates from October 10, 1930, a fact confirmed by the inscription in the image mentioning the engineering firm Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation along with the builders.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a high vantage point on an east hillside, which provides a sweeping overview of the site. The construction area extends across a large swath of land bordered by a body of water. Multiple cranes and extensive scaffolding dominate the scene, reflecting the scale and intensity of the construction work. At the center and right of the image, a massive concrete structure, possibly part of the dam, is visible with several layers evident from the construction progress.\n\nTo the left and throughout the site, smaller buildings, construction equipment, piles of materials, and various mechanical structures can be seen. These elements suggest the logistical complexities typical of such a large-scale engineering project.\n\nIn the background, across the water, gently rolling hills stretch into the distance, providing a stark contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial activity at the forefront. This juxtaposition highlights the transformative impact of such a project on its surrounding environment.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively conveys the magnitude of the hydroelectric station construction and the substantial human effort and engineering expertise involved in such an endeavor.","title":"Bagnell Dam under construction is shown in this old photograph, dated October 10, 1930.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["542516","548930","548145","553392","549004","550743","550701","548024","548922","548008","548007","545858","548920","548013","549498","545631"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["construction","engineering","project","station","swath","expertise","magnitude","inscription","site","scaffolding"]}
