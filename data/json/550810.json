{"path":"550810.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This is a serene and picturesque photograph depicting an outdoor scene. In the foreground, there are several yellow wildflowers and a bunch of scattered rocks at the edge of a body of water. The morning or evening light softly illuminates the delicate petals of the flowers, creating a gentle yet vivid contrast against the darker tones of the rocks.\n\nFloating gently on a very calm and reflective lake is a small boat with four individuals engaged in fishing. They are facing away from the camera, which contributes a sense of peace and anonymity to the scene. They are outfitted in casual, warm clothing and hats, suitable for a cool day outdoors. One of the individuals is actively casting a fishing line into the water, indicating the recreational activity they are involved in.\n\nThe lake itself is still, with a mirror-like surface that reflects the gentle hues of the sky and the dense, forested landscape that surrounds the water. The trees in the background are dense and thick, likely coniferous, indicative of a boreal or temperate forest setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of tranquility and leisure, emphasized by the natural beauty and the evident enjoyment of a quiet fishing outing. The composition, with its inclusion of the vibrant foreground flowers and the tranquil background, skillfully captures the essence of a peaceful retreat into nature.","title":"Fishing on the Wisconsin river at merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551350","550217","552313","552317","550000","544274","549935","555576","543579","552982","554516","557563","553082","542564","551680","549933"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["fishing","anonymity","temperate","flower","lake","retreat","inclusion","wildflowers","peace","rock"]}
