{"path":"544492.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene featuring several elements. The foreground includes a trio of white birds, possibly egrets, in flight. They are captured in various stages of ascent, focused towards the left of the frame, showing spread wings and elongated legs.\n\nIn the middle ground, a distinctive red and white sign stands prominently, conveying a humorous and colloquial message that reads \"Y'ALL PLEASE SLO DOWN SET EM' LIVE\". The phrasing and style of the sign suggest it might be designed to promote traffic safety in a playful or vernacular manner, typical perhaps of the Southern United States.\n\nFurther in the background, there is a cow, predominantly black, standing quietly and facing towards the sign. The cow is partially obscured by tall, wild grass that lines the fence running parallel to the road.\n\nThe scene is set in a wide, open pasture, implying a sense of spacious rural life. The sky is clear and blue, indicating good weather conditions. Overall, the composition contrasts the natural elements with a human-made safety message, blending wildlife and humor in a pastoral setting.","title":"Sign","placename":"Clewiston (Fla.)","location":"Clewiston, Florida","nn1":["544488","544484","550833","546102","554560","557202","545153","549214","554070","547290","548984","555635","553100","542627","557012","555645"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","message","safety","egret","ascent","pasture","sign","promote","wing","flight"]}
