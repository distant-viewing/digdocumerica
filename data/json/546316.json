{"path":"546316.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman engaged in outdoor fieldwork, specifically wading in a waterlogged area dense with tall grasses, likely a wetland or marsh. She has long blond hair and is dressed in practical outdoor clothingâ€”a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and presumably waterproof pants, although only her upper body is clearly visible. The woman is actively interacting with the environment; she's bent over slightly and appears to be examining or handling a clump of wetland plants or mud, which she holds in her hands.\n\nHer expression is focused and slightly strained, possibly indicating concentration or effort. The wind appears to be blowing her hair slightly, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The background is densely filled with similar grasses and reeds, suggesting a remote natural setting. The lighting indicates either a sunny or slightly overcast day, enhancing the natural, earthy tones of the surroundings. The overall composition of the image and the activities depicted underscore themes of environmental study or conservation work, suggesting the woman could be a scientist or researcher conducting fieldwork.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory biologist on a field trip to a salt marsh.
