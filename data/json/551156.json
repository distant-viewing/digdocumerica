{"path":"551156.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a sprawling complex of factories and machinery. In the foreground, a river or waterway lined with rocks and grass gently curves around the scene. Beyond the water, the industrial complex is densely packed with metallic towers, piping, large cylindrical tanks, and buildings of various sizes. Several smokestacks rise above the structures, emitting plumes of smoke or steam into the sky. The background is composed of a hillside with lush green vegetation, suggesting this complex is situated in a valley or a river basin. The sky is a dusky blue, indicating either early morning or late evening light, which casts a moody hue over the entire scene. Various shades of grey, silver, and muted colors dominate the industrial structures, contrasting with the brighter greenery in the distance. The overall composition shows a juxtaposition of industrial activity against a natural backdrop.","title":"Evening view of the monsanto and fmc chemical companies at Nitro on the kanawha river, seen from interstate 64","placename":"Charleston (W.
