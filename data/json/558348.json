{"path":"558348.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of someone actively engaged in the intricate task of cake decoration. The focus is on a hand (seeming to belong to an older adult due to visible signs of aging and work-experienced skin) skillfully manipulating a piping bag to create a delicate blue rose from icing. The icing rose on the hand highlights refined craftsmanship and attention to detail, exhibiting neatly layered petals.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a cake adorned with other similar decorations such as yellow and white icing flowers, with red floral decorations adding a pop of color. This setup suggests that the person is possibly working in a bakery setting or during a cake decorating session, where various tools and techniques are used to embellish baked goods attractively.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the art of confectionery and could be reflective of a professional environment or a passionate hobbyist demonstrating their expertise in cake artistry. The photograph exudes a sense of careful concentration and showcases the beauty of edible craft.","title":"Closeup of a rosette made by German immigrant Hans Strzyso who is chief baker at Madsens Supermarket.
