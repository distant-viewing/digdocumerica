{"path":"546726.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a busy, multilane highway in an urban area. The highway has a slight curvature and is heavily trafficked, with numerous cars visible along its length suggesting either rush hour or traffic congestion. Below and adjacent to the highway, there are several other roads and parking areas filled with parked cars, especially white vans congregated in one section â€“ likely a business or service facility's parking.\n\nSurrounding the highway, an assortment of buildings can be seen, including residential apartments, commercial buildings, and possibly industrial facilities. Notably, a prominent brick chimney stands out among these structures, suggesting the presence of an industrial facility or a power plant.\n\nThe area is densely built with a mix of architectures indicating a possibly older urban fabric interlaced with newer developments. Green spaces are sparse but visible, adding a touch of natural contrast to the predominantly grey concrete and asphalt landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures the bustling vibrancy and complexity of urban life, emphasizing themes of transportation, urban infrastructure, and density.","title":"Whitehurst freeway, looking east","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546608","546617","547780","547770","546713","546681","547764","555781","546686","546678","553838","546616","546707","553001","548363","546709"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","facility","parking","congregate","curvature","congestion","asphalt","van","parked","apartment"]}
