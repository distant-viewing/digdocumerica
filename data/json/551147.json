{"path":"551147.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene river scene with a focus on leisure and cityscape. A large, multi-level pleasure boat is central in the image, floating on a calm body of water. The boat is modern and seems to be equipped for leisure activities, with people visible on its decks enjoying the day. The passengers appear relaxed, some standing and others sitting, likely taking in the views.\n\nIn the blurred background, a grand architectural structure dominates the skyline. This building, resembling a state capitol with its large dome and classical design, provides an elegant backdrop. It suggests that the river is likely in a city with historical and administrative significance.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, part of another structure juts into view, possibly a dock or another boat, but it is cut off, so details are limited.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and leisurely, capturing a moment of enjoyment against a backdrop that blends natural and urban elements. The lighting suggests it might be midday, given the brightness of the scene and the haze that slightly shrouds the distant buildings, softening the urban landscape.","title":"Pleasure boat leaves the Kanawha City docks for a cruise down the Kanawha River.
