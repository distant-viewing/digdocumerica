{"path":"545114.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a vast, marshy wetland area characterized by a complex network of waterways. The intricate pattern of the rivers and streams creates a beautiful natural mosaic, reminiscent of tree branches spreading across the landscape. The water bodies are dark in contrast to the lighter green color of the wetlands. In the distance, a blue lake accompanied by a mountain range can be seen, adding depth and contrast to the scene.\n\nThe upper section of the image reveals slightly clouded skies that cast soft shadows on the ground, while the horizon line demarcates the separation between the lake and the sky subtly. The viewing angle suggests the shot was taken from an elevated perspective, likely from an airplane, as hinted by the slight hint of an aircraft structure in the lower left corner of the image.\n\nThis type of landscape appears to be a pristine environment, potentially indicating a remote or protected area. The diverse water paths look like they support a rich array of wildlife, important for ecological studies or conservation efforts. The overall composition of the photograph is both stunning and informative, showcasing the unique beauty and structure of natural wetland ecosystems.","title":"Columbia River estuary","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["544786","544649","550601","544773","544760","550569","550531","544757","557498","552924","544506","550544","550644","547488","545033","544556"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","separation","lake","airplane","aircraft","conservation","study","wildlife","stream","waterway"]}
