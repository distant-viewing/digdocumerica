{"path":"543471.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene set in front of an aged, rustic building, which houses \"The Old Forneletti's,\" indicated by the faded sign above the entrance. The structure's wooden facade shows signs of wear and history, painted in a muted color with peeling and weathered planks. The ground-level features a couple of large shop windows and a white wooden door, surrounded by older style brick pavement.\n\nIn front of the building, several individuals are engaged in casual conversation. To the left, two people dressed in bright, polka-dot patterned clothing are standing next to a vintage white Chevrolet Chevelle. This car adds a touch of classic American culture to the scene, featuring clean and well-maintained chrome details. The person closest to the car is barefoot, further reflecting a laid-back, communal atmosphere.\n\nTo the right, a group includes two men and a woman who appear to be interacting with an elderly gentleman in glasses, who is dressed in a blue shirt and grey pants and stands by a cardboard box possibly containing goods or deliveries. The younger man in the denim jacket and jeans has a casual demeanor, leaning against a traffic signpost with relaxed posture.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, the choice of attire, and the presence of the vintage car set against a weathered building, contribute to a scene that feels both historical and intimate, possibly harkening back to the 1960s or 70s, evoking a sense of nostalgia and community spirit.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["556214","545353","545350","555944","557684","551084","557805","545333","552412","556564","557655","545351","552965","545326","551119","552602"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["gentleman","signpost","car","delivery","spirit","70","choice","nostalgia","front","cardboard"]}
