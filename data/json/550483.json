{"path":"550483.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features an up-close image of a rugged and uneven pile of rocks. The rocks are of varying shades, primarily tones of dark grey and black, many speckled with lighter markings that appear white or light grey. These markings could be mineral deposits or lichen. Among the rocks, there is a notable contrast provided by a patch of moss or a similar plant, displaying a vibrant yellowish-green color. This patch of moss is nestled in a crevice between the rocks, adding a natural touch of color to the otherwise monochromatic rock surfaces. The texture of the rocks is rough and jagged, indicating they might be of a volcanic origin or simply weathered by natural elements. The focus and lighting in the photograph highlight the intricate textures and variety present in the small ecosystem, capturing the interplay between the organic and inorganic components.","title":"Caribou lichen growing in the talus at the foot of peak 5308 common to all alpine and arctic environments along the route","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["552546","550474","555182","555027","554410","550475","545589","554594","543549","543421","544440","550476","544435","543147","543151","558083"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","marking","moss","ligh","grey","origin","lichen","crevice","deposit","speckle"]}
