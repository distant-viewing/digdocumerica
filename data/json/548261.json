{"path":"548261.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside an urban subway train, likely from an earlier decade given the style and condition of the train. It prominently features a subway car door and windows, with graffiti covering much of the exterior in various styles and colors such as black, white, and blue.\n\nThrough the window of the subway car, three individuals can be clearly seen seated together; they appear to be in conversation or engaging with each other. The individuals exude a sense of casual interaction, typical of passengers finding themselves in close quarters on public transit. Their attire suggests a more formal period, possibly indicative of urban professional or formal personal attire from the late 20th century.\n\nThe subway car itself is painted in a muted color, possibly a faded blue or green, and is significantly worn and marked by extensive graffiti, reflecting a common urban condition in certain eras and locations where subway cars became canvasses for street art.\n\nThe image also carries a cinematic feel due to its slight blurring and the lighting contrasts, likely from natural light filtering through the subway station and reflecting off various surfaces. Above the subway car door, a sign indicates the train's direction or terminal point, but the text is partially obscured, suggesting movement or a focus shift inherent in candid photography.\n\nOverall, the photograph is evocative of a specific time and place within the urban landscape, characterized by the gritty aesthetic of the subway environment intermingled with human interaction.","title":"Many subway cars in New York City have been spray-painted by vandals.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556811","554324","554325","556814","548258","556669","556652","548256","556653","556813","548273","548263","556690","554326","553823","556665"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["subway","car","graffiti","train","quarter","door","shift","filtering","art","photography"]}
