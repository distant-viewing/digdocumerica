{"path":"544501.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a young bird, likely a heron chick, situated in a nest amidst a dense thicket of branches and foliage. The chick appears fluffy with soft white down, and its beak is open as if calling out or breathing heavily, indicating either vocalization or respiration activity. The bird's eyes have a wild and alert expression. Surrounding the chick are dark and rigid branches that form a part of the nest structure, along with some green leaves scattered around that suggest the nest is placed in a tree in a lush area. The background is slightly blurred, placing full focus on the chick and providing a deep contrast that highlights the bird against the darker foliage behind it. The lighting in the image casts a natural, bright light on the chick and parts of the branches, bringing out textures and enhancing the detail of the scene.","title":"Baby egret in nest","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544505","544513","553876","548497","548505","544489","544477","548490","548493","544547","548885","555010","544539","549231","545214","544222"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","branch","heron","thicket","beak","foliage","part","leave","eye","expression"]}
