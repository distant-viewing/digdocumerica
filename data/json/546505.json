{"path":"546505.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph reveals a serene garden environment within a built setting. The scene is brightly illuminated by what appears to be natural daylight, suggesting it was taken during the day.\n\nIn the foreground, robust green foliage dominates, with large leaves that shine under the sun's rays, hinting at a well-maintained garden. Behind this foliage, a slender birch tree rises, with its characteristic peeling white bark and sparse leafy branches, adding a vertical dimension to the space.\n\nCentral in the image is a paved pathway leading towards a person who is bending over, focused on a task that appears to be tending to the garden. This person is dressed in light-colored casual attire, suitable for outdoor activity, and is slightly blurred, conveying motion.\n\nThe surrounding architecture includes a brick building with a modern design, featuring large rectangular windows and a row of smaller, square windows just below the roofline. The roof is covered with grey shingles, and the overall design choices suggest a setting that might be institutional or residential with an emphasis on modernity.\n\nOverall, the composition beautifully balances elements of nature and architecture, creating a tranquil and orderly garden space ideal for relaxation or quiet activity.","title":"Interior courtyard of First Baptist Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546457","551104","546534","551728","546559","546460","550055","551705","551702","557281","552723","546450","551739","551649","551777","547249"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["garden","modernity","birch","ray","roofline","dimension","choice","shingle","architecture","foliage"]}
