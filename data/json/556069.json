{"path":"556069.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive interior of a grand building, likely a train station or a similar public facility, characterized by its opulent architectural details and large scale. The main hall is illuminated by natural light filtering through an architecturally striking arched ceiling, which includes a grid of windows and additional ornate stained glass at the far end, adding to the historic ambiance of the space.\n\nRow upon row of dark wooden benches dominate the foreground. These benches, arranged in straight lines, serve as seating for the visitors, some of whom are visible sitting or lying down, suggesting a typical scene of waiting travelers. In the middle and farther ends of the hall, there are people walking, sitting, or engaged in various activities, providing a sense of scale and busyness typical of such a public venue.\n\nThe space features high ceilings with elaborate decorative molding and archways that frame the distant walls, contributing to the majestic atmosphere. The flooring is a smooth, reflective surface, likely made of tile or polished stone, enhancing the overall grandeur of the setting.\n\nThere are various kiosks and small stalls in the back of the hall, appearing to offer goods or services to the people passing by, with the figures of the vendors and customers casually interacting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a slice of everyday life in a historically rich and architecturally significant environment, emphasizing both the beauty of the space and its role as a hub of activity and transit.","title":"Massive wooden benches fit in with the architecture of the interior of Chicago's Union Station. The terminal is one of the busiest in the Amtrak system. The volume is further swelled with the daily influx of commuter trains which are not a part of the Amtrak passenger services. The station was dedicated in 1925.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556828","556679","556131","555963","556024","556122","555962","556686","550290","556055","556680","556067","556054","556000","556017","549897"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["hall","ceiling","bench","end","busyness","kiosk","space","molding","flooring","archway"]}
