{"path":"551022.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy outdoors by a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The boy is shirtless and wearing frayed denim cutoff shorts. He appears to be examining a large fish that he has caught, which is hanging from a line in his left hand. His right hand is gently placed on the fish, seemingly checking or unhooking it.\n\nThe boy has short, straight hair that covers his eyes partly, and he leans his head forward as he focuses on the fish. His body language suggests curiosity and concentration. The setting around him includes calm waters with a soft ripple effect and dense foliage that extends into the water at the edge of the frame. The lighting is subdued, likely indicating an overcast day or a moment just before or after peak daylight hours.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene and reflects a moment of youthful exploration and connection with nature. The focus is squarely on the boy and his interaction with the fish, creating a narrative of self-reliance and achievement in a natural environment.","title":"A young fisherman shows off the large perch he caught in the kanawha river","placename":"Malden (W.
