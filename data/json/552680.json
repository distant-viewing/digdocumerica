{"path":"552680.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In the photograph, an elderly woman stands in front of an aged and weathered two-story building with peeling white paint. She has short white hair, wears glasses, and is dressed in a light-colored blouse, a white apron, and a patterned skirt. The woman is smiling and holding a framed black-and-white photograph in front of her at chest level, showcasing it to the camera.\n\nThe building behind her has a faded sign reading \"HARDWARE\" visible on the upper part and features large storefront windows. The windows display a variety of items, suggesting it may still be in use despite the building's dilapidated appearance. There is a clear, blue sky above and sunlight illuminates the scene, casting shadows on the ground.\n\nThe image captures a personal moment, possibly linking the woman's own history or memories to the building in the background, emphasized by her presentation of the framed photograph. This setup, along with her content expression and the historical aura of the surroundings, adds a nostalgic feel to the image.","title":"Mrs. Albers and her husband run the one remaining store in GRand Valley.
