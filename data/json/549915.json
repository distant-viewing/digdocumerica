{"path":"549915.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures an upward view of one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City. Prominently featured in the foreground is a large sign that reads “The World Trade Center” in white lettering on a dark blue background. The sign specifies that the building is the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and labels the project of the bistate interstate agency.\n\nThe photograph is taken from street level looking up towards the sky, emphasizing the towering height of the skyscraper. The building's façade is a series of closely spaced vertical lines, creating a grid-like texture. It reflects the clear blue sky, enhancing its looming presence.\n\nAbove the sign, the side of another building is visible, also featuring a similar architectural style of narrow vertical lines on its surface. The juxtaposition of these giant structures conveys a sense of the grand scale and modernism typical of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center before their destruction in 2001. The angle and perspective of the image accentuate the architectural design and the sheer vertical rise of these iconic buildings.","title":"Overlooking the Hudson River in lower Manhattan, the towers of the world trade center soar skyward to a height of 1,350 feet","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555275","549302","555274","548409","547691","549918","549914","549764","555278","548387","548319","549301","550007","552395","555741","549767"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["specify","sign","loom","destruction","building","façade","lettering","skyscraper","project","grid"]}
