{"path":"553689.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tropical urban landscape from an elevated perspective. A large, multi-story building, possibly a hotel or condominium, dominates the foreground. Its architectural design is noticeable with its rounded, tiered balconies that provide a wrap-around view. The topmost part of the building is uniquely capped with a golden-yellow, circular structure, possibly a rooftop feature or water tank.\n\nTo the right of the building, a street lined with palm trees stretches alongside. This street is populated with a few moving vehicles and appears to run parallel to a beach visible in the distance. The azure sea complements a clear sky dotted with a few fluffy clouds.\n\nThe background includes another building, similar in height but different in design, indicating a densely built beachfront area. The natural and urban elements combine to provide a scenic view, suggesting a location that balances city life with beachside leisure.","title":"\"round\" hotel waikiki beach","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553671","544638","553672","555756","553679","554144","553745","546412","555757","553677","554145","553983","554143","553791","553688","553680"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beachside","around","moving","reound","hotel","palm","rooftop","building","wrap","street"]}
