{"path":"549479.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an extensive industrial and transportation area, likely near a coastline given the visible body of water on the left. The image captures a mix of roads, railways, industrial buildings, storage yards, and green areas.\n\nOn the left side, large industrial facilities dominate the view, with large buildings and tanks that might be associated with manufacturing or processing plants. There are multiple railway tracks filled with rows of freight cars, suggesting this is a major hub for freight transport. Beyond the industrial buildings, there's a large body of water, potentially a river or a harbor, aligned with more industrial infrastructure on the farther shore.\n\nThe center and right part of the image feature a complex network of roads and more railway lines. The roads include a prominent highway that cuts vertically through the scene. Surrounding this highway are patches of green land, some of which appear to be undeveloped or possibly parks.\n\nOverall, the area is a dynamic mix of natural and heavily industrialized elements, indicative of a region focused on heavy industry and transport. The presence of both green areas and industrial development suggest this could be an outskirts area of a major city or a specialized industrial zone. No people are visible in this large-scale overview, emphasizing the focus on infrastructure and industry rather than residential or commercial areas.","title":"The polluted Buffalo River flows into Lake Erie.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["555765","550886","555779","549526","555761","551177","555774","555754","551988","545889","555744","555762","546719","548423","550890","548353"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["railway","freight","highway","industry","transport","road","industrialize","overview","infrastructure","mix"]}
