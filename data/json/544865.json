{"path":"544865.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque rural scene, likely on a farm or homestead nestled in a valley surrounded by forested hills. The focal point is a rustic, two-story log cabin with a prominent stone chimney and a shiny metal roof, reflecting the light. Surrounding the cabin are several fenced areas, perhaps for livestock, and a series of wooden enclosures made from logs, creating a farmyard atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground shows a weathered wooden fence, its logs assembled in a zigzag pattern, characteristic of traditional American frontier fencing. This fence appears to be falling into disrepair with some logs fallen or disjointed.\n\nThe cabin is situated in a large clearing. Behind it, there are cultivated fields suggesting agricultural activity, possibly for growing crops or grazing. The fields are bordered by tall pine trees emphasizing the cabin's seclusion and the natural beauty of its mountainous location.\n\nThe landscape around the cabin is varied, featuring open grassy areas and sections of tilled dark earth, ready for planting or recently harvested. The peaceful and remote setting is highlighted by the absence of visible modern technology or vehicles, suggesting the photo aims to capture a timeless or historical essence of rural life.\n\nThe natural lighting and deep shadows cast by the trees suggest that this photo was taken on a sunny day, enhancing the vividness and colors of the sceneâ€”from the rich greens of the trees to the earthy tones of the cabin and fence.","title":"Ranch","placename":"West Dolores River (Colo.)","location":"West Dolores River, Colorado","nn1":["546149","554084","557947","554401","557026","549193","554633","554696","547658","554786","557691","554438","555231","551076","546142","555635"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","log","fence","planting","fencing","enclosure","livestock","seclusion","field","pine"]}
