{"path":"542584.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a lumberyard with a semi-industrial setting. In the foreground, there are numerous stacks of lumber organized in neat rows, varying in color from light beige to deep yellow, suggesting different types of wood or stages of processing. This extensive collection of cut boards and timber is spread across a dirt ground, which appears expansive and somewhat barren, scattered with sparse greenery.\n\nIn the middle ground, two large, dark conical structures dominate the view; these are likely wood chip piles covered with protective tarps or possibly sawdust burners, which are commonly used in lumber processing to dispose of excess wood materials. These structures have metal frameworks visible at the top, possibly for ventilation. Adjacent to these, there are industrial buildings with parts emitting steam or smoke, suggesting active processing works. The infrastructure includes metal and possibly corrugated iron elements.\n\nThe background is further enriched with a picturesque view of distant mountains, partially shrouded by haze. The mountains provide a natural, serene backdrop contrasting with the industrial foreground, and are covered in dense foliage, hinting at a rural or less-developed region.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively combines elements of industry—an active lumberyard—with the natural environment, underscored by clear skies and mountainous landscapes, conveying a scene of human economic activity within a natural setting.","title":"Burning chamber of lumber mill","placename":"Stanislaus River (Calif.)","location":"Stanislaus River, California","nn1":["543489","543541","550668","552162","545256","552163","546236","543749","550349","545260","542945","542941","542859","542942","552140","548155"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["lumber","processing","wood","burner","sawdust","tarp","ventilation","chip","iron","cut"]}
