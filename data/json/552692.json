{"path":"552692.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural environment featuring a blend of diverse elements. In the foreground, a lively, rushing river flows, its surface agitated and frothy, suggesting rapid movement over rocks or a shallow bed. Surrounding the river are abundant trees cloaked in autumn colors, primarily vivid yellows, signaling the season. These trees densely populate the scene, their leaves and branches reaching into the frame, contributing to a vibrant display of fall foliage.\n\nRising above the woodland canopy, towering rock formations dominate the background. The rocks have a rugged texture and sharp, irregular shapes, typical of a mountainous or canyon-like terrain. The color of the rocks is a stark, dark grey or black, contrasting sharply with the bright yellows and greens of the trees. The sky is barely visible, but where it peeks through, it appears grey, perhaps indicating overcast weather, which enhances the vibrancy of the autumn leaves.\n\nOverall, the composition blends dynamic water movement with the static, enduring presence of the rock cliffs and the transitional, seasonal beauty of the autumn leaves. The image conveys a sense of secluded wilderness, emphasizing natural beauty and the peaceful yet powerful character of an untouched landscape.","title":"Aspen leaves flutter along the East Rifle Creek.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552600","548156","550658","549550","553653","554756","553855","552599","553416","554748","542743","550742","543647","555075","544856","549442"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rock","autumn","yellow","leave","cloak","movement","rush","blend","endure","peek"]}
