{"path":"546509.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph shows a view from the wooden deck of a building, looking out over a golf course. The deck is covered by a long, sloping roof supported by white columns. The structure includes an external staircase with a metal handrail that leads up to the deck. The railing around the deck is also made of metal and painted white. The floor of the deck is made of wooden planks.\n\nOn the deck, there is a rocking chair visible to the left side, suggesting a space meant for relaxation and observation of the surrounding landscape. The landscape beyond the deck is a sprawling golf course with neatly trimmed grass, scattered trees, and a clear, expansive sky above. The time appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the soft light and subdued colors in the sky. This setting conveys a quiet and serene environment, ideally suited for leisure activities like golf.","title":"Back area of otter creek clubhouse and golf course","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546524","546513","554149","543633","549069","554148","551264","548821","552608","557512","546959","544483","554167","554492","553980","547286"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["deck","golf","course","handrail","mean","slop","staircase","sprawling","observation","metal"]}
