{"path":"555112.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a dense forest scene at night. This image focuses on several thin, tall trees, which are primarily in the foreground. The trees have a relatively small number of branches, many of which are bare, suggesting either young trees or trees in a state of dormancy. The bark of the trees is visible and appears to be somewhat smooth.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a prominent tree stump covered in small green plants, which could be moss or small ferns, suggesting a moist environment typical of a forest ecosystem. The stump provides a contrasting texture against the smoother tree trunks.\n\nThe background is shrouded in darkness but hints at a thicker, perhaps older, section of the forest with fuller, darker trees that recede into the shadows. The forest floor is not clearly visible, obscured by the darkness and the density of the trees.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo with its focus on vertically oriented trees and the mysterious, dark atmosphere evokes a sense of solitude and quiet typical of a forest at night. The lighting, possibly from a flash or external light source, highlights the trees in the foreground against the much darker background.","title":"Stagnating hemlock trees in need of thinning in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
