{"path":"543664.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a roadside scene focused on environmental pollution through discarded trash. The foreground shows a large pile of garbage, consisting mainly of old, rusted and crushed cans, along with some other debris like torn pieces of paper or cardboard. The cans exhibit different labels, suggesting once contained food, drinks, or other consumables; they are significantly weathered and dirty, emphasizing their discarded nature.\n\nA blurred vehicle is captured in motion on the road at the top left side of the frame, adding a dynamic element to the image. The vehicle's speed and blur contrast sharply with the static pile of trash, possibly underlining themes of neglect or ongoing pollution despite the movement of life around it.\n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring a road curving around a hillside, dense with trees and rocky outcrops. This setting may suggest the location is near a natural or wooded area, further highlighting the discord between natural beauty and human waste.\n\nThe overall composition with the trash in sharp focus at the bottom, and the speeding car along with the natural background, conveys a poignant message about environmental issues and human impact, urging viewers to contemplate the consequences of littering and pollution.","title":"Trash on Vail Pass roadside","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["551247","550687","544298","558084","549957","549944","549746","543589","552100","557307","549820","548131","551440","544640","552080","556640"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","pollution","can","speed","discard","consequence","pile","contemplate","outcrop","cardboard"]}
