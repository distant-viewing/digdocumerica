{"path":"544557.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial view of a lush, forested landscape with multiple bodies of water. Prominently featured in the foreground is a large lake with a small island at its center. On the island, there's a cluster of buildings that appear to be either residential or commercial, possibly a resort or retreat center, alongside a docked boat, which suggests this location is accessible by water.\n\nTo the left, there is another body of water that seems to connect to more expansive areas dotted with smaller islands, all covered in dense greenery. Beyond these immediate areas, the land opens into a vast, flat expanse that extends towards the horizon, showcasing an array of greenery and dispersed water bodies which possibly includes more wetlands or forests.\n\nThe top and far-reaching areas of the photograph hint at a more developed region with several clearings and what could possibly be roads or trails hinting at human activity and possibly settlements or recreational areas designed to blend with the natural environment.\n\nThe image captures the beauty and solitude of a remote, forest-bordered water body, emphasizing the natural scenery and potential human interaction with this secluded environment.","title":"Private vacation home in west end of Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["552141","556931","555702","556926","556930","556928","555695","550579","550644","554652","550612","556966","550626","555728","542882","550601"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["island","body","water","retreat","trails","resort","disperse","hind","settlement","greenery"]}
