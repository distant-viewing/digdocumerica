{"path":"557286.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint urban scene centered around an older, two-story residential house. The building features a traditional architectural style, likely from the late 19th or early 20th century. The fa√ßade combines light-colored siding with darker trim around the windows and doors, and includes decorative elements such as band moldings, pediments, and a distinctive second-story bay window which is flanked by a balcony railing.\n\nThe first story of the building displays a central wooden door elevated slightly above street level, accessible by a stoop with stone steps. The entrance is flanked by two windows with shutters. Notably, one of the windows on the right is partly obscured by a large piece of fabric, possibly a tarp or cover, draped over what seems to be an object standing beside the stoop.\n\nA man in a red shirt and blue jeans stands by the stoop, facing the house. He appears to be engaged in an activity or possibly observing something, adding a human element to the scene. His presence suggests either domestic involvement or maintenance work related to the upkeep of the property.\n\nThe house sits in a densely-built area, as indicated by the visible adjacent buildings showing similarly traditional architectural details. Bare tree branches in the foreground suggest the season might be either autumn or winter, contributing to the somewhat desolate but calm urban atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on historical architecture and a solitary figure involved in everyday life, offers a glimpse into residential life in an older city neighborhood.","title":"House receives a new coat of paint in and older well-maintained ethnic community on the south side.
