{"path":"545534.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an environmental scene, possibly a quarry or mining site. The foreground shows rough, textured terrain with scattered stones and patches of dark, possibly moist or muddy soil. A dark, wet pathway or small stream meanders through this rugged landscape.\n\nIn the middle ground, an imposing mound of earth rises prominently. This mound has steep, bare sides showing layers of earth and rock, colored in shades of brown and orange. Atop this mound, a single tall, skinny tree stands almost solitary against the sky, giving a stark contrast between natural life and the disturbed earth.\n\nThe background features another similar mound, though it's partially obscured from view by the forefront formations. Both the sky and these additional elements suggest a remote, less inhabited area. The sky above is partially clouded but mostly clear, suggesting it might be either late afternoon or early morning given the gentle lighting.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of rugged terrain, possibly altered by human activity, with minimal vegetation and exposed geological features. This invokes themes of environmental impact and the stark beauty of natural geological formations even in disturbed states.","title":"Devastated area-site of a strip mine near Route 269","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["555610","554804","545529","555598","552420","554817","555622","554780","554766","555629","543718","543757","555103","544751","549119","543658"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["mound","earth","formation","quarry","terrain","stream","forefront","mining","pathway","state"]}
