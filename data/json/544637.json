{"path":"544637.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a cluttered, sprawling landfill area under a clear blue sky. The foreground of the image is dominated by a large, orange plastic bucket filled with a sudsy, bubbling liquid and a long-handled brush or scoop submerged in it. Surrounding this bucket are a variety of discarded items and debris, creating a chaotic and messy scene.\n\nThe middle and background of the photograph reveal more piles of rubbish that include an assortment of discarded objects such as electronic items, wooden planks, textiles, and other miscellaneous waste. The terrain appears rough and uneven, covered with debris and lacking any vegetation, suggesting it might be a designated waste area.\n\nThe landscape in the distance shows some greenery with what appears to be a line of trees and shrubs under the bright sky, which contrasts with the polluted and littered foreground. The overall composition emphasizes environmental neglect and pollution, with the presence of sunlight enhancing the textures and colors of the discarded items and highlighting the impact of human waste on natural landscapes.","title":"Open dump along U.S. 27","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550801","549747","544799","554541","548210","553433","549750","550256","550248","546246","557307","549739","543832","553039","549748","543828"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["discard","waste","bucket","item","scoop","bubble","rubbish","designate","brush","landfill"]}
