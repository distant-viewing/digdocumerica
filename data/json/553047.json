{"path":"553047.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of cultivated fields with distinct geometric patterns, separated by narrow roads or pathways that are primarily straight but also include some curves, forming a grid-like design. Each plot of land displays variations in color tones, ranging from shades of brown to dark soil, suggesting different types of crops or stages of tilling and cultivation. The fields are dotted sporadically with numerous white specks, which could be livestock, bales of hay, or other agricultural elements. On the left side and top center, there are roads that cut through or border the fields, enhancing the structured agricultural layout. The overall image provides a glimpse into a vast, meticulously organized farming area captured from a significant altitude.","title":"Aerial of cattle on huge feedlot.
