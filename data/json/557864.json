{"path":"557864.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph showcases a scene inside what appears to be a garage or a workshop. Two men are interacting near a vintage car, likely from the 1960s or 1970s, in a moment that seems to involve some sort of discussion or transaction related to automobile maintenance or repair.\n\nThe man standing outside the car wears a blue shirt with an embroidered tag that says \"Andy\" on his chest, suggesting he might be a mechanic or a workshop staff member. He has greying hair and is handing or showing something small—perhaps a car part or a tool—to the man seated inside the car.\n\nThe seated man, appearing middle-aged or older, occupies the driver's seat and is dressed in a casual, light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. His attention is directed towards what the standing man is presenting, indicative of a scenario where the seated man is either learning about something to do with the car or making decisions regarding potential services or parts.\n\nThe car itself has an open door, is silver or light-colored, with prominent chrome details and fixtures inside, which are typical of automobiles from the mid-20th century era.\n\nThe environment surrounding them is marked by a solid light green wall and a darker green element behind them, possibly a door or another wall, giving a typical workshop ambiance.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of professional interaction with a focus on automotive care or evaluation in a mid-20th century setting, characterized by vibrant color saturation typical of the photographic film used during that era.","title":"Public works employee at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio, gives a driver tips on how he can repair his car which failed the test for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.  Many of the cars that fail need only minor adjustments which the owners can make themselves.  The majority of vehicles are taken to a garage.  However, not all garages have exhaust analyzers used by the inspection station, and what a mechanic thinks is a properly tuned car still may not pass the test","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557906","557860","557900","557850","557858","557915","557927","557874","557891","557853","557919","557865","557885","557905","557897","542763"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["workshop","car","automobile","man","decision","transaction","door","learn","mechanic","era"]}
