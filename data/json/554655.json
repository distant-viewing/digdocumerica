{"path":"554655.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image features a man interacting with a small, red and white seaplane that is equipped with pontoons and is floating on a body of water. The seaplaneâ€™s cabin is visible with its door open. The man, dressed in a white sweater and dark pants, is kneeling on one of the pontoons and using a long paddle to presumably maneuver or stabilize the seaplane. The background displays a lakeside view with dense trees exhibiting autumn colors, primarily red and orange, indicating the season. The overall scene is serene with a clear focus on the interaction between the man and the seaplane in an idyllic, natural setting.","title":"Bush pilot Ted Anthonsen with his 4-seater seaplane moored near Old Forge","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554656","554654","554487","551219","555602","544973","546356","556909","546352","553411","549062","546976","546349","554488","544759","552330"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["paddle","cabin","sweater","man","autumn","season","door","pant","interaction","body"]}
