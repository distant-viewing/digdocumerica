{"path":"553649.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial or high-altitude view of a landscape largely shrouded in clouds or mist. The scene is framed by layers of distant ridges and mountains, which fade into a blue or purple hue due to atmospheric perspective, suggesting significant depth.\n\nDominating the image is a sprawling expanse of cloud cover, varying in density and texture, interspersed with clearer areas through which fragments of the ground are visible. In one clear patch, there appears to be a plume of white smoke rising vertically into the air, possibly indicating industrial activity such as a factory or plant.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photo is dim, suggesting either dusk, dawn, or an overcast day. The color palette consists predominantly of blues, purples, and shades of gray, contributing to a somewhat moody or serene atmosphere. The image lacks direct sunlight, with light diffusing softly through the clouds, enhancing the image's ethereal quality.","title":"Smoke from two lumbermills floats in early morning air east of Sonora, California.
