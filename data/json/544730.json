{"path":"544730.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a dry, barren landscape primarily characterized by its sparse vegetation and brown soil. In the foreground, there are two prominent objects: a metal lid likely covering a manhole, and a metal pole or marker that reads \"UNION.\" In the background, there are several cows scattered across the field. \n\nNotably, the background also features numerous large electricity pylons stretching across the horizon, suggesting an industrial or semi-urban setting. The sky is clear and bright, indicating that the photo was taken on a sunny day. The overall atmosphere conveys a juxtaposition of rural life with industrial elements due to the presence of livestock and power structures in the same frame.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["555609","558107","549214","544726","545827","557439","555645","555542","549191","544955","544868","542589","549118","544068","545828","552465"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["lid","pylon","electricity","cow","livestock","marker","metal","power","juxtaposition","soil"]}
