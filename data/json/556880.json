{"path":"556880.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a worker involved in a manual labor activity. The person, who is bending over machinery, is wearing blue jeans and a long-sleeved, striped, purple shirt. The individual is also equipped with a red hard hat and brown work boots. The worker appears to be using a large hammer or mallet to strike or adjust something related to the machinery. The machinery itself is not clearly visible due to the angle and the worker's position, but it seems to be composed of metal with some elements of rust and wear.\n\nThe background shows a glimpse of the outdoor setting, possibly under bright, sunny conditions judging by the lighting, although the immediate background is nondescript and primarily focused on the worker's task at hand. The colors are muted with the exception of the red hard hat, bringing a pop of color to the otherwise subdued palette. The scene captures the essence of physical labor and maintenance work, demonstrating a moment of intensive effort by the worker.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way worker drives a railroad spike into a tie to hold a part of the new quarter mile long section of rail.
