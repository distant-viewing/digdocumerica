{"path":"548146.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a towering electricity pylon, set against a dark blue sky. This pylon is constructed from numerous steel beams forming a geometric lattice structure. It's shot from a low angle, making the pylon appear imposing as it stretches upward into the sky.\n\nThe Sun, positioned directly behind the pylon, serves as a dramatic backlight, creating a burst of brightness at the center of the structure, from where beams of light radiate outward. This effect creates an interesting interplay of light and shadow, emphasizing the intricate pattern of the metalwork.\n\nMultiple diagonal and vertical lines formed by the beams add to the dynamic feel of the image. There are small reflective elements on some of the beams, likely for visibility and safety, adding twinkling points of light throughout the image. The composition and lighting combine to give the photograph a striking, graphic quality, focusing entirely on industrial design and natural illumination.","title":"Power transmission tower at the Dalles Dam on the Columbia River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["547936","543926","544613","544355","549020","542524","557538","544277","553830","546389","549110","549011","543728","544020","543903","544300"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pylon","beam","metalwork","backlight","burst","lattice","electricity","radiate","shoot","illumination"]}
