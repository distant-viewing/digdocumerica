{"path":"544432.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures two young boys in a dusty, open space in front of a stone wall, which is part of a rustic building. One boy is standing and holding onto the handlebars of a unique, elongated bicycle or chopper bike that appears to be custom-designed or modified. He wears a black jacket, a light-colored shirt, and is looking directly towards the camera with a subtle smile. The second boy, seated on the bike, is wearing a darker blue jacket and jeans. He appears to be mid-motion, either mounting or dismounting the bicycle, with one foot planted firmly on the ground.\n\nThe bicycle itself is interestingly structured, with a long front fork, making it resemble a lowrider style. It has two different-sized wheels, the front being smaller than the rear, and a high-rise handlebar, typical of chopper bikes.\n\nThe building behind them features a stone fa√ßade with two visible windows, one directly behind the boys is just an open hole, while another, a little further to the right, is covered with what looks like a simple wooden frame. The scene gives a feeling of a rural or perhaps suburban environment, suggesting a community where kids might freely play outdoors. The ground is unpaved and dusty, consistent with a less urban setting. The lighting indicates it might be late afternoon, with shadows beginning to lengthen and a gentle light bathing the scene.","title":"Arizona--Hopi Indian Reservation","placename":"Hopi Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Hopi Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["555950","546967","550249","544680","547170","551032","551003","545328","556163","545965","543715","553515","543719","545953","545973","550283"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["bike","boy","bicycle","handlebar","front","kid","stone","modify","hole","jacket"]}
