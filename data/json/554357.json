{"path":"554357.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large mound of compacted scrap metal and automobiles, creating a chaotic and highly textured landscape of twisted and crushed metal. The colors range from rusted browns to shades of gray and hints of other faded colors, which indicate the various types of metal and stages of oxidation. The pieces of metal vary in size and shape, and are densely packed together, creating a visually complex scene.\n\nIn the background, under a pale sky, there's a hint of an industrial landscape, possibly a bridge or similar large structure, suggesting that this scrapyard or recycling facility is likely situated near an industrial area or transportation route. The overall mood is somber, invoking themes of consumerism, waste, and the lifecycle of manufactured goods.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554301","548109","554300","554317","547611","554320","554318","552740","554346","545010","542585","554352","548147","545545","547610","542656"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["metal","lifecycle","scrapyard","recycling","scrap","hint","automobile","route","good","mound"]}
