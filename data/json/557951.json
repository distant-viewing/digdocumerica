{"path":"557951.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful rural setting centered on a traditional white church with a prominent spire. Adjacent to the church is a large white tent, under which a group of people can be observed gathered around tables, likely engaged in a communal event such as a picnic or a fair. The church and the tent are situated on a well-manicured lawn bordered by a picket fence, emphasizing the quaint, serene atmosphere of the scene.\n\nTo the right of the church, there is a white residential building, contributing to the small-town or village feel of the image. The background features a dense treeline of tall, lush trees which enhance the sense of seclusion and intimacy. The sky above is overcast with hints of blue, suggesting a typical cloudy day. The overall composition of the photograph, with its classic architecture and casual outdoor gathering, evokes a sense of community and tradition, common in rural American landscapes.","title":"Tent near the meeting house at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio, serves as a dining area for visitors. The food is sold by the Western Reserve Historical Society that operates the 19th-century farm and village as a living museum to preserve life as it was lived during that era. The meeting house was built in 1852 in Streetsboro, Ohio, and moved to its present site. The historic complex is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["550287","557758","556480","557952","547414","554035","557954","554207","547440","546455","558023","554208","558024","554033","547324","557953"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","tent","picket","village","tradition","treeline","intimacy","picnic","spire","seclusion"]}
