{"path":"548147.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The image depicts a large pile of metal scrap and debris, giving an impression of a scrapyard scene. The foreground shows various metal objects, including what appears to be parts of machinery, with a prominent, white cylindrical object that could be part of an engine or large tank. This object has patches of rust and peeling white paint, showing signs of weathering and age. Around it, there are assorted metal scraps like bent and torn sheets, frames, and possibly parts of vehicles or industrial equipment.\n\nBeyond this, the background is dominated by a mountainous accumulation of more metal scrap. The vast heap includes items like crushed barrels, mechanical components, and possibly parts of automotive or machinery skeletons. Dark and rusted metals predominate, suggesting that the items have been exposed to the elements for an extended period.\n\nThe sky above the scrap heap is slightly overcast, casting a natural, diffused light over the scene and adding to the grim and abandoned feel of the setting. There are no visible human figures or active work going on in the image, reinforcing the atmosphere of desolation. The focus is solely on the vast accumulation of discarded industrial waste.","title":"Heaped-up scrap iron at the American Ship Dismantling Division on the Willamette River, just south of the Columbia","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["554300","547625","548109","554318","554301","554346","547611","554357","557308","554335","547610","554317","542585","549307","550265","552740"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["scrap","metal","heap","accumulation","object","predominate","like","part","scrapyard","machinery"]}
