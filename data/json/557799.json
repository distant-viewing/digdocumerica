{"path":"557799.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor event involving a hot air balloon. The balloon is prominently displayed in the upper left corner of the image, partially shown with a blue and gold striped pattern. Hanging below it is a large, wicker basket where a pilot or passenger is likely situated, standing and facing away from the viewer.\n\nIn the foreground, two individuals, possibly a mother and daughter, are holding onto a yellow rope that is tied to the balloon basket, suggesting they are either helping to stabilize it or preparing to launch. The child is dressed in a traditional or folk costume, featuring a frilly white blouse, a patterned vest, and red accessories, while the adult wears a similar but simpler dress with a navy skirt and a white, apron-like garment with blue detailing.\n\nFurther back, a scattered crowd of spectators encircles the event area, many of whom are standing by a large tent that seems to serve as either a gathering or concession area. The tent is white with visible banners or decorations.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of lush green trees under a bright, clear sky dotted with clouds, suggesting a pleasant day. The overall atmosphere appears festive and communal, typical of a fair or cultural festival.","title":"Hot air balloonist from Atlanta tests his craft in tethered flight in the helen valley, site of the fifth annual oktoberfest at helen.
