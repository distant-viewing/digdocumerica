{"path":"550803.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a young fawn, identified by its small stature and characteristic white spots on a reddish-brown coat, in the midst of a serene natural setting. The fawn is positioned slightly to the left of the frame, engaged in grazing on the short grass at the edge of a pathway or road. Its head is bent downward towards the grass, showcasing its large, sensitive ears and delicate facial features.\n\nThe background is softly focused, consisting of lush greenery that includes a variety of bushes and flowering plants. The vegetation adds a rich, textural backdrop that enhances the sense of a peaceful, natural environment. The overall composition of the image, with the fawn off-center and the ample greenery, creates a dynamic yet harmonious scene that emphasizes the wilderness habitat of the animal. The lighting in the photograph is natural, seemingly overcast, which casts soft, diffused light across the scene, highlighting the gentle innocence of the fawn without harsh shadows.","title":"Deer feeding on grass alongside Highway 107, south of TOmahawk.
