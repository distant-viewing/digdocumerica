{"path":"542700.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a stunning aerial view of a river valley flanked by steep, rugged mountains. The river meanders centrally through the valley, appearing as a vibrant, winding ribbon reflecting the light, creating bright, white water rapids interspersed with darker sections of water. Its banks are densely lined with a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees, which display various shades of green, suggesting diverse vegetation.\n\nSurrounding the river, the mountains rise steeply with rugged, rocky faces partially covered by bushes and trees. The terrain's color palette includes various shades of earthy browns and greens, contributing to an impression of wild, untreated nature. In the far distance, multiple layers of mountains can be seen fading into a hazy blue, which could indicate either distance or atmospheric conditions like mist or light fog.\n\nThe photograph is captured in natural light, which is abundant and casts deep shadows in the folds of the mountains, enhancing their ragged contours and texture. The overall scene evokes a sense of untouched wilderness and might be representative of a natural park or a secluded mountain area known for outdoor activities such as hiking or rafting.","title":"The inaccessible Kings River gorge above a proposed lake and dam","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542701","550542","550529","550518","550561","550508","549442","550507","550526","550590","550487","550523","550577","550524","550562","542909"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","valley","rafting","river","rapid","ribbon","hiking","fold","atmospheric","stunning"]}
