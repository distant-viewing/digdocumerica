{"path":"548124.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a large boat named \"COLUMBIA\" moored beside a pier over a calm body of water. The ship is predominantly painted bright red with the name \"COLUMBIA\" displayed in large, bold white letters on its side. The vessel features a sturdy structure with two prominent masts that rise high above its deck, both equipped with various antennas, booms, and wired riggings, adding a technical and utilitarian aspect to its appearance.\n\nOn top of the larger structure on the ship, typically the bridge or command center, you can see a series of windows and a few additional smaller structures that likely house navigational and communication equipment. A funnel painted buff with a black top, indicative of the ship's engine exhaust system, towers near the center.\n\nThe setting is a maritime environment possibly indicative of a commercial or research port given the industrial style of the ship and its equipment. The water is tranquil, reflecting a partly cloudy sky above, which contributes to a serene nautical ambiance. In the distant background, there appears to be a landmass, possibly an island, enhancing the coastal scene. To the far right, a small boat or dinghy can be seen on the water, suggesting the presence of other water-based activities in the vicinity.","title":"Lightship Columbia at the mouth of the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["548122","549619","551581","549613","546804","542873","549618","557815","544657","546040","548126","544234","548201","549431","549614","555801"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","command","funnel","exhaust","landmass","rigging","antenna","boom","boat","communication"]}
