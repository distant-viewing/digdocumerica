{"path":"543866.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a heartwarming moment between a man and a young child, possibly a father and his son. The man, appearing in partial profile, is looking downward with a gentle, affectionate expression. He has a neatly trimmed beard and mustache, and his hair is dark and curly. He is wearing a light-colored, button-down shirt that shows signs of wear, suggesting practical use.\n\nThe child is held close to the man, his head resting against the man's shoulder, facing towards the camera. The child is shirtless, revealing his small shoulders and arms. He has a serious, somewhat pensive expression on his face, with big, round eyes and short curly hair. His gaze seems directed slightly off-camera, giving a sense of candidness to the image.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, showing a diffuse light blue and cloudy sky, which suggests an outdoor setting. The overall composition of the photograph, with its close framing and focus on the subjects, emphasizes the intimacy and protective feel of the scene. This image captures a simple yet poignant moment of human connection.","title":"Photograph of a migrant father with his young son","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553094","556527","557369","556294","556144","550943","556607","553543","543863","556299","557359","557368","552655","552931","558186","553496"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["child","shoulder","father","man","intimacy","mustache","hair","beard","camera","expression"]}
