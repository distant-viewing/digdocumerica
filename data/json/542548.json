{"path":"542548.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor setting featuring a middle-aged man standing in the foreground of a vast, arid landscape. The man, who appears prominently centered in the frame, is dressed in a casual short-sleeve button-up shirt, pants, and a cap. He is wearing glasses and has a slight, contemplative expression as he gazes directly at the camera. His shadow stretches long and narrow on the dry, cracked soil beneath him, suggesting the photo was taken during a time of day when the sun was relatively high.\n\nThe background showcases a wide, open field that looks parched and barren, with sparse vegetation and dry grasses scattered across the undulating terrain. The soil is noticeably cracked and devoid of lush greenery, indicating possible drought conditions. In the distance, there are hints of trees and a line of shrubbery that horizontally bisects the scene, providing a modest contrast to the otherwise dominant tones of brown and beige. The horizon is vast and flat with a clear sky overhead, emphasizing the solitude and openness of the landscape. \n\nThis setting could possibly suggest agricultural challenges or land conservation issues, as indicated by the dry and unyielded ground. The man's presence in this environment might imply his connection or concern with the land, potentially as a farmer, landowner, or researcher. The overall mood conveyed is one of quietude and reflection amidst a stark natural setting.","title":"Clyde kepley, owner of sanitary land fill, stands on his 13 acre finished area, which has fill depths to 80 feet","placename":"Pinedale (Calif.)","location":"Pinedale, California","nn1":["549083","545091","543833","546262","545592","557112","546068","547679","552113","553418","545520","553801","550268","554028","545753","548299"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farmer","soil","bisect","overhead","quietude","land","devoid","crack","shrubbery","openness"]}
