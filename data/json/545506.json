{"path":"545506.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph presents a sharp contrast between urban development and waste accumulation on a city street. A prominent focal point is a large pile of garbage bags in the foreground, overwhelmingly filled and in some areas spilling their contents onto the sidewalk. The bags are mostly beige, containing materials such as paper products, discarded boxes, and general refuse.\n\nA woman is visible in the mid-background of the image, walking along the sidewalk away from the camera. She is dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeve outfit and is carrying a patterned bag. Her presence contributes a human element to the scene, juxtaposing the everyday activities of city dwellers against the backdrop of urban neglect.\n\nIn the background, a skyscraper dominates the setting, characterized by its modern architectural style with distinct horizontal lines along its facade and a dark color theme. This building reinforces the urban environment context. Despite the clear sky and the presence of green trees lining the street, the massive pile of uncollected garbage draws significant attention, illustrating issues of urban management and environmental concern. Additionally, visible on the left side of the photograph is a hanging sign, although its text is not entirely legible, further adding to the urban street scene details.","title":"Trash piles high in Birmingham street","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["549840","549823","549752","549839","545494","547899","547878","549747","549739","549957","549762","557283","545502","549833","548214","549769"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bag","garbage","sidewalk","dweller","pile","city","street","accumulation","product","concern"]}
