{"path":"546151.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a picturesque scene dominated by a small lighthouse sitting atop a grassy mound. The foreground is filled with tall, dense grass, primarily in shades of green and brown, gently swaying or undulating, suggesting a breeze. This grass creates a natural, textured tapestry that leads the viewer's eye towards the lighthouse.\n\nThe lighthouse itself is modest in size, painted in a light color, likely white, with dark trim that contrasts neatly against the sky. The structure includes a base building topped with the actual light room, which is surrounded by a gallery with railings, presumably for observation or maintenance. Above this, there is a traditional lantern room capped with a domed roof. Beside the lighthouse, a flagpole stands without a flag, suggesting either a moment of remembrance, maintenance, or weather concern.\n\nThe background sky exudes a dynamic feel, with large, billowy clouds that appear soft and expansive, suggesting a fair weather day. The coloration of the sky ranges from light blue to hints of darker hues, which could indicate either the time of the day approaching sunset or an impending change in weather.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image uses natural lines and contrasts—between the soft, organic forms of the grass and the structured, geometrical lines of the lighthouse—to create a peaceful yet striking rural scene, likely indicating a coastal location given the presence of the lighthouse.","title":"Abandoned lighthouse","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["543141","550361","544996","547916","549375","550362","550314","547131","543086","542796","547154","545118","551600","545226","543403","545215"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","weather","room","grass","maintenance","remembrance","flagpole","lantern","tapestry","coloration"]}
