{"path":"554545.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at a mining or excavation site. It features a large mechanical crane situated on the right side of the image, its long boom extending diagonally upwards across the frame. The crane appears to be stationed on a dirt mound or elevated bank, overlooking a water-filled quarry below.\n\nThe foreground shows a sloped, rocky terrain leading down to the water, dotted with patches of grass and wildflowers, suggesting a natural setting that contrasts with the mechanical activity. On the opposite bank of the water, there is more rugged terrain with large rocks and sparse patches of vegetation.\n\nThe water body itself occupies the central and lower part of the image, reflecting a calm surface that enhances the serene yet industrious atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the sky is visible with scattered clouds, implying a bright day which illuminates the entire scene, casting some shadows that define the textures of the terrain and equipment. The overall composition balances elements of industry and nature, creating a vivid portrayal of human activity in a natural landscape.","title":"Dragline used to dredge material for blacktopping near saranac lake village, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545655","555593","548773","544157","545648","544109","545887","545883","545846","544268","548644","544134","554770","548775","548559","545641"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","bank","terrain","quarry","boom","portrayal","wildflower","overlook","water","mound"]}
