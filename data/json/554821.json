{"path":"554821.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a rustic, aged farm setting. A large structure, which appears to be an old barn with a red-brick lower section and dark wooden upper section, is partially visible on the left. The barn's roof is made of weathered, grayish tiles, some of which are missing or broken, suggesting long-term exposure to the elements.\n\nTo the right forefront of the image, there is a prominent silo. It appears cylindrical and tall, constructed from concrete or metal with a faded, peeling white paint surface showing signs of wear and aging. This silo, typical in farm landscapes, is used for storing bulk materials, often feed or grain.\n\nA wooden fence, seemingly weather-beaten and old, lines part of the front of the barn. The fencing is sparse, with several missing or broken slats. Behind the barn and silo, the terrain appears to be a grassy field that fades into the backdrop of the photo without any distinct features.\n\nThe photograph captures the essence of a long-standing farm that has seen better days, emphasizing themes of decay, neglect, and the passage of time, while also showcasing the sturdy, enduring structures of traditional farming. There are no humans or animals visible in the image, focusing all attention on the architectural elements and the mood they create.","title":"An abandoned barn off Route 22, near Piedmont Lake, Ohio and Steubenville.","placename":"Piedmont Lake (Ohio)","location":"Piedmont Lake, Ohio","nn1":["555627","552448","552537","554782","555612","552462","550693","543343","552091","550019","548065","552515","547307","556963","555577","547658"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["barn","silo","farm","slat","fencing","section","tile","grain","aging","term"]}
