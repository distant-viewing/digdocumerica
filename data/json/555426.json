{"path":"555426.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a nighttime cityscape dominated by a prominent high-rise building, which stands centrally in the image. The building has a modern, somewhat cylindrical structure tapering slightly at the top, adorned with vertical lines possibly reflecting its frame or design accents.\n\nIt's illuminated from within; several floors are lit, casting a soft glow into the surroundings. The light within each floor seems uneven, suggesting that the building is either partially occupied or in use during the time of the photograph.\n\nThe background is filled with a dense array of city lights, indicating a highly urbanized area. To the right of the building, a winding trail of bright lights, perhaps from a road or highway, snakes through the dark, adding dynamism to the scene.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the image is quite dark, focusing viewers' attention on the lit areasâ€”the building and the surrounding city lights. The vastness, density, and scattered distribution of lights across the image convey the expansive nature of the city; however, the specific details of the lower landscape are obscured by the night. \n\nThe image, through its focus and composition, emphasizes the isolation and prominence of the modern skyscraper against the intricate backdrop of an urban night environment.","title":"Looking into the downtown core area of Portland, from the west hills, the 43-story first national bank building shows lights on only a few floors at 8 p.m.  During the state's energy crisis in the fall of 1973","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555419","550007","555736","555406","555418","551455","545406","549490","549502","553255","549317","546546","553306","555425","546575","549880"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["night","city","floor","dynamism","taper","building","light","prominence","distribution","nighttime"]}
