{"path":"546799.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene along the shoreline of a body of water, depicting an environmental issue intertwined with recreational activity. The image shows a rocky, litter-strewn beach leading down to calm waters, under an overcast sky.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a person standing while fishing. The individual is dressed in a striped, colorful outfit that includes shorts and a shirt, and they are facing away from the camera as they hold a fishing rod extended out over the water. Nearby, there is a foldable chair on which they might sit while fishing, indicating that they have been at this location for some time.\n\nThe foreground of the image is cluttered with various kinds of litter, including bottles, cans, cigarette packets, a sandal, and other debris scattered across the sandy and rocky ground. This collection of refuse points towards environmental neglect.\n\nTall grasses and shrubs grow along the shoreline, part of the natural vegetation attempting to thrive despite the polluted conditions. In the background, partially visible in the misty distance, is another stretch of water, indicating that this might be a river or an inlet.","title":"Littered shore near seneca creek, northeast of Baltimore has not discouraged fishing","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["557734","548741","546374","550197","550687","552127","554534","547525","550352","550280","550812","555867","550276","547590","552936","547472"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["litter","fishing","shoreline","sandal","inlet","attempt","cigarette","thrive","intertwine","refuse"]}
