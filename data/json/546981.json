{"path":"546981.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This image captures a scene on a porch where two women are involved in hanging up a large, colorful quilt. The woman on the left, whose back is partially toward the camera, wears a light pink dress with floral detailing at the sleeves and her hair styled in a bonnet or wrap. She is seated and looks slightly turned, possibly threading or handling the fabric. The woman on the right stands and is more directly facing the camera, holding the quilt up by its corners displaying a broad smile. She is dressed in a light, possibly gray top and darker pants, with her hair pulled back.\n\nThe quilt they are handling is vibrant with various patterns and colors, including blocks of different shapes and sizes. The porch where they are situated is outlined by a wooden railing painted red, and supports that may also serve as part of the structure's aesthetic. \n\nIn the background, there is a lush green environment, suggesting the porch might be in a rural or suburban area. The weather appears sunny, casting natural light that brightens the entire scene, enhancing the vivid colors of the quilt. This image not only highlights a moment of daily life but also depicts a craft (quilting) often rich with cultural and familial significance.","title":"Mrs.  Hunter is well-known on john's island for her beautiful quilts","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["547308","547275","547741","547339","558341","546977","547377","551676","558340","547374","553483","553498","557153","544416","548618","546987"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["quilt","porch","bonnet","thread","woman","handle","brighten","hair","wrap","camera"]}
