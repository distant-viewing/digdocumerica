{"path":"551741.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor urban scene, possibly within a park or plaza area near a modern building. In the foreground, there is a woman seated on a concrete ledge. She is wearing a yellow top and dark pants, and she appears to be gazing upwards, possibly looking at the trees or something out of the frame. \n\nDirectly behind her, a flowering tree full of white blossoms dominates the scene, adding a vibrant, natural element to the image. This tree, along with others in the background, brings a touch of springtime beauty to the setting. \n\nThe background features a modern building with a large, square window. The building has a dark brick facade that contrasts with the bright greenery and white blossoms of the trees. \n\nBeyond the immediate area where the woman is seated, several other people can be glimpsed in the distance, walking or enjoying the space. Parked cars are also visible, suggesting this area is adjacent to a street or parking lot. \n\nOverall, the composition blends urban architectural elements with the natural beauty of spring blossoms, juxtaposing the man-made and natural components of an urban environment. The activity seems relaxed and leisurely, indicating a peaceful, public space in a city setting.","title":"Crab apple in full bloom at Fifth Avenue and 79th Street in midtown Manhattan.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557257","551705","551644","550075","550051","551815","551678","551740","551742","551713","544808","551646","551739","550074","547251","549516"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["blossom","plaza","ledge","tree","space","woman","beauty","lot","component","spring"]}
