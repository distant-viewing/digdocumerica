{"path":"556208.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene that seems to be from the 1970s or 1980s, based on the style of clothing and the urban environment. The focus of the image is a newsstand located on a city sidewalk. The newsstand, shaded by an umbrella, is stocked with an array of magazines and comics, visibly featuring titles like \"Conan\" and various song magazines, suggesting a pop culture emphasis.\n\nTo the left of the newsstand, there's a pile of large, bundled newspapers, indicating the volume of news circulation typical of the era. Two African American men are present in the frame; one is in the foreground walking past the newsstand while looking towards it, dressed in a light blue shirt and dark pants. The other, in dark clothing, is walking away from the camera, only partially visible.\n\nIn the background, there's a multi-storied circular building, indicative of mid-20th-century architectural styles, surrounded by other high-rise structures and a busy street filled with cars and a yellow bus. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright, sunny day. A street lamp is also visible, just above the newsstandâ€™s umbrella.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a bustling urban environment, focusing on everyday activities like walking and buying magazines, set against a backdrop of typical city infrastructure and mid-century architecture.","title":"Black man operating a newsstand in Chicago at 22nd and South State Street on the South Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549806","548399","556221","556675","556225","549812","550127","550142","556733","549882","549315","546672","548388","556224","548369","545351"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["magazine","umbrella","street","title","clothing","pop","century","volume","city","newspaper"]}
