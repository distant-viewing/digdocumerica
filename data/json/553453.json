{"path":"553453.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large construction site set in a natural environment. The scene shows a vast cleared area in the midst of lush, dense forests. There's a noticeable contrast between the green, untouched nature on the top half of the image and the development below.\n\nThe central and most prominent feature of the construction site includes multiple structures in various stages of completion. Notably, there are cylindrical tanks or silos, many are situated together with scaffolding around them, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance. Some of these cylindrical structures are open at the top, revealing interior details.\n\nTo the right side of the image, the construction includes large circular foundations or pits, which are currently empty and seem to be prepared for further construction or installation of equipment. A noticeable orange crane stands in the middle of these circular foundations, indicating active construction work.\n\nThe site is also scattered with other construction materials, machinery, dirt paths, and small structures that likely serve as temporary offices or storage spaces for construction equipment. The entire area is bordered by a light-colored dirt road, and a more clearly defined road traces the upper boundary of the photograph, paralleling a strip of river that runs against the backdrop of dense trees.\n\nThe background and surroundings are dominated by rolling, wooded hills, emphasizing the remote and natural setting of this industrial activity. The photograph captures a snapshot of significant industrial effort juxtaposed against a serene forest backdrop, highlighting progress yet evoking thoughts on the environmental impact.","title":"Construction site of new Fitchburg sewage treatment plant an EPA assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["549169","556940","549204","554809","547235","550563","547225","550565","544167","547220","548641","545641","553383","546064","553375","545858"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","foundation","site","completion","scaffold","dirt","trace","pit","parallel","equipment"]}
