{"path":"556427.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, a man examines an underground setting that suggests a mining environment. The man is wearing a light-colored hard hat with a headlamp and is dressed in rugged work clothing including a brown jacket, grey pants, and boots protected by leg covers. He appears attentive and curious as he peers into a low, dark cavity supported by beams.\n\nThe environment around him is rugged and wet with some visible puddles on the ground, potentially indicative of recent water infiltration or condensation typical in such environments. Above the cavity, wood and metal beams, functioning as structural support, are visible. These beams appear aged and covered in grime, highlighting the harsh conditions of the setting. The area is dimly lit, relying mainly on natural light filtering from an unseen source and the manâ€™s headlamp. The overall ambiance of the photograph is one of a harsh, somewhat hazardous work environment that requires cautious exploration and monitoring.","title":"Doren Bishop, Robin Mines superintendent for the Alma Coal Corporation, looks at the opening of a new mine near Clothier and Madison, West Virginia. It is called a punch mine because it is \"punched\" or cut into the side of a hill. It is the same as a drift mine. Eight men were working on the openings prior to deploying machinery for digging coal.","placename":"Madison (W.
