{"path":"554130.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid rural scene with a rich, dynamic landscape. The central focus is a curving road painted in a deep reddish-brown hue, contrasting sharply against the lush green vegetation lining the edges. The road appears mildly weathered, with visible patches and a double yellow line that is somewhat worn away, signaling an area where overtaking is forbidden. Along the side of the road, the soil bears the same reddish color, suggesting a high iron oxide content, typical of certain volcanic regions.\n\nOn the road, there are three vehicles traveling in the same direction, possibly indicating the road's utility as a main route through this rural area. The first of these is a white truck, followed by a smaller white car, and another darker vehicle in the distance. The vehicles provide a sense of scale and motion within the quiet, still landscape.\n\nIn the background, the area is relatively flat, with sparse settlements. The vegetation is denser towards the horizon, gradually fading into a hazy sky that suggests either early morning light or an environment affected by dust or slight fog. Utility poles run parallel to the road, emphasizing the road's straight path before it curves away, which also adds to the scene's perspective, guiding the viewer's eye through the image.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of nature with human-made structures, presenting a serene yet inhabited landscape, typical of rural settings where roads cut through natural environments, connecting remote areas. The lighting, although dim, highlights the textures and colors of the soil and foliage, enhancing the visual impact and depth of the scene.","title":"Highway 11 passing over 1868 lava flow near Waiohinu.
