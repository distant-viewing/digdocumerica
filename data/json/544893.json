{"path":"544893.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a yucca plant in a desert environment, showcasing a vertical bloom stalk densely packed with flowers transitioning in color from creamy white at the bottom to a rich, dark burgundy at the top. The yucca has long, narrow leaves that radiate outward from the base, forming a spiky rosette. These leaves are dark green with a hint of blue and have white, fibrous threads curling along the edges, typical of yucca plants.\n\nThe plant is rooted in reddish-brown sandy soil, typical of desert terrains, which fills the frame around the base of the plant. This suggests that the yucca is likely in its native habitat, perhaps in a rocky desert or arid mountainous area. The background beyond the plant reveals a continuation of this reddish-brown terrain, interspersed with similar rocky soil textures and minimal vegetation, reinforcing the arid climate suggestion. The lighting in the photograph suggests a sunny day, as highlighted by the bright, vibrant colors and sharp shadows cast by the yucca's leaves.","title":"Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah Junction (Colo.)","location":"Utah Junction, Colorado","nn1":["545717","549123","545709","544879","544885","544582","545727","544891","544875","554844","557540","545722","544890","545711","542610","544887"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","desert","leave","suggestion","thread","burgundy","soil","stalk","curl","base"]}
