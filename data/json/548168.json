{"path":"548168.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a storefront window display of a service station or automotive shop. Boldly filling most of the window are colorful lettered signs stating \"IRREGULAR HOURS DUE TO GAS SHORTAGE\" in all-caps. The words are arranged in a playful, staggered layout using various bright colors such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple for visual impact.\n\nBehind the sign, inside the store, various automotive products are neatly arranged on shelves for sale. These include motor oils, lubricants, and other car maintenance supplies from recognizable brands like Chevron and Atlas. Some of these products are strategically stacked to be visible even with the large signs in the window.\n\nThe view through the window is framed by a mullion that splits the pane into two vertical halves, reinforcing the symmetry of the display. The window offers a glimpse into the orderly, well-stocked shelves, presenting a business-like and professional atmosphere despite the disruption indicated by the signage. The photograph serves as a historical snapshot of a moment when businesses had to adjust operations during resource limitations.","title":"Gas station in the Portland area, away from the freeway.
