{"path":"545252.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph showcases a vivid beach scene where a line of vehicles is parked on a wide, sandy beach under a clear blue sky. At the forefront, a vintage light blue car with a distinctive 1960s design includes several passengers inside leaning out on the windows and gesturing or looking outside. The car features a sign across the windshield with the words \"your beach\" scribbled in red, seemingly as a form of protest or statement.\n\nBehind this car, a variety of other vehicles are visible, including a pickup truck with a similar protest sign on its windshield reading \"DRIVE NOW!\" indicating a possibly organized event or demonstration focused on beach driving rights or related beach use issues.\n\nFurther in the background, multiple other cars and RVs (recreational vehicles) are lined up along the sandy stretch, some closer to the shoreline where tiny figures can be seen enjoying the ocean. The expanse of the beach leads to waves gently rolling onto the shore, providing a scenic yet dynamic backdrop to the human activity centered around the automobiles.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of social interaction and public demonstration, emphasizing themes of communal space usage and possibly environmental or local policy concerns, all set in a picturesque coastal environment.","title":"In demonstration against a state government ban on auto traffic on this short stretch of beach, cars drive in procession through the prohibited area. Ban was instituted to protect clam beds. Protest leaders claim restriction hurt local business.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547499","557475","550922","545857","547478","547495","550934","545237","550925","550933","550921","548929","545849","548698","543208","543370"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","protest","demonstration","windshield","car","statement","vehicle","pickup","usage","stretch"]}
