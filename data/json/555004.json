{"path":"555004.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a plant, specifically focusing on young pine buds. The central subject is a conifer shoot where the needle-like leaves display a vibrant, fresh green color, and there are hints of moisture on the buds, possibly due to dew or recent rain, as evidenced by visible water droplets. This shoot is at the forefront and is detailed, showing textures and colors vividly against a softer, blurred background.\n\nThe main shoot in the center is partially covered by a translucent, whitish protective layer which appears to be peeling off, indicating that the bud is at a stage of growth where it is beginning to open. Surrounding this central shoot are several other smaller shoots forming in a radial pattern around it, all showing similar characteristics of youthful growth and dewdrops. \n\nThe background of the image is out of focus, which creates a bokeh effect with various shades of green and patches of darker tones. This blurred effect ensures that the viewer's attention is concentrated on the sharpness of the buds in the foreground. The overall mood of the image is serene and embodies the essence of a moist, verdant environment, typical of a coniferous forest habitat.","title":"Closeup of new growth on a 10-year old spruce on a south facing slope in olympic national timberland, Washington.
