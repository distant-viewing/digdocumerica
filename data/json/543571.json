{"path":"543571.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene likely situated in a rural or mountainous area. Prominently featured in the image are several large, round, water treatment or storage tanks. These structures are widely spaced and vary in size, with some tanks containing visible water and others appearing empty or under maintenance.\n\nIn the center and left of the image, there is a building equipped with modern-looking piping and possibly ventilation systems. The building and tanks are connected by a series of paved roads or walkways, suggesting accessibility for maintenance and operational activities.\n\nThe background offers a striking contrast to the industrial foreground, showcasing a scenic view of a densely forested area with mountains, which are partially covered with snow, indicating a cold or alpine location. The sky is overcast, adding to the cool and secluded atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, this photo depicts a water treatment facility, intelligently planned and constructed in harmony with its natural, picturesque environment. The facility seems to handle a significant capacity, judging by the number of tanks and the robustness of the infrastructure.","title":"S.
