{"path":"544861.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape, featuring a meandering river flowing through a forested area. The river, filled with clear, shimmering water, curves gently and has several shallow rapids visible where the water cascades over rocks. The banks of the river are lined with a mixture of green grassy patches and melting snow, indicating a transition between winter and spring.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is densely populated with tall coniferous trees, primarily pine trees, which are prominent throughout the image. The trees display deep green tones, suggesting a healthy, lush environment. Some areas around the riverbanks show brownish grass, possibly damp or in early stages of spring growth.\n\nThe natural light in the photograph suggests it was taken on a bright day, with sunlight filtering through the trees and reflecting off the river's surface, creating a vibrant and picturesque setting. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, emphasizing the pristine and untouched nature of the landscape.\n\nOverall, this image depicts a tranquil, wooded riverscape where the beauty of nature is at the forefront, untouched by urban development. It evokes a sense of peacefulness and the enduring quality of natural environments.","title":"West dolores river","placename":"West Dolores River (Colo.)","location":"West Dolores River, Colorado","nn1":["550656","555075","542844","555076","542523","546171","542653","550700","550845","551348","550839","557250","548156","554762","550658","550542"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","spring","damp","riverscape","melt","rapid","endure","peacefulness","tree","cascade"]}
