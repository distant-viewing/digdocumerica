{"path":"554387.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage indoor event, possibly an auto show from a bygone era. The setting is a large room with vibrant red carpeting and extensive rectangular ceiling lights that contribute to a bright and warm ambiance. The walls are draped in red fabric, creating a dramatic, glamorous look.\n\nIn the foreground, three men, possibly salesmen or event staff, are dressed in white dinner jackets with black bow ties and cummerbunds. They stand near the entrance, marked by pillar-like red drapery. One of these men stands prominently in the foreground, facing slightly towards the camera, with his arms crossed and a serious expression. In the middle background, another group of people, including men in similar attire and a woman in a dark outfit, can be seen discussing among themselves.\n\nBehind these individuals, the main attraction of the event, various classic cars, are displayed. The cars come in different shades and types, indicating a diverse showcase. These beautifully polished vehicles give the setting an air of sophistication and luxury.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its deep red tones, sharp attire, and elegant automobiles, evokes a sense of mid-century style and opulence.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554385","554389","554373","554372","554390","556703","554388","554375","552803","554377","554376","552412","554381","554384","554371","557900"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["event","showcase","luxury","auto","staff","attraction","show","pillar","bow","automobile"]}
