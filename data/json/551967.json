{"path":"551967.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil yet playful moment between two individuals by the water. The primary focus is on the interaction between a man and a woman on a series of rocky outcrops in what appears to be a calm body of water.\n\nThe man, standing with his back to the camera, holds a yellow Frisbee in his left hand and extends his right hand towards the woman. He wears a white t-shirt and brown pants. His stance, leaning slightly forward, suggests a gesture of assistance or play.\n\nThe woman, in contrast, faces the viewer but bows her head slightly as she reaches out to take the man's hand. She sports a fashionable and relaxed look with a dark, bucket-style hat, sleeveless dark top, and long pants. Her careful gesture and downward gaze indicate she is likely stepping from one rock to another, assisted by the manâ€™s hand for balance.\n\nThe background is a smooth gradation of blue, likely a mix of sky and water, providing a minimalistic yet deep backdrop that accentuates the subjects. The calm water surrounding the rocks reflects a silvery blue hue, enhancing the peacefulness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of human connection, nature, and leisure in a serene environment, inviting the viewer to reflect on moments of gentle interaction and support.","title":"Out for a game of frisbee in Lincoln Park, couple picks their way along the rocks of Lake Michigan's shoreline.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["545489","548833","549471","554901","552977","550238","547834","546320","551450","543203","551859","548465","550234","545194","551945","548291"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["gesture","hand","woman","assistance","gradation","man","pant","outcrop","stance","rock"]}
