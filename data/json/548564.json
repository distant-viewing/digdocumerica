{"path":"548564.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man holding a shuffleboard cue, standing beside a large scoreboard. The man is dressed in light casual attire, consisting of a patterned short-sleeve button-up shirt and a white baseball cap, suggesting the setting might be in a warm or tropical environment, consistent with a recreational or vacation spot.\n\nThe focus of the image is sharply on the man and the cue he holds, which extends diagonally across the frame, adding a dynamic visual element. His facial expression appears focused and possibly contemplative, accentuated by his thick-rimmed glasses and the way the sunlight casts shadows on his face, highlighting features such as his deep-set eyes and determined mouth.\n\nIn the background, a scoreboard is visible, displaying various numbers in white chalk on a black surface. The scores, organized in rows and columns, add an interesting textual element to the scene, indicating ongoing gameplay and scoring.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting emphasize the leisure activity and the seriousness with which the man seems to approach the game, presenting shuffleboard not just as a casual pastime but as a competitive sport. The bright sunlight and shadows, along with the vivid colors, bring life and vibrancy to the scene, while the depth of field focuses attention on the man and his interaction with the shuffleboard cue.","title":"Photograph of man waiting to play shuffleboard at the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548567","548566","551757","553291","543975","544213","551759","551760","548580","553176","543484","558191","547427","546155","552103","551758"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["man","seriousness","vacation","baseball","game","bring","approach","sunlight","mouth","vibrancy"]}
