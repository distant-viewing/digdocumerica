{"path":"546447.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph displays an industrial or commercial building with a large and modern architectural design, primarily featuring metal paneling. The buildingâ€™s prominent feature is its uneven facade with parts jutting out asymmetrically. There are no visible windows except for what appears to be a darkened glass panel or opening towards the center.\n\nIn the foreground, a line of cars is parked parallelly, suggesting this might be a workplace. The variety of cars, mostly in sedan styles, varies in color including red, blue, white, and a few darker shades. This indicates the era of the photograph could be around the 1970s or 1980s, based on the vehicle designs.\n\nThe foreground is somewhat obscured by a wired fence, and foliage branches slightly into the upper part of the frame, giving a sense of the location being on the edge of a developed area perhaps bordering a more natural or undeveloped land.\n\nThe lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, as the sky carries a soft blue tone with scattered clouds, and the natural light casts mild shadows in the environment, softening the metallic and industrial feel of the building. The scene is devoid of humans, focusing solely on the architectural and automotive elements.","title":"Columbus East Senior High School, built in 1972","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546448","546702","555449","546866","556790","552002","550053","555748","554433","546481","550118","555908","549310","546538","546085","546464"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["workplace","paneling","jut","darken","soften","opening","sedan","car","design","develop"]}
