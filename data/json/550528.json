{"path":"550528.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking aerial view of a valley surrounded by mountains. The landscape is a mix of vibrant green fields and wooded areas, interspersed with hills that have gentle, rounded contours, giving the terrain a soft, undulating appearance. Several small bodies of water, including a noticeable lake, are scattered throughout the valley, reflecting the sky above and linking with narrow waterways that wind through the terrain.\n\nThe valley is nestled among several prominent mountain ranges that recede into the background under a haze, suggesting distance and an expansive geography. The mountains are marked by ridges that are softly illuminated, highlighting their textured surfaces, which vary between shades of green and earth tones. The topography suggests a remote, possibly wilderness area, evoking a sense of tranquility and untouched natural beauty.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, being shot from an elevated perspective, emphasizes the grandeur and vastness of the landscape. The angle allows for a comprehensive view of the valley and its geological features, presenting a panoramic insight into this serene and picturesque environment. The natural light seems to be coming from a direction that enhances the depth and richness of the colors in the landscape.","title":"Grayling creek valley, view north from south end at mile 250 route follows left (west) side of valley, paralleling an existing trail","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["552593","544892","550499","543746","557531","550509","555676","555678","546424","552582","550497","550525","550599","545313","550516","550634"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","mountain","insight","geography","richness","fields","shoot","breathtaking","hills","recede"]}
