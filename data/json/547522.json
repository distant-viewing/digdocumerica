{"path":"547522.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with several notable elements creating a serene yet somewhat desolate atmosphere. Prominently in the foreground, a charred, blackened wooden post stands upright, showing signs of weathering and age, possibly due to fire damage or natural decay. Its texture is rough and the top of the post is jagged, indicating wear.\n\nMoving beyond the post, the middle ground shows a stack or collection of old stone slabs and debris loosely piled up. The stones have various shapes and sizes, with some appearing quite flat, suggesting they might once have been part of a structure or wall. The surrounding ground is covered in dry, yellowish grass and leaf litter, indicating a lack of recent maintenance, perhaps hinting it's an abandoned area.\n\nThe background reveals a slightly undulating landscape, primarily barren with early spring or late autumn naked trees which suggest a chilly or stark time of year. There aren't any leaves on the trees, contributing to the overall stark and rugged feel of the scene. A pale, overcast sky suggests it might be a cold day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph utilizes a depth of field that emphasizes the foreground post and progressively reveals the rugged landscape and disarray in the environment. This setup might evoke feelings of solitude, history, and the march of time affecting man-made and natural structures.","title":"Foundation for a stone barn--all that remains of an abandoned farm in exeter","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["543104","547518","543122","551964","543718","552515","547404","543658","543722","552550","547514","544751","555629","555103","556313","554807"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["post","leaf","march","blacken","abandoned","stone","slab","reveal","chilly","disarray"]}
