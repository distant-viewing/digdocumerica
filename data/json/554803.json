{"path":"554803.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling rural landscape under an overcast sky. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills with patches of bare soil and sparse vegetation, suggesting it may be late autumn or early spring. One prominent feature is a quarry with exposed earth and rock formations, indicating some level of industrial activity. There are no visible bodies of water, but a mix of barren and lightly forested areas points to a diverse ecosystem.\n\nDominating the middle ground is a road or highway that curves gently through the landscape, bridged at one point to facilitate passage over a dip or small valley. Surrounding the road are fields that appear to be in fallow, possibly prepared for future agricultural use but currently empty.\n\nThe horizon is lined with intermittent groups of trees and a few distant buildings, hinting at a human presence and activity in this area. Despite the signs of human influence, there's a sense of quiet and the vast openness typical of rural settings. The overall mood is tranquil and somewhat lonely, emphasized by the muted colors and soft lighting conditions.","title":"This unproductive land once was rolling farmland.
