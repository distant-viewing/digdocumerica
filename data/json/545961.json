{"path":"545961.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features five children sitting on what appears to be a wooden fishing boat. To the right of the image, part of a white-painted structure with peeling paint is visible, possibly part of the boat or an adjacent building. The background shows a serene body of water that extends into a calm horizon, bordered by marshy vegetation and a clear blue sky.\n\nThe children, four boys and one girl, are dressed in casual, brightly colored clothing typical of a cool weather setting. The eldest boy at the back holds a slingshot, suggesting they might be engaged in playful activities or exploring the surroundings. The children are sitting along the length of the boat, which shows signs of weathering and use, such as peeling paint and worn wood.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, the setting is peaceful and somewhat adventurous, implying a moment of leisure or a break from fishing. The reflections of blue sky and the natural environment on the water add a sense of calm and beauty to the scene. The presence of industrial machinery in the far background contrasts with the simplicity and somewhat playful nature of the children's activity.","title":"Children of fishermen on old fishing boat.
