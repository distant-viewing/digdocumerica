{"path":"551456.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene dominated by a bicycle parking area on a paved street. In the foreground, a cluster of bicycles is densely packed into a bike rack, with one prominently displayed red bicycle having a white basket fitted at its front. The bicycles vary in color and design, indicating a mix of personal styles and preferences of the cyclists.\n\nBehind the bicycle area, the setting is a busy urban street lined with tall buildings, imparting a sense of a bustling city environment. To the left, there is a building with a modern glass facade reflecting the surrounding architecture and sky. On the right, older, traditional buildings can be seen, displaying a contrast in architectural styles.\n\nThe background is also home to a couple of pedestrians, adding life to the scene. They appear to be young women, casually dressed, and walking along the pavement, further contributing to the urban, everyday life atmosphere.\n\nFurther enhancing the urban feel, there are street lamps with multiple globes perched on poles, positioned along the street. These lamps, along with the buildings and the busy street, provide context to a typical mid- to large-sized city setting. The presence of trees interspersed along the sidewalk helps soften the harshness of the urban environment, adding a touch of nature and greenery to the scene.","title":"Bicycle parking rack on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551443","554312","551645","551464","556708","551465","551646","547199","551864","551496","549875","548388","547032","546715","550126","551478"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bicycle","street","preference","facay","cyclist","harshness","urban","impart","fit","rack"]}
