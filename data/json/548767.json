{"path":"548767.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of fishing gear, likely associated with lobster or crab fishing. On the left side of the image, there's a large pile of thick ropes or cords, mostly coiled and placed atop a wooden crate. These ropes appear weathered, indicating frequent use. Adjacent to these, on the right, there are multiple trays or crates, also made of wood, which are stacked together.\n\nStrung along the crates are numerous round floats tied with ropes. These floats are predominantly painted in a pattern of blue and yellow segments, suggesting they serve both a functional and possibly regulatory role (color-coding for ownership or fishing area might be implied). The floats and their attached chains show signs of wear and exposure, common in maritime equipment.\n\nIn the background, but out of focus, a surface that might be either the ground or part of a dock or boat deck is visible, reinforcing the maritime theme of the image. The setting suggests outdoor storage or preparation area, typical in coastal or fishing areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on equipment and lack of human presence, highlights the tools of the trade in marine fishing operations. The arrangement and state of the gear convey a sense of ongoing use and the practical realities of fishing industries.","title":"Lobster fisherman's gear at Conch Key during the off-season. At this time, the fishermen repair their traps and repaint their floats. Each man has an identifying color and number. Thousands of traps are stored all over the little island.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546943","550305","548789","545189","545061","545093","552298","547552","550306","548228","544995","552301","547562","544264","552300","545185"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fishing","float","crate","rope","gear","cord","ownership","crab","tray","trade"]}
