{"path":"548163.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a person's hands filling out a form titled “OREGON DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.” The form is attached to a clipboard. The person is using a pen to write on the form, which appears to be a data recording sheet for fish damage surveys, specifically relating to damages by sea lions. The sheet includes columns titled 'Date,' 'Count,' 'Males,' 'Females,' 'Pups,' and 'Total.' The form displays a date at the top: \"3/21/73.\"\n\nThe person’s hands and part of their lower arms are visible, showing detail such as skin texture and a wristwatch. The background of the image is a soft, out-of-focus bluish color, contributing to a faded vintage feel. Overall, the image captures a moment of detailed observational work or surveying in a natural resource management setting. The lighting in the image is soft, creating a somewhat moody atmosphere.","title":"Member of the Oregon rats mountaineers' club filling in a snow survey form for the soil conservation service.
