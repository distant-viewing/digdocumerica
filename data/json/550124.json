{"path":"550124.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a two-story residential house characterized by traditional American architectural elements. The house has a pitched roof and is clad in horizontal siding, predominantly painted in a light, muted color, possibly yellow or beige. The eaves and distinct trim around the house are a darker hue, providing a contrasting detail. \n\nThe front of the house features several windows equipped with white shutters, which add to its quaint, classic aesthetic. There are two visible windows on the upper story and at least one window on the lower story near what appears to be an enclosed porch area. Each window consists of multiple panes, suggesting an older style common in traditional residential designs.\n\nThe house boasts a covered porch that runs the length of visible the facade. The porch roof is supported by narrow columns, possibly wooden, which are simple in design. The porch itself adds a welcoming touch and provides a shaded outdoor area.\n\nIn front of the porch, there is a prominent white picket fence that matches the trim on the house. This fence features a traditional design with evenly spaced pickets capped with pointed tips, enhancing the residential and homely feel of the scene. The gate to the fence is slightly open, inviting entry.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a suburban or small-town context given the presence of another structure closely situated to the side of the house shown. The right-hand side of the image slightly cuts into a neighboring house or building, covered partly by scaffolding, indicating construction or renovation work.\n\nThe surrounding area is mainly clear with a blue sky overhead and no visible vegetation overshadowing the house, suggesting the photo was taken on a bright, clear day. The angle and lighting highlight the architectural features and the neat, maintained appearance of the property.","title":"Renovated home on jay street--part of Ohio city area renewal project","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546429","558155","546433","557094","557076","546442","557326","548667","548295","546439","554697","558153","558035","550121","558036","556950"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","porch","fence","story","window","trim","eave","neighbor","pitched","picket"]}
