{"path":"557711.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a parade featuring members of a Historical Society. The scene takes place in an outdoor setting, presumably along a parade route given the audience and setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a central figure, an elderly woman, is seated on a vintage wooden rocking chair inside a float. She wears traditional, perhaps period-specific, attire including a patterned blouse and a floral scarf around her neck. Additionally, she wears glasses and a patterned bonnet. The woman is holding an object that looks like a piece of fabric or small flag.\n\nBeside her, on the float, there are other participants. One is a younger individual facing away from the camera, wearing a blue shirt and having short dark hair. Another person visible only through their traditional and vivid clothing stands closer to the back of the float.\n\nThe float is decorated patriotically with American flags and bunting bearing star motifs predominantly in red, white, and blue. Behind the participants, there is a large sign that reads \"HISTORICAL SOCIETY\" in bold, white letters against a navy-blue background, and it is flanked by various flags including the American flag and a flag resembling those used during the Confederate states, providing a historic context.\n\nThe backdrop displays a lush green lawn, suggesting the parade is possibly taking place in a park or a similar recreational area. The atmosphere appears festive and historical, reflecting a celebration or recognition of a past era, likely as part of a community event or holiday celebration.","title":"White county historical society float in a fourth of july parade down main street in helen, Georgia, near robertstown.
