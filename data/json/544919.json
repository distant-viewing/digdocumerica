{"path":"544919.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts an ancient ruin, possibly from a Native American pueblo. The structure is made of reddish-brown stone or adobe, giving it an earthy and rugged appearance. The walls feature remnants of what appear to be rooms or storage areas, characterized by their straight, clean lines that contrast with the naturally worn surfaces. There are multiple square and rectangular openings that resemble windows or passages, evenly spaced and framed by thicker wall sections.\n\nThe interior is dimly lit, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken at dusk or in a shaded area. The background is completely dark, which accentuates the edges and the forms of the stonework, highlighting the architectural and historical significance of the structure. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of quiet solitude and the passage of time, evoking a sense of mystery about the people who once inhabited this space.","title":"Cliff Palace is the largest remaining village of the pre-Columbian Indians.
