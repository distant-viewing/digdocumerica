{"path":"546747.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and congested highway during what appears to be either early morning or evening, as indicated by the active vehicle headlights and the overall dim lighting. The roadway is wet, suggesting recent rain, and reflects the lights of the numerous cars, enhancing the dramatic feel of the image.\n\nThe highway is filled with various types of vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses. Notably, there are three buses in the foreground, traveling closer to the camera, with their headlights and route indicators brightly lit, making them prominent features of the scene.\n\nThe composition shows the highway curving gently to the left as it recedes into the background, lined by guardrails and illuminated by streetlights. An overpass crosses the highway, adding a structural element to the upper part of the frame. The scene is further framed by signs and a directional arrow on the right, indicating lane usage or navigation information, likely to assist drivers in navigating the road.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is one of a typical rush hour where commuters are either heading to their destination or returning home, highlighted by the glowing lights and reflective wet surface that add a vivid texture to the photograph.","title":"Shirley Highway during evening rush hour","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546644","546739","553894","546629","553726","542764","546591","546571","546586","549890","549902","553727","547823","547811","556194","546610"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","headlight","bus","indicator","streetlight","return","guardrail","arrow","commuter","overpass"]}
