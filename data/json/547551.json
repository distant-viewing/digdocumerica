{"path":"547551.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures an active scene aboard a fishing vessel. Several fishermen, wearing yellow and red rain gear, are engaged in managing a large haul of fish. A prominent feature is a net full of silvery fish that is being hoisted out of the water, creating a cascade of water as the fish tumble into the sorting area. The deck of the ship is visible, covered almost entirely with a thick layer of these freshly caught fish, evidencing a successful fishing trip.\n\nThe ocean forms a tranquil blue backdrop that softly contrasts with the vibrant activity on the boat. The fishermen appear focused and busy, emphasizing the labor-intensive nature of their work. The image effectively portrays the physical effort required in commercial fishing and documents a moment filled with action and the tangible results of the fishermenâ€™s efforts.","title":"Fishermen load fish from trap net onto their boats.
