{"path":"549791.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image depicts an industrial scene focused on waste management, with a vivid portrayal of a landfill or dumpsite. The main object in the image is a large, yellow crane with a hooked metal claw, actively engaged in handling garbage. The claw is in the process of either depositing or picking up a mixed load of trash, which includes items like scraps of paper, plastic, fabric, and possibly metal pieces among other miscellaneous debris.\n\nThe garbage is being handled over a large, rusty-colored dumpster which is labeled with the faded word \"ATHEY\" visible across its side. The dumpster sits beside another similar one, partially visible to the right, and these are used to contain the garbage either for transport or segregation.\n\nThe background shows a clear blue sky, implying the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. There is no vegetation or other structures that can be seen in the immediate vicinity, suggesting the location is a designated waste management area, possibly remote from residential zones.\n\nThe overall composition of the image gives a stark impression of waste management processes, emphasizing themes of industrial activity and environmental impact.","title":"At Staten Island landfill steam shovel loads carts with garbage brought by barge from Manhattan.
