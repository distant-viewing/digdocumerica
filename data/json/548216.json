{"path":"548216.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial view of a water treatment facility. The image prominently features large sedimentation tanks filled with muddy brown water. These tanks are divided by walkways and equipped with several rows of V-shaped metallic slats, presumably for the purpose of aiding in the sedimentation process.\n\nIn the background, you can observe a variety of industrial buildings with flat roofs. These structures appear functional, typical of an industrial or commercial area. A few trees and a relatively flat landscape suggest that the facility is located in a sprawling urban or suburban setting.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, providing a contrast of light and shadow over the scene. This environmental setting emphasizes the industrial nature and extensive infrastructure required to manage and treat water in a populated area. The facility's design and the water's murky color underline its purpose in water processing and treatment.","title":"City of Portland Columbia boulevard sewage treatment plant","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547239","548212","547260","546895","547262","547257","547568","549636","543572","547252","545840","547681","543574","553837","543573","553900"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["facility","treat","purpose","slat","tanks","populated","water","treatment","sprawling","require"]}
