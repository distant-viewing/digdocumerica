{"path":"551005.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features three young girls standing outdoors on a grassy area. The girl on the left has blonde hair and is wearing a long-sleeve, horizontal striped shirt paired with light blue shorts. She is smiling and seems to be giggling. The girl in the middle has curly red hair and is wearing a sleeveless red and black plaid dress. The third girl, on the right, has dark skin and is wearing a white trimmed blue dress with blue and black patterns and a matching headscarf. She stands with her arms crossed and has a serious facial expression.\n\nIn the background, there is a simple, low-lying building painted in white, with a red roof and a part where the paint has peeled off, revealing the darker material underneath. Surrounding the area are various trees and a wooden fence that appears to be slightly worn out. The overall environment suggests a warm, sunny day in a rural or suburban setting. The mood conveyed through the different expressions and stances of the girls varies from joyful to somewhat serious, adding a layer of depth to the scene.","title":"Rand, wv., with much of its population living in poverty, has many unpaved roads, substandard houses, and junked autoMobiles","placename":"Charleston (W.
