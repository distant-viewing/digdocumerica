{"path":"557386.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, likely a factory or plant of some kind. The focus of the image is on a large structure consisting of multiple parts. This structure includes several large vertical cylindrical tanks that are prominently featured against the sky. These tanks are dark in color, towering, and arranged in a tight group, casting shadows on each other.\n\nTo the right of the tanks, there is a building with vertical ribbed siding, also in deep tones, potentially hinting at metal construction materials like steel or iron. This structure appears to span the background of multiple tanks, suggesting a connection or part of the same facility.\n\nIn front of these elements is an intricate framework of metal scaffolding or support structures, painted dark, which adds a complex geometric pattern to the composition. It surrounds some lower rectangular buildings or containers that are part of the industrial setup.\n\nForeground details include a variety of industrial objects scattered around the site, such as barrels, smaller tanks, and construction materials. There are also visible stairways and platforms, indicating access points for workers to maneuver around the site.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a man walking. He is dressed in light-colored clothing with a hard hat, indicating he might be a worker or inspector. His presence provides a sense of scale, underscoring the enormity of the industrial structures surrounding him.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is utilitarian and stark, typical of industrial zones, focusing fully on the function and structure of the facilities. The light appears to be natural, suggesting the photograph was taken during daylight hours.","title":"Closeup of cooling towers at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.  Smoke from the metallurgical furnaces is passed through the towers to cool it enough so precipitates are dropped into bags for collection.  Furnace emissions have decreased 97.7 percent since 1967.
