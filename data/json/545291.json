{"path":"545291.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a cluster of wildflowers, capturing the intricate details of their seed heads and fluffy, dandelion-like tufts. These seed heads are in various stages of bloom and dispersion, with some still tightly closed and fuzzy, and others open and disheveled as they release seeds into the air. The flowers' stems and leaves are slender and green, intertwining with each other and dominating the foreground of the image.\n\nIn the background, a soft, blurry field of yellow and green hints at a meadow lush with other wildflowers and foliage, bathed in natural light. The focus on the flowers against this muted backdrop highlights their delicate textures and natural beauty, creating a serene and somewhat ephemeral atmosphere. The overall composition of the photograph, with its depth of field and natural color palette, emphasizes the themes of growth, decay, and renewal inherent in wild flora.","title":"Wildflowers along the coast of San Juan island","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554745","554574","549230","547642","543596","557167","550781","553368","544443","545695","543197","557098","542970","553076","544876","557487"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seed","wildflower","renewal","tuft","dandelion","head","flower","release","meadow","intertwine"]}
