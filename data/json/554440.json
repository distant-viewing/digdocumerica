{"path":"554440.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a man standing in a forested area facing a large, dark outhouse-like structure. The man is dressed in a plaid shirt, jeans, and a camouflaged baseball cap. He appears to be entering or closely examining the structure.\n\nThe building is tall and oriented vertically, constructed from dark materials, possibly wood. It has a simple, straightforward design without windows and appears slightly weathered, blending in with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe setting is a dense forest, richly filled with various types of trees and underbrush. Sunlight is filtering through the leaves, indicating it might be either late morning or early afternoon. The natural light casts soft patterns on the ground and on the side of the building, giving the scene a serene and secluded ambiance.\n\nOverall, the composition suggests a scene of exploration or maintenance in a natural, outdoor setting, emphasizing themes of solitude and interaction with nature.","title":"Outdoor plumbing--part of a typical backwoods hunting--fishing camp.
