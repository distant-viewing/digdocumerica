{"path":"542589.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a vast, rural landscape under a clear, bright sky. The foreground is dominated by an expansive field of dry, golden crops that extend towards the horizon. The texture of the field suggests it could be wheat or a similar grain nearing harvest time.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is a significant industrial setup with numerous large, white storage tanks, arranged in two neat rows. These cylindrical facilities, distinct against the landscape, are typically used for storing liquids like oil, chemicals, or water.\n\nBeyond the industrial area, the background features a rolling range of mountains with subtle undulations. The mountains appear somewhat barren, with earthy tones that suggest a semi-arid or desert climate. The clear sky above has a soft gradient, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light, contributing to the calm atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural, agricultural foreground with the industrialized mid-ground, suggesting themes of economic activity and possibly the interaction between agricultural and industrial sectors in a rural setting.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542553","545971","544676","554807","549191","553933","543668","555588","555641","543764","552544","544552","554055","554015","553698","543159"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["wheat","harvest","sector","undulation","mountain","grain","liquid","field","oil","chemical"]}
