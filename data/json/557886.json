{"path":"557886.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a large industrial or transportation facility, maybe a bus or train station. The image displays an expansive interior with high ceilings and abundant windows letting in natural light. There are several rows of fluorescent lights running across the ceiling, adding artificial illumination to the space.\n\nThe floor is concrete, and several vehicles, including cars and possibly small buses or vans, are parked or moving through the facility. Notably, the space is interspersed with various columns supporting the structure.\n\nA few people are visible in the image. Some appear to be walking or standing, possibly engaged in conversation or waiting. In the foreground, a man stands beside a car, engaged in an activity that involves the vehicle. Other individuals are scattered throughout, perhaps performing tasks related to transportation or maintenance.\n\nThe image is tinged with a muted, somewhat dark tone, suggesting it was taken either in the early morning or late evening when daylight is fading. Decorative elements like hanging red lanterns suggest some cultural or festive context, possibly in an Asian locale or during a celebration period. The overall atmosphere is busy yet orderly, with a sense of quiet activity typical of a transit-related facility.\n","title":"Interior of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, with employees in the background testing a car's headlight alignment. All city motorists must go through an annual safety check. Previous to January, 1975, it was a semi-annual event. It was changed with the addition of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions testing for all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles. Officials expected 115,000 vehicles in the city to be emissions tested during 1975.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557845","556679","556703","556054","556069","556680","556024","556055","557884","556686","549670","556825","557913","557905","556021","556674"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","ceiling","facility","transportation","lantern","locale","celebration","standing","van","illumination"]}
