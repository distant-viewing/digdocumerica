{"path":"550266.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a large dump truck tipping its bed to unload dark material, possibly soil or coal, in an industrial or construction environment. The ground is vastly uneven and textured, possibly muddy, which scatters into patches and lumps around the area. The terrain appears rugged and heavily impacted by industrial activity.\n\nAt the back of the dump truck, a smaller, red heavy-duty truck can be seen, possibly involved in the handling or transport of the materials being dumped. One person, wearing light-colored clothing, stands near this truck, observing the unloading process.\n\nThe environment around the trucks shows no vegetation, consisting mainly of dark, muddied earth and scattered piles of the same material being unloaded. In the distant background, there is a faint outline of trees and a clearer landscape, suggesting that this industrial activity might be on the outskirts of a more rural area. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene, emphasizing the industrial starkness of the setting.","title":"Sludge from Cleveland's southern disposal unit is being used to reclaim strip-mined land at the Keller Coal Company.","placename":"Alliance (Ohio)","location":"Alliance, Ohio","nn1":["547922","550270","547232","555636","549956","542538","544135","547243","543896","553041","543785","544099","547104","555638","549743","554765"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["truck","dump","material","starkness","unloading","coal","outskirt","handling","duty","bed"]}
