{"path":"550698.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, turbulent river scene. The river, appearing quite wide and powerful, takes over much of the foreground with its muddy brown waters churned into frothy, white-capped waves, suggesting strong currents and possibly recent rainfalls that have stirred up silt and sediment. The river banks are just barely visible on the left, lined with dense greenery, indicating a natural, possibly untouched or minimally developed location.\n\nIn the background, a large hill or low mountain covered in thick forest rises steeply from the river's edge. The trees, mostly uniform in height and lush green, suggest a temperate climate and potentially a remote area not widely impacted by urban development. The sky, visibly in the top portion of the image, appears overcast with a bluish-grey hue, adding to the scene's dramatic and natural ambiance.\n\nThere are no visible structures or people; the scene is purely natural and might be of interest for those studying ecology, river dynamics, or simply appreciating wild, natural landscapes. The image evokes a sense of solitude and the raw power of nature.","title":"Androscoggin River showing outflow from the paper mill at Cascade","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550658","550742","553653","550367","549550","542537","542743","553855","552953","550655","553420","553416","555214","548156","553414","553003"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","silt","stir","churn","appreciate","dynamic","rainfall","current","sediment","study"]}
