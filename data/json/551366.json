{"path":"551366.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of an outdoor setting where a lizard is seen resting on a rock. The environment includes leafy green plants surrounding the focal point where the lizard is located, contributing to a natural, lush setting. The rock surface upon which the lizard lies is irregular in shape with a rough texture, and may exhibit varying colors such as grays or browns, blending with the dirt and natural debris around it.\n\nThe lizard itself has a mottled appearance, possibly providing camouflage against the rocky background. Its scales reflect a mix of browns and muted tones which help it merge with its surroundings. The image is somewhat shadowy with spots of sunlight filtering through the foliage above, creating a dappled light effect on the rock and lizard.\n\nThis serene scene mainly evokes a sense of quiet and seclusion, typically found in a natural habitat untouched by urban disturbances. The focus and composition of the image emphasize the lizard in its natural environment, showcasing the animal's interaction with its surroundings.","title":"Lizard stretches out on rock near the shore of ha ha tonka lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543778","545553","544622","551250","549459","544908","547635","554594","554596","550476","558083","551331","544904","549145","554410","553358"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["browns","rock","mottled","camouflage","surroundings","seclusion","disturbance","merge","habitat","find"]}
