{"path":"552709.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene focused on a busy toll bridge. It appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as the lighting is soft and has a warm hue, suggesting the sun might be low in the sky. The bridge is packed with numerous vehicles, suggesting a peak traffic hour.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a toll booth with barriers and red traffic signals, indicating the cars are waiting to pay or pass through. The toll booth has a numerical indicator (marked \"2\"), likely displaying the lane number. The cars exhibit a wide variety of models and sizes, tightly packed in a gridlock.\n\nThe composition leads the viewer's eye towards the towering structures of the bridge in the background, which emerge through a slightly hazy atmosphere. The sheer number of cars, alongside the grandeur of the bridge and the mellow lighting, together create a dynamic scene capturing the essence of daily city commute and infrastructure.","title":"Walt whitman bridge crosses the Delaware river at south Philadelphia, leads to New Jersey suburbs","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552708","548341","549861","550986","549878","553846","548401","549857","548389","549887","548418","546724","542682","546704","556194","548414"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["bridge","booth","number","indicator","traffic","pay","commute","signal","pass","emerge"]}
