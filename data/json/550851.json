{"path":"550851.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful fishing scene by a body of water, possibly a river or lake. Two people are seated on a wooden dock which extends into the water, surrounded by lush green foliage.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the dock, there is a woman seated on a white folding chair. She appears to be fishing, as she is holding a fishing rod that extends over the water. She is dressed casually in a short-sleeve blouse and pants, and her hair is styled in a short cut. Next to her, there is a gray jacket draped over the back of her chair and various fishing gear and containers are placed around her on the dock.\n\nBeside her and to the right, a man is seated directly on the dock with his legs hanging over the edge. He is looking down, possibly tending to a fishing line or bait. He wears a short-sleeve, plaid button-up shirt and dark shorts. Behind him, on the dock, there are more fishing related items, such as a tackle box and buckets, indicating preparation for a sustained fishing activity.\n\nThe background features gently shimmering water reflecting the light, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The edges of the photograph are framed by out-of-focus green foliage, giving it a secluded and intimate feel. The entire setting conveys a serene, leisurely day spent indulging in the timeless pastime of fishing in nature.","title":"Fishing on the fox river near montello.
