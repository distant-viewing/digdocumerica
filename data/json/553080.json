{"path":"553080.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image features a serene rural landscape dominated by a wide, tranquil canal that stretches away into the distance under a vast sky. The water reflects fluffy, expressive clouds which span across the impressive expanse of sky, appearing against a pale blue background dotted occasionally with patches of white and darker clouds. Adding to the tranquility are the smooth ripples on the water's surface which catch the light, creating small highlights and adding a gentle texture.\n\nOn either side of the canal, green vegetation, including grass and a line of trees, frames the waterway, reinforcing the peacefulness and natural setting of the scene. The left bank of the canal also shows a small cluster of houses or farm structures in the mid-distance, suggesting a rural community setting.\n\nFurther enriching the composition, in the foreground of the canal, there is a small boat, possibly a canoe, with an individual who seems to be either fishing or simply enjoying the stillness of the water. In the background, a bridge spans the canal, providing a connection between the two sides and adding a sense of depth to the landscape.\n\nAbove all, this photograph captures the essence of a quiet, pastoral scene, likely intended to evoke a sense of peacefulness and the beauty of a simple, nature-filled life. The capture of natural light, the presence of lush greenery, and the leisure activity hint at a lifestyle connected closely with nature and the outdoors.","title":"Diversionary canal of the Truckee River at Fernley is part of the Newlands Irrigation Project.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["558016","558002","553083","542631","552733","548030","550778","550773","551216","547965","557106","550324","550779","550831","557091","557972"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["canal","peacefulness","canoe","capture","lifestyle","cloud","highlight","outdoor","stillness","connection"]}
