{"path":"549605.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a focused man conducting a laboratory experiment indoors. He appears to be using a pipette to dispense a liquid into an Erlenmeyer flask that is set up on a white, square-shaped platform surrounded by a metal stand. The man has medium-length brown hair and a mustache. He is wearing a light blue shirt with his sleeves rolled up to his forearms, emphasizing a hands-on working scenario. \n\nThe environment around the man suggests a scientific research setting, with visible equipment like a burette stand holding a graduated cylinder, indicating precision in the experiment. There is a desk lamp with an exposed bulb on the left side, providing direct illumination to the workspace, which is essential for detail-oriented tasks. The background is somewhat blurred but shows some clutter, possibly other laboratory tools and equipment, reflecting a typical research or laboratory atmosphere. The overall mood is one of concentration and meticulousness, typical of scientific or laboratory work.\n","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
