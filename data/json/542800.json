{"path":"542800.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and tranquil scene at a beach during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, diffused light and long shadows. The image features three riders on horseback traveling along the wet sand near the water's edge. The horses and riders are silhouetted against the bright background, which is dominated by a low sun near the horizon, casting a golden reflection on the water and wet sand.\n\nThe riders are in casual attire suitable for riding, and they are positioned towards the left side of the frame, moving towards the right. The beach environment includes gentle waves lapping at the shore, and the coastline extends into the distance, bordered by a rocky headland or hill. The sky above is clear, with just a few thin clouds near the horizon, enhancing the peaceful and vast feeling of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition uses the rule of thirds, with the horizon placed towards the upper third of the frame, emphasizing both the expanse of the beach and the movement of the horses and riders. The reflection of the sunlight on the water creates a path that leads the eye through the scene, adding depth and a sense of motion. This photograph evokes themes of freedom, nature, and companionship.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542806","543014","542885","543071","542956","542966","542810","543366","542891","544414","544308","553102","557992","553116","542972","557186"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["rider","third","beach","horse","sand","lapping","rule","horizon","riding","horseback"]}
