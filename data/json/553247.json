{"path":"553247.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image features a creative and visually intricate setting with people and urban architecture. The foreground shows an assembly of variously sized gong-like components, suspended within a frame made of metal tubing. These objects, some of which bear noticeable inscriptions and wear, interlay creating a dynamic and somewhat industrial composition. The focal point clearly draws the viewer's eye through the metallic structure toward the backdrop.\n\nIn the background, a tall, modern skyscraper with vertical lines dominates the upper half of the photo. The building's reflective facade adds to the urban feel. Below this, at ground level, is a public space where a group of people is gathered. This scene captures a slice of daily life; individuals and small groups appear engaged in casual walking or conversation. They are dressed in typical casual to smart casual attire, suggesting a day-time, non-formal event or routine urban activity.\n\nThis image likely combines elements of public art and city life, merging a casual social atmosphere with an artistic urban installation, all framed against the backdrop of a bustling cityscape.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
