{"path":"557153.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features two elderly women engaged in a crafting activity. The setting seems to be an indoor workshop environment. On the right side of the image, there is a woman with silver hair and glasses, bent forward intently over her work. She is sewing or weaving with a concentration that is reflected in her closely scrutinizing eyes and slight frown. This woman wears a simple, striped top, and her earnest focus on the task at hand highlights her involvement in the craft.\n\nOn the background and partially blurred is another woman, sitting in a blue sweater, glasses perched on her nose, and looking towards the activity of the woman in the foreground, possibly learning or observing her technique. Her posture and facial expression convey interest and attentiveness.\n\nIn the foreground, the object of their focus appears to be a piece of handicraft, particularly noticeable is what seems like leatherwork on a large, flat surface that occupies the foreground. The craft piece involves stitching and fabric, evident from what can be seen over the table. \n\nThe overall ambience of the room suggests a workspace dedicated to artistic or craft activities, with what appears to be paper or patterns hanging in the background, which adds to the creative and productive atmosphere of the setting. The natural light diffusing into the room enhances the focus and seriousness with which the women are immersed in their craft. This image portrays a serene moment of artistic creation, traditional skills and shared knowledge between generations.","title":"\"broken fireplace\", older gRanddaughter of Iowa indian chief White Cloud, right, makes fringe for a shawl at the indian center in the town of White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy, in the northeast corner of the state.
