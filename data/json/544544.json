{"path":"544544.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph offers an elevated, wide-angle view of a landscape dominated by natural greenery punctuated by human-made structures. The focal feature is a series of parallel, white-lined pathways or roads stretching vertically down from the foreground into the dense greenery. The structured lines offer a stark contrast to the untamed appearance of the thick vegetation surrounding them.\n\nEach pathway is lined by what appears to be small, regularly spaced white rectangles or markers, possibly related to agricultural, surveying, or ecological research activities. The uniformity and precision of these markings suggest a controlled, possibly experimental environment within a natural setting.\n\nThe larger area is overwhelmingly green, hinting at a lush, densely forested or bushy terrain, stretching to the horizon where it meets a slightly hazy sky, indicating a vast, expansive wilderness. The sky is muted, with no visible clouds, contributing to the tranquil and secluded feel of the scene.\n\nThis setting can be indicative of a research facility, a forest management area, or an agricultural experiment station, typically found in remote natural regions dedicated to the study and management of the local flora. The exact purpose isn't apparent just from the image, but the structured nature of the paths amid the wilderness generally points to human intervention for scientific or management purposes.","title":"Cutler drain area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["556920","542821","556917","548598","542835","550540","553670","544446","557003","556938","552549","554164","556937","544560","555127","556933"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["management","research","pathway","wilderness","purpose","uniformity","offer","precision","experiment","marker"]}
