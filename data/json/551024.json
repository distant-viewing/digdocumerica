{"path":"551024.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene by a body of water, likely a river or pond. A person, who is seated, is fishing and facing away from the camera towards the water. The individual has short, light hair and is wearing knee-length shorts with no visible shirt, suggesting a warm, casual environment tailored for relaxation or recreational activities.\n\nThe surrounding area is a marshy shoreline dotted with natural debris; a massive fallen log dominates the foreground, stretching towards the water, partially submerged. This log adds a rustic, rugged quality to the scene and seems to be an integral part of the landscape. The ground is muddy and wet, imprinted with several footprints and scattered with small objects like a discarded container or a broken piece of board, hinting at human activity. \n\nThe lighting appears soft and subdued, indicating it might be a cloudy day or the image was taken in a shaded area. Overlying the peaceful scene is a reflection on the water's surface, capturing the sky and possibly surrounding foliage, which adds a mirror-like quality and depth to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of peaceful solitude and interaction with nature, focusing on the simple joy of fishing in a secluded spot.","title":"Young man fishes near a foul-smelling drainage ditch which flows into the Kanawha River.","placename":"Malden (W.
