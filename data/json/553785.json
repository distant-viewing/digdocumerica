{"path":"553785.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a striking and dynamic landscape, dominated by deep, rugged mountain ranges that recede into gentle slopes as they meet the valley. The image captures a winding highway that cuts through the valley, enhancing the sense of depth and scale. The road features multiple curves, subtly illuminated, possibly by the late afternoon or early evening light, creating a line of reflection that guides the eye through the various layers of the scene.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows patches of greenery and a few small structures that might serve as resting spots or maintenance hubs for travelers. There are also a few trees scattered around the area, adding a touch of life to the rocky environment. Adjacently, a body of water, reflecting a hint of the sky’s color, borders the highway, contributing to the overall tranquil yet majestic nature of the scenery.\n\nThe mountains in the background appear darker and more formidable, suggesting they are either further away or shaded from the sun’s setting rays. The skyline is jagged with peaks, providing a dramatic backdrop to the winding road in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting in the photo, along with the serene yet stark natural elements, lends the image a mysterious and almost ethereal quality, inviting contemplation of the vast, untouched wilderness. This photograph likely aims to capture the interplay of humanity's engineering with the raw, untamed beauty of the natural world, emphasizing a sense of isolation and tranquility within a grand scale.","title":"Litigation has suspended construction of the H-3 freeway opponents claim construction would damage Moanalua Valley which should be declared a national historic landmark.","placename":"Kaneohe (Hawaii)","location":"Kaneohe, Hawaii","nn1":["557558","555670","542735","550600","550634","553630","555665","542838","545367","550596","550497","543750","555861","544070","550592","550441"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["highway","valley","ray","traveler","scale","mountain","hub","engineering","world","road"]}
