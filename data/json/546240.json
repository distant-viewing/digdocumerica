{"path":"546240.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting with warning signs prominent in the foreground. The two signs, one in English and the other in Spanish, alert to the dangers present in the area. The English sign reads \"Danger Do Not Enter Waste Chemicals,\" while the Spanish sign translates to \"Danger No Entry Waste Chemicals.\" Both signs are mounted on metal posts and have a deep red background with white lettering, typical of warning signs meant to catch attention and convey urgency.\n\nIn the blurred background, an industrial complex is visible, characterized by tall structures that include towers and piping, possibly part of a chemical plant or refinery. These structures are metallic and have a skeletal appearance due to the visible beams and supporting structures. There appears to be no overt activity or people visible in the scene, suggesting automation or distant operation. The area surrounding the industrial installation includes open fields and puddles or small bodies of water reflecting the overcast sky, indicating a possibly marshy or wetland area that could be sensitive to environmental impacts from the plant. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of caution and industrial dominance over a natural landscape.","title":"Chemical plant","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["557412","546936","552212","545997","553905","543645","552211","544227","550255","552021","550917","548951","545949","548865","547014","545312"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["sign","warning","chemical","dominance","caution","refinery","danger","urgency","piping","puddle"]}
