{"path":"551169.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene involving hay harvesting. In the foreground to the right, there's a prominently displayed stack of hay bales loaded onto a flatbed trailer. This stack of hay bales serves as a central focus due to its close-up positioning and size within the frame.\n\nIn the middle ground, another scene unfolds where farm workers are actively engaged in loading a separate trailer with more hay bales. A red tractor is visible, pulling this loaded trailer. Another tractor is slightly visible in the background, suggesting ongoing multiple activities related to the hay collection process.\n\nThe background features a flat, expansive field under a wide, mostly clear sky with some small clouds. The setting appears to be in the late afternoon, given the quality of the light and the long shadows cast on the field, contributing to a peaceful rural atmosphere. Further in the distance, a line of trees marks the boundary of the field, adding a natural border to the expansive sky and field of harvested hay. These elements together highlight a typical farming activity during hay harvesting season, emphasizing both the machinery used and the manual labor involved.","title":"Farm on Route 35 near Pt.
