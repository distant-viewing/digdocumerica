{"path":"553406.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people involved in a rowing activity, possibly a team from a rowing club, carrying their rowing shell (a long, narrow boat designed for racing) over their shoulders as they walk along a wooden dock or bridge. The focus is on four individuals in the foreground.\n\nThe first individual on the left, partly out of frame, is a man holding the boat on his shoulder, wearing a white T-shirt and light-colored shorts. Next to him, three individuals are dressed in matching sleeveless striped tops and white shorts, possibly indicating they are teammates based on their uniform attire. Their expressions convey a sense of purpose or focus typically associated with preparing for a sports activity.\n\nThe setting is outdoors during a sunny day, suggested by the bright lighting and the abundance of lush green trees in the background that indicate a serene, natural environment such as a river or lake area, perfect for rowing. The calm water partially visible emphasizes the tranquility of the setting. The wooden walkway they are on is lined by dense foliage, enhancing the sense of an outdoor sports activity taking place in a peaceful, natural locale.","title":"Visiting crew at groton school on the Nashua river.
