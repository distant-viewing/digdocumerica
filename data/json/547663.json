{"path":"547663.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a calm and misty tidal flat landscape. The foreground is dominated by tall, dense grasses that are slightly swaying or bending, suggesting either a gentle breeze or the weight of moisture in the air. These grasses are a dark green color, perhaps slick with humidity or dew. Behind this grassy area, the middle of the photograph features an expanse of wet mudflat, interspersed with puddles of water and more patches of similar grass. This area extends towards a foggy horizon where the details blur into a hazy, indistinct background. The atmosphere of the image conveys a quiet sense of solitude, typical of misty or foggy coastal environments. The colors are muted, primarily in shades of dusky purple and murky greens, enhancing the feeling of a damp, early morning or late evening setting. There's a sense of stillness, with only minimal hints of wildlife or movement visible in this serene natural scene.","title":"Seapowet salt marsh at tiverton, home of the north east petroleum tanker terminal","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547924","547500","547604","545183","545294","544729","544687","545209","547544","547589","557014","547547","553856","550788","544515","545095"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["foggy","grass","mudflat","humidity","slick","sway","dew","weight","puddle","breeze"]}
