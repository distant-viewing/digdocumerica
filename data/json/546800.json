{"path":"546800.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people engaged in fishing from a rustic wooden dock. The dock, appearing somewhat aged and weathered, extends into a calm body of water that mirrors a softly clouded sky and the figures above. On the dock, there are five individuals. From left to right, three young children, each holding a fishing rod, seem focused on the water, possibly awaiting a catch. Next to them, a woman, also holding a fishing rod, stands attentively. At the far right, a man sits on the dock's edge, handling fishing equipment or bait.\n\nThe backdrop is entirely water with subtle ripples, reflecting the simple yet engaging activity above. The color palette is mostly natural tones with the brown of the wooden dock and the bluish-gray of the water. The presence of simple fishing gear and casual attire suggests a leisurely, perhaps familial outing centered around fishing. The overall atmosphere is serene, highlighted by the quiet water and the focused, calm demeanor of the individuals engaged in their task.","title":"Fishing on Back River, near Baltimore's sewage treatment plant","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550776","554517","554518","550851","548737","542560","549935","550848","544223","545928","543164","554516","542564","552291","542648","543231"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","dock","rod","bait","catch","water","outing","demeanor","gear","ripple"]}
