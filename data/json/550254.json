{"path":"550254.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental or possibly post-disaster devastation. The foreground prominently features several dead rats lying scattered on a sandy, litter-strewn ground filled with debris such as small stones, pieces of wood, and unidentifiable fragments. These rats are of various sizes and appear to be in a state of decay.\n\nIn the background, a group of people can be seen actively engaged in what appears to be a clean-up effort. They are spread across a field that is similarly covered with debris, suggesting recent damage or long-term neglect. The people include adults and possibly teenagers or young adults, dressed in casual clothing. Some are using sticks or tools to move or sift through the debris, while others seem to be supervising or watching.\n\nThe wider scene includes sandy soil and what looks like patches of grass or vegetation in the distance, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber mood of the image. This photograph evokes a narrative of a community dealing with the aftermath of an environmental crisis or cleanup activity in a distressed setting.","title":"White city lagoon on lake erie has been a city-designated wildlife sanctuary since 1964.
