{"path":"545801.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural landscape under an expansive sky. The primary focus is on a striking formation of tall, rugged rocks, which appear layered and weathered, suggesting significant geological aging. These formations, characterized by their towering presence and rounded contours, create a formidable and impressive natural scene. They appear silhouetted against the sky, emphasizing their imposing forms.\n\nThe sky above these rock formations is vast and filled with an assortment of clouds varying in shape and size. The clouds, ranging from fluffy and white to more spread out and darker at the edges, suggest a dynamic weather pattern, possibly indicative of an evolving climatic condition. This variety in cloud formation and coloration contributes to a sense of depth and movement in the sky, enhancing the overall drama of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a hint of green grass suggests the presence of a ground layer just below the rock formations, although it occupies a relatively small portion of the composition. This inclusion of vegetation adds a touch of life and contrast to the otherwise stark rock and sky-dominated scene.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its emphasis on the vertical rise of the rock formations against the horizontally expansive sky, creates a strong visual impact, evoking feelings of awe and the timeless power of natural geological processes. The photograph likely serves to highlight both the beauty and the immense scale of these natural structures.","title":"Rock formations in the \"the doll house,\" a remote area in the canyonlands separated from the famous needles region by the Colorado river","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544363","545805","544376","544392","545775","544745","545792","550428","549197","544429","545791","545783","545797","545696","545790","552444"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","rock","drama","fluffy","aging","awe","inclusion","round","coloration","cloud"]}
