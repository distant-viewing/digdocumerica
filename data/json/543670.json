{"path":"543670.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, natural landscape featuring a river channel, presumably in a mountainous region. The view is taken from a low angle along the riverbed, which is filled with a mixture of water and numerous rocks of various sizes. A striking element is a large, rusting pipe or culvert partially exposed on the right side of the image, discharging water into the river, adding a stark man-made contrast to the otherwise wild setting.\n\nIn the background, towering mountain peaks, some covered with snow, rise majestically, emphasizing the high altitude and wildness of the terrain. The mountains are steep and rugged, contributing to a dramatic skyline that arrests the viewer's attention. Between the peaks, there's a hint of dense vegetation, possibly a forested area, nestled in the lower parts of the mountains.\n\nThe sky, partially visible at the top of the image, appears clear, suggesting a crisp atmosphere typical of mountain environments. The overall composition of the photograph juxtaposes the serene beauty of the natural landscape with the harsh, utilitarian aspect of human infrastructure, underscoring conflicts between industrial developments and nature conservation.","title":"Water leaking from mine tailings pond at Idarado Mill flows into the San Miguel River.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543759","550518","544943","550507","553420","552994","543742","550498","550526","543739","555223","553653","550633","550512","555674","542700"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mountain","peak","wildness","riverbed","conservation","channel","river","altitude","mixture","pipe"]}
