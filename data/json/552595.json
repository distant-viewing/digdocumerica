{"path":"552595.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a picturesque town nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains with distinct ridges and escarpments. The landscape is a mixture of semi-arid terrain and fertile areas along a winding river that passes through the valley. The river is spanned by a couple of bridges connecting various parts of the town.\n\nThe town is fairly dense with a range of buildings, including residential homes, which differ in size and are laid out in a somewhat orderly grid pattern. There are also areas that appear to be commercial due to the larger building footprints and parking areas. Surrounding the central built-up area are patches of agricultural fields, some of which are quite distinct, suggesting cultivation or possibly fallow land.\n\nThe terrain immediately outside the town features lightly wooded areas and open fields, with the backdrop of the mountains providing a dramatic contrast. The lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enhancing the texture of the landscape with warm hues.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a harmonious blend of human settlement and natural environment, characterized by a central cluster of human habitation surrounded by natureâ€™s vastness and beauty.","title":"Rifle, southeast of the piceance basin, beneath the oil shale bearing book, (or roan) cliffs, is the major community in this region of sheep and cattle ranches","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552593","543746","545625","548199","543738","557653","550639","550525","550550","551101","550558","556967","542998","557527","549116","556341"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["town","valley","differ","footprint","cultivation","mountain","field","settlement","pass","river"]}
