{"path":"549720.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an industrial setting, likely a factory floor involved in the manufacturing or assembly of automobiles. The primary focus is a chassis of a car, which is positioned centrally in the image. The chassis appears to be partially assembled, featuring wheels, axles, and other structural components, all colored in black.\n\nA man is engaged with the chassis; he is bent over, closely inspecting or working on a part of the assembly near the rear end of the chassis. He is dressed in a short-sleeved striped shirt and dark trousers, indicative of a typical factory worker or technician's attire. His pose and attention suggest he is performing a task that requires precision.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows the interior of the factory. It is equipped with various industrial machines and tools, potentially related to vehicle assembly. There are visible elements such as overhead gantries or conveyor systems, which are typical in such settings for moving parts along the assembly line. The environment looks busy but orderly, with visible safety measures like yellow floor markings and barriers.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of manual labor and inspection within the automobile industry, emphasizing the detailed and hands-on process involved in vehicle assembly.","title":"Installing transmission on the Cadillac assembly line","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549728","549723","549719","549724","549722","557855","555954","553330","553490","557897","557850","549692","544826","557833","542763","549721"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["assembly","chassis","factory","automobile","floor","technician","assemble","precision","involve","inspection"]}
