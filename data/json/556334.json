The flag, attached to a pole on its left side, appears to be partially backlit and silhouetted against the cloudy backdrop, which gives an impression of a slightly dim and moody atmosphere. The flag is emblazoned with the words \"WE DIG COAL SAFELY\" in bold, black lettering. The design includes an emblem of a crossed pickaxe and a shovel beneath the text, symbolizing mining tools. The composition focuses on the fluttering flag, emphasizing themes of industry and safety in coal mining.
