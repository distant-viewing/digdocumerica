{"path":"547842.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a subway train stopped at a station platform. The train is metallic, predominantly silver in color, with navy blue trim and details. The destination \"St. George\" is displayed on both the front and side signs of the visible lead car. A driver is visible in the front window of the train. He is wearing a dark uniform.\n\nThe station itself has a concrete platform and is outdoors. There is a pedestrian overpass or bridge crossing above the track in the background. Various greenery can be seen around the area, including some trees and shrubs on a small slope beside the tracks. The lighting suggests daytime, and the weather appears to be cloudy, giving the image a soft light. The setting can imply a suburban environment due to the presence of green spaces and the open-air station.","title":"Staten Island rapid transit, part of the New York subway system, connects the small towns of the borough of Richmond.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551894","548265","556651","548254","556812","556846","548263","556650","556774","556660","556767","551889","556693","556810","556667","556670"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","station","platform","track","crossing","subway","overpass","destination","silver","stop"]}
