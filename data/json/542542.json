{"path":"542542.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a man holding a small bird in the palm of his hand. The man appears middle-aged and is wearing sunglasses and a light-colored button-up shirt. He has a broad smile, suggesting a moment of joy or a pleasant interaction.\n\nOn his head, he wears a light-colored cap that seems to be part of a uniform, possibly indicating that he works at the site shown in the background. He has a wallet or a similar item clipped to his belt, suggesting practicality and readiness for work-related tasks.\n\nThe background of the image is slightly blurred and features industrial equipment, which includes a large structure with visible stairs and platforms, likely part of a manufacturing or processing facility. There are several metal constructs and pipes, and the environment looks dusty and rugged, typical of an industrial or construction setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph contrasts the industrial background with the gentle and caring action of the man holding the bird, highlighting a moment of tenderness in a harsh environment.","title":"Plant worker, mayard lindell, at the sequoia rock co","placename":"San Joaquin River (Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin River, California","nn1":["545214","544222","545980","555854","549742","554951","553206","553025","553876","544547","553094","557369","544211","556529","548998","544833"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","clip","practicality","readiness","stair","palm","joy","button","sunglasse","work"]}
