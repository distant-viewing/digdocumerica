{"path":"545983.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial scene likely taken at a launching site for rockets. The bottom third of the image shows a body of calm water that reflects the scene above it. On the right side, there is a large vertical structure that appears to be a rocket standing on a launch pad. This rocket is slender, and its upper parts gleam silver under the light, suggesting its metallic construction.\n\nTo the left of the rocket, construction or maintenance activities are evident. There is a crane extending its boom across the space, indicating ongoing work. The craneâ€™s presence, along with various other indistinct equipment and structures around it, suggests this area is well-equipped for logistical and technical operations essential for either setting up or maintaining the rocket.\n\nThe horizon is dominated by a flat expanse of greenish-brown land that stretches from the left towards and beyond the rocket. This terrain appears somewhat marshy or muddy, typical of coastal or riverine launch sites.\n\nAbove, the sky occupies the top two-thirds of the image. It is filled with voluminous clouds, mostly bright with a few overcast shades, implying it could be either a sunny or slightly overcast day.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of human achievement and technological endeavor in a natural and somewhat remote landscape. The scene is both industrial and pioneering, typical of space exploration settings.","title":"Dredging for natural gas in marshlands along the Freeport Sulphur Co. pipeline canal","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["553067","552359","545979","551928","555796","544179","548437","544167","545273","544527","545020","544650","546083","547958","552179","544573"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["third","crane","achievement","pad","site","construction","boom","silver","endeavor","space"]}
