{"path":"547739.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up, blurry and red-toned image of a person's hand interacting with an arcade controller, which is the main subject. The operatorâ€™s hand, shown in the lower part of the image, is pressing a button labeled \"AUTO.\" Several other buttons and control mechanisms, perhaps joysticks or other switches, are near the center and appear in blurred red silhouettes that overlap and are distorted, giving a surreal, ghost-like effect.\n\nThe arcade controller also has a numerical display or marking that seems to read \"0302A,\" visible through the red and blurry surroundings. The image has a somewhat abstract, dreamlike quality due to the color treatment and significant motion blur, suggesting movement either of the camera or the subjects (the hand and the controls). The background is indistinct and engulfed in red and shadowy tones, contributing to the overall enigmatic and vibrant feel of the photograph.","title":"Operator's console for the \"whole body counter\" radiation detection device at EPA's Las Vegas National Environmental Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["557394","551360","551290","547671","547743","556384","556771","549111","542765","549623","551916","547720","546975","555332","551317","553883"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["button","control","hand","distort","auto","subject","press","switch","engulf","operator"]}
