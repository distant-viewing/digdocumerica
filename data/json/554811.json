{"path":"554811.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling industrial or mining landscape under a rather overcast sky, characterized by its muted colors and hilly terrains disrupted by human activity.\n\nIn the foreground, roads wind through the scene, showing a mix of curved and straight sections lined with bare trees. An orange truck is visible on one of the roads, adding a splash of color to the otherwise subdued scenery. There's a guardrail beside the road, detailing its purpose for vehicles.\n\nThe middle ground features an expanse of disturbed earth and sparse vegetation, suggesting extensive excavation or earth-moving activities. The terrain is uneven, with various mounds and depressions, indicating recent or ongoing alteration.\n\nBeyond this area, several water bodies can be seen, possibly ponds formed in excavated areas. They reflect the somber sky above. Further in the background, the landscape continues with more mounds and altered terrains. In the distant horizon, one can distinguish a slight rise in elevation, perhaps natural hills or further mounds associated with the industrial activity. Trees appear sporadically across the landscape, many of which are barren, likely due to the season or environmental impact from the industrial activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a detailed view of a stark, industrially altered landscape, dominated by earthy tones and a sense of quiet activity.","title":"As far as the eye can see the land has been stripped by the hanna coal company without starting reclamation, off route 100","placename":"Ohio","location":"Ohio","nn1":["554764","552004","554763","552427","554765","549255","554804","554829","544139","545529","547979","554815","544390","554836","555588","555629"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["alte","mounds","excavated","depression","detaile","distinguish","terrain","earth","bodie","guardrail"]}
