{"path":"554497.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image displays a peaceful, outdoor scene where three young children are gathered around a dog lying in the grass. From left to right:\n\n1. **First Child**: Partially visible, this individual appears to be interacting with the others but details are obscured due to their position at the edge of the frame.\n  \n2. **Second Child**: This boy, wearing glasses and a white T-shirt, is seated on the grass and seems to be pointing at something, actively engaging in conversation or explaining something to the others.\n\n3. **Third Child**: A girl with long hair, sitting in a bathing suit, looks intently at what the second child is pointing at, showing curiosity or concentration.\n\n4. **Fourth Child**: Sitting on the far right, this boy is dressed in a button-up long sleeve yellow shirt, listening or looking towards the second child with a slight smile, suggesting interest or amusement.\n\nThe dog between them is a medium-sized, hairy breed with distinctive black, tan, and white markings. It appears relaxed and is lying on its side, enjoying the attention it's receiving from the group.\n\nThe background details a lush green environment, possibly a park or backyard setting, with various trees and foliage providing a blurry but natural backdrop. There is a hint of a vehicle or structure in the far distance which suggests this could be near a residential area.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a candid moment of childhood interaction and friendship, set against a serene natural setting. The mood is casual and content, framed by soft natural lighting and vibrant colors.","title":"Youngsters playing with dogs at Stillwater, New York, near the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["558189","553526","543780","543485","545972","553510","543040","547106","556525","553507","547398","552033","557637","544833","549716","551273"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["dog","child","boy","friendship","lie","breed","backyard","amusement","receive","sit"]}
