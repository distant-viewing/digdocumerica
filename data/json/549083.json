{"path":"549083.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a man kneeling on a large expanse of cracked, dry earth, suggesting an arid, possibly desert environment. The man wears a light-colored straw hat, a dark leather jacket, tan pants, and boots. He has a rugged appearance and is looking directly at the camera with a faint smile. His hands, partly covered in visible dirt, are interacting with the soil, showing an active engagement with the landscape.\n\nThe background showcases a vast, flat terrain with minimal vegetation, consisting mainly of sparse, dry bushes. The expansive sky is visible with a clear, bright blue hue, indicating a sunny day. The horizon line is distant and flat, likely indicating a wide-open plain or valley. The soilâ€™s deep cracks signal severe dryness and create a compelling texture that dominates the foreground. This setting and the man's attire suggest an exploration or fieldwork scenario, possibly related to environmental studies or agriculture in a desert area. The overall composition conveys themes of isolation, ruggedness, and interaction with a harsh landscape.","title":"Poor soil, damaged by accumulated salt, is examined by mexican farmer, gilberto buitierrez banaga, near mexicali, mexico mexicans want better quality water from Colorado river presently salt content is extremely high at mexican border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["542548","543802","558108","543833","546262","553093","554794","555824","549086","545592","545091","545753","549259","553801","545755","544154"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crack","desert","soil","fieldwork","leather","faint","straw","ruggedness","plain","tan"]}
