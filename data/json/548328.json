{"path":"548328.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph features a low-light, almost silhouette view of a city skyline against a dramatic sky. Dominating the skyline are what appear to be tall buildings or skyscrapers, the tallest of which are centered in the image, with lower buildings spreading out to the edges. The sky overhead is filled with heavy, dark clouds, suggesting an overcast day or approaching storm, imparting a moody atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe water in the foreground reflects the sky to some extent, appearing relatively dark but with lighter patches where light penetrates the dense clouds. This suggests the photograph might have been taken during either early morning or late evening, as the light is quite muted and diffused.\n\nNo people or moving vehicles are discernible in this scene; the focus is entirely on the architectural elements and the natural environment. The overall impression is one of quiet and anticipation, typical of a large city viewed from a distance where the details merge into broad sweeps of shape and color against the natural elements.","title":"Twin towers of the World Trade buildings dominate this view of the Manhattan skyline.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548384","548383","553821","545499","545406","548337","548339","552251","555716","555736","552264","550295","548385","549971","548408","552252"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["skyline","anticipation","extent","overhead","city","storm","cloud","skyscraper","light","impression"]}
