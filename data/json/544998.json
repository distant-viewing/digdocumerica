{"path":"544998.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a scene featuring a mobile laboratory, specifically labeled as a \"Mobile Water Quality Laboratory\" according to the text on its side. The laboratory is housed within a large white trailer equipped with several windows and an open door.\n\nA man is stepping out of the trailer. He is wearing brown boots, dark trousers, a long-sleeve orange shirt, and glasses. He appears to be handling some paperwork or thin folders, caught in the moment of leaning forward slightly as he exits the vehicle. The setting seems utilitarian with minimal background visibleâ€”just a piece of another building or structure colored in a pale yellow can be seen on the left side of the photo.\n\nThe ground immediately around the trailer is unpaved and covered with small stones. There are some random objects like a box labeled \"Kodak\", another plain cardboard box, and a couple of bricks positioned as makeshift steps leading into the trailer. The trailer itself stands on jacks, indicating that it is parked and set up for stationary use rather than being in transit.\n\nThe overall impression is that of a functional, no-frills working environment, presumably focused on tasks related to water quality testing or environmental research. The person in the image seems engaged in his work, contributing to a sense of activity and purpose within this mobile workspace.","title":"Bill parks, of Oregon state university, tests waste discharge from seafood processing plants","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["543808","549628","552371","553657","550962","547718","546358","543797","546343","543803","542535","546904","544499","546278","546353","552367"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["trailer","laboratory","step","box","folder","label","paperwork","testing","cardboard","exit"]}
