{"path":"542978.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a sandy desert landscape. The primary focal point is a discarded soda can with a blue and red logo, lying on its side in the foreground of the image. The sandy ground is textured with ripples and small debris, likely formed by wind. In the midground and extending to the background, several dark, leafless tree branches protrude from the sand dunes. The sky is clear and is positioned at the upper quarter of the frame, suggesting a dry, possibly harsh environment. The overall composition and the presence of the soda can point towards themes of environmental pollution and human impact on natural landscapes.","title":"California--Arcata Beach early morning, Arcata","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542809","552937","551246","543616","550805","549944","550806","543664","556615","544640","555149","556639","546920","546965","556640","549043"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["soda","quarter","dune","midground","logo","wind","ripple","desert","sand","pollution"]}
