{"path":"546367.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a sweeping rural landscape characterized by verdant hills and dense forest patches. The focus of the scene is a ridge with a dirt road winding along its spine, leading to and from a small house situated at the crest of the hill. This house, with its rust-red roof and beige walls, appears modest and isolated, surrounded by a plot of land that is visibly cleared and levelled compared to the surrounding terrain.\n\nAdjacent to the house, there are some small, possibly utility structures and a vehicle parked near the entrance of the house, suggesting habitation. The road splits around the residence, indicating accessibility from multiple directions.\n\nToward the left, the road meanders downwards into a valley lush with tropical trees and vegetation, indicating a rich natural environment that is typical of a rainforest-like biome. In the upper right part of the image, a bus painted in white and red travels along the road, giving a sense of scale and connection to larger networks.\n\nThe whole scene is set against a backdrop of dense trees and undergrowth, with no other signs of human habitation visible in the immediate vicinity, which underscores the remote and tranquil setting of the house on the hill. The tranquility and simplicity of the pastoral scene evoke a sense of isolation and peaceful living, detached from urban hustle.","title":"A mountain farmhouse","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["556462","557748","551091","555635","554721","556423","549235","556971","555603","556997","549261","549236","549256","556959","555818","557750"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["house","road","habitation","hill","spine","rainforest","detach","crest","residence","cleared"]}
