{"path":"554447.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This is a vintage photograph capturing a casual, outdoors family scene. Four people are visible in the photo:\n\n1. A man stands to the left. He wears a light-colored ranger or scout uniform with a dark belt and dark shoes. He stands on a wooden porch or deck, leaning slightly with one foot higher on the stairs, giving a relaxed pose.\n\n2. A woman stands to the right beside the man. She has long dark hair and wears a light pink t-shirt and blue jeans. She smiles gently towards the camera, standing straight with confidence.\n\n3. Two young girls sit on the steps leading up to where the adults stand. The girl on the left wears a blue t-shirt and dark red pants, while the girl on the right wears a light, sleeveless top and blue shorts. Both are bare-legged and wear sandals.\n\nThe background includes lush green trees, suggesting a forested or park area. A section of a vehicle and a wheeled cart loaded with what looks to be groceries or supplies is visible at the far right, indicating perhaps a camping or picnicking scenario. The setting appears relaxed and natural, with an overcast light diffusing through the trees.","title":"U.S. Forest Service ranger and family at Marcy Dam near Lake Placid.
