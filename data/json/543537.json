{"path":"543537.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake scene framed by a stunning mountainous backdrop. In the foreground, an individual, appearing to be a young man, is kayaking across the calm blue water of a large lake. The kayak is sleek and red, contrasting with the tranquil blue of the lake. The kayaker, wearing a dark cap, seems to be paddling steadily, facing towards the right side of the frame.\n\nThe lake itself reflects the clear sky above, scattered lightly with buoys that dot the water's surface near the kayaker. The atmosphere suggests a peaceful, sunny day, perfect for water activities. On the right side, extending into the lake, are parts of a wooden dock, hinting at a recreational or residential waterfront area.\n\nIn the background, majestic snow-capped mountains rise under a clear blue sky. The mountains are densely covered with coniferous trees at the lower altitudes transitioning to rocky, snow-covered peaks. This panoramic view adds a breathtaking depth and natural beauty to the scene, highlighting the vastness of the landscape compared to the solitary kayaker. The photograph overall depicts a harmonious interaction between human and nature, emphasizing tranquility and the grandeur of the mountainous landscape.","title":"Kayaking on lake tahoe","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["550674","543522","552333","543535","552222","544031","543626","543816","554609","543533","544759","553334","557492","555692","550641","552982"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","kayak","snow","cap","buoy","overall","paddle","mountain","altitude","grandeur"]}
