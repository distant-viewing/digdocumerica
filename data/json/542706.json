{"path":"542706.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant, expansive field of pink flowers, captured using a fisheye lens which creates a curved, almost spherical perspective of the scene. The flowers, likely petunias or a similar type, dominate the frame, displaying various shades of pink from light to deep hues. Their vivid coloration stands out sharply against a clear blue sky, which occupies only a thin strip at the top edge of the photo due to the lens distortion.\n\nThis effect of the fisheye lens exaggerates the field's scale, making it appear as if the viewer is surrounded by the flowers. The curvature of the lens adds a distortion at the edges of the frame, bending the horizon and giving a slight vignette effect which darkens the corners of the image.\n\nThe sunlight illuminates the petals, highlighting their textures and the delicate nature of each flower. No people or man-made structures are visible in this naturalistic composition, focusing purely on the floral display and its overwhelming abundance. This composition not only captures the beauty of the flowers but also the sensation of immersion in nature, enhanced by the lens choice which wraps the scene around the viewer's field of view.","title":"Flower fields of Lompoc where many of world's flower seeds are grown","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["542970","554111","542704","543597","542969","554843","544574","557618","557167","552538","554595","542645","550781","543200","542642","542641"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["lens","flower","field","immersion","vignette","curvature","effect","abundance","choice","petal"]}
