{"path":"551703.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph displays a captivating garden scene highlighted by a lush assembly of plants and flowers. To the left, a bush flourishes with rich green leaves interspersed with several bright red roses in full bloom, contributing a vibrant splash of color against the foliage. This rose bush leans gently over a rustic wooden fence, which adds a natural, textured background to the scene.\n\nHanging from the fence is a yellow hanging basket, secured by wires, which overflows with various greenery and small, delicate pink flowers, adding variety and a sense of depth. The basket contributes a charming, cared-for element typical of a well-maintained garden.\n\nOverall, the image exudes a tranquil and inviting garden atmosphere, suggesting a moment of peace in a lush, floral environment. The natural lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows and highlighting the vivid colors of the plants. The composition is balanced with a blend of vertical and cascading elements, creating a harmonious natural setting.","title":"Detail of back garden on east 30th street.
