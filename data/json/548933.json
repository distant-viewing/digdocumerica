{"path":"548933.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a river landscape, bordered by dramatic cliffs and a variety of human settlements. The river, central to the image, flows through a desert environment, reflecting a clear sky. On the left, the riverbanks are flanked by steep, rugged cliffs that appear reddish-brown, contrasting sharply with the blue water.\n\nAlong the right side of the river, various settlements with small buildings, possibly residential, are visible. These areas are interspersed with clusters of trees and some open spaces, suggestive of recreational or community use. Notably, there are several RVs and vehicles dotted throughout, indicating this might be a popular spot for camping or vacations. A network of roads and paths connect these structures, facilitating movement within the community.\n\nIn the foreground, a sandy beach area adjacent to the river is visible, featuring more parked vehicles and a couple of boats near the shoreline, hinting at aquatic recreational activities like boating or fishing.\n\nThe background further away from the river shows more rugged terrain and sparse vegetation, characteristic of arid or semi-arid regions, leading to distant, hazy mountains that add depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a blend of natural and human elements, showcasing interaction with a river environment in a desert landscape.","title":"The Colorado River below Parker Dam.
