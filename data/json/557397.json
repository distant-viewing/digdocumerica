{"path":"557397.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and active industrial scene, likely within a steel mill or foundry. The central focus is on a large, vertical cylindrical structure that appears to be a furnace used for smelting or processing metal. This feature dominates the middle of the frame and emits an intense white light at the base, suggesting the presence of molten metal or extreme heat.\n\nForeground elements include heavy industrial machinery and tooling, possibly part of the material handling systems used to transport raw materials or finished products. Toward the left, there's a worn, partly open structure, which might be a door or a shielding cover, showing signs of considerable wear and exposure to high temperatures, evidenced by its scorched and deteriorated condition.\n\nThe background offers a view of the interior of the facility, with the roof structure visible, characterized by large beams and covered with a dark material, possibly for insulation or protection against heat. Streams of light enter through various openings, casting diagonal shafts across the scene and illuminating particles or fumes in the air, enhancing the industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by blues and grays, punctuated by the stark contrast of the white and orange glow from the furnace, suggesting the photograph might have been taken under challenging light conditions or manipulated to emphasize the harsh, metallic environment. There's no visible presence of people, which focuses the viewer's attention entirely on the machinery and the industrial process.","title":"Doors are open on furnace #6 to change electrodes at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.  Air pressure blows dirt off the carbon to expose the bolts to change the electrodes.  \"fugitive smoke\" escapes through the roof.  Powerplant and metallurgical furnace emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975.  A compliance schedule was reached between the company and the West Virginia air pollution control commission.  (see fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
