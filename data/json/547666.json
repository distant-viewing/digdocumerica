{"path":"547666.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a busy intersection scene dominated by a large red truck, affixed with a green number '2' on its side, carrying a dark container marked with a phone number. The truck is traversing the intersection, passing under multiple traffic signals that are showing green and red lights. Above the road, numerous tangled electrical and telephone wires crisscross the sky, adding complexity to the urban landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, a small blue car is partially visible, faded and slightly out of focus, emphasizing the prominence of the truck in the scene. Behind the truck, there are industrial installations which might be large storage facilities or factories, indicated by their flat structures and the absence of windows. This setting suggests an industrial area of a city.\n\nThe scene is likely captured on a bright day, given the brightness of the sky and shadows visible on the road and vehicles. This image provides a snapshot of urban industrial life, highlighting transportation and infrastructure.","title":"In the state capital, a heavily industrialized city","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["549866","557385","547651","549995","552077","556714","557431","552001","545876","555505","544057","544061","557389","547369","547569","553721"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["truck","intersection","number","affix","traverse","telephone","phone","prominence","installation","signal"]}
