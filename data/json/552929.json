{"path":"552929.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph primarily captures a stack of newspapers in the foreground, with the top visible newspaper titled \"The Courier-Journal & Times\". A headline on the paper reads, \"A Bargesâ€™ Retreat\". There is a prominent black-and-white image on the paper depicting industrial barges on a river.\n\nIn the blurred background, a few key elements are visible, setting a suburban or semi-urban scene. A classic car is parked on the street, styled with a mid-20th century design, suggesting the photo could be from around that era. Behind the car, there are several yellow school buses lined up next to each other, indicating the presence of a school or a bus depot nearby.\n\nAdditionally, there is visible signage that includes an advertisement for \"United Supermarkets\", featuring a logo and promotional content, which adds a touch of everyday commerce to the scene.\n\nA grassy foreground and trees with light foliage suggest the photo might be taken during a transition season, possibly spring or fall. The overall atmosphere resembles a tranquil, everyday moment captured with elements of daily life and transport faintly active in the background.","title":"Newspaper with barge story.
