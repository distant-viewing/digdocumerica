{"path":"557428.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban setting likely from the 1970s or early 1980s, based on the style of the architecture and vehicles. In the foreground, we see several two-story houses with wooden shingles on their roofs and dark brown sidings. The structures are built on a sloping residential street.\n\nProminently featured in the scene is a classic gold-colored car, possibly a sedan from the 1970s, parked curbside. Alongside the car, on the street, we see four children walking together. They appear to be engaged in conversation or perhaps enjoying a leisurely stroll.\n\nThe background reveals a more urban landscape with taller multi-story buildings that suggest either a business district or apartment complexes. The skyline is somewhat hazy, indicating either fog or smog.\n\nOverall, the scene paints a vivid picture of suburban life during this era, juxtaposed with the urban development seen in the distance, and captures a moment of daily activity and childhood in this neighborhood.","title":"Part of the intensive residential development underway around the harbor at coastal development has come under increasing restrictions since the implementation of the coastal zone conservation act in 1973.
