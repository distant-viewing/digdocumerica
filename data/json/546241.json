{"path":"546241.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a shallow water body, likely a pond or marsh. In the foreground, there is a dead bird, possibly a seagull, lying on its side in the mud with its white and gray plumage prominently displayed. Next to the bird, partially submerged in the water, are two objects that look like pieces of debris; one appears to be an old, weathered bottle, and the other resembles a stone or lump of dirt.\n\nIn the background, the water body continues towards a flat horizon lined with tall, dry grasses reflecting softly in the still water. The background also features a simple fence made of wood posts and wires, cutting across the landscape, and beyond it, the terrain remains relatively flat with sparse vegetation. The sky above is clear and possesses a soft gradient, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. Overall, the scene communicates a tranquil but somber mood, accentuated by the lifeless bird and still water.","title":"Dead bird in polluted water","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["552992","547947","549896","550388","557576","547039","542919","545991","547744","551122","547737","550387","548832","557495","550788","546066"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","plumage","seagull","water","marsh","mud","bottle","pond","gradient","wire"]}
