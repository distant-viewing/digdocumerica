{"path":"553897.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Harvey, David Alan","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene featuring a large naval ship, identified by the number \"879\" painted in large white numbers on its dark hull. The ship is moored in a body of water that is heavily polluted with various types of debris. The water surface is littered with assorted trash, including plastic bottles, cups, a tire, and other miscellaneous refuse floating amid patches of oil or other pollutants, which creates a sheen visible on the water's surface.\n\nThe composition of the photo focuses heavily on the contrast between the large, imposing structure of the ship and the polluted water around it. The ship appears sturdy and industrial, with visible features like an anchor hanging from the side. The lighting is slightly dim, suggesting the photo may have been taken during an overcast day or in shaded lighting, which casts the entire scene in a stark, somewhat gloomy atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the photograph likely aims to capture and critique environmental pollution, particularly highlighting the impact of human waste on marine and water environments adjacent to industrial or naval activities. The dark, murky tones of the water and the scattered debris underscore the neglect and environmental degradation present in the scene.","title":"Discharge and garbage at Navy Pier.
