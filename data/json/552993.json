{"path":"552993.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil yet somewhat unsettling scene centered around a body of water, possibly a small lake or pond. The main subjects are a group of ducks, mostly white, some actively swimming while a few others rest on the water's surface. The foreground prominently features one duck closer to the viewer, swimming among debris in the water, including sticks, leaves, and human litter such as a crushed can and torn wrappers.\n\nThe background shows a lush, dense grove of green trees encircling the far side of the pond, which enhances the natural, if neglected, vibe of the setting. In the distance, visible through a slight clearing in the trees, a group of people can be seen engaging in a lakeside activity or gathering, although the details of their actions are not clear due to the distance.\n\nThe overall composition underlines the contrast between natural beauty and environmental neglect, highlighted by the presence of trash amidst the wildlife habitat. The lighting suggests it is a sunny day, casting stark shadows and bright highlights across the scene, intensifying the vivid greens of the foliage and the whites of the ducks.","title":"White Rock Lake.
