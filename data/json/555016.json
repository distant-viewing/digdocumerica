{"path":"555016.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The image depicts a close-up view of a wooden surface with a variety of natural elements on it. The wood grain is beautifully exposed, displaying rich, dark streaks with smooth textures which serve as the backdrop. Covering parts of this wooden surface are clusters of small, dense green moss or similar low-growing vegetation. Scattered across the scene are numerous small, bright yellow spherical objects, which might be fruits, seeds, or possibly fungi, adding a vibrant contrast to the dark, woodsy background. The overall composition paints a serene yet intricate picture of nature's subtle beauty in decay and growth, intertwining life and the passage of time marked on the wooden surface.","title":"Witches paint fungus on a dead fir snag in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555006","555181","555183","555179","555025","555001","555008","545521","555063","554571","554985","555026","555188","555185","555018","545271"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["seed","fruit","surface","streak","grain","passage","moss","growth","picture","decay"]}
