{"path":"543566.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a collection of long, thin, grass-like aquatic plants suspended in water. The plants have slender, tapering strands that vary in color from pale to dark green, with some reddish hues along the edges of certain strands. Each strand has tiny droplets or bubbles clinging to it, giving them a speckled appearance that sparkles slightly due to light reflections.\n\nIn the background, the water is dark and creates a muted backdrop that contrasts with the delicate, almost ethereal quality of the plants. The composition captures a serene underwater scene, focusing on the plants' graceful forms and the interplay of light and water. There are no visible animals or human elements, emphasizing the natural and undisturbed environment. The photo has a calm and tranquil mood, inviting viewers to contemplate the quiet beauty found beneath the water's surface.","title":"Water drops on grass","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["551354","555022","543558","552525","555044","543187","544524","543561","555069","555023","557442","544525","555031","547509","542582","543555"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["strand","plant","bubble","droplet","water","collection","animal","interplay","reflection","form"]}
