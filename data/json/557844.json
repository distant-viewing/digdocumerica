{"path":"557844.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting on a red metal chair in what seems to be a shaded outdoor or semi-outdoor area. The man is dressed in a blue work uniform, including a shirt with a name badge and dark trousers. He is wearing a dark peaked cap, glasses, and lace-up boots, suggesting a practical, possibly occupational dress style.\n\nHis posture is relaxed, yet his expression appears contemplative or stern, marked by the slight frown and intense gaze. One hand is resting on the other, which grips what appears to be a small towel or cloth. The lighting casts distinct shadows, indicating it might be early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe background is simple, featuring a green colored wall with vertical paneling that contrasts starkly against the more neutrally colored foreground elements where the man is seated. The floor is concrete, and there is a prominent yellow line painted on it, possibly a safety or boundary marker. The general atmosphere suggests a setting in a workplace, such as a factory, workshop, or maintenance facility where the man could be overseeing operations or taking a break.","title":"Employee of the public works department in Norwood, Ohio he is seated during his work break, watching for cars pulling into the safety lane of the auto emission inspection station.
