{"path":"548638.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features an aerial view of a coastal development, possibly a marina or resort area located by a large body of water. The environment seems to vary between undeveloped, wilder areas and sections that have been significantly altered by human activity.\n\nIn the image, several inlets or man-made channels cut through the land, filled with clear blue water. There are multiple docks or piers, and white boats are either docked or anchored in these channels. These boats are visible in considerable number, indicating that this is likely a popular boating or marine area.\n\nThe land is divided into parcels, some of which are developed while others appear to be sandy and barren, perhaps because they are newly constructed or undeveloped lands. Roads or pathways are visible, curving and straight, providing access through the area.\n\nAround the core developed sections, there are patches of greener vegetation scattered across the terrain, hinting at managed landscaping or natural flora typical to a coastal environment. The outer areas, particularly in the background, are less controlled and show natural coastal vegetation and water bodies stretching out towards the horizon.\n\nThis complex interaction of human activities (marina and roads) with natural landscapes (water and vegetation) speaks to a managed coastal environment aimed at supporting recreational boating and possibly residential or vacation properties. The image captures a unique synthesis of human endeavor and natural beauty, characteristic of many waterfront developments.","title":"Camping trailer park under construction at cudjoe key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548784","557462","548639","548783","545128","548779","557422","556966","548637","548780","548636","548632","554022","549483","557451","552234"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["marina","boating","channel","develop","land","manage","parcel","core","dock","development"]}
