{"path":"548044.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a dilapidated wooden structure, presumably a house, situated on stilts over a body of water. The structure is in a state of disrepair, with parts of its wooden siding and roofing visibly damaged or missing. It appears abandoned and weather-beaten, emphasizing a sense of decay and neglect.\n\nThe house is built on a series of narrow poles or piles that are anchored into the water bed, showcasing a traditional stilt house construction typical of waterside or flood-prone areas. Several similar poles protrude out of the water around the structure, indicating either remnants of previous constructions or the beginnings of unfinished expansions.\n\nThe backdrop features a tranquil body of water that reflects a soft, muted light, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon timings. Beyond the water, faint silhouettes of mountains or hills are visible, draped in a haze that further adds to the atmosphere of isolation and abandonment in the scene. The overall mood conveyed is serene yet melancholic, highlighted by the muted colors and the still, reflective water surface.","title":"The mouth of the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544243","554788","544201","547038","551115","545005","557640","555632","554787","545137","552494","544698","554799","546871","547040","554823"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["stilt","house","water","beginning","timing","pole","construction","expansion","flood","roofing"]}
