{"path":"543372.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal scene where three people, likely a family or group of friends, are spending time on a rugged beach surrounded by large rocks and a view of the ocean. Two women and what appears to be a young boy or girl are present. The older woman is standing towards the right, dressed in a black tank top and jeans, and eating something. The younger woman is kneeling and focused on setting up or tidying up a picnic spot. She wears a purple top and darker pants. The child, wearing a yellow jacket, is reclining on the sand near the center of the image.\n\nThe group has a casual picnic setup, with blankets spread on the ground, a pie dish, and a few other items that suggest a meal, including some covered pots and a plastic juice container. The beach is not sandy but rather covered with small rocks and shells, indicative of a less trafficked area. Large rock formations surround the beach area, giving it a secluded and intimate feel.\n\nThe ocean can be seen in the background with waves breaking near the shore, and there is a small island or a large rock far out in the sea. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day which contrasts the likely chilly breeze often present on such coasts.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a tranquil and somewhat adventurous outing by the sea, focusing on simple joys like enjoying a meal outdoors surrounded by nature.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
