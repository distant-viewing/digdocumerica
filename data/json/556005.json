{"path":"556005.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a simple and striking visual of three diagonal contrails against a deep blue sky. These contrails, likely created by high-altitude aircraft, converge towards a point on the upper right side of the frame, creating a sense of perspective and depth. The lines are white and somewhat diffuse, suggesting that they were formed a short while before the photo was taken, as they have begun to spread out slightly. The sky forms a vivid and uniform backdrop, enhancing the contrast and emphasizing the linear elements. This composition is minimalistic and evokes a sense of calm and expansiveness. The framing and angle primarily focus on the artistic and geometric alignment of the contrails, with no other objects or distractions present in the scene.","title":"Empty rails of the main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad that carries the Southwest Limited near Dodge City, Kansas. The two passenger trains a day pass each other enroute between Los Angeles, California, and Chicago. The tracks, also heavily used by freight trains, reflect the western Kansas sunset. Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity passenger trains.","placename":"Dodge City (Kan.)","location":"Dodge City, Kansas","nn1":["553839","549109","548883","542717","542719","544606","542793","550390","544012","548841","552250","557310","557208","555714","544491","550889"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["visual","alignment","distraction","expansiveness","aircraft","framing","calm","altitude","angle","perspective"]}
