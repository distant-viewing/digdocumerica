{"path":"557680.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a man engaged in concentrated woodworking, using a router on a piece of wood at a well-lit workstation. He appears to be a middle-aged white male with a beard and glasses. He is wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt and focusing intently on his task. The setting looks like an open workshop or a shed, indicated by the wooden structure and tools visible around him. \n\nThe space is partially open to the outdoors, as evidenced by bright natural light and greenery visible in the background. The workshop has an informal, functional feel with various woodworking tools and items scattered around, contributing to a sense of a personal and frequently used workspace. The overall mood of the photograph is one of quiet industry and craftsmanship, set in a serene, light-filled environment.","title":"Dave gale, a \"medium-sized\" Atlanta contractor for 12 years moved to helen, Georgia, 90 miles to the northeast with his family of six in 1974.
