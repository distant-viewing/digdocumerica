{"path":"543450.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape, likely taken in a mountainous area such as Yosemite National Park. The scene is framed by overhanging branches at the top and rocks to the sides, focusing the viewer’s attention on the magnificent view ahead.\n\nCentral to the image is a towering, smooth, dome-shaped mountain which dominates the background. This impressive feature stands under a bright, clear sky with sparse clouds. Below the mountain, the middle ground reveals a valley flanked by dense, lush greenery, including a variety of trees and bushes.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a serene body of water reflecting the iconic mountain and sky. The stillness of the water creates a mirror-like surface, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the photograph. A few rocks emerge from the reflective water, and one large rock at the left edge partially obscures the view.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—combining water, rich green landscape, and a monumental mountain backdrop—offers a serene and breathtaking view of a pristine natural environment.","title":"Labor Day weekend","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["542792","555692","543443","555681","550441","550641","555709","543582","552894","555696","552173","555665","555660","543569","543761","550513"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","rock","dome","overhang","emerge","water","stillness","view","mirror","valley"]}
