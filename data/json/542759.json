{"path":"542759.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features three men interacting by a railway crossing. To the left, a young man with a light brown bowl haircut, wearing a white T-shirt, stands side facing the camera while conversing with two older men in uniforms. The two older men, appearing to be railway or highway patrol officers given their beige uniforms and peaked caps, engage attentively with him. The officer in the middle seems to be making a point or explaining something to the younger man, using his hands in his discourse. The scene occurs next to a railway track, which is hinted at by the presence of a blue train carriage visible on the far right of the frame, its front and a red marker light clearly shown.\n\nBehind them, the environment consists of an open field under a light sky, punctuated by tall electricity pylons in the background, creating a somewhat industrial or outskirts setting. A signal post with signs, slightly obscured, can be seen next to the men, suggesting proximity to a crossing or a similarly controlled area of the railway. The photograph captures a clear and sunny day, likely facilitating the calm, daytime conversation depicted among the individuals.","title":"Air pollution control department officers Mel Schreckengost and Dick Fehrenback discussing citation with driver of violating truck.","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["556110","556864","556089","551921","542757","556108","554026","556847","556875","555966","544969","556126","556012","556874","556090","557856"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","crossing","officer","man","uniform","haircut","bowl","pylon","carriage","electricity"]}
