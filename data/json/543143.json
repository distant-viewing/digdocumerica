{"path":"543143.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene at a water body, possibly a river or a sheltered bay. The image is drenched in warm tones of orange and purple, typical of a setting sun.\n\nThe foreground features a lone individual standing on what appears to be a dock or a jetty, silhouetted against the shimmering water. The figure is quietly observing the scene, perhaps lost in thought or simply enjoying the peaceful environment.\n\nThe water surface is calm but textured with ripples and reflections of the sun, which create glittering paths across the scene. Several boats of various sizes are scattered across the water; some are moored and motionless while others are gently swaying.\n\nA small motorboat is actively moving from the right to the left of the frame, creating a distinct wake that cuts through the waterâ€™s surface, adding dynamism to the otherwise tranquil scene. The boat is also in silhouette, and its action brings a sense of life and movement contrasting the stillness around it.\n\nThe background is soft and lacks distinct details, emphasizing the vastness and open space of the scene. This setting is further enriched by the muted tones of the sunset, providing a backdrop that enhances the contemplative and serene mood of the photograph. \n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the tranquility of an evening by the water, with human and boating activity adding layers of interest and engagement against a spectacular natural canvas.","title":"The waterfront at sunset","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["550303","550296","551215","543880","543956","552293","552038","547230","543411","551214","543119","543613","545149","552310","552294","557447"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sunset","contemplative","water","dynamism","obserive","sway","lose","sun","canva","jetty"]}
