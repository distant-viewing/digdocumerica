{"path":"546177.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a line of parked cars along a road, giving the scene a somewhat cluttered and eclectic appearance. At the forefront, we see the back of an aged car, likely a vintage model from around the mid-20th century, prominently displaying a Louisiana license plate dated to 1972. The car has dulled and patches of its paint have worn off, with visible rust and a hand-drawn design or writing in dust on the trunk.\n\nBehind this car, several others are visible; each appears to be from different eras and models, suggesting varying degrees of use and maintenance. The cars feature distinctive tailfin designs typical of mid-century automotive style, and they have a generally used and weathered look.\n\nIn the background, the environment suggests a rural or semi-industrial area with trees, shrubs, and open sky. There are piles of debris or materials and possibly some industrial equipment, contributing to a gritty, working-class atmosphere. The road itself on which the cars are parked is paved but shows signs of wear and is surrounded by natural overgrowth, emphasizing a sense of neglect or decline.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is somewhat nostalgic and melancholic, resonating with themes of obsolescence and the passage of time shown through the collection of old and fading vehicles. The scene captures a slice of life from a bygone era reflecting automotive history and the inevitable march of time affecting all man-made objects.","title":"Abandoned autoMobiles","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555492","545340","543166","555491","545540","557692","546230","542977","556707","553488","551021","552995","552077","545365","550683","556735"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","model","obsolescence","overgrowth","era","writing","class","degree","decline","century"]}
