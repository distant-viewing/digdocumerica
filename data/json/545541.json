{"path":"545541.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a railway yard scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting conditions. The image features numerous tracks filled with a series of rusted freight train cars, presenting an array of red and orange colors. The train cars vary slightly in design, but most share a common boxcar structure. \n\nIn the foreground, there is lush, wild grass that appears slightly blurred, suggesting a soft breeze or movement during the shot. This foreground greenery introduces a natural element contrasting with the industrial feel of the train yard.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by the train cars on multiple railway lines, adding depth and a sense of scale to the scene. The background includes a treeline and an expansive sky. Notably, there is a large cloud of smoke rising in the sky, which looks like it might be coming from beyond the visible train yard area. This smoke cloud adds a dynamic and potentially narrative element to the scene, drawing attention to activity outside the immediate view and suggesting industrial or agricultural operations. The sky is relatively clear, with a few small clouds, enhancing the striking appearance of the smoke.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene yet industrially charged landscape, marked by the contrast between the natural foreground, the grid-like pattern of the railway tracks, and the smoky disturbance in the background.","title":"Railroad trucks under embankment of route 269.
