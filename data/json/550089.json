{"path":"550089.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a heavy traffic scene, likely from the 1970s or early 1980s, featuring a multitude of cars on a multilane highway. The cars, which include a diverse range of models and colors such as red, blue, white, and various shades of brown and yellow, appear to be mostly American sedans typical of that eraâ€”large and boxy with distinctive chrome details.\n\nThe traffic is dense, with cars closely packed and occupying all available lanes. At the sides of the highway, guardrails and some greenery are visible. Above one section of the traffic, a concrete overpass cuts across the photo, casting a shadow onto portions of the roadway beneath it. The overall setting and the cars' styles suggest this could be in the United States.\n\nThe photograph itself is framed within a darker border that suggests it is a slide image, possibly viewed through a projector or prepared for viewing in a similar format. The composition and slight overexposure of the image contribute to a nostalgic feel, capturing a typical day on a busy freeway from a bygone era. The image offers a snapshot of automotive history, showing a variety of now-classic car models in everyday use.","title":"Exodus from Cleveland to the suburbs","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549903","545884","548084","557230","555505","555437","553019","544723","553018","542684","542764","545455","547811","556194","549877","545463"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","traffic","highway","model","freeway","multilane","slide","era","guardrail","multitude"]}
