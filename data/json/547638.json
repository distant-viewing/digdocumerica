{"path":"547638.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene seascape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and deep hues. It features a calm body of water with its surface reflecting shades of deep blues and purples. Scattered throughout the water are numerous dark, jagged rocks that protrude above the surface. These rocks vary in size and create a rugged texture against the smooth water.\n\nIn the background, there are larger rock formations or small islands that line the horizon. The colors of these formations are similar to those of the foreground rocks but bathed in shadow, enhancing the sense of depth in the image. The sky, though visible, is only a narrow strip at the top of the frame and matches the dark, muted tones of the rest of the environment, suggesting it might be overcast.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and a bit mysterious, emphasized by the choice of lighting and the natural ruggedness of the seascape. There are no visible human elements or activities in the scene, which emphasizes the natural and untouched aspect of the location.","title":"Rocky shore of Rhode Island Sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543025","553852","543060","545173","543091","547483","552891","543068","557510","553989","542808","543046","543081","543306","547057","543138"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["seascape","rock","formation","choice","ruggedness","island","protrude","match","purple","strip"]}
