{"path":"542583.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a captivating natural landscape dominated by a rocky terrain and a body of water. The scene is rich in details that suggest a rugged, untouched wild environment, possibly in a mountainous or hilly location.\n\nAt the center and forefront of the image is a calm, reflective water body, likely a river or a small lake, ensconced by large, irregularly shaped rocks. These rocks vary in color, mainly displaying hues of beige and gray, and are interspersed with some dark crevices and patches of moss or lichen, adding to the rough, natural texture of the scene.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes a mix of dense green vegetation, highlighting different species of shrubs and trees. These plants appear to be typical of a chaparral or Mediterranean-type ecosystem, adapting well to the rocky environment. The trees are predominantly evergreens, suggesting this area supports a hardy plant community.\n\nIn the background, similar rocky outcrops and dense greenery continue to ascend, indicating that this body of water is in a valley or nestled within a canyon. The atmosphere of the photograph carries a serene yet wild essence, reflecting the tranquil yet untamed character of the landscape.\n\nThere are no visible human elements or activities in the image; the focus is entirely on the natural elements, emphasizing a sense of peaceful isolation away from urban environments. The lighting is soft, with shadows casting gently over the rocks and water, suggesting that this image might have been taken either in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of stillness and natural beauty, inviting contemplation of the rugged, undisturbed wilderness.","title":"Low water on Stanislaus River above kayak run","placename":"Sonora (Calif.)","location":"Sonora, California","nn1":["543789","552900","553135","546963","552905","545068","550486","552891","552894","542537","548811","543771","557599","543647","545301","551520"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rock","evergreen","lichen","crevice","adapt","ascend","outcrop","body","beige","canyon"]}
