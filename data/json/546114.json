{"path":"546114.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape during sunset. The image captures a variety of industrial elements against a vibrant sky painted in shades of pink, purple, and orange. In the foreground, silhouetted against the glowing sky, one can see an array of industrial buildings and storage tanks. Several towering structures, possibly silos or smokestacks, dominate the central part of the image.\n\nTo the right, multiple cranes, which might be used for loading or construction purposes, extend their arms towards the sky. The outline of a boat is visible on the right, likely a tugboat, docked near the water's edge, further adding to the industrial maritime theme of the scene.\n\nIn the background, more industrial structures are visible, with lights that have started to illuminate as day transitions to night. The entire scene is a blend of nature's beauty and industrial activity, typical of a working port or industrial complex near a waterway. The contrasting elements of natural beauty and man-made industry create a compelling and thought-provoking image.","title":"Sunset over olin-mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["547102","545430","545438","548851","551956","546384","545418","544684","547200","547084","558140","546118","543003","552164","551140","547172"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["provoke","tugboat","start","loading","silo","port","thought","night","contrasting","transitions"]}
