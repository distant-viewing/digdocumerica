{"path":"546189.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial setting with a variety of interesting elements. At the center of the image is a large, unusual, dome-shaped building made of metal, featuring a conical top that could possibly serve as a vent or chimney. The structure has multiple windows or vents arranged symmetrically on its side, and a large doorway that is slightly ajar, revealing some inner details.\n\nIn the foreground, there's an array of industrial materials and equipment. Neatly stacked metallic cylinders—likely gas canisters—are grouped in rows on the left side of the image. Also visible are several large pipes piled alongside each other, providing a sense of ongoing construction or manufacturing activity.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a different stack of what appears to be steel or metal pipes occupies the space. They are organized in a systematic manner, indicating an organized storage system.\n\nAdding a human or activity element to the scene, a yellow forklift is positioned near the center, slightly left. It's facing away from the viewer and towards the open door of the dome, suggesting movement or operations involving the transfer or loading of materials.\n\nThe environment suggests an expansive industrial or factory area, with visible indicators of heavy manufacturing or processing. The scene's composition effectively illustrates an active industrial environment with dedicated spaces for different materials and functions. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late afternoon, providing a softer light on the metal structures and materials at the site.","title":"Shell casings are stacked outside \"domes.\"  The domes are notorious for the lack of air circulation and the heat which builds up inside.
