{"path":"543593.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction site scene focusing on the development of a large wooden structure. In the foreground, a yellow bulldozer is prominently featured, positioned facing the viewer. It is parked and unattended with its blade and wheels close to the ground.\n\nIn the background, extensive wooden framework and beams form the structure of what appears to be a developing building. Several workers are observed on this construction skeleton. One individual is standing on the roof part, probably securing or laying down roofing materials. Another worker is seen some levels below, possibly engaged in measuring or constructing another section of the framework.\n\nThe environment around the construction site includes tall pine trees, suggesting that the location is in a wooded or rural area. The sky is clear and deep blue, indicating it might be a bright, sunny day, which illuminates the construction site with natural light. The overall scene captures a moment of active construction work with a focus on wooden architecture, highlighting the initial phases of building in a potentially residential or recreational area.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["553391","543583","556940","547858","545665","545652","557479","557730","554544","553378","542614","543114","555601","557728","553382","543584"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","framework","worker","phase","blade","roofing","measure","bulldozer","secure"]}
