{"path":"543079.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal rocky landscape likely during low tide, with large boulders and smaller scattered rocks visible. Two prominent rocks in the foreground are marked with graffiti or paint. The left boulder has two hearts painted in white and orange, with '68' in orange and the word 'LOVE' in white. The right rock features letters, possibly initials, and numbers (\"HB 67 11\"), painted in white.\n\nThe area has puddles of water, reflecting the sky and some of the rocky forms, creating a mirror-like effect that contributes to the overall serene yet rugged atmosphere of the scene. The background shows additional rocks and the open sea, hinting at a vast and unpopulated natural environment. The sky is somewhat overcast with soft, diffused lighting and hints of blue peeking through the clouds. The overall setting suggests a feeling of solitude and the impact of human presence in natural locations, evidenced by the graffiti on the rocks.","title":"Graffiti deface ancient rocks, tidal pool reflects sky and clouds","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["542915","557118","554555","545122","549353","547486","543025","545130","543142","549338","543237","543306","543204","553852","545173","543295"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","graffiti","boulder","paint","love","heart","tide","puddle","peek","white"]}
