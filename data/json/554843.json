{"path":"554843.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a cluster of vibrant pink flowers, each with five delicate petals. The flowers are arranged around a dark central core from which several slender, green leaves protrude, adding contrast to the deep pink petals. The background is softly blurred, using a shallow depth of field which highlights the flowers in the foreground. The out-of-focus areas contain hues of earthy browns and hints of green, suggesting a natural, outdoor setting. The lighting in the image subtly enhances the texture of the petals and the overall serene mood of the composition.","title":"Iron weed in bloom in the Texas countryside, near San Antonio","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554595","543597","542970","554115","553366","553588","557500","552552","557545","557167","550462","557618","544934","544875","554111","545695"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","flower","core","protrude","contain","arrange","brown","cluster","blur","green"]}
