{"path":"556195.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban streetscape, characterized by a large number of cars lined up and congested traffic extending towards the horizon. The road, filled with vehicles, runs straight through the middle of the photo toward a distant, prominent classical building reminiscent of early 20th-century architectural styles. This building has a large central facade featuring columns and large stairs leading up to it, suggesting it might be a government or cultural institution.\n\nFlanking the sides of the road are rows of mature, leafy trees which provide a green canopy above the parked cars on either side. The perspective of the photo, taken from an elevated vantage point, enhances the sense of depth and congestion, as the road and cars diminish in size toward the center of the frame.\n\nIn the distant background, beyond the main classical building, other high-rise buildings are visible, indicating this scene is set in a densely populated, urban environment. The overall lighting suggests it is either late afternoon or early morning, as the light appears soft and diffuse.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by this scene is one of busy city life, potentially during rush hour, juxtaposed against a backdrop of historical and modern architecture.","title":"A portion of lake shore drive in Chicago.  It and the outer drive are the city's most spectacular street.  Traffic motors along lake Michigan from 5600 north to 6600 south, generally at 45 mph.  The drive provides a continuous, landscaped aspect of Chicago's front yard.  There are four lanes each way, but six lanes are one way in and six out during the morning and evening rush hours.  The field museum of natural history is seen in the background","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553893","556732","556729","556727","546370","552711","546716","549849","545884","553718","548419","547776","546727","556681","546730","546707"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","streetscape","mature","congest","car","diminish","institution","government","rush","congestion"]}
