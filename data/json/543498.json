{"path":"543498.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young man running along a sandy beach next to the ocean. He is dressed casually in a long-sleeve dark sweater and dark capri pants. The man is barefoot, his feet making contact with the wet sand as one of his legs is bent at the knee in mid-stride, enhancing the sense of motion in the image. He seems to be running away from or alongside the gentle surf, with waves rolling in near him.\n\nThe background features the ocean with multiple layers of waves; the closer ones breaking in white foam while the more distant ones appear calmer and undisturbed. The sky is clear with no visible clouds providing a bright blue backdrop to the scene.\n\nThe setting evokes a sense of solitude and peaceful interaction with nature, emphasized by the man's engagement in his activity and the wide-open space around him. The image suggests a leisurely time spent at the beach, enjoying the natural environment and the physical activity. The mood is tranquil and carefree, supported by the natural lighting and the composition of the sea and sky meeting along a gently curved horizon.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["554122","547943","543293","546953","547612","553072","550826","543460","544191","543073","555402","544869","547600","547607","548291","545195"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["one","ocean","wave","beach","surf","contact","stride","meeting","foot","knee"]}
