{"path":"544170.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape featuring a body of water that extends towards a dramatic mountainous backdrop. In the foreground, the left portion shows a rocky cliff that descends into the water. On the right, the scene opens up to a broader view of the water which has a slight ripple, reflecting a soft light. \n\nA cluster of what appears to be small white buildings or structures is visible along the shoreline adjacent to the water. These buildings look like they could be part of a small town or community, situated just at the base of large, majestic rock formations which dominate the background. These rock formations are layered and have varying shades of red and beige, suggesting sedimentary rock compositions. The contours of the landscape create a dramatic and rugged visual texture.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with hints of blue and a warm glow, possibly from the setting or rising sun, adding a soft illumination to the upper parts of the cliffs and mountains, providing a beautiful contrast with the darker tones of the foreground and the reflective water surface. The overall atmosphere of the scene is serene yet awe-inspiring, with natural colors and light that bring out the vivid textures and forms of the landscape.","title":"View of glen canyon, Utah, from the Arizona shore of lake powell","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["552894","544155","544393","552886","543761","548919","543771","552904","544383","552889","544453","545639","543816","552900","552893","542583"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["cliff","rock","formation","descend","water","bring","illumination","open","contour","texture"]}
