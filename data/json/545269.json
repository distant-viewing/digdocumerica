{"path":"545269.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, a man is standing outdoors amidst a landscape of fallen trees and debris that gives the appearance of a scene following a natural disaster or logging activity. The man, appearing middle-aged, is positioned in the foreground. He is wearing a silver hard hat, a blue long-sleeve shirt under a red vest, and dark pants. He is also equipped with a leather belt, boots, and is wearing glasses.\n\nThe environment surrounding the man is wild and rugged; numerous large, fallen tree trunks lie scattered around, with broken branches and stumps visible. The background shows a dense forest on a slope with some of the trees still standing but many appearing damaged or dead. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an outdoor, daylight setting.\n\nThis setting seems to reflect a fieldwork scenario, possibly related to forestry, environmental research, or disaster assessment, indicated by the man's attire and protective gear. The image conveys a sense of active engagement with a challenging outdoor environment.","title":"Butte Creek stream, formerly a salmon spawning ground, was ruined by the improper forestry practices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, according to forestry consultant Dee Terry.
