{"path":"548884.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and vintage-looking scene featuring a biplane during what appears to be either an early morning or late evening flight, given the subdued lighting and the silhouette effect. The biplane, characterized by its two main wings stacked one above the other, is shown in mid-flight close to the ground, kicking up a trail of dust and debris behind it. The aircraftâ€™s front, including the engine and propeller, is central in the image, facing the viewer, while its tail extends towards the back.\n\nThe background is quite minimalistic, primarily showing a soft, hazy horizon that blends into a nearly monochromatic sky. This simplicity emphasizes the silhouette of the airplane and the dynamic activity depicted. The overall atmosphere of the picture conveys a sense of motion and an old-time adventurous spirit, reminiscent of early flight exploration eras. The lighting and angle create a strong silhouette of the biplane, highlighting its distinctive structural elements and the action of flight.","title":"Crop duster plane at work in Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549072","553873","542500","542506","542496","548841","542501","542499","542504","548215","542793","544491","548881","542717","542720","542498"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["biplane","flight","silhouette","propeller","spirit","airplane","tail","wing","engine","aircraft"]}
