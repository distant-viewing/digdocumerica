{"path":"543475.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This is a vividly colored photograph that depicts a man outdoors. The man is caught in profile view and appears to be mid-stride. He wears a dark bowler hat with a long feather tucked into its band. His facial features include a large mustache and he has a mild, content expression. He sports a dark-green sleeveless vest over a light-green T-shirt, coupled with faded blue jeans.\n\nIn his hands, he holds a partially visible wine bottle with a green label and some illustrations of grapes and leaves. His right hand is unscrewing the cap of the bottle. The leather vest is another noticeable element of his attire, adding a unique texture to his casual, somewhat eclectic outfit.\n\nThe backdrop is blurred but seems to be an outdoor setting with sandy, rocky ground which suggests a natural, rugged terrainâ€”an inference supported by the sunlit, high-contrast lighting conditions.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of leisurely, perhaps impromptu, outdoor activity, emphasizing a relaxed and slightly rustic aesthetic.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz County (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz County, California","nn1":["551300","554677","553115","554858","547679","553176","553418","542613","553270","547329","543034","557173","544295","552873","557112","547416"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["vest","bottle","illustration","leather","stride","feather","tuck","mustache","band","hand"]}
