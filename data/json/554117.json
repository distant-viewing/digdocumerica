{"path":"554117.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a vibrantly colored hibiscus flower. The flower, primarily in a rich shade of red, has a large, fully opened bloom with five delicate petals that appear soft and slightly ruffled at the edges. The center of the flower is dominated by a prominent, elongated pistil tipped with visible yellow pollen, surrounded by several shorter stamens. The background of the image is completely dark, enhancing the stark contrast with the vivid red of the hibiscus. The lighting focuses on the flower, highlighting its texture and color saturation, and there are faint reflections of light visible on the petals and pistil, adding depth and dimension to the image. The angle of the shot and the magnification create an intimate and detailed view of the flower's structure and colors.","title":"Hibiscus","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["553949","553948","554116","554840","557545","544891","547815","557586","555035","554843","543623","554587","553366","557500","545699","554115"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","tipp","ruffle","stamen","shorter","dimension","elongate","saturation","bloom"]}
