{"path":"548459.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged woman sitting in a living room. She is wearing a sleeveless, mustard yellow dress and large-framed glasses. Seated in a sleek, black chair with armrests, she looks directly at the camera with a subtle smile.\n\nThe room has a vintage vibe, with wood-paneled walls that add a cozy feel. To the left, a small wooden coffee table holds a clear glass ashtray and sits in front of a dark green couch. There's a television set housed within a dark wooden console, typical of mid-20th-century decor.\n\nOn the coffee table, there's a vase with several large, red flowers, possibly anthuriums, adding a splash of color to the scene. The background includes a lamp with a classic beige shade and a framed picture or painting hanging on the wall. The lighting comes from a window covered with sheer curtains, softening the natural light entering the room.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a peaceful domestic scene, reflective of a certain era indicated by the style of interior decoration and the subject's attire.","title":"Carolyn brobrek in living room of her home at 99 cowper street where, in october 1969, she felt her ears pop when a jet took off.
