{"path":"553940.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a residential area, depicting a densely populated neighborhood. The photograph shows hundreds of houses arranged closely together, mostly single-story structures with various roofing colors. The layout of the streets is grid-like in some areas, while slightly more organic in others, adapting to the topography. The area is bounded by gentle hills, and the houses seem to almost creep up the inclines. The background features rolling hills and higher terrains with a hint of vegetation. The setting appears to be suburban, and the architecture suggests a warm climate, possibly due to the presence of numerous trees scattered throughout the neighborhood. Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of a spacious residential sector, nestled in a valley-like setting with natural boundaries formed by the surrounding hills.","title":"Pearl City, on the west side of Honolulu, is the fastest growing area in all of Hawaii.
