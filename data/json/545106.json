{"path":"545106.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal beach landscape. From a high vantage point, the viewer looks down upon a long, curving sandy beach bordered by the blue ocean on one side. Waves gently lap at the shoreline, creating a foamy surf. The beach is bookended by rugged rock formations and cliffs, some of which protrude into the sea forming small, rocky islets.\n\nTo the left, large rocks sit close to the shore, partially submerged by the ocean. The right side of the beach shows more gentle slopes, with eroded cliff faces worn smooth by elements, suggesting softer geological features compared to the sharper, jagged rocks on the left.\n\nThe beach itself is undisturbed, with no visible signs of human activity, providing a natural and pristine appearance. Patches of green vegetation are visible both on the cliffs and at the edges of the beach, hinting at resilient plant life thriving in this coastal environment.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day ideal for highlighting the natural beauty of this coastal scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its natural curves, varying textures, and contrasting elements of rock, sand, and water, offers a peaceful yet dynamic representation of a coastal landscape.","title":"Oregon--near Seal Rock","placename":"Seal Rock (Or.)","location":"Seal Rock, Oregon","nn1":["543250","551554","543300","545226","543299","543287","554023","543088","545222","543289","543255","543184","545125","545129","543328","547697"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","cliff","rock","ocean","islet","curve","surf","foamy","protrude","erod"]}
