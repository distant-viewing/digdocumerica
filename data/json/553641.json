{"path":"553641.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man engaged in a logging activity, set in a bustling outdoor lumberyard. The man, dressed in work clothes—a blue shirt and dark pants—is kneeling beside a large cut log. He is in the process of measuring the log with a yellow measuring tape, suggesting he is evaluating its size, likely for processing or sale.\n\nThe setting is vibrant and rugged, with an expansive background filled with neatly stacked piles of various logs, indicating a substantial logging operation. The sky overhead is dramatic, featuring dark, swirling clouds that suggest the potential of an impending storm, adding a dynamic and somewhat foreboding atmosphere to the scene. \n\nThe foreground shows more logs and debris from the logging activities, emphasizing the industry's physical nature. There is also a spray can, possibly used for marking the logs, placed beside the man, integrating an element of the tools used in this field.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of daily labor in the logging industry, highlighting both the hard work involved and the environment in which it takes place.","title":"In august, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora, California salvage operations on acreage owned by the pickering lumber company of standard, California., began promptly.
