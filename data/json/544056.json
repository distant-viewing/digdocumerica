{"path":"544056.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image portrays a rugged landscape, predominantly characterized by reddish-brown tones, suggestive of a dry, arid environment, possibly a mining area given the context of the photo. At the focal point of the composition, there's a rectangular tunnel entrance, which appears to be reinforced with timber framing, cut into a rockface. The tunnel emits a sense of abandonment and mystery.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is a pool of water with a noticeably reddish hue, likely caused by iron-rich minerals in the area. The surface of the water is littered with small rocks and debris, which could suggest a lack of regular maintenance or little human activity. Various sizes of stones and soil textures dominate the scene around the pool and the entrance to the tunnel. The ground appears rough and uneven, strewn with fragments of rocks and smaller grains that could be remnants of mining activity.\n\nThe overall lighting of the scene is bright, indicating that the photograph was taken in daylight conditions which sharply accentuate the vivid red and brown colors of the soil and rocks. The bright light casts shadows within the tunnel entrance, creating a stark contrast to the illuminated landscape.\n\nThe presentation and elements within the photo suggest a deserted mining area, leaving the viewer with a curiosity about the history, function, and current status of the tunnel within such a stark and seemingly isolated environment.","title":"Drainage from an abandoned mine pollutes nearby streams with iron oxides.","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["543848","545529","556521","544751","555610","543822","552420","544418","551534","556519","543836","554817","554804","554802","552422","545534"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["tunnel","entrance","mining","pool","rock","status","soil","presentation","iron","fragment"]}
