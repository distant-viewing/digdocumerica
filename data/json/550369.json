{"path":"550369.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene featuring significant pollution. The river water appears dark, almost black, suggesting heavy contamination. There are extensive formations of white and greyish foam swirling on the river surface, creating intricate patterns and shapes that span across the frame. These foam patterns indicate the presence of foreign substances, possibly detergents or other industrial pollutants.\n\nThe background shows a natural landscape framing both sides of the polluted river. On the left bank, there are lush green trees and a small hint of a building partially obscured by foliage. On the right bank, more dense greenery is visible along with a residential or possibly small institutional building perched higher up, overseeing the river. The sky is clear and blue, adding a stark contrast to the dark tones of the polluted water. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph juxtaposes the natural beauty of the landscape and the man-made impact on the environment, highlighted by the polluted river. This creates a striking visual narrative about environmental degradation.","title":"Foamy st.
