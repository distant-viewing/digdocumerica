{"path":"557441.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image centered around a wooden fence post that is partially submerged in calm water, reflecting in it as well. Atop the post, a white and red sign is affixed, prominently displaying text that reads “PRIVATE PROPERTY NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT\" followed by further text that warns \"VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED\" under the jurisdiction of \"SEC. 602.\" The name “THE IRVINE CO.” is noted at the bottom, possibly indicating the managing entity or owner. \n\nVisible are also barbed wire strands stretching horizontally from the post, suggesting the fence serves as a boundary marker. The background features what appears to be lush wetlands or a flooded area, with sparse vegetation partially submerged by the water. The environment suggests a rural or undeveloped landscape, possibly a protected or private natural area. The sky above is clear, contributing to the overall serene yet resolute mood portrayed by the scene.","title":"Private property is posted in Upper Newport Bay, near Newport Bay, the bay, an excellent example of a bird refuge, was scheduled for development as a yacht harbor.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["548836","548845","554103","544263","557474","552076","548846","547910","547046","545159","552211","553344","543168","545949","548063","544288"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["post","submerge","entity","text","trespassing","fence","warn","owner","affix","strand"]}
