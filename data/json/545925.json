{"path":"545925.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory complex. In the foreground, there is a stack of wood materials, possibly pallets or wooden planks, laid out neatly in rows, indicating an area of storage or processing. Behind this foreground detail, the central focus of the image is a significant industrial plant.\n\nProminent in the scene is a towering smokestack, which stands out due to its large size and red and white color banding at the top, from which white smoke is billowing into the sky. Several other smaller smokestacks and industrial structures scattered throughout the scene also release white smoke, contributing to a busy industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe background reveals a slightly clouded sky, which allows for a bright daylight setting that illuminates the entire scene. The overall composition and elements present in the photograph suggest a setting involved in heavy industry, likely a manufacturing or processing plant of some kind. The smoke emissions imply active production processes taking place at the time the photograph was taken.","title":"Georgia Pacific lumber mill","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["545910","543005","550716","550869","546908","550876","543011","557293","548376","550328","544691","545244","552138","546143","550329","548336"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["smoke","smokestack","processing","pallet","plant","kind","production","emission","plank","manufacturing"]}
