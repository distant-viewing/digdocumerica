{"path":"557653.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a small town nestled in a lush, mountainous landscape. The central focus is a main street that runs roughly horizontally across the image, lined with red-roofed buildings that appear to be a mix of residential and possibly commercial properties. There are several vehicles on the road, indicating moderate traffic. Parallel to the main street and slightly to the right, there is a large, open green space that could be a park or communal area, enhancing the town's scenic charm.\n\nSurrounding the central built area are various other homes scattered among patches of dense greenery, likely trees and shrubbery characteristic of a temperate climate. The backdrop consists of rolling hills and mountains, suggesting that this town is situated in a valley-like area. The mountains are covered in dense forests, adding to the picturesque quality of the setting. The sky above is clear with no visible clouds, indicating fair weather and contributing to the bright and vivid colors of the terrain and architecture.","title":"Aerial view of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown.
