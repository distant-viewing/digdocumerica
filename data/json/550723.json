{"path":"550723.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and somewhat unsettling scene of pollution in a river. The body of water is divided into distinct sections by color; on one side there's a natural dark blue, suggestive of typical river water, while the other side is covered in a striking pinkish-white foam, indicative of chemical contamination or industrial waste.\n\nIn the foreground, details such as twigs, rocks, and debris are visible in the contaminated part of the river, adding to the bleak, polluted feel of the scene. The clear demarcation in the river's coloration might suggest the point of discharge for the pollutants.\n\nBeyond the water, the landscape includes a row of houses nestled among lush green trees. These structures appear quaint and residential, contrasting sharply with the foreboding polluted river in front of them. The backdrop is dominated by dense forestry and hills, providing a serene contrast to the disturbed river.\n\nOverall, the composition and juxtaposition in this photograph powerfully highlight the impact of environmental pollution against the natural beauty of the landscape, creating a strong visual statement on the importance of environmental conservation.","title":"View of the Androscoggin River from the Oxford Paper Company mill at Rumford, showing outflow of wastes from the mill.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550369","551531","550206","552098","544804","550371","543819","545168","544779","548090","552080","552811","544810","550946","552127","547524"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","pollution","discharge","statement","demarcation","contamination","pollutant","twig","forestry","coloration"]}
