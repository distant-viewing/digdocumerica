{"path":"544385.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photo captures a scene containing five people outdoors, on what appears to be a sandy area. Involved in the scene are two older adult couples and a young boy.\n\n- On the left, a woman in white and coral colored trousers stands alongside a man in a pink shirt and dark pants, who is holding a small camera or possibly a can.\n- In the middle, a young boy in a dark t-shirt and dark shorts is in motion, seemingly running or playing around energetically.\n- On the right, there is a woman in a white sleeveless top and black pants standing close to a man in a white shirt, dark pants, and a light-colored cowboy hat. This pair is conversing and appears to be looking downwards or at something out of the frame.\n\nThe background is fairly nondescript but suggests a wide-open outdoor area with light sandy ground and no visible structures or objects that jump out prominently. The overall mood seems relaxed and casual, with the individuals enjoying a leisurely day out.","title":"Arizona--Navajo Reservation","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["543234","551425","551004","543534","556525","558292","556531","547873","547974","551027","555546","544206","543321","547756","544739","552952"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["pant","boy","jump","shirt","cowboy","can","converse","woman","pair","couple"]}
