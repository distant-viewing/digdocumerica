{"path":"547569.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph presents a busy multi-lane highway filled with various types of vehicles: cars, trucks, and tankers dominate the scene. The vehicles are captured in motion, heading in both directions on the highway that appears to be divided by a central barrier. The vantage point of the image suggests it was taken from an elevated position, possibly a bridge or another road crossing over the highway, facing one side of the highway with a view extending to the surrounding area.\n\nIn the foreground, a notable truck is seen from a top-down perspective, directly below the vantage point. The truck is moving alongside other vehicles including a vintage-looking car and modern sedans and coupes that reflect automotive designs that might suggest the era in which the photo was taken.\n\nIn the background, beyond the flow of traffic, an industrial landscape unfolds. Several large tanks, possibly for storing oil or chemicals, and tall silos stand prominently. Industrial buildings with flat roofs can be seen as well. The overall setting appears somewhat urban or semi-industrial with no clear signs of residential areas.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, contributing to a somewhat muted color palette overall, with industrial and earth tones dominating. In the farthest view, some miscellaneous structures and possibly other machinery or parts of the industrial complex can be made out, setting a backdrop that gives a context of industry or transportation hub.","title":"I-95 along the waterfront","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["545455","555437","552001","547811","555505","549890","545463","546686","549902","546681","557471","546612","556194","548084","542764","547780"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["highway","truck","coupe","tanker","vehicle","point","silo","hub","oil","chemical"]}
