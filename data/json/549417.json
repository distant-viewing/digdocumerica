{"path":"549417.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene on a body of water, likely a lake or river. In the foreground, there is a small boat featuring two occupants. The boat, which is dark-colored, is positioned slightly towards the right side of the frame and is moving slowly on the water. The occupants of the boat are seated towards the back, and one of them appears to be handling a motor or controlling the boat's steering.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a slightly hazy landscape, probably due to the time of day or weather conditions. This includes a line of trees that are somewhat silhouetted against a lighter sky, suggesting an early morning or late evening setting. There are also several sailboats docked at a distance or slowly moving on the water, visible as small shapes with raised sails.\n\nOverall, the image has a serene and quiet mood, enhanced by the soft focus and muted color palette predominantly in blues and grays. The composition helps emphasize a sense of vastness and calmness on the water, reflecting a moment of leisure or gentle activity.","title":"Chesapeake Bay at twilight","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546976","553411","550835","549411","551281","552313","550769","557563","552316","551313","552292","552982","552310","550324","550841","548118"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["occupant","boat","motor","steering","calmness","sail","water","sailboat","gray","vastness"]}
