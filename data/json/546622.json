{"path":"546622.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban street scene, likely from the 1970s based on the style of cars and general ambience. The location is identified by street signs as the intersection near Dupont Circle on Massachusetts Avenue in Northwest Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the foreground, three people are crossing the street. From left to right, the first person is wearing a yellow headscarf and sunglasses and carries what appears to be a briefcase or bag. The middle person is draped in a long dark coat and is wearing sunglasses, while the third person, only partially visible, wears dark clothing and is facing slightly towards the camera.\n\nVisible in the scene are various classic cars of the era, indicating a busy traffic time. A light-colored car, possibly a Chevrolet, occupies the immediate foreground. The background shows a tree-lined street filled with more vehicles that fades into the distance.\n\nThe photograph also exhibits a sense of hurried motion, suggested by the blur of the car in the foreground and the pedestrians in mid-crossing, capturing a slice of daily life in a bustling city environment. The street signs are a sharp focal point, adding a geographic and somewhat nostalgic context to the image.","title":"Pedestrian island on Dupont Circle","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556710","546626","547788","548369","556726","548368","556199","546600","549882","553184","556725","549906","550139","556715","549923","556225"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","car","sunglass","person","briefcase","headscarf","crossing","ambience","blur","intersection"]}
