{"path":"554900.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a casual and intimate moment between a young woman and a young man seated against a large, fallen tree trunk in a natural, perhaps woodland, setting. The woman is wearing a sleeveless, light pastel blue top and short white shorts. Her legs are crossed, and she is wearing sandals. She has dark, long, straight hair and is smiling as she looks affectionately at the man.\n\nThe man, seated closely beside her, is dressed in a yellow t-shirt and white pants, also wearing sandals. He has dark, shoulder-length hair and is turning his face towards the woman, sharing a moment of connection that seems both relaxed and joyful. His pose suggests ease and comfort.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but reveals a green, natural environment that indicates they might be in a park or a similarly wooded area. The ground around them is covered with a mix of soil and small plants, enhancing the sense of being in the midst of nature. The mood of the photograph is serene and heartwarming, emphasizing a personal and tranquil moment shared between two people.","title":"Teenagers enjoy each other's company on the bank of the Frio Canyon River near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554902","554901","551514","554911","554913","548833","545489","551016","552977","551859","549756","551450","551462","554494","554921","551271"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["sandal","woman","ease","comfort","hair","woodland","midst","moment","t","pose"]}
