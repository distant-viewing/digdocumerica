{"path":"555142.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of significant woodland destruction. The foreground is filled with numerous fallen trees scattered chaotically across the ground. Many of these trees appear freshly cut, as indicated by the bright colors of the wood and visible splinters. The area is littered with debris, including branches and leaves, suggesting recent logging activity or a natural disaster.\n\nIn the middle ground, thereâ€™s a visible contrast where a line of upright coniferous trees stands in front of a steep, barren hillside. The hillside, which is covered in smaller tree stumps and fallen wood debris, dramatically showcases the extent of tree removal.\n\nIn the background, through the gaps in the standing trees, a road can be seen running parallel to the scene. This might suggest the proximity of this area to accessible transportation routes, which could be related to the reasons behind the tree felling (e.g., logging activities).\n\nThe scene is set in a natural, outdoor environment, possibly in a mountainous region given the slope of the background terrain. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of intervention in nature, highlighting the impact of human activities or possibly natural occurrences like storms on forested landscapes.","title":"Clear-cutting of second growth Douglas fir and hemlock on the canyon river drainage system in olympic national timberland Washington.
