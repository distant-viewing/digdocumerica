{"path":"549645.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a city street scene from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the style of the clothing, vehicles, and other elements. The setting is possibly in Eastern Europe based on text and architectural details.\n\nIn the foreground, left side of the photo, a woman is walking towards the camera. She is wearing a light blue skirt, dark shoes, and a turquoise shirt under a black blazer. Her hair is short and styled into what resembles a typical 1970s look. Further back on the right, several other individuals are seen walking or standing, including a woman in a red dress and men in suits.\n\nThe street is lined with parked cars, including a notable East European model, suggesting a locale potentially in the former Eastern Bloc. The pavement is marked with parking meters and signs, one prominently featuring a parking symbol (\"P\") against a blue background, and another displaying a parking meter icon.\n\nOn the left side, there are shop fronts with various signs. One sign features what seems to be a falcon or eagle head along with text that might denote names of businesses or services. Due to the quality and angle of the photo, exact details on the signs are slightly unclear, but they contribute to a general sense of a bustling urban street.\n\nThe atmosphere is relatively calm with individuals going about their day, likely typical of a weekday given the attire and activities noted. The area is also shaded with foliage from trees that line the street, adding a sense of verdure to an otherwise urban setting. The architecture visible includes pragmatic, somewhat austere mid-20th-century buildings with large windows and minimal decoration.","title":"Sign announces the installation of parking meters, recently introduced in Belgrade.","placename":"Belgrade (Serbia)","location":"Belgrade, Serbia","nn1":["545231","556715","553184","551835","549923","556726","558253","556711","547191","546626","556808","556742","548369","551824","548399","549671"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["meter","parking","street","sign","text","1970","blazer","locale","standing","symbol"]}
