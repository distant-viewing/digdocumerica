{"path":"551583.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a large cargo ship in a river or large waterway. The ship, named \"Edgar B. Speer\" and registered in Wilmington, DE, is predominantly red and black with a small section in white. It displays a large star emblem and an American flag on its stern. The ship is partially loaded with what appears to be iron ore, as indicated by the distinct dark cargo visible above the ship's deck and within its open hold compartments which are covered by substantial structures.\n\nThe Edgar B. Speer is docked at a large loading facility, evidenced by the industrial metal framework that extends over the ship, possibly for loading or unloading purposes. The water around the ship has a rich reddish-brown color, possibly due to sediment or the surrounding geography.\n\nThe sky is partially cloudy but allows for ample sunlight, casting glimmers on the water's surface and giving the scene a bright, vibrant look. The image captures the ship almost in profile, maximizing the visibility of its features and the activity around it. There's no visible human activity in the immediate area, suggesting the photograph might be more focused on the ship and industrial operations rather than personal or human elements.","title":"Red clay from the banks of the Nemadji River and iron ore spillage at Burlington Northern Railroad loading docks gives brown-orange color to Lake Superior.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546024","550873","546020","551558","551582","548201","548126","551581","546804","548127","555811","546860","553740","550918","546082","547627"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","loading","cargo","glimmer","ore","maximize","register","geography","unloading","compartment"]}
