{"path":"552152.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene from an elevated or aerial perspective. The predominant structure in the image is a large, maroon-colored warehouse or factory building with several doors and noticeable roof vents. In front of this building are several forklifts and pallets, suggesting regular loading or unloading activities.\n\nAdjacent to the building, there is a considerable amount of industrial material. Notably, there is a large pile of what appears to be wood chips or sawdust, suggestive of wood-processing activities. The ground is patchy with areas of accumulated snow, indicating cold weather.\n\nParallel to the forefront of the image is a set of black cylindrical structures, possibly for storage or processing, aligned in a row stretching across the length of the photo. These are intersected by pieces of timber, possibly rail tracks, leading towards the adjacent piles of debris.\n\nThe overall scene is an amalgamation of industrial warehouse operations possibly linked to lumber or related industries, characterized by material storage, and handling equipment in a cold environment where snow is present. The photo captures the functional and robust nature of industrial setups.","title":"Scott sulphite pulp mill discharges water waste","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550349","552207","547010","542942","548405","555779","545256","543169","550350","546236","551988","554435","548353","555761","547528","543749"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["warehouse","snow","pallet","pile","industries","storage","wood","lumber","chip","vent"]}
