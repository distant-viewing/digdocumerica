{"path":"551037.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting, likely a mining operation located in a mountainous area. In the foreground, there's a large pile of loose stones, mostly a mixture of rocks and pebbles, indicating mining activity. Adjacent to this pile runs a conveyor belt system that moves materials from one part of the site to another. The conveyor belt is mounted on a metal structure and extends into the midground, where it appears to connect to a larger processing facility.\n\nThe processing facility features several metallic structures and buildings, with visible ducts and other industrial apparatus. There is additional stockpiled material near these structures, likely processed or to be processed minerals or coal. The setting has an overcast sky which casts a muted light over the scene, enhancing the industrial feel of the photograph.\n\nThe environment is surrounded by lush green mountains, providing a stark natural backdrop contrasting with the man-made industrial elements. The tree-covered hill slopes sharply upwards and is shrouded in a light mist or haze, possibly due to humidity or dust from the mining operations.\n\nOverall, the image provides a vivid depiction of a heavy industrial operation situated within a natural landscape, highlighting the interaction and contrast between industrial development and the natural environment.","title":"The large slag pile in foreground has been covered with dirt to keep down the dust at the Valley Camp Coal Company.","placename":"Shrewsbury (W.
