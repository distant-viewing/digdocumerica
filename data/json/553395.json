{"path":"553395.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a turbulent river or stream flowing forcefully through a stone-built canal or riverbed. The water appears muddy and swift, showing various degrees of turbulence and whitewater as it courses through the channel. The river is bordered by sturdy stone walls on both sides, suggesting an engineered waterway possibly designed for controlling water flow or for mill operations.\n\nIn the background, there's an old building made of dark-colored stone, adding to the scene a mood of historical or industrial use. There are large trees and some greenery around, which, along with the architecture, suggest this might be an area within a well-established town or city. Partially visible on the right side of the image, there is a bridge and a glimpse of what seems to be older model cars, thereby dating the photograph rather than it representing contemporary time.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the raw power of nature as represented by the unbridled water, yet simultaneously shows human effort to contain and utilize this force, evident through the structured stonework and built environment surrounding the waterway.","title":"Waste from the Weyerhaeuser paper mill discolors nearby stream.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553389","553420","548061","542743","547238","550367","550647","553390","544856","550742","552137","553462","553416","553380","550698","546111"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["stone","waterway","turbulence","stonework","degree","riverbed","mill","canal","channel","force"]}
