{"path":"550398.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a remote industrial facility surrounded by a lush, green landscape. Key features include:\n\n1. **Industrial Facility**: In the center of the image, there is a cluster of large, rectangular buildings characterized by flat roofs. The central composition comprises multiple structures closely aligned, possibly serving as storage or operational units. Several large, yellow rectangular objects, possibly containers or machinery, are neatly arranged outside the buildings, suggesting ongoing industrial or construction activity.\n\n2. **Access Roads**: A wide, unpaved road leads directly to the industrial facility, branching off to connect with various parts of the complex. This road appears to be the main access route for vehicles.\n\n3. **Natural Environment**: The facility is nestled within a vast expanse of green terrain, indicative of a wetland or marsh-like environment, given the apparent moisture content and the texture of the landscape. \n\n4. **Water Bodies**: There are multiple water bodies visible in the photograph. A winding river cuts through the landscape, curving around the right side and top of the facility, and several smaller bodies of water can be seen scattered throughout the green field.\n\n5. **Runway/Track**: To the right of the facility, there's a long, straight clearing that resembles a dirt track or runway, hinting at possible aviation-related uses or access.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a contrast between industrial development and natural environment, emphasizing the isolated and self-contained nature of such facilities in remote locations.","title":"Happy valley camp.
