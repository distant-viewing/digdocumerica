{"path":"548466.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively beach scene set against an unusual backdrop of airport runways and landing aircraft. In the foreground, a woman in a light-colored bikini is seen sitting on a beach blanket on sandy terrain. She appears to be leaning forward, resting her weight on one arm, while looking off to her left. Directly in front of her is a person reclining on the beach, partially cropped by the frame, wearing white shorts. Various other beachgoers are captured in this scene, including individuals swimming in the water, small groups on the shore, and children playing in the sand.\n\nIn the background, distinctly juxtaposing the relaxed beachfront activity, there are two large airplanesâ€”one landed and stationary on the runway, and another one in the process of taking off. The stark contrast between the leisurely beach scene and the busy airport operations gives this image a surreal quality. The horizon shows a clear sky, contributing to the bright and sunny day which attracts visitors to relax by the waterside despite the proximity to the airplanes.","title":"Constitution Beach--within sight and sound of Logan Airport's takeoff runway 22R","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548468","547507","550936","548541","553685","547680","557458","546794","546408","550932","553686","543534","553683","548929","550919","545162"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","runway","airport","airplane","beachgoer","landing","recline","weight","bikini","attract"]}
