{"path":"549481.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features a circular, fisheye lens view capturing a scene on a bridge. Two flags, the American flag on the left and the Canadian flag on the right, are prominently displayed, fluttering in the wind on flagpoles that are bent in an arc shape.\n\nIn the center of the image, two individuals, possibly tourists, are standing by the railing of the bridge, engaging in conversation. The bridge appears to be a pedestrian zone as indicated by the metal railing and the absence of vehicular traffic.\n\nThe \"USA\" text painted on the ground suggests that one side of the bridge connects to the United States, likely referencing a boundary or a point of interest.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a glimpse of a waterfall, possibly Niagara Falls given its location between the United States and Canada, along with some high-rise buildings and a tower, which resembles the Skylon Tower, further hinting at the likelihood of this being Niagara Falls.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its use of the fisheye lens, creates a distinctive, curved perspective, emphasizing the expanse of the bridge and the surrounding landmarks. The photograph has a broad daylight setting with clear skies, contributing to the visibility and vibrancy of the scene.","title":"\"fish-eye\" camera view of united states-canada boundary line on rainbow bridge, which spans the niagara river just below the falls.
