{"path":"554998.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a serene and mysterious forest scene, dominated by the focal point of a young, slender tree in the foreground. The tree is adorned with moss or fern-like plants draping over its branches, adding a lush, green texture against the dark backdrop of the dense woods. Sunlight streams through the canopy, creating a striking contrast by illuminating parts of the tree and the forest floor while leaving other sections in deep shadow.\n\nThe light source, possibly the sun, is partially visible through the tree branches and casts intricate patterns of light and shadow across the scene, contributing to the overall atmospheric and enchanting effect. The background is shadowy and indistinct, with hints of other trees and foliage, suggesting the depth and density of the forest.\n\nThe ground is blanketed with what appears to be fallen leaves, pine needles, or other organic forest debris, reflecting the secluded and untouched nature of this woodland environment. The mood is quiet and seems somewhat isolated, evoking a sense of stillness and the intrinsic beauty of a natural forest setting undisturbed by human activity.","title":"Stagnated spruce, covered with club moss waits beneath the dense forest canopy for a mature tree to fall and give it enough light for rapid growth in the Olympic National Park, Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542932","554961","542931","554393","554976","542958","558082","554394","542846","555096","542929","542791","543021","555118","550791","555054"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","branch","tree","fern","needle","moss","stillness","source","density","shadow"]}
