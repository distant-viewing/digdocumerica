{"path":"546292.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a pair of human hands performing a dissection on a small silver fish. The hands belong to an individual wearing a white lab coat, suggesting a scientific or research environment. In one hand, the individual is holding the fish, while the other hand uses scissors to cut or examine the fish's interior.\n\nIn the background, there are labels with percentages noted as \"50% L.O.U\" and \"70% L.O.U\", among other partially visible labels which might indicate different concentrations of a substance, possibly related to the study being conducted. The background also features other laboratory equipment and containers, enhancing the scientific context of the activity.\n\nThe focus of the image is on the meticulous activity of examining the fish, potentially to study its anatomy or for testing reactions to various substances implied by the background labels. The setting appears orderly with a focus on precise and careful work.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: pathobiology lab pathobiologist is removing the liver from a spotfish.
