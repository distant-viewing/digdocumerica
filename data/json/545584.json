{"path":"545584.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic view from inside a cave-like rock formation. The primary viewpoint is through a large, naturally formed archway, which frames the scene beyond in a circular shape, revealing a vivid landscape under a clear blue sky. The edges of the archway are rugged and uneven, with visible stratifications and variations in color, ranging from darker shades at the bottom to lighter, sunlit tones at the top.\n\nThe landscape visible through the arch consists of a wide, open valley with several layers of rock formations that recede into the distance. These formations have flat tops and are interspersed with areas of vegetation. The valley floor appears semi-arid, with some patches of greenery that suggest sparse vegetation. A dirt road snakes through the middle of the valley, adding a hint of human presence in this otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its natural arch framing the distant landscape, creates a striking contrast between the shadowy foreground and the brightly lit scenery, emphasizing the grandeur and isolation of the rock formation and the expansive view it offers.","title":"\"paul bunyon's potty\" in the needles is a fine example of a pot hole arch: an arch through a roof","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544939","545563","545578","545568","545555","545711","545566","553077","545554","544935","545572","545580","544397","544745","545570","545550"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["formation","archway","arch","rock","valley","vally","stratification","cave","shadowy","recede"]}
