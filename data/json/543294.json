{"path":"543294.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features an intriguing geological formation composed predominantly of weathered rock, which is shaped by coastal erosional processes. The terrain is characterized by smooth, sinuous surfaces with numerous indentations, grooves, and rounded protuberances, giving it an almost organic look. The rock's colors range from shades of gray to subtle browns, and its surface appears finely textured.\n\nThe formation spans from the foreground deep into the mid-ground of the image, leading the viewer's eye towards a slightly darker, rougher rock formation situated to the left side. The right side of the photograph opens to a view of the ocean. Visible in the top right corner is a vast expanse of blue sea, its surface slightly agitated, hinting at light wind conditions.\n\nThe photograph captures a clear sky with ample sunlight illuminating the formation, creating pronounced shadows in the recesses of the rock, which enhance the three-dimensional feel of the surface. The scene encapsulates a serene yet rugged coastal environment, emphasizing the natural beauty and dramatic forms created by the interaction of rock, wind, and water.","title":"California--point lobos reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543289","545130","545117","545173","543250","553771","545126","545122","543142","553775","543068","543307","543139","547486","543295","543291"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["formation","rock","surface","recess","wind","groove","open","encapsulate","span","gray"]}
