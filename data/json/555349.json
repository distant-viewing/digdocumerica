{"path":"555349.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In this photograph, a man is engaged in examining or adjusting a series of concentrated solar panels. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly on a rooftop or an outdoor experimental setup, given the presence of adjacent buildings and a clear sky overhead.\n\nThe man, who appears focused on his task, is wearing a dark gray buttoned shirt. His hair is medium length and he has a mustache, typical of styles from past decades, possibly indicating the photo's vintage nature. He is reaching out to handle one of the cylindrical solar concentrators, which are sleek, polished, and mounted in a row on a yellow-framed structure.\n\nThe solar concentrators themselves are shiny, reflective, and tubular, pointing towards a design that maximizes the capture and concentration of sunlight. The equipment is technical, with various mechanical elements like brackets and adjustable fittings visible. The intense sunlight is evident through the glare and reflections visible on the surface of the solar concentrators.\n\nThe background is minimal but includes details such as a wall covered with somewhat weathered paint and a small section of another building, all under a bright, clear blue sky.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of human interaction with renewable energy technology, highlighting both the practical aspects of the work and the environmental conditions in which such technologies operate.","title":"Prototype of a linear parabolic reflector used to gather the sun's energy and heat fluid in the center pipe to several hundred degrees F. \"Solar farms\" with banks of such reflectors covering many square miles could drive large turbines and generators and provide almost half the country's electrical energy needs according to the designers.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555347","555323","555348","555293","555343","555341","557328","555327","557312","555309","557332","557319","557320","555292","557334","557338"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["technology","fitting","bracket","glare","mustache","capture","overhead","rooftop","sunlight","decade"]}
