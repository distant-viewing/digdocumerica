{"path":"548971.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage scene focused on a cluster of pale, wildflowers in the foreground growing sparsely from a gravelly, arid roadside. The flowers appear detailed and vivid against the rough texture of the ground. Blurred in the background is a dark-colored car, possibly a classic model from the late 1960s or 1970s, in motion along the road. The carâ€™s motion and the focus on the flowers create a dynamic contrast between nature and human activity.\n\nThe setting is a wide-open landscape, characteristic of a desert or dry region, under a clear blue sky. There are low hills in the distance, contributing to a sense of remote tranquility. The overall composition plays with depth and focus, drawing the viewer's attention to the natural beauty at the roadside, with human presence suggested but not emphasized, encouraging reflection on the interplay between natural elements and human passage through them.","title":"Wildflowers along Nevada highway","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["545880","542642","549002","545703","554920","557549","549018","554031","545723","542709","554805","554130","553010","552549","550795","544080"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["roadside","encourage","motion","wildflowers","flowers","grow","passage","blur","car","pale"]}
