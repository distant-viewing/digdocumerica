{"path":"557658.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features a large, concrete bridge with an arch design, located over a river. The bridge appears sturdy with its thick balustrades and sidewalls that have a series of rectangular openings for aesthetics or structural reasons. The top of the bridge is accessible with a flat pathway, and there are people standing and walking over it, indicating its use as a pedestrian crossing or a shared road.\n\nUnder the arch of the bridge, there is a shaded area where the river flows, and a dirt path runs alongside it. Visible under the arch on the far bank is a group of people, several of whom appear to be children. They are engaging in outdoor activities near the river bank, possibly playing or washing. The setting is quite rural and tranquil, marked by lush greenery surrounding the river and dirt roads.\n\nOn the left side under the bridge, there is a parked vehicle, which looks like an old-fashioned car, suggesting that the image might be from a mid-20th century timeframe. Just in front of the car, a gravel-road leads out from beneath the bridge, blending with the dirt path and providing access to the river area.\n\nThe photo captures a mix of natural landscape and human-made structures, illustrating a daily life scene likely in a rural or semi-rural area. It portrays a peaceful coexistence and utilization of the river and bridge by the local community.","title":"Pedestrian route under the Chattahoochee River bridge connects the Helen, Georgia, city parking lot in the background with Main Street shops and eliminates the need for tourists to cross busy Georgia Highway 17/75 that runs through the town.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557969","549469","542734","548816","557959","557970","552052","544542","549068","545227","558048","551186","548064","558051","542555","551527"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","river","arch","dirt","bank","washing","reason","timeframe","balustrade","road"]}
