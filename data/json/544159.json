{"path":"544159.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene featuring a large-scale industrial or building project. We see two workers clad in safety gear: hard hats, reflective vests, and work clothes, positioned on a vast scaffolding structure. The scaffolding is made of metal poles and horizontal supports, which provide a framework for the workers as they perhaps prepare for further construction tasks or are engaged in inspection.\n\nThe background is dominated by a huge, vertical surface comprising reddish-brown panels that are possibly wooden formwork used in concrete casting. This backdrop gives a rugged, textured appearance, contrasting with the metallic gray of the scaffold. The lighting casts sharp shadows and highlights, enhancing the intricate details of the construction materials and the grid-like pattern formed by the scaffolding.\n\nSome sections of the background panels are not perfectly aligned, which might indicate ongoing work or adjustments. Overall, the image emphasizes themes of labor, construction, and the scale of human enterprise in engineering and building environments.","title":"The Navajo generating plant under construction.
