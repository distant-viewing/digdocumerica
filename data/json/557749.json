{"path":"557749.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a meadow dotted with clumps of small shrubs and scattered cattle unfolds. The cattle, which are brown with white markings, are grazing peacefully. The meadow features dry, yellow grass, suggesting it might be late summer or early fall.\n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a prominent hill, atop which sits a small, white structure with a red roof, resembling a classic gazebo or small chapel. This structure stands out distinctively against the natural greens and browns of the landscape, and sits symmetrically atop the green, grass-covered hill.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest of dark green trees lines the horizon, with a subtle hill visible beneath the cloudy, muted sky. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and somewhat moody, likely due to the dim lighting and soft, natural colors. It's a picturesque setting that evokes a sense of peacefulness and rural beauty.","title":"Cattle grazing near the Nacoochee Indian Mound in the Nacoochee Valley two miles southwest of Helen, Georgia, which is near Robertstown. The mound was the center of the ancient Cherokee town of Gauxule and was reportedly visited by Desoto the Spaniard, in 1540 during his search for gold. Tourists visit the area to camp and fish and view the business district of Helen which has been Renovated with a Bavarian Alpine theme.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549256","549142","554801","550833","542627","554560","546102","554722","557674","557946","551305","554071","555603","545040","555645","550667"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["cattle","meadow","hill","gazebo","clump","peacefulness","grass","marking","fall","summer"]}
