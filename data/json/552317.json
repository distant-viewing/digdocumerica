{"path":"552317.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals fishing from a small boat on a tranquil body of water. The image suggests a serene, leisurely setting surrounded by nature.\n\nThe boat is a typical small fishing boat, equipped with a motor at the back. One person in the boat is seated near the motor, donned in a red jacketâ€”one is actively fishing, casting a line into the water. The other person, wearing a white and blue outfit, appears more relaxed, possibly watching the line or simply enjoying the surroundings. Both individuals are wearing wide-brimmed hats, possibly for protection from the sun.\n\nThe background is dominated by lush green trees, densely packed and forming a solid mass of foliage that provides a vibrant and contrasting backdrop to the darker tones of the water. The sky above the tree line is a light, faded blue, suggesting either a clear day or a slight overcast.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative, emphasizing outdoor recreational activities and a connection with nature. The composition with the focus on the boat and its occupants directs the viewer's attention to their activity and interaction with the environment.","title":"Salmon fishing on the north fork of the lower skagit river near la connor","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552313","550000","554198","551350","552291","548735","546976","552326","553411","551537","552123","552308","557565","544260","552282","550835"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","motor","fish","don","mass","occupant","protection","line","brim","person"]}
