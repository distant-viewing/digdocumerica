{"path":"553309.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph shows a mature woman dressed in what appears to be a thematic or costume outfit, making a playful or whimsical statement. She is wearing a large black witch's hat and glasses, adding to the eccentricity of her appearance. Her expression is partially obscured; however, she appears to be looking away from the camera, possibly engaging with someone out of frame or observing something in the distance.\n\nShe holds a sign prominently displaying the words \"FLY ME\" in white chalk against a black background, suggesting a playful or ironic message, perhaps in the context of a protest, event, or festival. The sign appears to be homemade and is attached to a bicycle handle, indicating mobility in her participation.\n\nBehind the woman, there is a younger individual, partially visible and out of focus. This person wears a casual t-shirt and seems to be involved in a separate activity, looking away from the woman.\n\nThe background is blurred but appears to be an outdoor setting with soft natural lighting, hinting at a public space possibly conducive to gatherings or social events. The overall mood of the photograph seems light-hearted, with a touch of surreal or comic undertone provided by the woman's costume and sign.","title":"Women's suffrage day at fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553240","553321","552720","557039","553200","550079","550077","543323","553307","550048","543864","557177","557928","555934","546623","553709"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","protest","undertone","hear","statement","costume","mobility","event","sign","participation"]}
