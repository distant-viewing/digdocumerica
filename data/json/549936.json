{"path":"549936.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph depicts a large garbage disposal area, which appears to be a landfill or dumpsite. In the foreground, a significant amount of mixed waste, including plastics, paper, and other debris, is scattered across the area. Two large, heavy machinery vehicles are prominently featured in the scene. On the left, there is a dump truck actively dumping more waste into the pile; the rear of the truck is elevated as trash pours out. Next to it, a yellow construction vehicle, possibly a bulldozer or a compactor, is parked with its driver side door open, indicating recent or ongoing use. On the right, another bulldozer is seen with a large shovel attachment, suggesting it is being used to manipulate and compact the trash heap.\n\nIn the background, the area is bordered by a line of trees and beyond that a glimpse of a water body can be seen under a blue sky. There is a person visible near the left side of the image, standing by the yellow vehicle, wearing a dark outfit and possibly observing or managing the operation.\n\nThe overall composition gives an impression of a busy, work-oriented environmental setting focused on waste management, placed in a relatively scenic or natural outer area juxtaposed against the stark and cluttered conditions of the landfill.","title":"The croton dump on the Hudson River is just a few hundred feet from croton point park","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["546246","546235","543828","548210","546257","549792","546231","549795","546250","543821","546761","546238","549937","548350","550252","549750"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","landfill","dump","bulldozer","trash","compactor","next","used","truck","dumpsite"]}
