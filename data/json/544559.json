{"path":"544559.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures three pelicans perched on a bare, gnarled tree branch. The background is a uniform, clear blue sky which vividly contrasts with the dark hues of the pelicans. The pelican on the left is looking straight ahead, while the one in the middle is looking slightly sideways towards the left. The pelican on the right is the most dynamic, with its wings partially spread as if it's either about to take off or adjusting its balance. All three birds exhibit typical pelican features: long beaks with large throat pouches and webbed feet that are gripping the branch tightly. The lighting is bright, likely midday, accentuating the textures of the pelicansâ€™ feathers and the roughness of the tree branch.","title":"Pelicans resting in mangrove trees","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548728","555554","544500","544611","552911","550903","544497","545302","552909","552912","545187","544547","550889","544477","544489","544505"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["pelican","branch","beak","feather","wing","foot","midday","balance","left","bird"]}
