{"path":"557437.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a vibrant scene blending nature with suburban lifestyle. In the foreground, a suburban neighborhood with neatly lined houses and a curved road is visible. The homes appear modern and are equipped with large yards, driveways, and varying roof designs. Some houses have dark shingles whereas others have tile roofs. A swimming pool is situated along one side of the neighborhood. \n\nA prominent feature in the middle ground is a lush, green park area with people gathered in small groups. Paths wind through the park, inviting for a stroll or jog, surrounded by young trees and neatly maintained grass. This communal area promotes a sense of neighborhood and provides a space for residents to enjoy the outdoors.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large rolling hill that encroaches closely behind the neighborhood. The hill's surface shows a mix of green vegetation and areas of bare earth, suggesting either natural erosion or human activity. Its presence offers a striking contrast to the organized and planned environment of the suburban area, giving the landscape a dramatic backdrop and perhaps a hint of nature's overarching presence.\n\nThis juxtaposition of an idyllic suburban lifestyle against the wild, natural terrain illustrates a typical scene in many parts of the world where human habitation meets untouched land. The photograph is well composed, using the curve of the hill to draw the eye back and forth between nature and suburban life.","title":"Residential development in the Irvine Ranch area near Newport Beach. This development is part of a new town of high-value planned units in contrast to uncontrolled private subdivisions. Some 84 percent of the residents in the state live within 30 miles of the coast. This density results in many clashes between developers and conservationists who want to retain the beauty of the land.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557440","557547","557552","553704","557427","553929","548011","543106","548026","558059","557426","557404","557405","557436","558057","547256"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["neighborhood","lifestyle","hill","encroach","stroll","driveway","resident","house","shingle","swimming"]}
