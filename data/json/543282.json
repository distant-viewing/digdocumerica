{"path":"543282.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of several seagulls standing on a wet beach at dusk or during very low light conditions. The birds are evenly spaced and appear to be calmly resting or perhaps searching for food along the shoreline. The wet sand reflects the silhouettes of the birds, creating mirror images of each gull, enhancing the tranquil mood of the scene. The water is calm with subtle ripples, indicating a peaceful environment without much wind. The background is mostly uniform and dark, likely due to the low lighting, focusing all attention on the seagulls and their reflections on the wet sand. The overall ambiance of the photograph is quiet and contemplative.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["552146","547008","544504","545991","554600","543281","553347","542919","544609","543285","547744","548832","548241","544683","545302","543063"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seagull","bird","sand","search","food","mirror","ripple","shoreline","dusk","beach"]}
