{"path":"552237.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an abstract natural scene, likely taken during dusk or dawn given the soft ambient light. The central focus is a large patch of shimmering reflections on the surface of a body of water, such as a lake or slow-moving river. The reflections are bright and concentrated, almost silver-like, suggesting that they are sunlight bouncing off gentle ripples.\n\nThe surrounding water appears dark and smooth, with minute gradations in hue that might indicate slight undulations in the water's surface or variations in depth. No distinct landmarks or solid objects interrupt the expanse of water, lending the image a minimalistic and serene quality.\n\nThe edges of the frame are vignetted, darkening towards the corners, which draws the viewerâ€™s attention towards the bright, reflective patch. The overall composition is simple yet evocative, emphasizing texture and the interplay between light and shadow. This scene likely represents a quiet, reflective moment in nature, devoid of human activity and immersed in tranquility.","title":"Close-ranked snow geese in flight over Stillaguamish Estuary on Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544725","550389","546963","548978","554608","557572","543611","553180","557255","549446","545923","554753","544679","544253","542994","544711"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["vignette","reflection","undulation","gradation","interrupt","immerse","darken","silver","landmark","water"]}
