{"path":"544943.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, natural landscape with several components of interest. At the forefront, a wide, reddish-brown river flows horizontally across the frame, its muddy waters reflecting a slight ripple. The riverbank on the left is layered with small, pebbly stones which are partially submerged in the water.\n\nBeyond the river bank, there is construction or maintenance activity. Visible are parts of heavy machinery, possibly an excavator, along with a couple of small, dark structures which could be temporary shelters or tool sheds. The machinery's presence suggests work related to the river or the surrounding area.\n\nThe background is dominated by striking natural features. Towering mountains capped with snow frame the scene, suggesting this photograph might have been taken in late spring when snow still clings to the higher elevations but the lower lands are thawing. In the middle, an open valley leads the eye toward the mountains, enhancing the depth of the landscape. The trees on the sides of the valley are predominantly bare, indicating that full spring foliage has not yet emerged.\n\nThe combination of human activity with the serene, albeit rugged, natural backdrop makes this an interesting depiction of interaction between humans and nature. The clear sky and bright sunlight suggest good weather, ideal for outdoor activities and work. This setting could be part of a larger natural reserve or a remote area used for resource management.","title":"Polluted stream","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["553380","543670","543739","553392","555674","550524","553653","550698","545632","542880","552994","543716","550526","550518","553420","550530"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["spring","valley","snow","river","machinery","excavator","reserve","cling","mountain","ideal"]}
