{"path":"543628.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor scene focused on a river landscape at either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and the slight play of shadows across the setting. The river, shimmering due to the reflection of the sky above, meanders smoothly through the frame and is interspersed with several small, stony islets visible above the water's surface.\n\nOn the right side of the image, close to the foreground, a person dressed in light-colored casual clothing, possibly a T-shirt and pants, is standing on the river's edge. The individual appears to be engaged in fishing, judging from the stance and the fishing rod they hold directed towards the river.\n\nThe surrounding environment is rich with vegetation, with dense shrubbery and trees lining the banks of the river, enhancing the feel of a secluded, natural spot. The way the light plays on the water, along with the stillness of the scene, lends a serene and somewhat reflective atmosphere to the photograph.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542651","550217","553070","550666","550665","551024","542509","555576","545968","554519","554520","552976","542529","550313","543453","551025"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["river","fishing","islet","play","stance","shrubbery","t","shimmer","rod","judge"]}
