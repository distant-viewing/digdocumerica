{"path":"554144.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a scenic coastal area. The main focus is two large hotel buildings located directly on a rugged coastline. These buildings are multi-storied, modern structures with flat roofs and spacious balconies, likely offering extensive sea views. Between the two buildings, there is a large, circular swimming pool surrounded by a patio area, likely adorned with lounge chairs and umbrellas.\n\nThe surrounding environment features rocky shorelines where waves crash against the rocks, creating white foam. These buildings are positioned amidst lush, tropical greenery that contrasts sharply with the blue of the ocean.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of the hotels, the landscape transitions into a wider area with a mix of vegetation and scattered residential or smaller commercial buildings, visible along a winding road. The backdrop of the scene is dominated by a mountain range covered with dense forest, suggesting a volcanic region, possibly indicating that this location is on an island or along a coastal region known for volcanic activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph with the juxtaposition of man-made structures with the natural coastline and the rugged terrain in the distance evokes a sense of isolated luxury and robust natural beauty.","title":"Kailua, also called the kona coast, on the western side of the island, is part urban and part agricultural and is the fastest developing area on the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554145","543437","553983","553982","553689","553671","544638","554171","554170","554143","543426","551260","545110","553677","553672","543088"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["hotel","coastline","luxury","patio","building","region","lounge","crash","swimming","umbrella"]}
