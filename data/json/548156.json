{"path":"548156.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a lush, vibrant riverscape, where a river winds through a forested area. Several large, distinct rock formations emerge prominently from the river, surrounded by rapid, swirling flows of water. These natural rock formations are irregular in shape and vary in size, standing as stark, solid elements amidst the fluid motion of the water. \n\nThe river itself appears to be wide and active, with white frothy water indicating rapid movement and possible shallow areas. The riverbank is visible at one side of the photo, lined with small pebbles and bits of vegetation poking through.\n\nThe background is filled with dense, evergreen forest stretching out under a clear, bright sky. The trees are mostly coniferous, closely packed, and stretch across rolling hills that recede into the distance. There's a noticeable gradient in the sky from a deeper to a lighter blue, suggesting either a time of day when the sun is high or the use of a filter in photography.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its focus on natural geological and hydrological features set against a forest backdrop, offers a picturesque view of an untouched natural landscape, likely intended to highlight the serene and rugged beauty of the area.","title":"Spokane River--west of Spokane and downstream from the city sewage treatment plant","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550658","542743","553653","549442","543647","550682","544861","542537","550700","553855","553416","552692","542701","549550","550531","550542"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["riverscape","river","formation","pebble","filter","forest","rock","photography","gradient","bit"]}
