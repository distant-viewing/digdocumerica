{"path":"548510.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene of sailboat racing. There are three sailboats in the foreground, each manned by a single person. The sailboats are small, designed for one sailor, and they feature different sail designs.\n\nThe sailboat closest to the viewer has a crisp white sail with a design that includes three zigzag lines. The other two boats, slightly further back, have sails marked with numbers and letters indicating their registration or class identifiers. The number \"14986\" is readable on the sail of the boat to the right, under which \"US\" and possibly a club or class designation, \"8201,\" is visible.\n\nThe sailors appear focused and tranquil, each handling their boats diligently, possibly navigating through a course or participating in a relaxed race. They are all wearing casual, possibly athletic, attire suitable for sailing.\n\nThe background is somewhat hazy, giving an impression of light fog or mist over the water. This limits the visibility but contributes to the serene atmosphere of the scene. The water is calm, with only small ripples caused by the gentle movement of the boats.\n\nOverall, the composition and mood of the photograph are peaceful, focusing on the leisure activity of sailing with a soft, overcast lighting scenario. The presence and arrangement of the sailboats suggest a coordinated event or a casual gathering of sailing enthusiasts.","title":"Racing on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548519","549425","543941","548203","552345","544669","552346","543936","548526","549423","547781","548521","549386","548555","549424","549411"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","sailing","sailor","class","boat","number","zigzag","club","desig"]}
