{"path":"551143.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures two people standing on the balcony of an old, ornate building. On the left, a sign hangs from the balcony railing that reads \"Charleston Job Corps Center,\" indicating the building serves an educational or workforce-related purpose. The sign specifies that the center is operated for the U.S. Department of Labor Manpower Administration by Teledyne Economic Development Company.\n\nThe architecture of the building features brick walls with large arched windows that have decorations and stone detailing around them. The balcony railing is similarly styled with large, carved stones contributing to an overall historic look.\n\nTwo individuals are present in the scene: both are young and dressed in casual attire. The person on the left is wearing a purple tank top and dark pants, with a blue cap, while leaning against the balcony railing looking outward. The person on the right is wearing a horizontally striped, fitted t-shirt and dark pants, standing upright with her hand resting on her hip.\n\nThe image invokes a sense of daily life at the Job Corps Center, perhaps capturing a moment of pause or casual conversation between these individuals. There is a calm and relaxed atmosphere in the composition, highlighted by the natural lighting and the peaceful expression on the individuals' faces. The signage, architectural details, and the appearance of the people provide a sense of the place and time the photo represents.","title":"Outside the job corps center on summers street in downtown Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
