{"path":"542670.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a jet aircraft captured through a wide-angle, fisheye lens, creating a pronounced curvature at the edges of the frame. The aircraft is positioned on a tarmac, and it is viewed directly from the front, resulting in a symmetrical composition. The nose of the aircraft has multiple air intakes or sensors that give it a distinct, technical appearance. It has twin engines mounted under each wing, with propellers that are stationary in the picture.\n\nThe plane is equipped with a front landing gear, which is clearly visible, and it casts a shadow on the tarmac due to what appears to be sunlight. The body of the plane is light-colored with markings or insignias near the front, although specific details are hard to distinguish.\n\nIn the background, there are additional airplanes parked on the tarmac. They are similar in design but not identical, suggesting they could be part of a fleet or collection. The sky is clear, indicating the photo was taken on a day with good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the image features a sense of readiness or paused activity, as there are no visible movement or people, giving it a quiet but powerful atmosphere. The use of the fisheye lens emphasizes the aircraft's design features and creates a dynamic visual effect.","title":"Plane (supplied by NASA) uses space techniques in smog research.
