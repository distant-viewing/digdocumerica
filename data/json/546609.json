{"path":"546609.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a formal landscape composed of several elements. At the center, a symmetrical concrete pathway leads up a wide set of steps flanked by lush greenery. The greenery includes neatly trimmed hedges and a variety of trees, adding a rich, natural texture to the scene. Beside the steps is a flagpole with the American flag, creating a focal point in the composition.\n\nOn either side of the central pathway and flag, the asphalt creates a looping driveway used for parking. This driveway is shaped in a 'U' that surrounds a small landscaped island with a single tree and neatly maintained hedges. Parked on either side of the driveway are several cars, indicating either a day of moderate activity at this location or designated parking.\n\nIn the bottom left corner, the asphalt widens into a parking lot with more cars neatly arranged in bays marked by white lines. This suggests a formal, possibly governmental or corporate, setting. The photograph captures two individuals walking on the path, providing a sense of scale and activity. Their presence, along with the parked cars and the institutional landscape design, suggests this might be a location of significance or public interest, possibly a government institution or memorial park. The overall ambiance is orderly and serene, emphasizing the importance and formality of the setting.","title":"In front of national institutes of health, bethesda Maryland","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550161","547249","546535","558056","548866","546702","551613","546559","544560","547248","546457","546745","547228","552721","546448","546570"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["driveway","hedge","parking","asphalt","flag","step","pathway","formality","institution","park"]}
