{"path":"553411.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene moment on a body of water, possibly a lake or a river. In the center of the image, there is a small, flat-bottomed boat gliding gently on the dark-hued water. The boat is occupied by two individuals: one person wearing a red shirt is seated at the stern, operating the motor, while the other, in a white shirt, is seated at the bow, facing the water.\n\nThe surrounding environment is lush and green, suggesting this activity is taking place in a natural, verdant setting. There is rocky terrain visible on the left side of the frame, partially submerged in the water and covered with small patches of moss or grass. The water appears calm, with light ripples that reflect the overcast sky above, enhancing the tranquility of the scene.\n\nOverhanging branches from trees on the right side of the image slightly drape over the water, adding to the secluded and intimate feel of the location. The overall mood of the photo is peaceful, with an emphasis on the quiet enjoyment of nature.","title":"Mine falls park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shores of the Nashua river.
