{"path":"557094.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph displays a serene scene featuring a large, traditional two-story house set in a well-manicured lawn. The house is painted in light beige with a steeply pitched dark shingled roof, creating a striking contrast. It features classic architectural elements such as multi-pane windows, a covered entry porch with columns, and decorative woodwork under the eaves and around the windows.\n\nIn the foreground, a lush, mature tree with broad leaves partially obscures the view, adding a natural element to the image. Its branches spread across the frame, casting dappled shadows on the grass and the house, enhancing the tranquil suburban atmosphere.\n\nTo the right of the main house, there is a one-story addition or section with a flat, slightly sloped roof and large windows. An ornamental structure, possibly a small cupola, accents the top of this section, adding to its elegant aesthetic.\n\nOverall, the setting conveys a calm, residential environment with well-established trees and landscaping, reflecting a peaceful, domestic life. The bright daylight suggests itâ€™s either late morning or early afternoon, ideal for capturing the vibrant greens and architectural details.","title":"Former home of aviatrix amelia earhart, who disappeared on a round the world flight in the late 1930's.
