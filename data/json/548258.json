{"path":"548258.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving a passing subway train that has been covered in graffiti. The subway car is adorned with various graffiti tags in differing styles and colors; prominent among them is a large yellow splatter or scribble across the windows. Through the graffiti-covered glass, we can view the interior of the subway car, notably two individuals seated inside. These individuals are positioned in such a way that each is visible through separate windows on the car. One person, visible through the left window, is wearing a brown or grey outfit and appears engaged in either reading or looking down thoughtfully. The other person, in the right window, wears a similar outfit and maintains a similar posture, appearing absorbed in their own activity or lost in thought.\n\nThe windows themselves feature metal frames and the train's metal exterior panels are visible. Each window also contains ads or posters that are typical in subway cars, presenting information or advertisements. The scene outside the subway is less visible, giving an encapsulating feel, focusing attention on the train and its occupants amidst the vibrant graffiti. The image evokes urban environments and public transportation's role within them, highlighting elements of city art (or vandalism, depending on one's viewpoint) and everyday commuting life.","title":"This \"Broadway local\" subway car, like many others, has been decorated by vandals.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554325","556811","548260","556690","548261","554324","556653","548266","553823","548253","554326","556652","548273","548265","548263","556814"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","graffiti","window","train","car","outfit","ad","tag","occupant","reading"]}
