{"path":"549993.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This image depicts a vibrant and active scene at a skiing area. The photograph shows several people, predominantly children, engaged in skiing or preparing to ski. There are four children and two adults visible in the frame.\n\nOn the left side, there is an adult wearing a red jacket, white hat with a pom-pom, and white gloves, kneeling and adjusting the ski equipment of a child. The child, dressed in a blue and red winter gear, is bending over, likely looking at their ski bindings. Another child, standing next to them, is dressed in red with white stripes and a red hat, seemingly preparing their own skis.\n\nIn the center and right part of the image, there is a child dressed in red pants and a white jacket adorned with red and black accents, along with a white hat, walking carefully in the snow. Nearby, another child in a red outfit is standing with ski poles in hand, possibly waiting or watching the others.\n\nThe background suggests the location may have relatively sparse snow coverage with patches of dirt and grass visible, indicating perhaps late or early season conditions or less-than-ideal snowfall. The atmosphere is active and cheerful, reflecting a winter sports setting where children are learning and enjoying skiing. The presence of other skiers beyond the main subjects adds to the communal and busy environment of the ski slope.","title":"The great blue hill ski slopes are 10 miles from the center of Boston and can be reached by street car and bus.
