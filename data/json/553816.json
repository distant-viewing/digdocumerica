{"path":"553816.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an awe-inspiring landscape scene during sunset. It depicts a river winding through a mountainous area. The river shines prominently, reflecting the hues of the sky, leading the viewers' eyes towards the horizon where the sun sets brightly in a clear sky. Mountain silhouettes rise on either side of the river, contributing to a feeling of depth and wild natural beauty.\n\nThe colors of the sky transition from a rich orange near the sun to darker shades of blue and purple as it stretches upwards, forming a gradient effect that enhances the dramatic ambiance of the photo. The overall composition is balanced, with the sun positioned slightly off-center, emphasizing the sinuous path of the river below.\n\nDust specks and slight imperfections appear on the image, suggesting it might be an analog photograph, adding a touch of authenticity and nostalgia. The scene is serene, evoking a tranquil and contemplative mood, drawing attention to the natural beauty and drama of the landscape during sunset.","title":"Sunrise over the Columbia River near the Washington-Oregon border.
