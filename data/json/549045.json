{"path":"549045.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a young person in a cowboy hat smiling broadly at the camera. They are in a Western setting, likely at a rodeo or horse riding event, based on the environment and attire. The individual is dressed in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and a dark cowboy hat, presenting a traditional Western look. They are interacting with a saddle, appearing to either be setting it up or adjusting it on a horse that is not fully visible in the frame.\n\nThe background features white metal railing panels, probably part of a fence surrounding a riding or rodeo area, and a clear blue sky, indicating it's a bright sunny day. The overall ambience is vibrant and cheerful, enhanced by the person's engaging smile and active stance, suggesting they are comfortably involved in and enjoying the equestrian activities. The focus and lighting emphasize the person's face and the upper part of the saddle, directing attention to their interaction with the horse equipment and their welcoming expression.","title":"Smiling participant in the \"junior rodeo\", sponsored by the parker indian rodeo association and held on the Colorado river indian reservation","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["547709","543787","549122","552579","549120","543779","553118","552561","557051","557043","544420","557047","547344","547328","554689","549038"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","riding","saddle","cowboy","smile","person","ambience","stance","panel","railing"]}
