{"path":"554018.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a coastal area, capturing a striking landscape where land and water meet. The scene is divided into several distinct segments:\n\n1. **Ocean and Shoreline**: The prominent blue ocean transitions through shades from deep to lighter blue, indicative of varying depths or sea-bed textures. At the interface, the water graces a sandy shoreline with its waves, creating white frothy patterns along the edges.\n\n2. **Sandy Beaches and Peninsulas**: White sandy beaches outline the land, creating a stark contrast against both the lush green vegetation and the blue waters. Two sandy peninsulas or spits are evident, each jutting into the sea, forming calm lagoon-like bodies of water on their leeward sides.\n\n3. **Greenery and Terrain**: The terrain is predominantly hilly with sparse to moderately dense vegetation, mostly in shades of olive and dark green. The green areas are interspersed with patches of bare earth or sand, suggesting either sandy grounds or areas with less vegetation.\n\n4. **Human Activity and Constructions**: Visible signs of human activity include structures near the shore, possibly houses or small buildings. In the water, there are several boats, which appear to be mostly small, possibly for fishing or local transport. A distinct structure, which looks like a jetty or pier, extends into the ocean at one point.\n\n5. **Water Bodies Inside The Land**: Besides the ocean, there are other visible water bodies, possibly ponds or small lakes near the shore, surrounded by vegetation and some sandy banks.\n\nOverall, the photograph encapsulates a serene yet vibrant coastal scene, teeming with natural beauty and human life coexisting. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the geographical and ecological features of the area.","title":"Aerial view of the \"Puaahala\" development. Ancient fish pond important in Hawaiian tradition, has been filled in. In 1969, the Land Use Commission approved developers' request to change 183 acres from rural and conservation to urban use. Halt in work left unsightly mess and approval was almost withdrawn, but project is now continuing.","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["547629","543427","554022","548628","554057","547637","557453","547980","548604","554156","548629","552922","554157","553910","548785","543308"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","vegetation","lagoon","water","shore","grace","teem","sea","interface","peninsula"]}
