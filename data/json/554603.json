{"path":"554603.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural setting, featuring a still body of water, likely a pond or a slow-moving stream, surrounded by dense greenery. The water surface is partially covered with a layer of fallen blossoms or similar organic debris, creating a textured blanket that contrasts with the clear patches of water where reflections of the surrounding flora can be seen.\n\nA large, partially submerged log is prominent, extending across the foreground of the image, suggesting an element of decay and the passage of time within this tranquil wilderness. This log plays a significant role in the composition, adding a natural linear element that guides the viewer’s eye through the scene.\n\nThe surrounding vegetation is dense and appears to be a mixture of various types of shrubs and small trees, possibly indicating a forested or swamp-like environment. The foliage is mostly a deep green color, which suggests a thriving, moisture-rich habitat.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft and diffused, implying either an overcast sky or a shaded environment that filters the light, thereby enhancing the intimate and enclosed feeling of the scene. There is no visible human activity or presence, which reinforces a sense of undisturbed natural beauty and tranquility. The focus is squarely on the interaction between natural elements—water, wood, and plant life—and their quiet coexistence.","title":"Hatchout of aquatic insects making scum on the water in the forest preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["546963","553410","551352","553465","554623","542526","550341","543561","555153","547011","544765","554776","554525","545008","550345","555229"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["log","thriving","swamp","intimate","blossom","covered","shaded","linear","moisture","coexistence"]}
