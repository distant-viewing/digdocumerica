{"path":"547552.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene, likely taken during a fishing activity. We see a large fishing boat adorned with significant fishing equipment such as a vast net stretched out prominently in the foreground. The net is held aloft by cables and appears to be either being cast into the water or pulled in, filled with the catch.\n\nOn the boat, several figures are visible; they are involved in the fishing operation. These individuals wear casual, functional clothing suitable for fishing tasks, and are actively engaged in managing the equipment, ensuring the operation runs smoothly.\n\nIn the background, the ocean extends towards the horizon under a seemingly clear sky. Notably, a lighthouse is discernible in the mid-distance, serving as a navigational aid and adding a scenic maritime element to the composition. The silhouette of the lighthouse against the light sky suggests early morning or late afternoon light, giving the scene a peaceful yet active maritime ambiance.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of industry and co-operation, highlighting the labor-intensive nature of fishing. The interaction of nature with human endeavor is framed dramatically, with the vastness of the sea juxtaposed against the intricate, man-made fishing equipment.","title":"The last trap is pulled.
