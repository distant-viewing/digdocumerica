{"path":"543158.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a complex industrial scene, likely inside a factory with heavy machinery and manufacturing equipment. The environment looks mechanical and somewhat dated, with various metal structures and components dominating the setting.\n\nTo the left of the image, there are several circular platforms, possibly turntables, with mechanical arms and tracks that might be used for transporting or maneuvering items during the manufacturing process. The turntables are attached to a larger assembly line system, which includes conveyer belts and tracks extending towards the center and right side of the image.\n\nIn the background, there are two large white structures labeled with the numbers '2' and '3.' These appear to be large industrial vats or containers, possibly for holding materials or chemicals involved in the production process. They sit on top of a raised platform that is accessible by stairs seen on the right. These vessels are cylindrical and taper slightly towards the top, resembling giant bottles or tanks.\n\nThe overall setting is gritty and utilitarian, with visible wear and aging on the machinery, indicating long-term industrial use. The structures are housed in a large building with a high ceiling supported by steel trusses. There are no visible windows, suggesting that the environment is fully enclosed. \n\nThere are no people present in the photograph, emphasizing the mechanical and uninhabited aspect of the environment. The machinery and disarray suggest that the site is either in operation without human presence visible in the shot or it has been left in a state of semi-operational maintenance. The lighting is somewhat dim, contributing to the industrial ambiance.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["546923","546757","544026","556388","543997","557387","558371","544818","552003","544045","544153","556389","558365","557388","555330","545992"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["machinery","manufacturing","platform","enclosed","track","taper","transporting","materials","assembly","process"]}
