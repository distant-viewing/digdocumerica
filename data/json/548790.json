{"path":"548790.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a broad area cluttered with numerous wooden crates of various sizes, arranged haphazardly across what appears to be an outdoor storage or loading area near a body of water. The crates are predominantly weathered and show variations in color, primarily shades of brown and gray, suggesting frequent use or prolonged exposure to the elements. Several stacks and groupings of these crates create a disjointed pattern across the surface of the photograph.\n\nIn the background, the scenery shifts from the immediate focus of wooden crates to a tranquil blue sea, enhancing the coastal setting. Just beyond the crates, a small body of water is visible. The clear sky above and the calm sea hint at a peaceful, relatively remote locale.\n\nFurther in the distance, along the coastline, sparse vegetation and palm trees can be seen, sporadically distributed. There are also some constructed features, such as low-rise buildings or structures, subtly peeping from behind the greenery, possibly part of a port or a related maritime facility.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a working environment, likely related to maritime activities, given the proximity to water and the apparent use of the crates for goods transportation. The setting suggests a focus on industrial or commercial use rather than residential or recreational activities.","title":"Traps of the lobster fishermen of tiny Conch Key are stored all over the island.
