{"path":"553783.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows two individuals engaged in water-related activities, seemingly preparing for or returning from snorkeling. They are in a clear blue body of water close to the shore. The person on the right is a man wearing a snorkel and diving mask on his head, glancing away from the camera with a serious expression, possibly focusing on something out of frame. On the left, partially obscured by the man, is a woman who also wears a snorkel and is adjusting or holding a metal object, potentially a camera housed in a waterproof case, used for underwater photography.\n\nThe background reveals a sandy beach lined with small figures of people mingling or moving about, and behind the beach is a hill with sparse vegetation. The setting appears to be a sunny day given the bright light and shadows present, suggesting a vibrant outdoor, recreational atmosphere likely at a holiday or scenic destination renowned for snorkeling or diving activities. The overall composition focuses on the interaction between the two main individuals and the preparation for an underwater experience.","title":"Koko Head Park in the Hanauma Bay Marine Life Conservation District is a popular snorkeling and skin diving spot.
