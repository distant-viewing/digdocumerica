{"path":"549746.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid scene at a landfill or dump site, dominated by a large pile of variegated trash. At the top of the mound of garbage, an open, dark-colored garbage truck is visible, its back lifted to unload rubbish. The truck is adorned with a slogan that reads \"HELP KEEP YOUR BOROUGH CLEAN,\" suggesting municipal involvement in waste management.\n\nThe garbage pile itself consists of a dense, chaotic mixture of items such as discarded papers, plastics, fragments of textiles, and other miscellaneous debris, visually representing a wide range of colors and textures, indicative of domestic waste. There is no immediate presence of people, focusing the imagery solely on waste management efforts.\n\nIn the background, the sky appears clear, offering a stark contrast to the cluttered and dirty foreground. This juxtaposition may underline the environmental impact of human consumption and waste. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the towering pile of trash dominated by the mechanical figure of the garbage truck, serves as a powerful visual message about waste, recycling, and environmental conservation.","title":"Truck piling garbage in Hackensack meadows dump behind ft lee.
