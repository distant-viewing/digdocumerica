{"path":"542837.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking aerial view of a mountainous landscape. The central focus is a large, bare slide area on the slope of a mountain, characterized by its exposed, soil-laden appearance that contrasts sharply with its surroundings. This section of the mountain has a lighter, earth-toned color, suggesting recent earth movement or erosion that has cleared away any vegetation.\n\nSurrounding the slide area, dense forests of dark green coniferous trees dominate the landscape. These forests appear lush and undisturbed, indicating the robust natural environment of the region. The treeline is dense and uniformly covers the mountains, except where interrupted by the slide.\n\nTowards the edges of the photograph and in areas adjacent to the slide, patches of snow are visible, hinting at the high-altitude or cold climate conditions prevalent in the area. The texture of the snow varies, with some areas looking compact and others more dispersed.\n\nThe overall composition of the image captures the rugged terrain and natural dynamics of a mountain environment, showcasing the stark contrast between the barren slide area and the verdant forest, as well as highlighting the impacts of natural or possibly human-induced changes in such landscapes.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555677","552144","542830","542842","543721","551064","550419","550510","555657","542519","550515","542821","551200","542843","550514","550396"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["slide","mountain","forests","snow","earth","lighter","compact","exposed","interrupt","treeline"]}
