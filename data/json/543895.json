{"path":"543895.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This image captures a classroom scene. In the foreground, a cardboard sign prominently occupies the lower left corner, with the words \"FIGHT FOR YOUR WORLD\" hand-written in black marker. This sign, resting on the floor, appears worn and hastily made, suggesting a sense of urgency or grassroots activism.\n\nBehind the sign, the classroom setting is somewhat blurred, emphasizing the sign's message over the specifics of the background. In the classroom, there are students seated at wood desks. We can clearly see two students; other partially visible figures suggest more in the room. The student nearest in the middle ground, presumably a young woman, is turned towards her right, possibly listening to or looking at someone or something outside the field of view. Another student, slightly out of focus in the background, is looking forward, suggesting they are paying attention to a teacher or presentation not visible in the image.\n\nNatural light streams in through large windows visible in the background, illuminating the room and creating a bright, hopeful atmosphere. The overall composition uses a shallow depth of field, drawing attention to the activism-themed sign while still providing a context of youthful engagement possibly related to the message on the sign.","title":"Classroom","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["553911","558212","543920","552946","558214","554838","544798","544322","543919","548243","546548","546556","544235","554332","552731","545547"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["student","classroom","activism","sign","message","room","teacher","specific","urgency","presentation"]}
