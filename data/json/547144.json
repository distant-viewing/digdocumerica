{"path":"547144.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph displays a \"No Parking Any Time\" sign, clearly stipulating it as a police order. This rectangular sign is mounted on a black, metal post that is thickly encased in ice, suggesting freezing conditions. The sign itself is painted in a muted, possibly faded yellow background with bold, black text. The icicles are prominently visible, hanging off the sign and layered along the post, adding a textured, glossy appearance against the stark contrast of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a wide expanse of water, likely a lake or sea, is visible. It reflects a calm yet subtly turbulent state, with small waves lapping onto a sandy beach. The water meets the shore, which appears wet, possibly from recent tide movements. The sky above is a clear, deep blue, contributing to the vivid color contrast in the image.\n\nThe composition centers the signpost within the frame, aligning it vertically and dividing the photo into clear zones of interestâ€”the icy foreground and the serene aquatic background. The balance of natural lighting enhances the crisp clarity and vivid colors of the scene, emphasizing the chilly, serene ambiance.","title":"Ice fringed sign at Michigan City breakwater","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["546619","544228","555385","547111","552620","554119","553860","554567","548158","547139","548846","543550","544220","547865","543168","548248"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["post","sign","signpost","freeze","encase","order","police","tide","ice","lap"]}
