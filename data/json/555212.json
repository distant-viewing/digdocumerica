{"path":"555212.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene focused on a flowing river and its immediate surroundings. In the foreground, a large, smooth rock is visible, partially covered with a patch of vibrant green moss, creating a soft texture that contrasts with the stone's harsh surface. The moss is lush, with small, fine details that suggest a moist environment.\n\nThe background presents a dynamic view of a river flowing powerfully through a rugged landscape. The river appears blurred due to a slow shutter speed used during the capture, giving the water a smooth, silky texture that conveys motion. This flowing water cascades over and around darker rocks, which are partially obscured by the force and volume of the water.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is calm and somewhat mystical, with a strong emphasis on the natural beauty and tranquility of the water and its interaction with the rock and moss. The colors are rich and deep, primarily consisting of the gray of the rocks, the white of the rushing water, and the vibrant green of the moss, contributing to a feeling of freshness and natural purity. The image does not include any people or man-made objects, focusing solely on the natural elements.","title":"Stream flowing through a 60 to 80-year-old age class timberland in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
