{"path":"549893.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a commuter train or ferry where people are engaged in various activities to pass the time during their journey. The image features six individuals seated in a row on elongated benches, all facing towards the windows on the left-hand side, which fill the space with natural light. These large, rectangular windows reveal no distinct external features, suggesting the focus is purely on the interior atmosphere.\n\nThe passengers, reminiscent of 1970s attire, are absorbed in quiet, personal activities: most are reading newspapers or documents, conveying a sense of a morning commute routine. The person second from the left appears to be a young woman, gazing outside absent-mindedly or lost in thought, contrasted with her fellow passengers' focus on their reading material.\n\nThe setting has a vintage, somewhat austere look with utilitarian benches and a dark-colored floor marked by the worn-out patterns possibly due to frequent foot traffic. The overall lighting in the scene is dim, accented by streaks of sunlight that cast visible shadows on the floor, enhancing the early morning, contemplative mood of the photograph. The ambiance is calm and a bit sleepy, typical of early commutes where passengers are yet to fully embark on the day's duties.","title":"On the Staten Island Ferry in New York Harbor's Upper Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556656","549897","556095","556834","555974","556671","556780","554370","556691","556062","548256","556698","555977","556097","556061","556070"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["commute","passenger","bench","floor","ferry","commuter","reading","streak","morning","document"]}
