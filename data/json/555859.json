{"path":"555859.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This aerial photograph displays a landscape markedly shaped by human activities, possibly associated with mining or industrial use. The picture shows several large bodies of water which are dark and possibly polluted. Around and between these water bodies, there are extensive swaths of land that appear bare and discolored, suggesting recent excavation or deposition of materials. \n\nThere is also a visible pattern of roads or tracks crisscrossing the terrain, further imprinting human presence on the environment. Some structures, possibly machinery or storage units, can be seen scattered in certain areas, indicating ongoing operations or at least some level of industrial activity. \n\nA particular feature is the containment or separation of the water bodies by thin strips of land, possibly dams, which are holding or redirecting water. The surrounding areas look rugged and devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the impact and scale of human intervention in this region. The overall scene, without the specific context, conveys a strong visual impression of environmental alteration, typical of areas subjected to intensive industrial use.","title":"Aerial view of the five acre pond when the cleanup operation was half finished.
