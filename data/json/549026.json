{"path":"549026.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene of a busy casino street at night, likely in Las Vegas. The center of the image is dominated by the brightly lit facade of the \"Golden Nugget Gambling Hall\", which is adorned with numerous bulbs and neon signs that illuminate the scene in a warm golden hue. The words \"Golden Nugget Casino\" are prominently featured on the building in large, glowing letters.\n\nTo the left, there is a towering neon sign that reads \"QUEEN\" in large vertical lettering, also lit with numerous bulbs, which adds to the luminous and lively atmosphere typical of casino districts. Another similarly styled sign on the right curves gracefully into the frame, with abstract neon swirls and dots enhancing the festive mood.\n\nThe street is lined with other casinos and establishments, each competing for attention with their own colorful signs and decorations. There's a rhythm of light and color all along the block. The foreground shows a part of the street, dimly lit compared to the brilliance of the buildings, with several cars parked and a few people visible, likely pedestrians, adding a sense of scale and activity to the scene. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the illuminated establishments and their dazzling displays.","title":"Night lights","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549025","549009","549015","553119","549022","545462","553139","549017","551321","549014","555446","551322","553017","545456","548402","552414"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["neon","bulb","establishment","sign","street","rhythm","attention","district","light","decoration"]}
