{"path":"555893.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph showcases the rear part of a car, focusing on its dark-colored trunk. In the center of the image is an emblem featuring a license plate with a design based on the flag of Puerto Rico. The plate is rectangular, divided diagonally with red and white stripes and features a singular white star on a blue triangle. On the left side of the plate, the words \"PUERTO RICO\" are printed in uppercase letters, oriented vertically. \n\nAbove the Puerto Rico flag emblem, there is another decorative element that appears to be a chrome detailing, which might be part of the car's manufacturer logo or model indication, though it's not fully distinguishable. To the right of the flag emblem, there are individual chrome letters spelling out \"R\".\n\nThe surface of the trunk is dark and reflects light irregularly, indicating it might be somewhat textured or not perfectly smooth. There are no visible people or other objects in the environment around the car, affording a clear and isolated view of the car detailing and emblem. The focus is squarely on the symbolic identification of the car with Puerto Rico, suggesting a strong sense of pride or connection to the region by the owner.","title":"Emblem of Puerto Rico on a car in Paterson, New Jersey, an indication of the growing pride of minorities in America of their heritage. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract houses. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor.","placename":"Paterson (N.J.)","location":"Paterson, New Jersey","nn1":["547494","554369","554364","546193","547722","554336","545335","547269","554361","555932","549883","548750","546653","550152","555462","547735"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["emblem","plate","flag","car","chrome","detailing","letter","trunk","owner","identification"]}
