{"path":"556523.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man speaking into a microphone, engaged either in a speech or conversation during an outdoor event. He wears a casual but sporty outfit, including a yellow polo shirt and dark green shorts. His attire is complemented with a two-tone baseball cap labeled \"TECH\", which is mainly white with a maroon bill and lettering, suggesting affiliation with a school or sports team.\n\nThe man has a robust build and exudes a lively and expressive demeanor, as he seems to be mid-sentence with a slightly open mouth and a congenial smile on his face. His skin tone is fair, and his dark hair is partially visible under the cap.\n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring a lush green setting that suggests a park or similar recreational space. Behind him, soft, blurry outlines of trees and a partly cloudy sky can be seen, along with a hint of a vehicle, possibly a van, further adding to the outdoor, event-like setting. The lighting in the image indicates it might be a cloudy day, influencing the gentle and even illumination of the scene.","title":"Paul Callis, president of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company with headquarters at Jasper, near Chattanooga, Tennessee, talks to miners at the first annual company-sponsored picnic. He was discussing absenteeism from work and told them both labor and management lose because of it. The problem is greater among the younger miners who haven't settled down yet and take off to hunt or fish when they feel like it.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556526","558293","554338","557031","548302","556622","553153","557030","549114","545668","543932","549908","556528","554028","542562","557144"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["cap","speech","affiliation","maroon","microphone","polo","event","team","build","school"]}
