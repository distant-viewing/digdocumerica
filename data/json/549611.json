{"path":"549611.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a laboratory setting. A man with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a dark green shirt and black pants, is seen adding a liquid from a white plastic jug into a series of glass containers. These containers are arranged neatly on stepped shelves and are fitted on top of black bases that seem to include some kind of burner or heating element. Each glass container is connected to the next by tubing, suggesting some form of progressive experiment or process.\n\nThe man's action is precise, suggesting a careful measurement or addition of the liquid. The background and immediate surroundings include more laboratory equipment and supplies, indicating a well-used and functional research space. The muted lighting focuses on the central action, giving the image a focused and intense feel, appropriate to a scientific or research environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of scientific experimentation or chemical processing, emphasizing careful measurement and handling of substances within a professional laboratory setting.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions of Lake Superior.
