{"path":"547609.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic coastal scene featuring ocean waves crashing onto a sandy beach. In the foreground, gentle waves are washing over the beach, forming white, foamy patterns as they recede. The dominating element in the middle of the image is a powerful wave breaking with force, its white spray bursting upwards and outwards, creating a visually striking contrast against the calm blue ocean and sky in the background.\n\nThe top part of the photo is occupied by a clear sky that merges seamlessly into the horizon, suggesting a serene, open atmosphere. The overall composition of the picture emphasizes the raw energy and natural beauty of the seaside environment, illustrating the repetitive yet ever-changing movements of the sea. There's no visible human activity or objects in the scene; it's an unspoiled natural landscape focusing solely on the interplay between water, waves, and sandy shores. The timing of the shot captures the wave at the moment of impact, conveying both the tranquility and the powerful dynamics of the ocean.","title":"Atlantic surf","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["543253","543251","543019","543308","543309","543092","543138","543250","543055","543287","554065","554088","546982","545106","547155","542867"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["wave","ocean","beach","timing","seaside","dynamic","spray","force","energy","shot"]}
