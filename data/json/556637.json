{"path":"556637.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In the photograph, a young man with curly hair is sitting on the ground, engaged in the task of painting cans. He is wearing a plain white T-shirt and faded denim jeans. The setting appears to be an outdoor workspace, as indicated by the natural lighting and rough ground consisting of small rocks and earth. He has positioned himself beside a wall or a large board, which provides a backdrop that is uniformly dark, helping to highlight the objects and activity in the foreground.\n\nThe young man is focused on his work, holding a paint can and a brush. On his left, there are several cans lined up against the dark backdrop. These cans seem to have been freshly painted, as their tops are uniformly white. To his right, there's a cardboard box with more cans awaiting painting, some already partially painted.\n\nThe environment suggests a possibly informal or temporary workspace given the unrefined setting. The activity demonstrates an artistic or practical project involving the repurposing or decorating of these cans. The presence of multiple spray paint cans indicates that these might be used for more detailed or color-specific tasks subsequently. The scene is imbued with a sense of creativity and resourcefulness, characteristic of hands-on artistic or DIY projects in an outdoor setting.","title":"Construction of one of three experimental houses built from empty beer and soft drink cans","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["557689","553656","556638","549930","552369","546552","553904","556154","546847","556230","556229","548455","545822","546032","546287","558306"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["can","workspace","project","paint","creativity","task","painting","brush","cardboard","spray"]}
