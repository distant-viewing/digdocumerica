{"path":"550506.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image portrays a majestic and rugged mountainous landscape, possibly after a recent snowfall. The mountains are extensive and appear to be part of a large range, with numerous peaks and valleys visible.\n\nThe majority of the terrain in the photograph is covered with a thin layer of snow, revealing the contours and folds of the mountains beneath. The slopes have a mix of snow and exposed dark rock, creating a stark contrast that highlights the ruggedness of the landscape. Various snow patches are visible, especially on higher elevations and northern-facing slopes where the snow is more likely to persist.\n\nThe mountain peaks are sharp and well-defined against the sky, with some peaks showing signs of erosion or rock slides. The valleys between the mountains are deep and V-shaped, suggesting that they were likely formed by glacial activity or water erosion over millennia.\n\nThe image is quite detailed and captures the varied textures of the mountain surfaces, from smooth snow-covered areas to rough, rocky outcrops. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of desolation and untouched wilderness, with no visible human presence or activity that would otherwise indicate scale or habitation.\n\nThis photograph could be useful in studies related to geography, geology, or environmental science, providing insights into mountain formations, weather patterns, and natural landscape evolution.","title":"Distant view north toward Dietrich Pass from a point above the northwest tributary of the north fork of the Chandalar River","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550502","542519","550514","550422","550645","550501","550423","550505","550416","550500","542520","550515","542831","550415","555690","550631"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","peak","erosion","valley","evolution","v","geology","millennium","slope"]}
