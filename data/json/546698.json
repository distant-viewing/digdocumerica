{"path":"546698.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph showing a dense urban scene, presumably captured from a high viewpoint. The composition primarily focuses on transportation routes that slice through the urban layout.\n\nAt the forefront, there's a highway featured with rows of vehicles in moderate traffic; some lanes are moving smoother than others. Adjacent to the highway, parking lots filled with cars highlight the daily urban commute and possibly a working day scenario. Beside one of the main roads, a multi-track railway line runs parallel, though no trains are visible in this segment.\n\nBeyond these transportation arteries, a large river can be seen winding across the upper half of the image, flanked by green banks and trees that signify a more natural environment amidst the urban setup. This offers a contrast to the built environment, adding a touch of nature and spaciousness to the image.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, towards the riverbank, a distinctive round-shaped building catches the eye, suggesting an area possibly used for public gatherings or events.\n\nThe overall scene reflects a typical urban environment with its busy roads, railways, and proximity to a river, showcasing the blend of transportation and natural elements in a city setting. The image captures a moment in daily urban life, emphasizing movement, infrastructure, and the intersection of nature with urban development.","title":"Pennsylvania avenue, ne, looking west","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546616","546678","555781","546704","555745","546617","546707","546573","548344","546581","546574","553559","547765","548363","546726","555744"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["transportation","railway","highway","spaciousness","commute","signify","half","route","intersection","scenario"]}
