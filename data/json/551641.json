{"path":"551641.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"In this photograph, four young girls, dressed in green scout uniforms, are seen sitting on the edge of a fountain in an urban setting. Each girl is engaged in a different activity. From left to right: the first girl is using a hand calculator or a similar device; the second is turning her head as if speaking to someone behind her; the third is eating a sandwich; and the fourth is drinking from a can, possibly a soft drink. They appear to be relaxed and enjoying their time at the fountain, which is vigorously spraying water upwards.\n\nBehind them, a vibrant cityscape features tall and dense buildings, suggesting this photo is taken in a downtown area of a large city. The buildings are mostly modern, with dark and light facades often found in urban centers. The fountain itself adds a sense of calmness to the otherwise potentially bustling environment. The time seems to be daylight, with shadows indicating the sun possibly in mid-afternoon position. It's a vivid scene combining elements of youthful leisure and urban life.","title":"Girl Scouts lunch alongside Rockefeller Center fountain 5th Avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551639","551658","551638","551449","551480","557258","552737","550748","553185","551484","553192","551772","553289","551467","549982","550747"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["fountain","girl","sandwich","drink","downtown","calmness","time","can","device","position"]}
