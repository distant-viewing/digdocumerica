{"path":"550179.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a gloomy, industrial scene where pollution pervades the atmosphere. The main focus is a road stretching into the distance, leading up to a bridge that ascends steeply and then descends out of view, partially obscured by thick, dark smoke. The scene is shrouded in a haze, possibly suggesting smog or early morning mist mixed with pollution.\n\nOn the road, there are a few sparse vehicles: a couple of cars moving away from the viewpoint, and one vehicle moving towards the viewer. There are multiple utility poles aligned on both sides of the road, densely packed and creating a tunnel-like effect. These poles are connected by numerous lines which form a grid-like pattern above the street.\n\nThe background is dominated by looming silhouettes of industrial buildings from which massive clouds of dark smoke are billowing into the sky, contributing to the overall dreary and polluted atmosphere. The sky itself is obscured, blending with the smoke, making it difficult to distinguish the horizon. High-voltage power lines and towers are also visible, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe coloring of the photograph is predominantly dark and muted, with tones of gray, brown, and dark red, reinforcing the theme of industrial decay and environmental pollution. The image captures a stark, somewhat dystopian landscape, emphasizing themes of urban decline and the environmental impact of industrial activities.","title":"Dark clouds of factory smoke obscure clark avenue bridge","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550175","550173","551033","550185","550181","550171","548850","550172","550183","551057","548316","551069","550191","550176","551083","546076"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["pollution","smoke","pervade","voltage","road","pole","smog","tunnel","coloring","decline"]}
