{"path":"543359.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal scene featuring an industrial marine structure extending over the ocean. The foreground shows a collection of large, uneven rocks, which appear weathered and algae-covered, possibly indicating a tidal zone. These rocks provide a natural texture that contrasts sharply with the man-made construction.\n\nThe marine structure itself appears weathered and somewhat dilapidated, suggesting it has been exposed to harsh maritime conditions. It is built on stilts, likely to withstand the ocean tide, and hosts several box-like buildings that could serve as storage sheds or processing facilities for marine activities. The construction materials mainly include wood and metal, adding an industrial feel to the coastal landscape.\n\nThe ocean extends into the horizon, and calm sea conditions are visible under a clear sky. The absence of visible human activity lends a quiet, abandoned feel to the scene, emphasizing the interaction between man-made structures and the natural environment. This setting could be interpreted as a derelict aquatic farm or an old fishing pier, reflecting themes of industrial decay and the relentless impact of the natural elements on human endeavors.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543405","543242","543288","543320","543364","547118","547040","547068","549338","547581","551953","543257","543291","552167","547602","544976"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","stilt","construction","algae","rock","endeavor","shed","feel","condition","absence"]}
