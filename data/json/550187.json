{"path":"550187.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban industrial scene, marked by a juxtaposition of residential and industrial elements. The foreground features a stop sign on the left, anchoring the image in an everyday urban setting. A two-story yellow house with green trim, showing typical residential architecture, is visible in the middle ground, encircled by a short metal fence.\n\nThe background contrasts starkly with this semblance of suburban normalcy. An industrial facility with multiple structures, including large towers and buildings with visible emissions and smoke, dominates the skyline. Thick, heavy smoke billows into the sky, coloring it with shades of gray and brown, suggesting air pollution and industrial activity.\n\nTo the right side of the frame, partially visible is the rear of a red \"Chevrolet\" truck, indicating the presence of either work-related activity or personal transportation near the industrial site.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively contrasts the residential and industrial aspects of the area, with the stop sign possibly symbolizing a call for caution or attention towards the environmental impact visible in the scene.","title":"Smoke from republic steel blankets the neighborhood","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550196","550200","545388","551146","550173","550203","551075","551074","551145","551072","557303","551033","552037","557213","551151","551152"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["stop","caution","call","smoke","encircle","symbolize","rear","anchor","emission","billow"]}
