{"path":"548966.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a farming scene with a central focus on five cows eating from a long, narrow feeding trough made of wood. The cows, consisting of mainly black and white patterned breeds, possibly Holsteins, are lined up along the trough, each one engaged in feeding on what appears to be green fodder.\n\nIn the background stands a man, likely a farmer, observing the cows. He is dressed in a light blue shirt, jeans, and possibly work boots, portraying a typical farmer's attire. Behind him is a large farm building marked with the word “SIOUX” on its doors, and a white livestock trailer parked beside the building, hinting at the preparation for transport or the recent delivery of livestock.\n\nThe setting is an open yard with a predominantly dirt ground, scattered with a few areas of grass. The lighting suggests it is daytime with bright sunlight enhancing the deep shadows and vibrant green of the feed. This backdrop creates a realistic depiction of daily life on a farm, emphasizing agricultural activity and livestock management.","title":"Livestock on epa's experimental farm","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548967","548984","552465","542626","548952","554950","548959","554949","552569","552567","554917","548962","548065","542960","553100","548955"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","livestock","trough","farmer","feed","farm","breed","delivery","eat","trailer"]}
