{"path":"550987.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The image appears to capture a scene of thick, billowing smoke emerging vigorously from multiple chimneys against a rather obscured background. The color palette is dominated by tones of gray and black from the smoke, and a light blue hue possibly implying a clear sky. \n\nThe smoke itself is dense and voluminous, engulfing a majority of the image space and creating a dramatic contrast against the lighter sky in the background. The source of the smoke is partially visible at the bottom of the photograph, represented by dark silhouettes of industrial structures or chimneys. These structures have sharp, rectangular forms, suggesting they could be part of a manufacturing plant or similar industrial facility.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or natural elements apart from some out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, which somewhat frames the industrial scene above. The scene is depicted during daytime, indicated by the natural light illuminating the smoke and sky.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes an industrial atmosphere, likely looking to highlight environmental or pollution themes given the dramatic portrayal of smoke emissions.","title":"Emission from the union carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, wv","placename":"Charleston (W.
