{"path":"551922.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring a single individual lying down on a wooden park bench. The person's attire suggests casual clothing, possibly a jacket and pants, and they appear to be resting or sleeping. Specifically, the individual's head and arms drift off one side of the bench, while the legs stretch towards the other end, with the feet hanging slightly off the bench. \n\nThe bench itself is a simple, sturdy design made of thick wooden planks for both the seat and the backrest, supported by dark metal or wooden legs. It is positioned on a well-maintained grassy area, indicating a public park or similar recreational space.\n\nIn the background, there's a contrast between the green, open park space and the urban environment. A series of old-style brick houses or apartment buildings line the street behind the park. These buildings feature ornate details and brick chimneys, characteristic of an urban residential area from perhaps the mid-20th century.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the person in the foreground and the architectural elements in the background, emphasizes a sense of solitude or detachment within an urban setting. The lighting suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening, contributing to a calm, serene atmosphere.","title":"Juneway beach, rogers park","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549321","555924","552723","552722","549911","551970","550188","550051","551860","555991","547355","551448","547251","557713","549926","556292"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["bench","park","leg","brick","drift","apartment","foot","person","space","plank"]}
