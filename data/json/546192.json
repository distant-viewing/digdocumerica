{"path":"546192.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban commercial street scene, dominated by the presence of three towering oil derricks in the background. These derricks stand tall against a clear sky and add an industrial element to the urban landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is busy with several cars, likely from the 1960s or 1970s, parked along the curb and driving on the street. The cars vary in color and type, including sedans and possibly a coupe, showcasing the typical automotive styles of that era.\n\nThe middle ground features a row of one-story commercial buildings with different storefronts. Visible signage includes “BURGESS JEWELERS” and “WHITE AUTO STORE.” The architecture is utilitarian, reflecting the functional commercial use of the buildings. Each storefront has large windows and some have awnings.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a vivid slice of life from a past era, juxtaposing the everyday activity of shopping and driving with the extraordinary presence of oil derricks within a cityscape, hinting at the economic activities that might have been crucial to this area's economy.","title":"Oil derricks behind the stores of Main Street","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["545614","550970","555458","555910","549882","551070","545216","555457","542586","545333","551125","547651","551135","547369","545618","550143"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["storefront","oil","coupe","economy","era","awning","past","shopping","curb","street"]}
