{"path":"555382.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows a barren landscape with a vast spread of land and water. The foreground features a multitude of scattered, concrete and metal debris, comprising cylindrical tanks and various block-like structures, possibly remnants of an industrial operation or construction material. Among these remains, a prominent sign reading \"KEEP OFF\" is visible on the right side of the image, suggesting restrictions on accessing or using the area.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a narrow strip of water body lined by an irregular series of reddish objects that resemble buoys or barrier floats, hinting at water-related activities or controlled areas. Beyond the water, there is a broad, flat expanse that appears to be significantly devoid of vegetation or any visible activities, possibly a dried lake bed or a cleared area.\n\nIn the background, dense, lush forests on mountain slopes frame the scene, indicating the setting is likely in a mountainous or coastal region. The overall composition, along with the natural and industrial elements, suggests environmental degradation or the impact of human activities on a natural site. The contrast between the industrial foreground and the natural beauty of the forest and mountains creates a poignant commentary on environmental conservation and human enterprise.","title":"Detroit Lake shown at an all-time low in the fall of 1973 due to low precipitation the year before.
