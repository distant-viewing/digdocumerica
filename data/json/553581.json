{"path":"553581.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene within a forest, where the foreground prominently features a close-up view of dried, cracked and texture-rich mud. A distinct trail cuts through the mud, possibly formed by the running water before it dried out, leaving a trace of its flow pattern. This channel is filled with salt residues, suggesting that the water previously present was high in minerals.\n\nIn the background, a dense assembly of thin, tall trees stands, their trunks spreading upwards towards the sky. The trees cast long shadows across the forest floor, indicating that the image was taken during a time of day when the sun was relatively low in the sky, perhaps morning or late afternoon. The forest floor is covered with a layer of fallen pine needles, adding a brownish tone that contrasts with the darker tree trunks and the pale, sandy color of the dried mud in the foreground.\n\nThere is no human activity or presence visible in the shot; the natural landscape is the sole focus, depicting a tranquil yet somewhat stark aspect of forest environments especially after water sources have receded. The composition is vertically oriented, emphasizing the length of the trees and the depth of the scene extending from the dried earth up towards the forest canopy.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, in the \"Granite Creek\" section of the burn area.
