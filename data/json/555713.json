{"path":"555713.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil seascape scene. The main focus of the image is the vast ocean which glitters under the sunlight. The sea appears calm, with gentle ripples rather than harsh waves, reflecting sunlight in a myriad of shimmering silver tones. The horizon line distinctly separates the sea from the sky.\n\nAbove the ocean, the sky is filled with clouds, varying in shade from light to darker gray, suggesting either an early morning or late evening time. The clouds are soft and fluffy in appearance, scattered unevenly across the sky.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene and calm, primarily driven by the vastness of the sea and the expansive sky. The color palette consists of soft blues, grays, and silvery whites, contributing to the peaceful ambiance. There are no visible human activities or objects; it's purely a natural seascape without any signs of human interference, emphasizing the beauty of the natural world. The edges of the photograph are framed by a black border which slightly vignettes into the image, adding a subtle vintage feel to the scene.","title":"The New York Bight, a unique coastal marine environment because of the extent of man's activities.
