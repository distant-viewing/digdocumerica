{"path":"546583.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy multi-lane highway curving through a lush, forested area. On the left side of the highway, traffic flows smoothly in both lanes. In contrast, on the right side, there is significant congestion, with vehicles lined up in tight rows, indicating heavy traffic or a potential slowdown. The layout features a central grassy median dividing the opposite lanes of traffic. Additional roads intersect and merge with the main highway at a cloverleaf interchange visible in the middle of the image. The landscape surrounding the highway is densely packed with trees, and no buildings are visible, suggesting that this area is relatively undeveloped except for the road infrastructure. The overall setting and lighting imply that the photograph could have been taken during the late afternoon or evening, contributing to the intensity of highway use, possibly during rush hour.","title":"Rush hour traffic, 4:30 to 6:30 pm.
