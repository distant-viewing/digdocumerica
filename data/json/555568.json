{"path":"555568.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an old-fashioned yellow school bus, partially visible from its front-to-mid section. The bus is parked beside a barbed wire fence, through which grassy fields and distant hills are observable. The side of the bus has the words \"TRANSPORTATION CORAL COMPANY - CENTRAL DIVISION\" painted on it. The vibrant yellow of the bus stands out against the blue sky and the natural green of the landscape.\n\nThe bus has typical features: multiple windows on its side, through which several people can be seen sitting inside. The passengers appear to be engaged in conversation or looking out the windows. The front of the bus features a broad windshield, and the vehicle's hood and headlights are clearly visible. The tire closest to the viewer is detailed, showing a heavy-duty tire design typical for larger vehicles.\n\nThe surroundings suggest a rural or semi-rural landscape, with wide-open spaces and undeveloped land stretching into the distance. The weather is sunny, casting strong shadows and contributing to the vividness of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of a peaceful travel or excursion in a country setting.","title":"The Hanna Coal Company, a part of the Consolidated Coal Company, conducts tours through strip mine areas that have been reclaimed.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["543026","553957","552773","558206","558241","558208","550973","547814","544193","547133","548937","552505","558215","556797","543513","547136"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","tire","excursion","division","country","windshield","front","school","headlight","hood"]}
