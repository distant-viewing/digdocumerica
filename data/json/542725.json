{"path":"542725.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph showcases a serene forest scene dominated by tall, densely packed trees that create a shaded, somewhat dark environment. The bulk of the trees have dark, thick trunks and are probably conifers, indicated by their slender and straight appearance. In the foreground, a younger, noticeably lighter-colored conifer stands out due to its vibrant green needles and relatively smaller size, suggesting a different species or perhaps younger age compared to the surrounding trees.\n\nThe entire setting portrays a natural forest floor that is lightly covered with underbrush and small plants, possibly ferns or low shrubs, adding a textured contrast to the smooth tree trunks. The light from above filters through the canopy, highlighting parts of the young tree in the foreground and scattering dapples of illumination throughout the undergrowth.\n\nThe composition's focus on vertical lines is evident, emphasized by the towering trees which draw the eye upwards towards the little visible sky. This setup gives a sense of towering height and dense forestation, possibly implying a deep forest or a preserved woodland area. The image communicates a tranquil and secluded atmosphere, typical of a deep, undisturbed natural forest environment.","title":"California--sequoia national park","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["555120","555114","553574","555118","550791","546947","554990","554425","555096","549234","554965","542745","554393","555125","555116","555108"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["conifer","forest","trunk","tree","forestation","dapple","tower","fern","undergrowth","needle"]}
