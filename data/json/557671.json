{"path":"557671.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features a rural scene centered around a small, rustic house with a wooden, covered porch. The house is painted dark red and has white-framed windows. To the side of the house, a man is standing on the porch, leaning slightly against the porch post, and he appears to be looking at the camera. He is wearing casual attire. Adjacent to the porch, a bright blue Toyota pick-up truck is partially parked on the grass, and the tailgate reads \"TOYOTA\".\n\nIn front of the house and truck, there's a lush garden with dense greenery and white flowering bushes. The environment looks well-tended but natural, suggesting a peaceful domestic setting. Beyond the immediate yard, the background is densely wooded, hinting that the house is likely in a secluded or rural area.\n\nThe overall impression is one of a tranquil, domestic rural life, with personal elements like the truck and flowering garden adding character to the scene.","title":"Home on River Street, half a block south of Main Street shops in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The town was typical of small mountain communities in the area until 1969 when the residents decided to Renovate business district shops with a Bavarian Alpine theme. A 1975 community growth plan estimates there are 22 families living in the core area south of Main Street who will be displaced between 1975 and 1990. The home owner on the porch plans to sell in a year or two and leave the town.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557670","557746","557667","548295","551091","554694","547792","556959","556542","551100","556578","550704","557760","551109","554697","546992"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","truck","garden","yard","character","post","red","bush","impression"]}
