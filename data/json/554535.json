{"path":"554535.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a man is involved in an activity near a body of water. The man, who is not fully visible as only the upper part of his body is shown, is extending his arm to touch or manipulate something in the water. His attire includes a camouflage-patterned bucket hat and a blue denim shirt with rolled-up sleeves, suggesting a casual, possibly work-related environment.\n\nThe body of water appears dark and filled with various small floating objects, some of which look like cigarette butts and possibly other small debris. There is also a bright yellow box with a logo floating in the water, which stands out against the dark background of the water surface.\n\nThe area surrounding the water is densely packed with brown and green vegetation, possibly shrubbery or small bushes, which indicates a natural, outdoor setting. The lighting in the photograph highlights the central action, focusing attention on the manâ€™s arm and the floating objects in the water.\n\nThis scene seems to be capturing a moment of environmental interaction, possibly related to water quality testing or cleaning, given the focus on the floating debris and the man's deliberate action towards the water.","title":"Pop tops of cans and a film container litter a tarn (pool of water) at the top of Algonquin Mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553650","551406","548956","552110","546298","545663","545386","555867","548831","550962","550047","552085","546892","549012","554848","546307"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["water","action","arm","camouflage","cleaning","man","testing","cigarette","body","object"]}
