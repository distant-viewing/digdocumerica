{"path":"554902.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between a man and a woman in a natural, lush environment. The man, with medium-length dark hair and a moustache, is dressed in a light yellow polo shirt, and is gently tucking a strand of hair behind the woman's ear. He is smiling softly, looking at the woman with affection.\n\nThe woman, with long brown hair, is wearing a light blue sleeveless top decorated with small green flowers. She has a subtle, content smile on her face and appears relaxed, enjoying the man's gesture. Her head is tilted slightly to the side, and she is wearing hoop earrings and a thin headband.\n\nThe background consists of dense green foliage, with visible tree trunks providing a textured backdrop. The setting suggests a peaceful, wooded area, enhancing the intimacy and serene mood of the scene. The natural light softly illuminates their faces, highlighting the warm interaction between them.","title":"Young man picks leaves from his girl's hair after they had embraced on the banks of the Frio Canyon River near Leakey, Texas and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554900","554901","545489","554913","554911","551016","552977","544337","546312","549756","551934","554907","548833","546320","551945","547834"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","hair","smile","affection","hoop","headband","earring","strand","polo","intimacy"]}
