{"path":"548174.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene with several elements. At the forefront is a metal signage frame with a makeshift sign reading \"OUT OF GAS\" in capital letters, where \"Sorry\" is written in a smaller font above it. Below this temporary sign, there is a permanent sign featuring the logo and text for \"S&H Green Stamps,\" a mid-20th-century sales promotion stamps collected for discounts on purchases.\n\nBehind the sign frame, street and road signs are visible. One of the signs points straight ahead for \"ROUTE 26,\" \"ZOO,\" and \"BEACH\" indicating directions to multiple destinations. Another road sign below directs to \"U.S. 30\" and \"CIVIC STADIUM.\" Additionally, there are gasoline price signs showing \"Regular 37.9\" and \"Ethyl 41.9,\" indicative of the pricing for different types of fuel.\n\nIn the background, a green traffic light is visible, and the street view includes a parked white station wagon. Other elements include lush trees and a hint of a residential or commercial area, possibly indicating this as a suburban location. The overall setting suggests an era reminiscent of the late 20th century, possibly during an energy crisis given the \"OUT OF GAS\" announcement. The photograph has a somewhat faded color saturation, characteristic of film photography from past decades.","title":"\"out of gas\" signs have cropped up all over the Portland area since the start of the fuel shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555452","555459","548171","548173","555494","548170","555465","555518","555473","548176","555520","546184","555467","555484","555415","548053"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","street","promotion","stadium","crisis","font","purchase","gasoline","capital","century"]}
