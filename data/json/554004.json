{"path":"554004.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, yet evocative scene at a rocky beach. In the foreground, a person is standing on a rugged coastline filled with dark rocks. The person is gazing towards the sea, facing away from the camera, and appears contemplative or absorbed in the view.\n\nDominating the middle ground is a large, derelict ship partially submerged and stranded near the shore. The ship, showing signs of rust and decay, is starkly silhouetted against the ocean waves breaking around it.\n\nThe background features a wide, open sea under a sky filled with fluffy, bright clouds diffusing sunlight. The horizon is visible, adding depth to the scene which elicits a mood of loneliness or reflection. The overall color palette is rich with deep blues and muted earth tones, contributing to the somber yet beautiful ambiance of the seascape.","title":"\"Shipwreck Beach\" on the island's eastern shore--so called from the many ships that have run aground on its reefs.
