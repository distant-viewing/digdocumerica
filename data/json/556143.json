{"path":"556143.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up profile view of a smiling young woman. She has voluminous, curly black hair styled in a large afro. The woman is turned slightly away from the camera, looking towards the right with a joyful expression, featuring a wide smile displaying her white teeth.\n\nShe is wearing what appears to be a dark jacket or coat with a visible patterned collar or scarf peeking out, suggesting a cooler outdoor setting. The background is softly out of focus, primarily showing muted green tones that suggest a natural outdoor environment, probably a park or similar recreational area.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is soft, likely either overcast or well-diffused sunlight, which gently illuminates the woman's face and highlights the texture of her hair. The overall mood conveyed by the image is cheerful and relaxed. The choice of focus and depth of field emphasizes the subject while simultaneously softening the background, drawing attention predominantly to her expression and the texture of her hair.","title":"A student at the Westinghouse Industrial Vocation School on Chicago's West Side. She is one of nearly 1.2 million people of her race who make up over one third of Chicago's population. It is one of many black faces in this project. The photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope, struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship, and faith. In short, portraits of human beings who are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556134","556142","544742","556139","556150","553499","557114","545373","556470","553509","556412","544747","553178","554923","556765","556151"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["hair","smile","woman","afro","tooth","scarf","choice","peek","collar","expression"]}
