{"path":"558048.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a broad view of a landscape punctuated by a large, curving highway bridge. The bridge, which is supported by numerous pillars, spans across the image from the left to the right side, traveling over a valley lush with greenery. Below the bridge and to the left, there is a rural area comprising several small buildings, possibly farmhouses or rural residences, some enclosed by fences. There are also green fields, a bit of farmland, and patches of trees surrounding these buildings.\n\nThe background and right portion of the image display denser wooded areas with foliage beginning to show autumn colorsâ€”hints of red and orange among the predominantly green trees. Beyond the bridge and habitat, the ground appears scarred and barren in certain areas, indicating possible land clearance or the aftermath of a natural occurrence, giving a contrast to the otherwise verdant environment.\n\nThe perspective used in this photograph captures the expansive infrastructure integrated into natural settings, emphasizing both human engineering endeavours and the natural environment, suggesting a sort of coexistence or intrusion, depending on interpretation. The overall composition skillfully presents a slice of rural life intersected by significant transportation architecture.","title":"The Ohio turnpike crosses over the cuyahoga valley and river as well as railroad tracks used by the chessie system in this aerial view taken south of Cleveland.
