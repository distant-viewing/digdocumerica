{"path":"547052.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil lakeside scene at either dawn or dusk, characterized by a strikingly colorful sky and a calm, reflective lake. The composition is centered around a wooden dock that extends into the lake from the bottom edge of the frame, leading the viewer's eye towards the horizon.\n\nThe dock, painted white, shows signs of wear and weathering, including some scattered debris and stains. On the left side of the dock, there are two metal containers, possibly buckets or pots, one of which is being held down by a chain attached to the dock. The calm water mirrors the sky, doubling the visual impact of the cloud patterns and the gradients of blue and purple in the sky.\n\nIn the distance, a line of silhouetted land separates the sky from the water, with small rises and dips indicating hills or forested areas. The overall atmosphere is serene and slightly melancholic, enhanced by the soft lighting and the expansive view of the natural landscape. This scene evokes a sense of peace and solitude, ideal for contemplation or relaxation.","title":"Bass Lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["545911","547027","552311","551312","554477","554405","545149","550735","550299","554552","543618","552319","551280","547127","543553","543527"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dock","double","dip","lake","pot","peace","stain","weathering","chain","relaxation"]}
