{"path":"544264.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a moment from a fishing activity, likely focused on crabbing, given the content shown. The central figure in the image is a man bent over inside a small boat. His face is not visible as he is leaning forward, concentrating on his task. He is dressed in a striped pair of shorts and a white t-shirt with a light-colored cap on his head, which is covered in stains suggesting hard work or frequent use.\n\nThe man is handling a large cardboard box filled with blue crabs, which are very prominently displayed. Some of the crabs have their claws extended towards the edge of the box, illustrating their natural response to being confined. The intricate details and colors of the crabs are quite vivid against the brown interior of the cardboard box.\n\nIn his environment, he is surrounded by water, indicative of a coastal or estuarine area, where crabbing is common. The background is blurred but shows a relatively calm water surface and hints of aquatic farming structures, perhaps for raising shellfish or other marine animals.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a bright sunny day, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the vivid blues of the crabs against the more muted tones of the boat and the fishermanâ€™s clothing. The overall composition of the image is dynamically centered around the action of the man and the crabs, emphasizing the theme of marine life harvest and the gritty realism of manual labor.","title":"Crabbing on north shore of Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["545093","545175","544256","545182","545089","545174","545189","554200","546301","552273","552298","545185","552877","549334","545178","547563"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["crab","box","cardboard","shellfish","realism","claw","fisherman","response","confine","harvest"]}
