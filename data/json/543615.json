{"path":"543615.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, forested scene likely in a mountainous or temperate wilderness area. The foreground prominently features clusters of broad-leafed plants, which could be young skunk cabbage, and patches of thin, grass-like plants, all bathed in dappled sunlight. The leaves of the foreground plants have a vibrant green color with distinctive veining, suggesting they are young and fresh.\n\nThe background includes several tree trunks, possibly aspen or birch, given their white bark and the dark, vertical markings on them. The trees are medium in density, allowing streams of sunlight to filter through and create an interplay of light and shadow on the forest floor. The undergrowth is not dense, indicating that the area might be well-managed or naturally sparse in brush.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image feels serene and secluded, typical of a woodland environment in the late spring or early summer when plant growth is at its peak. The sunlight suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, times when light is soft and angled, enhancing the textures and colors of the forest landscape. There is no presence of animals or human activities visible, enhancing the sense of natural tranquility.","title":"'forest'","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["558088","543581","545488","547643","555040","550536","554718","554425","546205","554958","555116","550602","547011","555216","555054","546947"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["plant","sunlight","birch","brush","forest","undergrowth","marking","bark","density","stream"]}
