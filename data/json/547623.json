{"path":"547623.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a striking contrast between industrial activity and environmental impact. The main subject is a large, aging cargo ship, moored in a body of water that appears calm and reflective. The ship is painted in white and rusty red colors and shows signs of wear and corrosion, indicating that it has been in service for many years.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a polluted shoreline cluttered with debris and garbage, suggesting neglect or the aftermath of industrial activity. Among the visible trash are pieces of metal, wood, a tire, and smaller unidentifiable items scattered across the muddy and rocky bank. These materials are likely washed ashore or dumped, highlighting environmental concerns like pollution and habitat destruction.\n\nThe water's surface near the ship is still, which allows it to reflect the ship's hull and some of the debris on the shoreline. This reflective quality adds a sense of depth and stillness to the scene, emphasizing the impact of human activity on natural landscapes.\n\nThe contrast between the polluted foreground and the large industrial ship serves as a powerful commentary on environmental issues associated with maritime and port industries. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the ship and the littered shore, effectively draws attention to the interaction between human industrial endeavors and their environmental consequences.","title":"Tanker on the Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["553897","547572","545261","546887","546116","552244","547056","552127","557246","549820","547626","551985","550941","552080","547581","555852"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["ship","shoreline","corrosion","consequence","impact","commentary","destruction","debris","endeavor","year"]}
