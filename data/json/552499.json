{"path":"552499.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The image features an up-close view of a precision mechanical device, likely a part of a weighing scale or measurement tool. The key elements shown include:\n\n1. A horizontal beam balance with markings on it. The beam is engraved with scale markings that appear to measure weight or mass; these markings are numerical and include increments from 100 to 300 on the upper beam and from 4000 to 7000 on the lower beam.\n\n2. A counterbalance weight is visible at the top, mounted on the beam, with a slider mechanism allowing it to be moved and set at a specific measurement position for accurate balancing or measuring.\n\n3. Below the main beam, there is another metallic component with a rectangular face, showing some signs of rust and usage. This part has two visible dials or knobsâ€”suggesting adjustability and fine control of the mechanism.\n\n4. A metallic, cylindrical component on the right appears as a stand or mount, possibly supporting the beams. It has a shiny, silvery finish, contrasting with slight corrosion or weathering visible on other parts.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus and dark, which helps to highlight the details of the metallic and mechanical components in the foreground. The overall setting suggests an industrial or laboratory environment where precise measurements are required.","title":"Abandoned weigh station for grain elevator in Gerlaw","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["555374","555325","545274","546269","546932","555954","549125","546327","555330","556321","552768","544818","556388","546344","546283","547671"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["beam","measurement","marking","weight","component","mechanism","corrosion","knob","mass","finish"]}
