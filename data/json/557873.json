{"path":"557873.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features a large brick building, likely an industrial or automotive facility, with multiple garage doors opened revealing a glimpse of the inner workings. In front of one of these garage doors, two men appear to be engaged in a conversation, with one man wearing a white outfit that could suggest a uniform, possibly a mechanic or a service employee. Adjacent to where they stand, a vintage car, colored dark and parked just outside another garage door, adds a touch of retrospective ambiance to the scene.\n\nAdditionally, prominently displayed flags, including the American flag and possibly others, accentuate the patriotic feel of the scene, flying above the building on flagpoles. The building's facade includes signage that is somewhat difficult to read due to the distance and angle, but there seems to be a STOP sign visible near one of the doorways.\n\nFramed by an overcast sky and scattered leaves of overhanging trees, the atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat subdued, creating a calm but busy tableau that hints at the everyday operations of this facility. The street in front of the building appears quiet, devoid of any busy traffic, which focuses attention more on the activities and setting of the building itself.","title":"Safety inspection building in an easily accessible location in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
