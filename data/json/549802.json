{"path":"549802.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"In the photograph, a tugboat is depicted in the act of pushing two large, rectangular barges through a body of water, possibly a river or a coastal area. The barges are filled to capacity with a towering and chaotic accumulation of what appears to be garbage, dominated by numerous unidentifiable fragments and debris. Each barge has its identifying code prominently visible; the front barge is marked as \"US 95\" and the rear as \"US 94.\"\n\nThe tugboat, placed centrally between the two barges, is painted in red and black, and it is visibly churning the water around it, indicating movement. The water is relatively calm but rippled by the motion of the tugboat and the loaded barges. \n\nNo people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention purely on the industrial and environmental aspect of the scene. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the operation, emphasizing the scale of the waste being transported.","title":"Tugboat herds garbage scows down the East River from a transfer point in Manhattan.
