{"path":"552462.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene, primarily characterized by its simplicity and natural elements. Central to the image is an old, weathered barn with a rustic aesthetic. The barn is sizable, with a gabled roof that features patches of rust on its metal sheets, suggesting age and exposure to the elements. Its wooden walls, painted blue, show signs of wear and fading.\n\nTo the right of the barn, there is a traditional windmill, standing on a slender metal frame. This structure, commonly found in rural settings, suggests the presence of a well or serves as a mechanism for pumping water.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by a vast, cultivated field that appears to be freshly plowed, preparing it for seeding. The soil is dark and rich, finely tilled, spreading uniformly across the frame.\n\nIn the background, the landscape flattens out into a vast horizon that hints at more agricultural land. The sky is clear, casting bright, natural light across the scene, enhancing the vividness of the barn's blue hue and the metallic sheen of the windmill.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene, rural landscape that reflects agricultural life and the enduring nature of farm structures against time and elements.","title":"Farm","placename":"McNabb (Ill.)","location":"McNabb, Illinois","nn1":["555571","555577","552537","547307","554782","547304","550019","547289","557183","547303","547293","556963","549237","552515","547309","547128"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","windmill","sheen","sheet","show","mechanism","vividness","metal","rust","simplicity"]}
