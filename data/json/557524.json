{"path":"557524.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a coastal road winding through a seaside town. The photograph appears to be taken from a high vantage point overlooking the scene. The ocean provides a vast, calm backdrop, stretching out to the horizon. Alongside the beach, there's a collection of buildings that vary in style and size, likely a mix of residential homes and small businesses tailored to seaside living and tourism.\n\nA prominent coastal road curves through the center of the image, busy with a variety of vehicles including cars and possibly a bus or a large van. This road divides the built-up area from the sandy beach peppered with large rocks. Additionally, a pedestrian can be seen walking near the junction where another smaller road intersects the main thoroughfare.\n\nThe lush greenery on the right side of the frame suggests the area's natural vegetation, adding a contrasting texture to the built and paved environments. Overall, the scene captures a vibrant blend of natural beauty and human activity typical of many coastal communities.","title":"Looking down from the Santa Monica Mountains towards Highway #1 near Malibu, California, on the northern edge of Los Angeles. These mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County, but are under the threat of development. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure. Shoreline development has been restricted since the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545104","545110","543427","545105","557463","553774","553765","557453","557482","557523","545121","543337","543438","543435","545918","543362"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["road","build","tourism","beach","tailor","junction","pepper","thoroughfare","van","overlook"]}
