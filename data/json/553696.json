{"path":"553696.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a large agricultural field, which has been meticulously cultivated into neat, parallel rows. The field is mainly composed of a deep brown earth, possibly indicating freshly tilled soil or a specific type of crop. The lines in the field show variations in direction, which could reflect different planting strategies or land contours.\n\nRunning through and around the field are several dirt roads, highlighted by a lighter shade of brown and clearly defined edges, contrasting against the darker soil of the cultivated areas. These roads meander through the landscape, suggesting they might be used for farm access and transportation.\n\nAdditionally, there is a noticeable white high-voltage power line running diagonally through the part of the image, supported by tall poles that cast shadows on the ground, indicating the photograph was taken with the sun at a low angle.\n\nThe perimeter and the spaces between the sectors of the field are lined with greenery, likely bushes or small trees, which might serve as windbreaks or field boundaries. The surrounding area beyond the field looks more rugged and less cultivated, which adds a natural, wild contrast to the disciplined appearance of the farmed area.","title":"Pineapple fields in Mililani town.
