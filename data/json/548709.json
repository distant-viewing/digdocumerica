{"path":"548709.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a view looking upward at a large tree, possibly an oak, characterized by its rough, textured bark and sprawling, intricate branches. The tree dominates the frame, its trunk and branches extending into a canopy that partially obscures the sky. Through the leaves and branches, dappled sunlight filters down, creating an interplay of light and shadow on the tree's surface.\n\nNotable in the image are the effects of lens flare, which appear as soft, round orbs of light in various sizes and colors, contributing an etheric or dreamlike quality to the scene. These light orbs scatter across the frame, enhancing the visual impact of the sunlight filtering through the leaves.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or man-made structures in the photograph, allowing the viewer's focus to be solely on the natural elements. The background, beyond the immediate view of the tree, fades into a blur of green, suggesting a dense, possibly forested area.\n\nThe overall composition, with its upward perspective and emphasis on natural textures and light effects, evokes a serene and somewhat mystical atmosphere, inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty and complexity of nature.","title":"One of Key Largo's remaining mahogany trees. English cabinet makers used to prize these trees as the raw material for their finest furniture. Today, developers and bulldozer operators who do not recognize the trees often uproot them when clearing land for commercial use.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548687","543448","551365","554954","548708","545292","543488","542927","547634","554099","550792","548686","542958","542932","547546","554995"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["orb","branch","filter","oak","contemplate","effect","flare","lens","leave","sunlight"]}
