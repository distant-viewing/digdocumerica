{"path":"554494.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, lakeside setting where two individuals are engaging in a relaxed conversation. The two individuals, a man and a woman, are sitting on a weathered log close to the water's edge amidst verdant greenery. The man is wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, and the woman is in a short-sleeve button-up shirt and shorts, both dressed aptly for a warm, casual outing.\n\nThey seem engaged in a conversation, looking towards each other, which adds a personal and relaxed atmosphere to the scene. Behind them, the lake appears calm with gentle ripples, shimmering under the light, contributing to the tranquil mood.\n\nTo the right of the frame, partially obscured by leafy tree branches, there's a single bicycle leaning against a tree, suggesting that at least one of them rode a bike to this scenic spot. The presence of the bicycle, alongside the natural surroundings, also hints at a theme of eco-friendly transportation and outdoor recreation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—the natural framing of trees around the subjects, the positioning of the bicycle, and the calm lake in the background—creates a picturesque and peaceful moment, evoking a sense of leisure and enjoyment in nature.","title":"Bicycling couple stop during their tour of Fourth Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553396","551514","547595","543601","554900","546077","549471","545038","557563","551942","543951","543505","548833","554493","550238","549756"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["bicycle","short","conversation","lake","bike","positioning","lakeside","recreation","outing","button"]}
