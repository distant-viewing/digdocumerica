{"path":"544661.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an evocative scene at a marina during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The sky is rich with moody colors, exhibiting shades of deep purple, blue, and hints of fiery orange amidst clouds that blend into this dramatic backdrop. Numerous sailboats are moored at the marina, and their masts rise vertically against the sky, creating a forest of slender, linear forms.\n\nThe boats appear in different sizes and styles, mostly yachts or sailing boats, with a few featuring covered areas or cabins. The detailing on these boats can't be clearly discerned due to the low light conditions, but they present a variety of shapes with darkened, silhouetted hulls against the brighter water. Reflective ripples on the water suggest a gentle movement at the surface, and the overall atmosphere is calm and serene, highlighted by the subdued natural lighting and coloration of the sky.\n\nWhile there are no people visible in this scene, the arrangement and number of boats imply human activity, likely a bustling day behind or ahead of this tranquil moment. The surrounding environment beyond the marina is not distinctly visible, implying a focus intensely oriented towards the boats and the sky. The composition and timing capture nature's quiet spectacle beautifully, set against human elements of recreation or transportation.","title":"Alameda marina","placename":"Oakland (Calif.)","location":"Oakland, California","nn1":["550039","548247","542904","543545","543246","543119","545026","544248","542871","546877","544130","556191","546388","553991","545015","543956"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["marina","boat","yacht","spectacle","capture","mast","coloration","recreation","detailing","sailing"]}
