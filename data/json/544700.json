{"path":"544700.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial plant, possibly a factory or a refinery, dominated by a color palette of dark tones and silhouettes against a stark, possibly sunset or sunrise-lit sky. Thick, voluminous plumes of dark smoke billow from multiple points of the structure, rising and mixing with the ambient atmospheric light.\n\nThe primary focus of the image is the silhouette of the industrial complex that features several large buildings and a variety of connected pipes and metal frameworks. Some components of this plant are box-like in shape, while others are cylindrical, and there are angled supports and staircases visible upon closer inspection, suggesting accessibility to different levels and sections of the plant.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is slightly ominous, showcasing the environmental impact of industrial activities. The contrast between the dark, pollution-producing facility and the lighter sky in the background emphasizes the dramatic effect of industrial emissions on the surroundings.","title":"Industry has taken over the San Francisco Bay Area for its own purposes.","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["545446","544688","544173","544696","547090","544684","542999","546384","550983","545447","546107","550328","549190","557231","557381","557302"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","refinery","like","silhouette","accessibility","staircase","inspection","produce","sunrise","emission"]}
