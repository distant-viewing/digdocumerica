{"path":"547657.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a barren landscape that appears to be a dry lakebed or riverbed, characterized by a vast stretch of dirt and scattered stones. Tire tracks run across the foreground, suggesting recent vehicle activity.\n\nIn the distance, a two-story house with a visible balcony stands isolated against a backdrop of leafless trees and clear blue sky, hinting at a season that could either be late autumn or early spring. The surrounding environment is devoid of visible vegetation on the ground, lending an overall sparse and desolate feeling to the scene.\n\nThis setting may represent a place undergoing drought conditions or a temporary drawdown of a water reservoir. The clear skies and harsh sunlight accentuate the dryness of the terrain.","title":"Land cleared for development at Point Judith","placename":"Block Island Sound (R.I.)","location":"Block Island Sound, Rhode Island","nn1":["544428","550397","544019","543658","545604","544733","555882","555885","544751","557417","554166","549133","545593","544184","543644","544137"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["drought","reservoir","riverbed","undergo","isolate","balcony","tire","represent","autumn","lend"]}
