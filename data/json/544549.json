{"path":"544549.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and lush swamp scene, likely in a cypress swamp. The foreground is dominated by water that reflects the muted light and shadows of the surroundings. Emerging from the water are several stout tree trunks, presumably bald cypress trees, characterized by their textured, flaky bark and buttressed bases which widen at the water's edge, providing stability in the soft swamp ground.\n\nThe trees are adorned with various epiphytes, including clumps of Spanish moss that dangle from the branches, adding to the scene's quintessentially damp and mystical swamp ambiance. Among these, there are also large, leathery leaves of swamp plants, possibly water lilies or similar aquatic vegetation, floating at the surface and interspersed throughout the scene.\n\nThe background is dense with similar trees fading into a mist or muted light, suggesting either a time of day when light is diffused (such as dawn or dusk) or a cloudy day. The overall atmosphere is calm and somewhat enigmatic, inviting contemplation of nature's quietly complex beauty in a swamp environment. No human presence or man-made objects are visible, emphasizing the undisturbed natural setting.","title":"TaMiami Canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546181","544595","546059","544585","544545","544589","544593","544602","550789","546057","544241","554717","546205","550788","550345","547604"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["swamp","lily","basis","stability","clump","tree","water","bark","moss","contemplation"]}
