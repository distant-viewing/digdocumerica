{"path":"556853.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene centered around a set of railroad tracks, which lead the eye towards a parking lot and buildings in the distance. In the foreground, multiple railroad tracks composed of steel rails and wooden sleepers lie parallel to each other, embedded in a bed of gravel.\n\nBeyond the closest set of tracks, a chain-link fence separates the railway from a large, crowded parking lot to the left, filled with cars of various colors and models typical of the late 20th century. To the right, the parking lot is less populated.\n\nAcross the parking lot, there are workmen active near the tracks, dressed in light-colored, possibly reflective clothing, suggesting maintenance or construction activity. Their presence indicates a human element amidst the otherwise industrial and somewhat desolate railway landscape.\n\nIn the background, the scene is bordered by low-rise structures and trees. The buildings appear to be industrial or commercial, with flat roofs and functional design, while a verdant area of trees adds a touch of nature to the otherwise urban setting. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, which casts ample light over the entire scene, enhancing the visibility of details such as the texture of the gravel and the details on the parked cars.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of everyday industrial activity where transportation infrastructure intersects with urban life. The vantage point suggests the photo might have been taken from a railway bridge or a similarly elevated position.","title":"View from an Amtrak passenger train as it reaches Baltimore, Maryland, en route from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547140","556852","556783","556902","556873","556692","546627","547528","547050","556382","556877","556841","556851","546719","546700","556888"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["lot","parking","track","railway","railroad","gravel","embed","bed","chain","link"]}
