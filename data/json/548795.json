{"path":"548795.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene camping scene at dusk, characterized by its dim light and tranquil ambiance. In the foreground, a large camper trailer with extended awnings is parked on what appears to be a sandy and gravel mixed ground. The trailer's windows reveal silhouettes of people inside, suggesting a sense of activity or occupancy.\n\nFlanking the camper are various trees, likely pine, which add a natural, forested feel to the setting. On the right, a single bicycle is parked upright, contributing to the leisurely, outdoor-recreational theme of the scene.\n\nThe background offers a view of a calm sea or lake, visible through the gaps between the trees and the camper trailer. The sky above the waterline is overcast, hinting at a cooling, possibly evening atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a typical outdoor vacation scenario, focusing on leisure and natural beauty, with the elements of the camper, bicycle, trees, and water coming together to evoke a sense of peaceful retreat.","title":"Camping facilities, with water, electricity, and plumbing, are aVailable on long key state park","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548748","548796","548668","557514","548797","553133","548669","542746","550977","544449","545500","554480","544387","544855","542747","549450"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["camper","trailer","bicycle","gaps","extended","waterline","vacation","cooling","leisurely","awning"]}
