{"path":"551389.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people engaged in activities near a river or lake, enveloped in a dense, misty atmosphere. The scene is set in a soft purple hue, likely due to the time of day or weather conditions, adding a moody, serene quality to the image.\n\nSeveral individuals, spread out across the composition, appear to be collecting or interacting with the water. Some are standing in the water, while others are on the bank. The people in the water are equipped with buckets and poles, suggesting they might be fishing or possibly gathering other resources from the water.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a figure stands in a boat, also holding a pole, which might be used for navigation or aid in collecting items from the water. The attire of the individuals is casual, suited for outdoor activity, with some wearing hats for protection against the elements.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured by the fog but hints at a tree-lined shore. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, highlighted by the diffuse lighting and limited visibility due to the fog, which adds a sense of isolation and tranquility to the scene. The photograph captures a moment of everyday life, likely in a rural setting, where the river or lake plays a significant role in the local way of life.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
