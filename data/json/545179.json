{"path":"545179.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic moment on the open water. It features a man positioned in the rear of a small boat, which is actively moving at a significant speed. The man appears middle-aged with curly hair and is dressed in a brown jacket with white and brown striped trousers. He is leaning slightly forward with one hand extended towards the ocean in what looks like a gesture of pointing or reaching.\n\nThe scene is vibrant with the sunlight illuminating the clear blue sky and the ocean's surface. The ocean itself is tumultuous, with white foam created by the boat's rapid movement through the water, suggesting choppy conditions. Above the ocean, to the left of the composition, a bird can be seen in mid-flight, tethered by what appears to be a string or fishing line, adding an unusual element to the scene.\n\nThe background indicates a clear horizon where the deep blue of the ocean meets the sky, emphasizing the feeling of openness and the expansive nature of the setting. The image conveys a sense of adventure and interaction with the natural elements, highlighted by the man's engagement with the surroundings and the fast-moving boat cutting through the waters.","title":"Denis Hickey works Dungeness crab pots.
