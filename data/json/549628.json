{"path":"549628.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a man conducting an environmental or scientific experiment by a body of water. The man appears to be in his thirties or forties, wearing casual attire consisting of a plaid, short-sleeved, blue and white shirt, and dark blue pants. He has curly hair and is wearing sunglasses, and can be seen handling a tall, vertical metal apparatus that has multiple glass jars affixed to it at intervals, each jar containing what seems to be samples of water or another clear liquid.\n\nThe man is focused on adjusting or examining one of the jars, and his posture and facial expression suggest concentration and dedication to the task. The background features a calm body of water, reflecting a mostly cloudy sky, and lined with lush green trees on the far side, giving the setting a tranquil, natural feel. The image evokes themes of scientific research, environmental monitoring, and possibly the study of water quality or similar fields.","title":"Scientist from the EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory on Dauphin Island.
