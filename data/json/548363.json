{"path":"548363.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a densely packed urban area, dominated by a complex network of elevated highways and roadways. The highways are heavily utilized, filled with numerous cars indicating either rush-hour traffic or typical urban congestion. Different levels and layers of roads intersect and weave around each other, contributing to a highly structured yet busy transportation hub.\n\nIn the midst of these roadways, there are clusters of residential buildings, likely apartments or condos. These medium-rise buildings are rectangular and uniformly spaced in a tight formation, surrounded on all sides by the road infrastructure. This juxtaposition highlights the integration of living spaces within significant transport networks, typical of urban settings.\n\nOn the periphery and beneath the interchange, patches of green spaces and trees provide a contrast to the otherwise grey and concrete-dominated scene. These green areas appear well-maintained, offering a visual relief and indicating the presence of parklands or planned landscaping.\n\nThe overall scene is indicative of a major metropolitan area where infrastructure development is closely integrated with residential zones, emphasizing the balance urban planners must maintain between transportation efficiency and livable spaces. The image also reflects the complexities and challenges of urban design and transportation planning in densely populated cities.","title":"Entrance to the George Washington Bridge from upper Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548359","548092","548332","546617","546726","546616","546678","548358","547764","547770","546573","548411","553015","546713","555781","546709"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["transportation","roadway","network","highway","space","relief","maintain","interchange","efficiency","periphery"]}
