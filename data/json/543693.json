{"path":"543693.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a touching moment between an elderly man and a young child engaged in the activity of fishing together. The scene takes place in a body of water, likely a lake or river, where they are standing knee-deep. The older man is wearing a pair of dark waders, a light-colored shirt, and a unique hat adorned with a red and blue striped ribbon, possibly hinting at a festive or special occasion. He is smiling and appears to be instructing or helping the child with the fishing rod.\n\nThe child, in contrast, wears a bright red-orange sleeveless shirt and multi-colored shorts, standing close to the man, looking up at him, possibly listening or conversing.\n\nThe background of the scene is a calm body of water that fills the top half of the frame, with subtle ripples and light reflecting off the surface suggesting a sunny day. The atmosphere is serene and intimate, emphasized by the soft focus and diffuse light that bathes the subjects, highlighting this quiet, bonding moment between the generations. The interaction suggests warmth, guidance, and a shared joy in a simple, outdoor activity.","title":"Shana is taught to fish by her gRandfather at man-made Miramonte Lake.","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543516","550848","557741","543484","542564","543164","552976","553081","558186","554692","549935","551393","554520","551410","551537","548737"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","instruct","guidance","bond","ribbon","generation","occasion","knee","half","warmth"]}
