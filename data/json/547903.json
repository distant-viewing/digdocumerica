{"path":"547903.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph appears to capture an industrial scene, possibly at a port or a similar loading facility. In the foreground, there is an open, metal cargo box suspended from an unseen crane mechanism, tilted to drop its contents into a large dumpster labeled “DS 30.” The cargo seems to be some type of dark, granular material, possibly scrap metal, coal, or another raw industrial commodity.\n\nBelow the suspended cargo box, the dumpster is situated on a platform adjacent to an industrial waterway or dock area, as evidenced by water visible in the distant background and a large metal-bearing structure or possibly a part of a ship's infrastructure to the right side of the frame.\n\nSeveral large piles of similar dark material are scattered around the area, and various industrial equipment and materials, such as ropes and chains, are seen scattered on the platform. The buildings in the background have a utilitarian industrial design, featuring large rectangular structures with faded and dirt-streaked exteriors, large windows, and sliding cargo doors. They might serve as warehouses or processing buildings.\n\nThe overall environment looks quite utilitarian and focused on heavy industry, with little to no vegetation or non-industrial elements visible. The scene is overcast, and the lighting is flat, enhancing the gritty, work-focused nature of the setting.","title":"Barge loaded with ashes from gravesend bay incineration plant","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547611","555809","550882","550265","547610","548353","548356","548423","550960","548324","547474","547010","548774","547065","546255","550880"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["cargo","dumpster","suspend","box","platform","material","metal","drop","slide","loading"]}
