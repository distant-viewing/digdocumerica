{"path":"555755.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This is an aerial photograph portraying a wide, expansive view of an urban landscape that includes both industrial and residential areas. The foreground shows numerous large industrial facilities, including warehouses and manufacturing buildings, some with flat, expansive roofs. Many of these roofs have numerous vehicles parked around them, indicating active commercial operations. There is a significant presence of parked trailers and cars, as well as some areas where materials appear to be stored outside, possibly for construction or manufacturing.\n\nA dominant feature in the landscape is a network of roads, one of which is a prominent highway that curves through the scene, leading towards a cluster of high-rise buildings in the distant background, possibly indicating the downtown area of a city. This area also contains several bridges spanning a river that snakes through the city, contributing to the division of the landscape into distinct zones.\n\nThe river appears muddy and is bordered by green spaces in some areas, suggesting less developed or possibly recreational land. Beyond the river and industrial zones, the land rises slightly with patches of greenery and more dispersed housing, transitioning from the heavily industrial foreground.\n\nIn addition to these elements, there are small bodies of water (ponds or small lakes), and the overall landscape shows a mix of development and open land, likely utilized for various urban needs. The color palette includes earth tones, greens, and blues, particularly noticeable in the bodies of water and green spaces. The image is taken from a high vantage point, and the shadows cast by buildings indicate that the photograph was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, given the softness and length of the shadows. This photo captures a complex urban environment marked by industrial activity, transportation infrastructure, and varied land use.","title":"Destruction of wetlands near Newark, New Jersey.
