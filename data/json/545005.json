{"path":"545005.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic waterside scene with multiple structures and a calm, reflective body of water. Dominating the image are large, wooden, reddish-brown buildings with gabled roofs, built on stilts over the water. These structures are connected by wooden piers and walkways badly in need of repair, suggesting a somewhat dilapidated or long-used waterfront establishment, possibly for fishing or boating related activities.\n\nSeveral boats are visible, moored alongside the piers beneath the buildings. The nearest structure to the foreground has a visible boat parked under it, half-sheltered from view. Reflections of the buildings and the skeletal remains of old piers shimmer in the tranquil water, enhancing the serene yet somewhat abandoned feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a more substantial pier extends into the waterway, equipped with rails and lamp posts, suggesting it may accommodate larger vessels or serve a more public or commercial function. Sparse vegetation and flat terrain can be seen beyond the waterfront, with a hint of a roadway or path dissecting the landscape parallel to the horizon.\n\nThe sky is overcast, lending a soft light to the image which mutes the colors and adds to the atmosphere of calm and quiet isolation. The composition of the photo, with its focus on the interaction between the man-made structures and the natural environment, portrays a scenic but somber waterfront locale likely shaped by its maritime activities.","title":"Fishing dock","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["550293","548105","547594","544567","547965","546871","547847","547622","551981","547585","551978","544201","544266","547575","546109","547584"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pier","waterfro","gabled","waterside","stilt","moor","accommodate","boat","not","locale"]}
