{"path":"555647.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a rural landscape scene. The foreground prominently displays a deteriorated road that appears overgrown with patches of grass and bordered by natural vegetation. A prominent yellow, rectangular sign with black text stands near the left edge of the road, stating \"ROAD CLOSED AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\". To the right of the road, dense greenery including tall grasses and wildflowers suggests the image was taken in a verdant, overgrown area, possibly during spring or summer.\n\nIn the midground, lush fields of corn and other crops extend towards the background on either side of the road. The colors here are vibrant, with different shades of green dominating the scene.\n\nThe background shows a distinct, large hill or landfill, with a relatively barren and brown appearance. Further emphasizing its prominence in the landscape, this hill stands out against the otherwise verdant surroundings. \n\nThe sky above is clear and vividly blue, highlighting a stark contrast to the natural and developed elements below. Overall, the photograph captures a somewhat neglected road leading through a fertile agricultural area to a starkly contrasting backdrop. The presence of the road sign suggests that the road leads to or borders a restricted area, possibly associated with the visible hill in the background.","title":"Farmland purchased and the road closed by the Ohio power company near Chandlersville, Ohio","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["555582","555628","554789","544245","549182","545620","545624","543104","556313","544262","547316","544292","554802","556615","554803","555858"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","hill","corn","border","prominence","deteriorate","landfill","lead","grass","wildflower"]}
