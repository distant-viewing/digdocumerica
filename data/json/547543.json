{"path":"547543.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a vast marshland or wetland area, dominated by tall golden-brown reeds that sway slightly under the influence of a breeze. The foreground is filled with these dense reeds, with patches of visible water reflecting a clear sky. The scene transitions seamlessly into the background, where a more distant landscape presents a slightly raised, darkened landfill area embellished with various materials and debris. Notably, two distinct utility poles are positioned in the mid-distance, suggesting the presence of human infrastructure nearby. The sky above is devoid of clouds and displays a soft gradient of light, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. The overall composition invokes a serene yet somber mood, emphasizing the interaction between natural landscapes and human encroachment.","title":"Looking across the salt marsh to the Middletown dump","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547547","547500","547532","542525","547589","544515","544530","547924","550345","550788","550787","553856","557498","547604","554717","550783"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["reed","marshland","encroachment","landfill","influence","breeze","wetland","gradient","utility","mid"]}
