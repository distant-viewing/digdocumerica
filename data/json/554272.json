{"path":"554272.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals walking along a wet asphalt road surrounded by a winter landscape, characterized by mounds of snow. On the left, one person is wearing a light gray jacket, dark pants, and beige boots, carrying a star-shaped trophy and a brown leather bag over their shoulder. Their hair is dark and curly, falling around the face.\n\nOn the right, the other person is dressed in a green jacket, blue jeans, and is also wearing boots, holding a pair of yellow ski poles in one hand and a beige purse in the other. This individual has their hair tied back with a patterned cloth headband.\n\nThe background features snow-covered hills and a clear blue sky. To the extreme right, there is a snowbank and visible signage indicating a restricted area beyond a chain-link fence, possibly entry to a ski area or parking lot. The scene exudes a casual, leisurely mood, possibly after a day spent in winter outdoor activities.","title":"Returning to the village after a day of skiing","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554275","548038","554261","548032","554259","554228","543510","554213","548046","543375","543384","554262","554279","557181","554276","554251"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["boot","winter","snow","headband","purse","entry","leather","ski","jacket","cloth"]}
