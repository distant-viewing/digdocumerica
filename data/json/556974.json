{"path":"556974.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This aerial photograph shows a residential area with several features. The image is divided roughly in half by a vertical road that continues beyond the top and bottom boundaries. Parallel to this main road are several smaller roads accessorized with houses on either side. These houses vary in architecture and size but mostly include typical suburban single-family homes, some with detached garages.\n\nOn the left side of the image, adjacent to the vertical road, there's a large green field, which contrasts with the densely built-up area to the right. Several properties on the right are lined with trees and shrubs, adding to the greenery in the scene. Each plot seems to have a well-defined yard, many of which include planted gardens and orderly landscaping.\n\nIn the background, there are more residential or possibly rural structures visible, suggesting this area is on the outskirts of a town or in a semi-rural setting. The color palette of the environment includes various shades of green from the vegetation and darker hues from the rooftops, creating a tranquil and serene atmosphere. The layout indicates well-organized urban planning typical of suburban developments. The overall setting appears peaceful and orderly.","title":"Aerial view of a portion of a central valley quadrangle which is bounded by tracyton, illahee, brownsville and silverdale these communities and others in the area will be affected by population growth when the navy's proposed trident submarine base is built nearby","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["558057","547435","549071","556975","544604","546399","547211","548011","553937","551198","553700","547769","553970","556956","558059","553693"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["road","accessorize","house","landscaping","plot","garage","rooftop","planning","outskirt","half"]}
