{"path":"546682.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a tree-lined road flanked by parked cars on one side and a flowing river or canal on the other. It is a vibrant daytime scene, though details such as the brightness and colors suggest it might also be a slightly overcast day.\n\nThe road is depicted in a vertical composition, running from the bottom to the top of the image. On the left side of the road, densely packed with lush green trees, the branches and leaves create a solid green border that dominates this portion of the scene. On the right, juxtaposed against this natural vista, is a lineup of vintage cars parked along the roadside. The cars, likely from the mid-20th century given their design, come in various colors including white, blue, gray, and mint green.\n\nThe road itself is a dark asphalt color, contrasting sharply with the lighter colors of the cars and the vibrant green of the trees. On the opposite side of the road from the trees is a strip of land followed by what appears to be a river or canal. The water body is visible through a small clearing in the vegetation, hinting at a serene setting adjacent to the bustling road.\n\nThis high angle shot may have been taken from a building, bridge, or some other elevated point, overlooking this scenic urban tableau. It captures a moment of everyday tranquility and urban life, juxtaposed with natural beauty.","title":"Orderly traffic on rock creek parkway","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546730","550216","548473","546710","549857","546716","552712","551240","553718","549829","554031","547776","547659","558047","557555","546718"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","canal","juxtapose","lineup","car","green","vista","tableau","asphalt","scenic"]}
