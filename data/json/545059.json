{"path":"545059.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling industrial landscape dominated by a massive accumulation of scrap materials. The scene is densely packed with piles of metallic debris, parts of vehicles, and miscellaneous waste sprawled over a large area. The ground is uneven and dirt-covered, with pathways meandering between the piles of scrap.\n\nAround the perimeter and interspersed throughout the site are various makeshift structures, perhaps workshops or storage sheds, indicative of an active industrial or recycling operation. Several vehicles, including trucks and what appear to be heavy machinery, are scattered throughout the area, suggesting ongoing work or transport.\n\nThe background shows a contrast between the industrial area and the modern infrastructure, featuring a bridge and elevated roads. High-rise buildings are visible in the far distance, subtly obscured by a haze that could be pollution or mist, which blankets the area and contributes to a gritty, overcast atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph highlights the extensive human impact on the environment through industrial activities, emphasizing themes of recycling, waste management, and possibly the economic aspects tied to scrap handling and processing facilities.","title":"Zidell ship-wrecking yard","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547610","547611","547062","542660","554318","547625","546256","545146","550880","546255","554300","552154","557308","554301","547901","551521"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["scrap","recycling","waste","pile","perimeter","accumulation","workshop","handling","shed","vehicle"]}
