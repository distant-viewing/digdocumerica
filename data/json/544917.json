{"path":"544917.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a striking natural landscape featuring a vast, curved canyon with towering, smooth red sandstone walls. A clear blue sky barely peeks out from above the sweeping sandstone rock formations, which show alternating stripes and layers of deep oranges and reds, accentuating the canyon's grand scale and sculptural beauty wrought by geological processes.\n\nIn the scene, a small figure—a hiker dressed in outdoor gear with a backpack and wearing a hat—stands near the center, visually dwarfed by the immense scale of the canyon walls. This person is actively using a camera, pointing it upwards towards the graceful arcs of the rock. Their presence contributes a sense of scale and a human element to the vast, unspoiled wilderness.\n\nThe canyon floor, where the hiker stands, appears damp, possibly from a nearby stream which can be seen meandering into the distance, its path marked by sand and mudbanks. The ground is etched with patterns, possibly from the flow of water or footsteps of past visitors, directing a visual flow that follows the curvature of the canyon.\n\nSparse vegetation, including a few green bushes and small trees, adds a touch of life to the otherwise barren rock and sand landscape, suggesting resilience and adaptation to a harsh environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its sweeping curves and vibrant color palette, along with the solitary figure of the hiker, conveys a narrative of adventure, solitude, and exploration in one of nature's grandest settings.","title":"Sculptured by erosion","placename":"Bryce Canyon (Utah)","location":"Bryce Canyon, Utah","nn1":["545697","544899","544931","545305","544950","545750","544895","545762","544903","545765","544928","545693","545759","545758","545796","545764"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","hiker","sandstone","scale","rock","sand","dwarf","etch","wrotch","alternate"]}
