{"path":"544744.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This image features a striking aerial view of a meandering river cutting through an expansive, rugged landscape. The river, silvery and reflective, snakes prominently through the scene from the upper left to the bottom right, contrasting sharply against the surrounding terrain. The land around the river is textured and appears arid, covered in shades of browns and blacks with hints of dark green vegetation or algae near the water's edges.\n\nThe terrain is varied, including rough, rocky outcrops and smoother, sediment-filled areas that suggest erosive processes at work. The colors indicate a combination of rock types and possible mineral deposits that enhance the stark and natural beauty of the environment. The overall composition of the photograph, combined with the play of light and shadows, highlights the dramatic and wild aspects of this seemingly desolate region.\n\nThe viewpoint is high, likely taken from an aircraft, giving an expansive view that emphasizes the isolation and untouched nature of the landscape. The river’s winding path leads the viewer’s eye through the composition, demonstrating nature’s ability to sculpt the land over time. There are no visible human activities or structures, underscoring the remoteness and natural state of the environment captured in the photograph.","title":"Colorado--South Platte River","placename":"South Platte River (Colo. and Neb.)","location":"South Platte River, Colorado","nn1":["552908","552925","549456","550597","550542","552548","549021","545632","550577","550616","543977","550633","550593","550562","550524","544752"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","sculpt","varied","black","remoteness","silvery","alga","outcrop","deposit","land"]}
