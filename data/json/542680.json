{"path":"542680.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic sunset scene characterized by a vivid and emotionally stirring atmosphere. At the center of the image, the sun appears as a bright, glowing orb just above the horizon, casting a warm orange and yellow light that permeates the sky. Surrounding the sun, the sky transitions into deeper shades of red and orange, suggesting that the sun is setting.\n\nBelow the sun, a silhouette of mountain ranges lines the bottom part of the frame, adding a sense of depth and natural landscape to the composition. The mountain contours are soft and indistinct, primarily due to the haze or mist that partially obscures them, contributing to the overall mystical and serene feeling of the scene.\n\nThe foreground is not visible, allowing the viewer to focus entirely on the interplay of light and color in the sky and the stark outlines of the mountains. The hues and gradients of color in the sky suggest that the photograph was taken during the \"golden hour,\" a time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, which is famous for its photography-friendly soft light.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes strong horizontal lines formed by the horizon and the mountain range, while the spherical sun creates a focal point that draws the eye. The natural gradation of colors from bright to dark provides a dynamic yet harmonious visual experience, evocative of tranquility and the natural beauty of a dusk landscape.","title":"Sunset seen through smog","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542678","552896","553844","557560","552337","554396","555070","549106","547719","557629","542679","552895","554643","543410","552335","544047"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","mountain","sunset","stirr","orb","permeate","gradation","bright","range","photography"]}
