{"path":"558210.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a classroom scene featuring a male teacher standing at the front. The teacher, dressed in a vibrant red blazer, a striped tie, and plaid trousers, is holding papers in one hand and gesturing with the other. He appears engaged in his presentation, possibly addressing a student or making a point during his lecture.\n\nIn the foreground, the back of a student's head is visible, suggesting the photo is taken from the perspective of someone seated among the students. The student has dark hair and is wearing a knit sweater.\n\nThe classroom setting is typical with a simple, functional design. The chalkboard behind the teacher is partly visible, and wooden desks with chairs are apparent. The overall tone of the image conveys a typical educational environment with a focus on the teacher's interaction with the class. The lighting in the room is soft, illuminating the teacher and the front of the classroom.","title":"A teacher talks to his students in a classroom at Cathedral High School in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have arrived since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized during the 1960's.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558214","558212","544798","544322","548243","554838","552590","558410","557703","548227","558209","554344","543919","543920","546548","544314"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["teacher","student","classroom","class","presentation","address","blazer","front","knit","desk"]}
