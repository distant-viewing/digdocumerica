{"path":"542874.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene on a waterside dock during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the soft lighting. A man and a dog are the two main subjects positioned on the wooden dock, with a body of water reflecting their images subtly rippled. The man, possibly middle-aged and wearing a blue work suit, stands with a relaxed posture, facing the dog. The dog, appearing to be a boxer breed, sits attentively, looking up at the man, suggesting a moment of interaction or training.\n\nBehind them is a moderately sized boat with a noticeable blue and white color scheme, bearing the name \"Hunter\" inscribed visibly on its side. The reflection in the water, especially that of the boat, adds a gentle, artistic element to the scene, enhancing the overall peaceful atmosphere. The elements suggest a calm, serene moment, likely in a small marina or boat dock area. The clarity and simplicity of the scene evoke a sense of quiet companionship and mutual trust between the man and his dog.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["553089","549928","551516","543038","554537","549716","554126","556549","554473","557637","547148","545911","544195","549954","543031","548138"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dog","dock","boat","inscribe","training","breed","positio","subjects","waterside","man"]}
