{"path":"556360.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from inside a mining environment, vividly portraying the working conditions and atmosphere typical in such settings.\n\nThe photo is dominated by dim, blue-tinted lighting which gives it a somber and industrial feel. At the center, a miner can be seen operating a large piece of machinery, likely a continuous miner or similar heavy equipment used for underground excavation. The miner is wearing typical protective gear, including a hard hat with a mounted light, which provides a focal illumination point in the otherwise dark surroundings.\n\nThe space around the miner is cramped and filled with mineral debris and coal, reflecting the harsh and confined conditions commonly found in underground mining operations. The ceiling and walls of the mine appear to be reinforced with wooden beams and metal structures, ensuring the stability of the tunnel. Exposed wires and additional mechanical parts can be seen protruding from various directions, contributing to the industrial chaos of the scene.\n\nIn the background and foreground, more of the rough, rock-laden surfaces are visible, covered in dust and small reflective particles, possibly minerals or moisture, catching what little light is present. This adds a raw texture to the image, emphasizing the rugged nature of the miner's work environment.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively conveys the tough, hazardous, and crucial job of miners working underground, surrounded by the oppressive darkness only sporadically penetrated by artificial lights.","title":"Harley Owens in position as a machine operator on the end of the long wall where the coal is placed on a conveyor belt. A tail operator works on the other end of the machine 450 feet away. This is mine #3 of the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company near Richlands, Virginia. Long wall mining is relatively new and more costly, but allows about twice as much coal to be taken from a mine.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556397","556396","556319","556510","556511","556364","556359","556366","556358","556357","556363","556365","556329","543743","556513","543775"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["miner","mineral","mining","job","stability","tunnel","particle","chaos","mine","coal"]}
