{"path":"543024.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody rural landscape at dusk. The composition is characterized by a silhouette of a hilly terrain against a vibrant sky that gradates from a rich orange near the horizon to a dark blue, almost black, at the top. Near the center of the photograph, a vehicle is captured at a distance, making its way along the crest of the hill. The vehicle is blackened by the backlighting of the sunset, shown only in outline.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are multiple telegraph poles connected by taut, diagonal wires, creating a slight diagonal line from the upper left to the lower center. The hill itself is bordered by a simple fence, marked intermittently by posts that extend along the hill's contour.\n\nThe silhouette of the fence, combined with the sparse, open landscape and the starkness of the silhouette forms against the colorful sky, creates a scene that is both stark and vibrant. This setting conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility, with the vehicle being the only sign of human activity in an otherwise desolate landscape. The overall mood is somewhat contemplative and serene, as the natural beauty of the scene dominates the visual elements.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553820","544123","544119","557182","544359","545349","545347","549140","543728","544944","547292","548230","556587","546100","556960","557013"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["hill","blacken","fence","vehicle","starkness","silhouette","crest","backlighting","near","desolate"]}
