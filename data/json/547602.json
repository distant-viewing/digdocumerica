{"path":"547602.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph displays a tranquil coastal scene. The foreground features a rugged shore comprised of rocks and rubble, possibly remnants of a man-made structure, bathed in varying shades of green moss and algae. The rocks appear weathered and partially submerged by the tide. In between these rocks, small puddles of water and debris, such as pebbles and a stray piece of wood, can be observed, creating a mosaic of natural textures.\n\nThe body of water in the midground is calm with a smooth surface, reflecting a gentle light. This tranquility contrasts with the littered and somewhat chaotic state of the shore. In the water, there are a few objects like sticks and possibly trash, hinting at human activity or nearby habitation affecting the area.\n\nThe background consists of the open water extending towards the horizon under an overcast or clear, slightly darkened sky, perhaps indicating either early morning or late afternoon. There is no clear demarcation of the far shoreline, giving a sense of expansiveness to the body of water. \n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene yet slightly neglected coastal environment where the natural beauty coexists with subtle signs of human impact. The scene invites contemplation about the resilience of nature despite environmental challenges.","title":"Narragansett bay at fields point shows green algal scum indicator of phosphate pollutants","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["543289","549338","543186","545173","547486","543297","543068","554102","545122","544284","545095","549353","542976","550458","542884","557508"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","shore","demarcation","expansiveness","water","algae","tide","pebble","rubble","coexist"]}
