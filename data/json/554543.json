{"path":"554543.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving several people and vehicles on a vast, rather barren piece of land. In the foreground, there are two parked vehicles: on the left side, a white sedan with its front door wide open and, on the right, a dark blue Chevrolet pickup truck. The pickup truck has a group of six people standing in its cargo bed, all facing away from the camera, seemingly looking at something in the distance.\n\nTo the side of the truck, a single young man wearing a white shirt and dark pants stands facing towards both the truck and the group, giving an impression of observing or listening. Also seen in the truckâ€™s cargo bed is a dog, lying down near the cab, appearing relaxed or tired.\n\nThe background reveals a large, cleared area littered with what appears to be trash or debris, suggesting that the site might be a dump or under development. Beyond this cleared area, a dense forest of coniferous trees lines the horizon under a cloudy sky. \n\nOverall, the composition and the attire of the people suggest a gathering or perhaps a shared outing to a remote location, with the group collectively focused on something occurring or visible in the cleared area in front of them.","title":"Watching black bears is a favorite summer evening attraction at dumps in the Adirondack Forest Preserve. The bears are semi-tame and accidents are possible if tourists are not cautious, in the New York State recreation area.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553117","553112","544802","548303","551413","554666","557004","545225","545596","557777","554685","552376","553113","554681","544402","544767"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["truck","clear","pickup","bed","cargo","group","cab","people","dump","occur"]}
