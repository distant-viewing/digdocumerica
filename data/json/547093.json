{"path":"547093.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene centered around a faded red pickup truck parked in front of a larger industrial vehicle, possibly a garbage truck, set against a very dimly lit background that fades into darkness. The pickup truck, which displays the word \"MARCUS\" prominently on its door, contains a driver wearing glasses and a dark colored outfit. In front of the vehicle, there appears to be a massive pile of debris or crushed material, predominantly in shades of dark gray and black, suggesting a waste management or industrial site. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of gritty, work-related activity in an industrial or utilitarian environment, emphasized by the low visibility and shadowy ambiance.","title":"Pick-up truck above Calumet River-wall","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["543896","544061","553041","555817","552077","544767","545010","549837","549743","544720","543173","547666","542538","548275","556323","552360"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["pickup","truck","front","garbage","darkness","driver","vehicle","word","visibility","waste"]}
