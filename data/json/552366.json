The man on the left, who wears glasses and a blue denim shirt with sleeves rolled up, is bending slightly forward to get a closer look at the document. The man on the right, wearing a tan baseball cap and a plaid shirt, is pointing at a specific portion of the document, possibly explaining something.\n\nIn the background, there is a bright yellow helicopter with an open door, indicating either recent activity or preparation for a flight. The helicopter appears to be parked on a helipad or a similar flat surface, and there are a few individuals in the background near the helicopter, possibly engaged in conversations or maintenance activities.\n\nOther notable features in the image include a coffee cup on the surface near the documents, suggesting a work or discussion session. The environment suggests overcast weather, with a flat, nondescript sky, which might suggest either early morning or a cloudy day.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a businesslike, professional atmosphere, possibly in a field related to aviation, search and rescue, or a similar field where such a helicopter would be utilized.","title":"Los Angeles reactive pollutant program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552390","552388","552392","557727","542576","556383","548769","546683","555287","552616","556634","552387","557894","555825","548277","555233"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["helicopter","document","aviation","session","coffee","map","surface","baseball","cup","field"]}
