{"path":"547403.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and lively group dance scene. Many people, both men and women, are seen on a dark, glossy dance floor, engaged in what appears to be folk dancing or a form of social ballroom dance. The overall scene is lit warmly, creating a soft, inviting glow that highlights the dancers and their colorful attire.\n\nThe dancers, who vary in age, are dressed in traditional or vintage-style attire. Women wear full, belled skirts adorned with different patterns and colors like pink, yellow, blue, and green. The skirts often feature floral or gingham designs. Most women have paired these skirts with white blouses. The men typically wear long-sleeve shirts in solid colors like white or muted tones, complemented by dark trousers.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of movement and joy, with couples seen holding hands, some in mid-twirl, and others calmly walking through the dance floor. The background is dark and indistinct, putting the focus squarely on the dancers themselves. The composition and lighting give this image a timeless, nostalgic feel, suggesting a community gathering or a cultural celebration.","title":"The Pershing Memorial Auditorium is the scene of Lincoln's 33rd annual square dance festival.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["558286","547334","547386","547317","547387","558284","547271","547274","547371","558285","547383","553241","551710","557790","556288","553235"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["dance","dancer","skirt","folk","dancing","woman","floor","celebration","joy","attire"]}
