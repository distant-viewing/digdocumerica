{"path":"549694.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an industrial steel foundry or mill. The environment is illuminated by the intense glow of molten metal, creating a dramatic and vibrant lighting effect with oranges and yellows against darker areas of the factory.\n\nIn the foreground, a worker stands facing away from the viewer, observing the activities ahead. He is dressed in typical industrial protective clothing: a long-sleeve shirt and pants, possibly coveralls, and he appears to be wearing safety shoes. His attention is directed towards the center of the image where the main action is occurring.\n\nIn the middle of the photograph, two more workers are engaged in handling a large, glowing metal cylinder using a hoist. This cylinder is possibly being transported or moved to another section of the mill. The workers appear focused and are coordinated in their efforts to manage the heavy load safely.\n\nThe background shows additional elements of the mill, including various machinery and equipment, possibly for processing or shaping steel. Sparks are visible in several areas, indicating active metalworking processes. Overhead, industrial structures and possibly some conduits or piping can be seen, which are typical in such environments.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a snapshot of the heavy, intense, and precise work involved in steelmaking, highlighting the challenging conditions and the teamwork necessary to operate safely and effectively in such a setting.","title":"Pouring clusters of 16-gear case housings at the ford foundry in dearborn","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["544000","549693","544004","549695","543996","544049","544041","544001","557399","545536","557400","557395","557397","557402","544045","545532"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["mill","cylinder","worker","steel","conduit","glow","hoist","coordinate","orang","involved"]}
