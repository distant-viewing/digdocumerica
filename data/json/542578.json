{"path":"542578.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant scene at what appears to be a small airport or airfield. In the foreground, there is a cropped view of a small aircraft, pale with red accents, featuring a visible propeller and spraying apparatus, suggesting its use in aerial application, possibly for crop dusting or pesticide spraying.\n\nThree men are actively engaged in loading or unloading sacks from the aircraft. The man on the left, wearing a white hat and shirt, is hefting a sack labeled \"ZINC\" into the aircraft, implying it might contain agricultural chemicals. Another man, to the right, dressed in a turquoise shirt and also wearing a white hat, assists from the aircraft's wing, reaching down to adjust or guide the sack. Inside the cockpit, another figure is partially visible, potentially coordinating or assisting with the loading.\n\nThe backdrop is a clear, vivid blue sky punctuated by a few wispy clouds and a trailing streak, possibly from an earlier aircraft. The tarmac is sunlit, casting sharp shadows of the men and aircraft, which contrasts with the brightness of the sky and adds a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of diligent activity, set in a context of agricultural or chemical application, underlined by the practical attire and focused actions of the individuals involved.","title":"Loading zinc poison which will be spread by plane over active squirrel colonies - part of Fresno county farm commission program to protect barley crops","placename":"Fresno County (Calif.)","location":"Fresno County, California","nn1":["542508","542499","542498","556043","555620","554936","549036","542576","553044","542504","542503","553665","542669","554922","557110","554092"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","sack","application","spraie","loading","assist","dusting","pesticide","propeller","tarmac"]}
