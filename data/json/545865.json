{"path":"545865.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a wet surface, likely asphalt, covered in patches of ice and water. The image is textured and shows clear detail of the surface conditions, with small ice particles or possibly frost visible scattered across the area. The color palette is predominantly dark, with gray and black tones showing the wet and icy areas, while the ice particles reflect light, creating bright white specks. The lighting in the photograph suggests that it could either be under an overcast sky or in shaded light, contributing to the cool, subdued colors and the overall somber mood of the image. No people or distinct objects other than the textured surface itself are discernible, emphasizing the natural patterns and the interplay between the frozen and liquid elements on the ground.","title":"Foamy water of Simms Bayou indicates pollution construction of new settling tank, recommended by EPA, has been begun.","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545850","554347","553582","545923","555226","550201","552066","552907","543619","550816","543550","545919","550837","555005","544716","544176"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ice","particle","surface","speck","asphalt","interplay","palette","light","object","pattern"]}
