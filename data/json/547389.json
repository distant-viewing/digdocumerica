{"path":"547389.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a man riding a bicycle down a tree-lined street with a distinctly suburban or small-town vibe. The street is paved with cobblestones or similarly textured material, adding a vintage or classic element to the scene. The man is dressed formally in a dark plaid or tweed suit with a white shirt and tie, which contrasts with the more casual activity of cycling. His expression is focused and slightly serious.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a long street, stretching off into the distance and framed by both vehicles parked on either side and a variety of commercial signs that suggest a busy main street environment. The signs, partially obscured, suggest shops or businesses typical of a mid-20th century American town. Above, the sky appears clear, adding brightness to the scene.\n\nThe composition uses depth of field effectively, with the cyclist sharply in focus and the background softly blurred, highlighting the cyclist and giving a sense of motion towards the viewer. The lighting and the shadows cast on the road suggest it is a sunny day. The trees on the sides dapple the light, creating patches of shadows and highlighting the texture of the road. The scene captures a moment that blends everyday activity with a slightly unusual element of formality given the manâ€™s attire. It evokes a sense of an era gone by, primarily through the attire of the cyclist and the vintage cars in the backdrop.","title":"Associate county court judge, fred burns, on his daily bike ride to the seward county courthouse","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547715","550073","543497","556708","555433","557432","547032","555894","550689","547400","547748","551464","544967","548531","551849","551504"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["cyclist","street","town","formality","cobblestone","dapple","vintage","go","bicycle","attire"]}
