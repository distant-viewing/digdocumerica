{"path":"550715.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial or infrastructural water scene. There is a prominent concrete tunnel, arch-shaped, through which white, frothy water is actively flowing. The tunnel is encased in a concrete structure and is flanked by green foliage which partially obscures and hangs over the edges, blending the industrial with natural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, a rustic and weathered concrete railing, likely part of a small overpass or viewing platform, frames the view of the water outflow. The railing appears old and worn, with visible erosion and patches of lichen or moss, giving a sense of age and disrepair. Three metal bars, possibly part of this railing, horizontally overlap the top third of the photograph, somewhat blurring into the vibrant flow of water beneath.\n\nOverall, the image has an abandoned or neglected feel, emphasizing a coexistence of man-made structures with the relentless persistence of nature slowly reclaiming its territory. The photograph evokes thoughts about the passage of time and the impacts of human infrastructure on natural environments.","title":"Outflow pipe 6 of the Oxford Paper Company will at Rumford on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["551534","550721","552071","544674","550218","547952","556944","553354","555550","549564","558003","547890","550719","552402","544795","553462"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["railing","tunnel","lichen","overpass","third","bar","coexistence","arch","disrepair","water"]}
