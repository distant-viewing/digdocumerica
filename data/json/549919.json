{"path":"549919.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene focused on multiple lanes of traffic. It appears to have been taken during the daytime from an elevated perspective, perhaps a bridge or an overpass.\n\nThe image features an array of vintage cars, mostly from around the 1960s to 1970s, suggesting the photo might be from that era. The cars exhibit a variety of colors, designs, and makes, creating a vibrant tableau of automotive history. Notable vehicles include a pale blue Volkswagen Beetle navigating smoothly through the lanes.\n\nThere are several lanes of traffic in different directions, demarcated by concrete barriers and metal railings that guide the flow of vehicles. A bus is also visible, adding a public transportation element to the scene. Traffic cones and road signs add more layers to the typical urban traffic landscape, indicating road work or lane divisions.\n\nThe backdrop is less distinct, but it shows a mix of commercial signs and part of a building, providing a hint of the city environment beyond the immediate focus on the road. The photograph has a dynamic feel, capturing a moment of everyday transport activity, characteristic of a busy city setting.","title":"Manhattan side of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553019","546370","549857","556724","545463","557230","542684","545884","549903","546716","549679","547369","556194","550139","546730","556729"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["lane","traffic","road","cone","division","tableau","overpass","city","history","daytime"]}
