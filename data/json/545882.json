{"path":"545882.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and atmospheric scene focusing primarily on water, possibly a river or waterfall, cascading forcefully over an inclined, rocky surface. The viewpoint is somewhat close and angled, emphasizing the motion and sheer of the water flowing downward. The image is enriched with a play of light and shadow, lending a texture that almost appears monochromatic but is speckled with highlights where the light catches the streaming water.\n\nIn the background, through a dense spray that mists from the water's impact, trees or bushy vegetation are faintly visible. These plants frame the top part of the image, adding a sense of seclusion and natural wilderness to the scene.\n\nA notable element is the sun, visible as a bright, star-like point through the foliage, casting light directly into and across the water, creating twinkling effects and enhancing the drama of the natural setting. The overall impression is one of rugged beauty, capturing a moment of natural power and the interplay of light within a secluded environment.","title":"Gorman Falls, a pure spring water creek.
