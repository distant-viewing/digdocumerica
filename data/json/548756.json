{"path":"548756.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures a peaceful and slightly eerie outdoor scene. At the center is a lone tree, which appears to be a medium-sized, leafy deciduous tree, possibly in a phase of new leaf growth. The tree casts a long and intricate shadow on the sandy ground, suggesting this photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon when the sun is lower in the sky.\n\nBeside the tree, there is a wooden picnic table, which seems to be weather-worn and aged, indicating it might be frequently used or neglected. The ground around these objects is sandy and sparsely vegetated, which could suggest a dry or deserted location, possibly near a beach or in a semi-arid area.\n\nThe background is vast and open, featuring more sandy soil, sparse vegetation, and a few scattered objects that could be other picnic areas or natural debris. The sky above is dramatic, filled with fluffy, voluminous clouds and subdued hints of blue peeking through. There's a soft, hazy light filtering through the clouds, perhaps filtered by the sun's position behind or near the cloud cover, lending a dreamy quality to the atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition and mood of the photograph are serene and somewhat solitary, emphasizing themes of quiet natural beauty and stillness.","title":"Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key.
