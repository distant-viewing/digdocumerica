{"path":"553992.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a striking sunset over the ocean. The scene is predominantly occupied by dark, rich tones contributing to a dramatic and moody atmosphere. The sun is partially obscured behind dense clouds, breaking through at the crest, which results in a burst of radiant light that illuminates the edges of the clouds.\n\nThese rays of sunlight filter through various gaps in the clouds, creating a stunning light show in yellows and golds against the darker cloud forms. Below, the ocean surface reflects this light, mimicking the pattern and colors of the sky but in a more subdued, fragmented manner due to the rippling water.\n\nThe horizon is relatively straight and positioned near the lower third of the composition, emphasizing the vastness of the sky above. This setup directs the viewer's focus towards the interplay of light and shadow in the clouds and the reflective dance of light on the water.\n\nOverall, the photograph harnesses a sense of serene grandeur, showcasing the natural beauty and dramatic flair of a sunset at sea.","title":"Sunset at manele bay","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["547352","543144","553857","552335","552350","542680","547356","557447","552896","554396","545000","553993","550288","548123","552277","553990"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["cloud","sunset","ocean","mimic","flair","ray","light","harness","burst","dance"]}
