{"path":"543207.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of thrilling adventure and leisure, featuring two individuals riding in a homemade dune buggy, likely on a sandy beach area. The driver, on the right side, appears engaged and joyful, handling a rugged steering mechanism. He wears a simple white t-shirt. The passenger, on the left, is holding tightly to a frame structure, looking forward with an expression mixing excitement and focus, dressed in a dark jacket and blue jeans.\n\nThe dune buggy itself is a makeshift vehicle, primarily composed of bare metal frames and welded parts, equipped with a prominent front engine and smooth, wide tires suitable for sandy terrain. It lacks a conventional body, adding to its rugged, improvised look. Above and slightly behind the driver, a singular circular headlamp is mounted atop the vehicle on a slender, vertical pole, enhancing the buggyâ€™s utilitarian appearance.\n\nThe background is blurry due to motion but shows a broad, open landscape with low vegetation and patches of sand. Sparse buildings can be discerned in the far background, suggesting a secluded or rural beach setting. The horizon is clear, indicating a sunny day with optimal conditions for outdoor activities.\n\nThis image oozes a sense of freedom and the joy of DIY engineering, capturing a spontaneous moment of fun and exploration in a natural setting.","title":"Couple in dune buggy","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["548986","543370","545098","553056","545094","544038","545102","547758","543208","550935","551316","543211","546093","543856","545596","543947"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["driver","improvise","beach","fun","headlamp","dune","freedom","excitement","steering","mechanism"]}
