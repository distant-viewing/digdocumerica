{"path":"546458.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque outdoor corridor covered by a pergola. The pergola, made up of vertical columns and horizontal beams, is adorned with climbing vegetation, adding a touch of greenery and natural beauty to the scene. The path under the pergola is a straight, concrete walkway, lined with grass on both sides, leading towards a brightly painted yellow wall with a door at the end. The sunlight filters through the lattices and foliage overhead, creating a dappled lighting effect on the pathway.\n\nIn the background, one can see a red brick building that appears to match the architectural style of the corridor, suggesting this could be a part of a larger, cohesive property. There are hints of a residential or suburban environment given the calm and manicured look of the surroundings. The lighting suggests it is a bright sunny day, giving the entire setting a vivid and inviting appearance. No people are visible in this shot, promoting a sense of quiet and solitude.","title":"Mabel McDowell Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546454","546559","546450","555350","546505","546464","549360","546510","546457","550275","546517","544285","557782","551263","551104","546460"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["corridor","climbing","lattice","walkway","calm","property","column","shot","end","pathway"]}
