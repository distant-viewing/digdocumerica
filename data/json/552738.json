{"path":"552738.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a large pile of crushed and compressed cars stacked haphazardly on top of each other. The vehicles show a range of colors, predominantly whites, greens, blues, and reds, though many are tarnished and faded. The cars are severely damaged; their structures are bent and the metal exteriors are crumpled due to the force applied to compress them. There are no visible people, nor discernible activities occurring— it is a still image of a junkyard scene. The sharp outlines and various components of the cars—like wheels, bumpers, and partial hoods—are scattered throughout the chaotic stack. The background is relatively nondescript and out of focus, emphasizing the foreground of piled-up cars. The lighting suggests daylight conditions, with clear visibility enhancing the metallic sheen of damaged paint and exposed components. This image documents a scene of automotive waste, presumably at a scrapyard or recycling facility, highlighting the end-of-life stage for these vehicles.","title":"Stacked cars in city junkyard will be used for scrap","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["554348","554352","551517","542656","554320","554311","553006","545303","546172","553005","551547","547476","552739","545545","555492","545365"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","damage","component","stack","compress","apply","pile","junkyard","scrapyard","crumple"]}
