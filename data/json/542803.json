{"path":"542803.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents a vibrant street scene featuring several elements of mid-20th-century life. Central to the image is an old-fashioned pickup truck, painted in a weathered grey that shows considerable usage. The truck is in motion, crossing the frame from left to right, with a driver visible through the window, who appears focused on the road.\n\nBehind the truck, a commercial building housing \"Feed Nilsen Co. Seed\" is prominently displayed. The storefront, characterized by large pane windows and a simple rectangular design, showcases various items that suggest its purpose as a supplier of seeds and possibly other agricultural or gardening needs. Inside, numerous items can be seen lined up against the window such as glass jars and other containers, likely containing different types of seeds. The exterior of the store includes typical retail adornments of the period, such as a styled awning and decorative white trimming along the roof line, which add a quaint appeal to the setting.\n\nFurther adding to the scene's ambiance are the reflections visible in the store windows and the clear, diffuse lighting, suggesting a bright day, which helps in highlighting the details of the car and the store's interior through the glass.\n\nOverall, the composition cleverly captures a moment of everyday life, likely in a small town, emphasizing themes of commerce and transportation from a bygone era. The scene also subtly conveys a sense of motion and busyness, as indicated by the moving truck and the elaborate display within the store, creating a snapshot of the era's economic activity.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544329","549866","545333","548275","543173","550138","557705","550128","546376","556714","545614","546440","551070","556986","545216","557155"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["store","truck","seed","window","trimming","busyness","jar","motion","era","item"]}
