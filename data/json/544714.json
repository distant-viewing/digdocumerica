{"path":"544714.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure engaged in fishing within a large body of water, presumably a sea or lake. The person, likely male, is clad in a dark wet suit and is partially submerged in choppy brownish waters, with waves around him. He wears a dark-colored helmet or cap on his head and is in the process of casting a fishing line into the water using a fishing rod. The person's posture indicates a moment of activity, as his arms are extended in an effort to maneuver the fishing rod.\n\nThe background features a serene and hazy landscape with mountain silhouettes, suggesting the distance from which the photograph was taken or the vastness of the setting. The water's surface is textured with ripples and waves that reflect sunlight, creating a sparkling effect. The overall lighting conditions of the photo suggest it might be taken during late afternoon or early morning, giving the scene a soft, warm ambiance.\n\nThe composition of the photograph uses natural lighting, and the focus on the fisherman against the vast, dynamic backdrop of the water and distant mountains creates a sense of isolation and tranquility. This image might evoke themes of solitude, nature, and the pursuit of leisure through fishing.","title":"Surf-casting.
