{"path":"544082.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a city at sunset, characterized by a distinctly reddish-orange glow over the landscape. The cityscape consists of closely packed buildings, many of which are low-rise residential structures and a few larger commercial or public buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, a large, multi-storied building with a flat roof and numerous windows suggests a public or commercial property. Beyond this foreground structure, the city extends into the middle distance where numerous homes and buildings of varying sizes and shapes can be seen sprawling across the undulating terrain.\n\nThe background features hills or short mountains, providing a natural undulating skyline against the sunset. Several buildings are located on these elevated areas, standing out due to their positioning and size, seeming somewhat more affluent or important.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a densely populated urban area nestled in a hilly or mountainous region under a dramatic, colorful sky that suggests the end of the day. The light conditions and the red hue suggest the photograph might have been taken with a specific filter or during a unique lighting condition, enhancing the moody, warm aesthetic.","title":"Dust storm blankets Phoenix on labor day 1972.
