{"path":"550362.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph presents a serene coastal scene, characterized by a striking rocky shoreline and the calming expanse of a body of water, possibly the sea. The foreground shows jagged rocks covered in patches of green moss and lichen, leading into a small, smooth pebble beach that edges into gently rippling water. The calm water reflects a soft light, suggesting a cloudy or overcast sky.\n\nDominating the right side of the image is a headland adorned with a picturesque lighthouse. The lighthouse is painted in vivid red and white, typical for a maritime navigation aid, and it stands tall on the rocky cliff, surrounded by scattered evergreen trees that suggest a resilient, perhaps even harsh, environment.\n\nFarther out to sea, small rock formations emerge from the water surface, adding texture and depth to the seascape. These formations likely provide habitats for various marine life. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat isolated, conveying a sense of seclusion and the timeless watchfulness of the lighthouse over the water.","title":"Lighthouse on Campobello Island, looking north toward shipping channel.
