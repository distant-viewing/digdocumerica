{"path":"548252.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man focused on his work, seated inside what appears to be a workshop filled with various items. He is wearing thick-rimmed glasses and a multicolored striped button-up shirt. The man is concentrating intently, looking down at something in his hands which isnâ€™t clearly visible due to the angle. His expression is one of deep focus and consideration.\n\nThe environment around him is cluttered and suggests a setting used for practical tasks or repairs. There are hints of objects and tools in the blurred background, implying a workspace that is likely used regularly, filled with numerous items necessary for his tasks.\n\nThe lighting is soft yet ample, illuminating the man and the immediate surroundings without harshness, contributing to the intimate and candid feel of the scene. The overall mood conveys a sense of quiet dedication and expertise in his craft.","title":"Gene (\"Shorty\") Lesch, Rockport's pewtersmith and harbormaster, works in his shop in the Bearskin Neck section of Rockport.","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["558356","555533","548231","547427","548455","542664","547366","557678","555297","547353","555532","555430","556563","546291","558324","545986"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["expertise","consideration","dedication","harshness","task","item","craft","repair","workshop","workspace"]}
