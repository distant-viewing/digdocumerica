{"path":"553133.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor scene likely from a crowded camping area or a gathering at a picturesque lakeside location. The foreground is filled with a variety of parked vehicles, including cars, trucks, and camper vans, many of which appear to be from the mid to late 20th century given their designs and colors. The vehicles are densely arranged on a grassy area, facing towards the water.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features a large, tranquil body of water that reflects the light of what seems to be a setting or rising sun, suggesting it's either early morning or late evening. Beyond the water, there are imposing mountains that rise steeply. These mountains have rugged textures and are shadowed in places, while other parts are highlighted by the sunlight, enhancing their dramatic contours.\n\nThe overall composition offers a snapshot of leisure and recreation, possibly during a weekend or a holiday, with people likely engaging in activities such as camping, fishing, boating, or simply enjoying a getaway in a natural setting. The image has a peaceful yet vibrant atmosphere, underpinned by the beauty of the natural environment and the communal sense of an outing.","title":"Pyramid Lake beach on Memorial Day weekend","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["548748","544389","554683","544006","542746","554485","548795","544002","547773","542747","548796","548668","548002","544442","548802","545293"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["camping","holiday","camper","boating","mountain","lakeside","van","recreation","outing","vehicle"]}
