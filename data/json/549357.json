{"path":"549357.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene in a wooded area. The central focus of the image is a bright yellow and red sign mounted on a pole that reads \"OZRAČENA ZONA PRISTUP ZABRANJEN,” which translates to \"Radiation Zone Access Prohibited\" in English. This warning presence is emphasized by two additional yellow warning signs hanging from the tree branches nearby; each sign displays a radiation hazard symbol (three black fan-shaped blades on a yellow background).\n\nThe surrounding environment consists of a grassy, somewhat uneven terrain dotted with trees, largely covered in green foliage, adding a contrasting natural backdrop to the stark and warning symbols depicted by the signs. No people are visible in the photograph, underscoring the area's restricted and likely dangerous nature.\n\nIn the background, beyond the trees, there appears to be a white building, partially obscured by the tree line, suggesting that this zone might be located near a facility or developed area despite its natural and untended foreground. The colors in the photograph are slightly faded, which along with the context and style of the signage, suggests the photo could be of some historical interest or taken several years ago.","title":"Radiation warning sign at the Ruder Boskovic Institute's cyclotron.","placename":"Zagreb (Croatia)","location":"Zagreb, Croatia","nn1":["543645","548951","548865","546240","556617","553905","549129","547123","554103","557412","548063","555858","546386","555382","557474","544227"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["warning","symbol","sign","fan","hazard","blade","tree","year","interest","signage"]}
