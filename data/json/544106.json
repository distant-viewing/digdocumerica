{"path":"544106.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph shows a large, rugged open-pit mine with multiple layers and terraced benches, suggesting it might be a quarry or a mining site of some sort. The terrain has varying shades of brown and reddish-brown, indicative of iron-rich soil or possibly areas with exposure to oxidation processes.\n\nDistinct horizontal layers are visible, with each layer presenting a different texture and color, ranging from crumbly dark browns to harder, more compacted reddish hues. The size and scale of the mining operation are highlighted by tiny figures visible in the middle section of the image, giving a sense of the vastness of this site.\n\nNo machinery is clearly visible in this part of the mine; however, there appear to be some piles of mined material and possibly small paths or roads carved into the benches, used for accessing different levels of the excavation.\n\nThe photograph conveys an environment of harsh and arid conditions, likely exposed to elements with minimal vegetation or water sources present. These are typical characteristics found in areas utilized for large-scale mining operations, which are often located in geologically rich but environmentally challenging landscapes.","title":"Phelps dodge corp.'
