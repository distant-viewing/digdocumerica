{"path":"548594.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a long, straight road cutting through a dense, verdant forest. The image captures a dramatic scene where parts of the forest near the road are engulfed in thick smoke, indicating a wildfire or controlled burn. The road bisects the frame vertically, and the smoke creates a soft, hazy atmosphere that partially obscures the trees. The smoke's grey and white hues contrast sharply with the dark green tones of the untouched forest areas.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is lush and overgrown, suggesting a remote or less developed area. The aerial perspective provides a broad view of the forest's expanse, emphasizing the scale of the forest and the impact of the smoke. Wispy clouds are visible in the mostly clear sky above, hinting at fair weather conditions despite the fire-related activity below. The composition and the elements within it suggest themes of human influence on natural environments and the dynamic changes wrought by such interactions.","title":"Smoke from forest fire drifts across drainage canal cut through everglades in collier county.
