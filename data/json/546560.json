{"path":"546560.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a spacious library setting. In the center of the image, there is a lone individual seated at a rounded table working intently, possibly reading or studying from the materials spread out before them. This table is surrounded by tall, densely stocked bookshelves full of books, indicating a well-endowed library collection. The shelves in the foreground contain books that are more visibly accessible, while more shelves can be seen extending into the background, enriched with an array of books.\n\nThe library's architectural features include a high ceiling with a distinct, geometric industrial design of beams, which adds to the large and open feel of the space. Dimly lit light fixtures specifically illuminate the area above the person at the table, drawing attention to their activity.\n\nDarker tones dominate the scene, with the brick walls and dark shelves creating a contrastive ambiance, emphasizing solitude and focus within the library. The carpet and some seating areas are also visible, all contributing to a studious and quiet environment. The overall composition skillfully combines elements of architecture, library science, and human presence, encapsulating a moment of solitary academic pursuit.","title":"Open stack area, Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["549361","549337","546553","546549","552592","546500","553763","546511","546564","553535","546561","552647","546478","555316","546526","546519"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["library","shelf","book","table","bookshelf","science","stock","pursuit","carpet","fixture"]}
