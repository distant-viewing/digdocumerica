{"path":"550559.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph offers an expansive aerial view of a lush, forested landscape with a prominent river meandering through it. The river, noted for its wide and serpentine path, displays a light brown or muddy color that contrasts starkly against the dense greenery of the surrounding terrain. The forest consists predominantly of coniferous trees, presenting various shades of dark green that suggest a dense and rich vegetation cover.\n\nThe landscape encapsulates various undulations and clearings, indicating natural variations in the terrain, which may involve hills or small valleys. There are no visible man-made structures or signs of human disturbance, which suggests the location might be in a relatively remote or untouched natural area.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears to be soft and diffuse, possibly due to overcast weather, which casts an even but moody light over the entire scene, enhancing the monotones of the greens and the brown river. There are no people or animals visible in the shot, highlighting the solitude and untouched nature of the landscape. The overarching perspective and lack of visible boundaries suggest the vastness of the area and the isolation from urban or developed environments.","title":"The Yukon crossing.
