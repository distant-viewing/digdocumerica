{"path":"555843.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image features a dark blue, nearly black background filled with various small, glowing orange and yellow shapes scattered throughout the composition. These shapes vary in size and intensity, suggesting they are at different distances or of different natures. Some of them show undefined, flame-like edges while others are more solid and orb-like. There appears to be a lack of symmetry or pattern, giving the shapes a random, almost chaotic placement against the dark backdrop. The overall impression is reminiscent of celestial or microscopic phenomena, capturing a somewhat ethereal or otherworldly feel. The image evokes a sense of mystery, as the precise nature and origin of these glowing entities are not immediately clear. It might be interpreted as anything from an abstract representation of space, stars, or distant galaxies to a microscopic view of organisms or chemical reactions.","title":"Olisthodiscus luteus, one of the organisms which causes red tide, photographed at the Atlantic Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.
