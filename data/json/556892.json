{"path":"556892.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene focused on a person operating heavy machinery on a railroad. The setting is outdoors during a bright, sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a complex assembly of mechanical components, likely part of a railroad maintenance machine. These parts are made up of hydraulic hoses, metal levers, and other rugged, metallic structures, some of which are rusted, showing signs of wear and use. The ground is covered in gravel stones typical of a railroad track setting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, parts of the railroad tracks are visible, reinforcing the context of the setting. Positioned near the center and to the right, a person in work attire, a blue denim shirt, and jeans, is seated or standing (not entirely clear due to the angle) on the machinery. This individual is engaged in operating the machine, focusing on adjusting or handling the controls, which are not distinctly visible.\n\nIn the background, part of the machinery extends upwards, forming a framework around the operator, with parts resembling a platform or protective housing, topped with a roof. The roof of the structure is a faded red hue, matching with the primary color theme of the machinery.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, indicating fair weather conditions, which contribute to the vivid colors and shadows depicted in the scene. The overall composition highlights a moment of manual labor and machine operation within the railroad maintenance industry.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way machinery, used to improve the roadbed. In 1974 the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in track maintenance, the highest in the industry. That year Southern laid 91,808 tons of rail and placed 2,278,318 railroad ties. The maximum safe speed on the company's track is usually 60 miles per hour for the entire 10,531 miles of the system. In comparison, another company has a maximum of eight miles per hour on one of its sections.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556865","556891","556901","556861","556883","556875","556885","556887","556874","556866","556899","556872","556890","556862","556860","556871"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["railroad","machine","machinery","part","maintenance","track","lever","operator","assembly","hose"]}
