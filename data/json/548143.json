{"path":"548143.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed landscape featuring a broad body of water with a developed shoreline. The scene includes a highway that closely hugs the coastline, bending gently around the contours. On this highway, a long vehicle—possibly a bus or a trailer truck—can be seen traveling along. Below the highway, separated by a narrow strip of land, is a railway track paralleling the road, but it approaches the composition at a slightly different angle due to the curve of the land.\n\nTo the left, the shoreline is edged with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation, indicating a rugged environment. A sliver of a sandy beach separates the darker blue water from the greener land areas. The backdrop is dominated by hills or mountainous regions on the opposite side of the water, showcasing different tones of green and brown, suggesting varied vegetation or possibly seasonal changes. The sky is bright and clear blue, possibly indicating a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a tranquil yet dynamic environment where transportation routes integrate closely with the natural landscape, presenting a harmony between human-built infrastructure and natural beauty. The perspective suggests that the image was taken from an elevated vantage point, giving a broad overview of the scenic geography.","title":"Columbia River Gorge between The Dalles and the Hood River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548144","545104","557465","545918","549504","550600","549527","548178","550613","543435","556905","555861","557503","556935","553774","548129"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["highway","separate","land","shoreline","geography","hug","harmony","overview","parallel","approach"]}
