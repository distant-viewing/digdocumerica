{"path":"556034.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an interior scene of a bus filled with passengers. In the foreground, an elderly couple is seated side by side. The man, positioned on the right, is focused on reading a book held in both hands. He has grey hair, is wearing a dark short-sleeve shirt with a checkered pattern and a dark watch on his left wrist. The woman on the left wears glasses and a patterned blouse; she appears to be slightly turned towards the man, observing what he is reading.\n\nThe seats in the bus are equipped with patterned upholstery, predominantly visible as pink with floral designs. Overhead compartments can be seen above the passengers, reflecting the typical layout of a long-distance travel bus. The interior lighting casts a slightly dim ambiance throughout the cabin.\n\nFurther back in the bus, other passengers are visible, seated facing forward. They appear to be variously engaged, with some passengers conversing, and others also focused on reading. The focus and depth of field of the image blur the details of these individuals slightly, emphasizing the elderly couple in the foreground. The general atmosphere evoked is one of calm and quiet travel, with passengers settled in for their journey.","title":"Couple discuss their plans in a passenger car on the Lone Star as it crosses Oklahoma enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas.
