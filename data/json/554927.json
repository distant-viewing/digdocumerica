{"path":"554927.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rooster standing in a rustic setting. The landscape is somewhat barren, with sparse straw-like vegetation covering the ground. In the background, there are walls made of different materials and colors, including silver corrugated metal and faded blue and gray wooden planks. This makeshift barrier constructs a somewhat shabby, textured backdrop that conveys a sense of rural life or an outdoor space in a farm-like environment.\n\nThe rooster itself boasts vivid plumage with a predominance of rich black feathers and a striking red comb atop its head. Its presence and pose suggest it might be stepping or moving slightly, lending a dynamic element to the otherwise still and serene environment. The lighting appears quite natural, overcast or in the shade, casting even light across the scene and emphasizing the details of the rooster and the textured backdrop. The combination of colors and elements in this photo evokes a raw, rustic charm characteristic of a rural or farm setting.","title":"Gamecock on a farm in the Leakey, Texas, area, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554914","554947","554946","551326","549115","543117","547043","551081","553777","547039","544547","546068","544484","554917","555609","547394"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["farm","comb","boast","plumage","feather","straw","characteristic","combination","plank","charm"]}
