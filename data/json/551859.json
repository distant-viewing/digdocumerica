{"path":"551859.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"In this photograph, a couple is seen sitting across from each other on large, rounded stone boulders. The setting appears to be outdoors and possibly by a waterfront given the bright glare and the hint of water shimmer at the backdrop.\n\nThe man is dressed in a plaid long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, while the woman is wearing a striped, long-sleeve top and a black skirt. Both individuals are casually dressed indicative of a relaxed setting, and they are holding hands, which suggests an intimate or close relationship.\n\nAbove the couple, floating in mid-air is a bird, possibly a seagull, which adds a lively dynamic to the otherwise serene scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is bright, likely indicating that this image was taken during daytime. The overexposed light reflecting from the water in the background creates a striking contrast with the subjects in the foreground, giving the image a washed-out and dreamlike quality.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a candid, peaceful moment between two individuals, possibly enjoying a warm, sunny day by the water.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
