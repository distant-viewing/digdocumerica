{"path":"545054.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dramatic moment during sunset at sea. In the image, the ocean is depicted with a rich texture and the water reflects the colors of dusk, featuring hues of deep purple and orange. The focus of the shot is on two individuals lifting a large, intricate fishing net from the water. They appear as silhouettes due to the backlighting of the setting sun, which highlights their actions but obscures their features and details.\n\nThe individuals are partly visible; one seems to be leaning over the side of a small boat, grabbing the net, while the other assists by pulling the net aboard, showcasing a coordinated effort in their task. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the vastness of the ocean and the sky, providing a sense of isolation and the magnitude of nature compared to the human activity.\n\nThe sky in the background is softly lit with the fading light, suggesting that the sun has just dipped below the horizon. There is no land in sight, just the open water, which amplifies the feeling of being in a vast, open space. The overall mood of the image is one of peacefulness mixed with the hard work of fishing, captured beautifully through the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Gill net fishing on the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545055","550296","547555","554147","552224","543411","544251","547549","547552","552309","550303","543143","543956","547556","545030","552124"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","fishing","ocean","grab","magnitude","dip","sun","amplify","backlighting","sight"]}
