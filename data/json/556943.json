{"path":"556943.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, natural landscape. In the foreground, a dirt road with prominent wheel tracks winds to the left, leading your eye toward a watery horizon. On the right side of the road, a sign reading \"GAME PRESERVE NO HUNTING\" is propped up among dense shrubbery and foliage, sending a clear conservation message.\n\nTo the left of the dirt road, there's a white, unadorned utility building which peeks into the frame. This structure contrasts with the natural, rugged charm of the setting.\n\nThe background features a large body of water that spans the middle ground, blending into a grey, mist-shrouded sky that gives the scene a somber tone. Barren, leafless trees on either side frame this view, enhancing the sense of a deserted, wild landscape.\n\nThe overall composition and the overcast sky contribute to a quiet, tranquil, yet slightly somber mood in the photograph. The image juxtaposes human elements such as the road and the small building against the natural beauty and wilderness of the waterside area, highlighted by the conservationist sign.","title":"The shore access to the proposed Trident submarine base drydock and refit facility at the Navy's Bangor annex will be located at this roadway which created Hunter's Marsh, an ex-estaurine environment. The marsh presently is a game preserve for hunting and fishing by government employees.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["548248","544116","543104","547659","550598","545109","552076","550345","544598","554717","544245","552521","545213","555881","556985","554803"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["road","hunting","dirt","game","shrubbery","conservation","message","charm","wheel","grey"]}
