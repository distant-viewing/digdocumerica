{"path":"547879.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of four young people near an old, weathered boat on a broad, sandy beach. The boat, primarily red with peeling paint and visible wear, sits partially in shallow water on the wet sand. Two of the individuals are seated inside the boat: the one on the left is dark-haired, wearing a light gray sweater and jeans, smiling and looking towards the camera, while the other, also smiling and light-haired, is dressed in a red shirt with a dark jacket over it and jeans. The other two, both standing outside the boat to the right, include a person with medium-length dark hair wearing a red t-shirt and black pants, and another with curly brown hair in a blue striped shirt and blue jeans. They both exhibit playful expressions, contributing to the overall casual and joyful atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, the beach stretches widely into the distance with very little visible vegetation or dunes, suggesting a flat coastal area. Far off in the horizon, you can see the silhouette of a city skyline with tall buildings, subtly contrasting with the natural scene. The sky is mostly clear with scattered clouds, suggesting a fair weather day ideal for outdoor activities. This setting and the interactions capture a candid moment of leisure and informal camaraderie among the group.","title":"Plum beach, sheepshead bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543944","547189","544185","549373","544269","549410","547009","546397","552150","552945","554199","551310","545961","549415","551309","543943"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","jeans","hair","smile","beach","far","peeling","dune","medium","camaraderie"]}
