{"path":"542727.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene camping scene set in a forested area. In the foreground, a young boy dressed in a plaid jacket and jeans is sitting on a folding chair next to a campfire grill. Facing him, a woman (possibly his mother) is also seated in a folding chair, wearing a yellow jacket and jeans, actively engaging with the boy and holding a stick, likely used for roasting. There's a sense of relaxation and leisure in their activities.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a picnic table covered with a checkered tablecloth, typical of outdoor settings, suggesting they might have had a meal or are planning one. Various camping gear, including what appears to be a cooler and some pots, are scattered around the site.\n\nIn the background, other campers can be seen in this forested area. There are several vehicles and a camper van, indicating this is a well-used campsite. Large, mature trees dominate the landscape, providing ample shade and contributing to the tranquil woodland atmosphere.\n\nThe composition of this photograph, with its casual yet intimate focus on the interaction between the boy and the woman by the campfire, alongside the broader camping scene, effectively conveys a feeling of familial bonding and the enjoyment of nature.","title":"Azalea camp ground at dawn","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["544855","554863","545497","545500","544387","542726","551314","550977","554479","548796","557933","548748","554513","545228","549450","554181"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["camping","campfire","camper","boy","chair","bonding","folding","jean","mother","tablecloth"]}
