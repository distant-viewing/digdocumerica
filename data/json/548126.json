{"path":"548126.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image depicts a maritime scene at a dock. It captures a large commercial ship, identified as the \"Sea Hawk,\" moored by thick ropes attached to a wharf. The perspective is from the waterfront looking outwards, with the ropes leading from the foreground to the ship, giving a sense of depth and direction.\n\nThe ship itself is substantial with a predominantly black hull and a name visibly painted in white letters near the bow. Its deck structures and masts rise against a comparatively clear sky with a few clouds. This ship displays features typical of freighter vessels, which are used for transporting goods over water.\n\nIn the background, another part of the port is visible, including industrial buildings, a large metal framework possibly related to loading operations, and storage tanks. The water by the dock appears calm, and the lighting suggests it is daylight with good visibility. The overall setting is industrial, focused on maritime commerce and the docking facilities that support such operations. The scene lacks any visible human activity, creating a static yet compelling image of industrial maritime environment.","title":"Logs are loaded aboard freighter at the Columbia River mouth for export to Japan.","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["548127","551581","553740","544657","546934","552244","547619","551558","547474","546828","546804","548125","551990","550944","545845","552008"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","rope","dock","docking","operation","mast","commerce","maritime","bow","port"]}
