{"path":"557687.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a loading dock during what appears to be a sunny day. The scene is set outside a red and white building, possibly a market or grocery store. In the foreground, a man is actively engaged in moving boxes from a pile which are likely delivered goods. He is leaning over, pulling a heavy box from a stack that sits on a wooden pallet. The boxes are variously labeled, possibly indicating different types of goods, and some are marked with the logo \"Piece of Cake.\" \n\nTo the right of the man, under an overhang or covered portion of the dock, another man is visible. He is wearing a light-colored shirt and is seated, somewhat obscured in the shadows, facing slightly away from the camera.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate area of the loading dock, there is a view of a street scene. Visible are several parked and moving cars, suggesting a moderately busy area. The architecture of the buildings in this street scene includes red roofs and white walls, which together with the autos gives a vintage feel to the surroundings, reminiscent of mid-20th century American town landscapes.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its rich, dynamic range of colors and shadow interplay, captures a moment of everyday work and ordinary life, highlighting the activity and environment of a working day.","title":"Bi-weekly (Saturday morning) delivery of supplies to Brown's Grocery and Service Station in Helen, Georgia, comes from nearby Cornelia.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557110","553732","549850","547075","546881","554936","546796","556043","546910","546917","546918","549867","542866","542857","549084","546762"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["box","loading","dock","good","auto","grocery","pallet","deliver","move","overhang"]}
