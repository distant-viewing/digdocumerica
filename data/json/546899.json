{"path":"546899.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a tranquil industrial or treatment facility scene, primarily dominated by watery landscapes and structural elements. The chief subject is a large pool of water which has partially frozen over, showing distinct patches of ice forming near the edges. A thin cover of snow appears to dust much of the visible surfaces.\n\nTowards the center, extending into the body of water, is a concrete or stone path that gradually descends beneath the water's surface, suggesting perhaps a submerged walkway or overflow structure. Around and parallel to this path is a narrow metal railing, now partly swallowed by the icy water, emphasizing the chilly conditions.\n\nOn the right side, reaching across the pool, is a bridge constructed of metal, with long, thin beams holding up a simple pathway which might facilitate access across the water. This bridge, with its reflection subtly visible on the water's surface, provides a functional yet scenic element to the scene.\n\nFurther back and to the left, there is a building, appearing utilitarian with its flat roof and broad, unembellished facade. The presence of transmission poles and trees around this building help to situate the facility in a less urbanized setting, possibly on the outskirts of a town or within a specially designated area due to its industrial or utility function.\n\nThe skies are overcast, casting a cool, muted light over the scene, enhancing the wintry feel of the environment. The overall mood is serene, slightly melancholic, and distinctly cold, possibly captured during the early winter months.","title":"Settling tank at the Back River sewage treatment plant","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["543524","556944","550201","547890","543550","549635","545167","547519","542526","543809","552213","543568","542979","552040","550368","545919"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pool","water","bridge","freeze","path","month","overflow","transmission","designate","surface"]}
