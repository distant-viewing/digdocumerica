{"path":"545427.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures the industrial setting of a steel manufacturing facility. The primary focus of the image is the Fairfield Works of the United States Steel Corporation, prominently labeled on a large, dark building facade. The sign includes the \"USS\" logo, emphasizing the corporate identity.\n\nIn the foreground, the entrance to the facility is visible, marked by a smaller sign reading \"Sheet Products Entrance No. 1\", mounted over a gate that appears closed. This entrance is characterized by a series of vertical and horizontal lines formed by the structure's architecture and the fencing, with a barred gate leading to the interior.\n\nDark, voluminous clouds of smoke billow from tall stacks in the background, suggesting ongoing heavy industrial operations. These clouds dominate the upper section of the image, implying environmental impact concerns typical of such facilities. The sky is dimly lit, evoking either dawn or dusk, contributing to the somewhat somber ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe overall color tone is dark with muted hues, reflecting the industrial nature of the scene and possibly the air quality concerns due to the smoke emissions. There appears to be no human activity visible in the photograph, which might indicate the picture was taken during a non-operational period or from a distance where such details are not easily discernible.","title":"Fairfield plant of U.S. Steel","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545477","545445","557215","549967","546884","546827","547097","549966","546769","547069","550195","547048","550344","546882","545434","557216"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["gate","concern","entrance","facility","identity","smoke","fencing","cloud","emission","manufacturing"]}
