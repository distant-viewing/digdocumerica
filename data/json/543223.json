{"path":"543223.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a scene set in what appears to be a historical or theme park setting, emulating an old western town. The main structure in the image is the \"Roaring Camp General Store,\" a two-story wooden building painted in a light taupe with dark brown trim. The store's façade is adorned with a prominent red sign with white lettering that reads \"ROARING CAMP GENERAL STORE.\"\n\nIn front of the General Store, there is a wooden porch where four elderly individuals are seated on a bench, seemingly enjoying a leisurely conversation or simply observing the activities around them. They are casually dressed, suggesting a relaxed, tourist-like environment.\n\nTo the right of the General Store, there is another wooden structure, also styled in a similar old-west fashion, with signs and other decorative elements that contribute to the theme. People are visible in this area, walking and engaging with the setting, adding a dynamic human element to the composition.\n\nThe setting is completed by large trees in the background that suggest the location might be in a wooded or forested area. The sky is clear with a vibrant blue color, indicating good weather, which contributes to the overall cheerful and inviting atmosphere of the scene.","title":"General store","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543365","554456","543356","549019","551116","554699","555377","546131","548242","544882","548625","543239","557654","556368","557947","550679"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["theme","tourist","trim","façade","store","lettering","bench","fashion","porch","sign"]}
