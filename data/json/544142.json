{"path":"544142.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph illustrates a vivid natural landscape, centered around a body of deep blue water. A motorboat is seen traversing the water, leaving a white wake in its trail, which creates a contrast with the deep blue hue of the water. The boat is a small, possibly recreational type, with visible figures on board.\n\nThe surroundings are characterized by rugged, rocky cliffs with a reddish-brown color, suggesting an arid, possibly desert environment. The cliffs rise steeply from the water's edge, showing significant geological layer formations and erosions that offer a textured appearance to the scene. \n\nThe lighting is bright, indicating a sunny day, and this adds a gleam to the water's surface as well as highlights the intricate details of the rocky cliffs. There are no visible plants or greenery, reinforcing the arid setting. The sky is not visible in the image, focusing all attention on the contrast between the water and the dry, rocky cliffs surrounding it.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a moment of activity and the beauty of a stark, natural landscape, emphasizing the vast, open space and the interaction of human activity with nature.","title":"Motorboating on lake powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["552921","544125","544383","555693","548919","546317","549458","549066","547685","555694","555710","555703","544749","555701","545043","555704"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["cliff","water","gleam","traverse","motorboat","reddish","wake","trail","arid","board"]}
