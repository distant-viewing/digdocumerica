{"path":"558050.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image is an aerial view capturing a scenic landscape consisting of multiple layers of transportation and natural elements. The photograph predominantly features two parallel bridges that stretch horizontally across the frame. These bridges are large, elevated structures with concrete supports, and they span over a wide, meandering river lined with dense trees.\n\nBelow the bridges runs a curving road, visible at the lower edge of the image, flanked on either side by trees and patches of grass. Adjacent to the curving road on the right-hand side, there is a row of houses with visible rooftops, suggesting a residential area nestled in this lush setting.\n\nThe river, which appears to separate two distinct land areas, reflects some light, indicating a flow or slight ripples on the surface. The vegetative landscape encompasses a blend of dense tree coverage and open areas, presenting varying shades of green. In the background, beyond the river and the bridges, there are extensive fields, divided by hedgerows or fences, which add texture and pattern to the rural scenery. These fields are likely agricultural, given their orderly appearance and clear delineation.\n\nThe overall composition is rich in natural beauty and presents a harmonious integration of infrastructure within a rural setting, offering both a functional perspective with the bridges and roads, and a tranquil, natural environment.","title":"Aerial view of the Ohio Turnpike at Riverview Road south of Cleveland, Ohio. The highway crosses the Cuyahoga Valley and river as well as railroad tracks used by the Chessie System. The valley is part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area signed into law in December, 1974. The National Park Service must complete a master plan for the area by June, 1976. The law allows for expenditure of $34.5 million for land acquisition, but it must be appropriated by Congress.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558051","558048","558049","549469","553663","558042","558043","546588","548097","547263","555727","548087","550624","546625","548427","548019"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["bridge","delineation","river","road","integration","coverage","rooftop","field","support","scenery"]}
