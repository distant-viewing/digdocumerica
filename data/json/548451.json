{"path":"548451.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man holding two small printed photographs in his hands. The man wears silver-rimmed glasses and smokes a cigar, which he holds in his mouth. He is dressed in a plaid, short-sleeved shirt and appears to be sitting outdoors. The background of the image shows a large, industrial-looking vehicle, possibly a harvester or a dump truck, behind a chain-link fence, suggesting the setting could be near a farm or industrial site.\n\nThe photographs that the man holds each capture different scenes. One photo shows a tree in what looks like a park setting with a woman standing beneath the tree. The other photo depicts a child, likely taken near a road or a paved path with subtle hues of greenery around.\n\nThe image is shot in natural lighting, further supported by the soft, diffused light and a somewhat cloudy sky visible in the background. This setup conveys a sense of personal history or memory being shared by the man, emphasized by his direct and engaged expression towards the camera while showcasing the smaller photos.","title":"Matthew vieira stands in the very place where, some thirty-five years ago, he took these pictures of his children.
