{"path":"545951.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a person standing on the wooden stoop of what appears to be a rustic, outdoor shack or small storefront. The person is dressed in an apron and gloves, indicative of manual or food preparation work, and is holding a large fish in one hand, suggesting that this might be a fish market or processing area.\n\nThe shack has a slanted, corrugated metal roof and is constructed from various materials, showing signs of wear and practical use rather than aesthetic design. To the left of the photograph, there is a wooden post supporting the roof, and various objects are scattered around the stoop, including burlap sacks, buckets, a shovel, and an overturned basket.\n\nAbove the person, under the shelter of the roof, there are hanging signs advertising different seafoods for saleâ€”such as \"crab,\" \"shrimp,\" and other items barely visible due to the photo's resolution and lighting. The background is dimly lit and includes tree trunks and hanging vegetation, possibly Spanish moss, which could suggest a Southern U.S. setting. Overall, the scene captures a moment of everyday life in a seafood handling or small retail operation, set against a backdrop of a lush, natural environment.","title":"Young employee at seafood market.
