{"path":"547148.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an older man and a fluffy white dog on a beach. The man, dressed elegantly in a light gray trench coat, dark trousers, dress shoes, and a fedora hat, is filming with a vintage handheld camera. He appears focused and serious about his task, holding the camera to his eye and looking through the viewfinder.\n\nThe white dog standing beside him looks alert yet calm, facing the same direction as the man but slightly turned towards the camera. Its fur is noticeably fluffy and slightly windblown, which suggests a breezy environment.\n\nThe background shows a calm sea with gentle waves, under a clear blue sky. There's no one else in the immediate vicinity, giving the scene a private, serene atmosphere. The elements in the image, including the classic attire of the man and the timeless setting, give this photograph a nostalgic and evocative feel.","title":"Man films gale-whipped waves of Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547100","553089","543500","542874","556421","554951","553481","550924","548695","549112","543394","549928","556529","556549","543395","554126"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","camera","fedora","trench","man","fur","film","vicinity","one","shoe"]}
