{"path":"557065.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph depicts a stately brick house featuring distinctive architectural details. The house is primarily red brick with white trim. In the front, there is an elegant entrance framed by an arch-covered porch that features rounded and arched openings. The porch is supported by columns, and access is provided via a stairway with stone balustrades on each side, leading up to a pair of dark-colored doors. Above the entrance, the gable is ornamented with a decorative wooden trim and a small, circular window set into a triangular pediment. To the right of the entrance, large windows with white frames and decorative headers are visible. The facade shows intricate brickwork including horizontal banding and patterns.\n\nThe house is surrounded by a well-manicured lawn and bordered by a hedge, beyond which a quiet, residential type street might be inferred, suggested by the tranquil atmosphere and mature trees visible in the background. The overall aesthetic is one of traditional elegance, reflecting a serene suburban or possibly historic neighborhood setting. The image captures the essence of classic architectural beauty, well-maintained and showcasing an inviting, warm exterior.","title":"Restoration of a late 19th century example of Victorian architecture in Atchison, Kansas.
