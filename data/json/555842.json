{"path":"555842.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The image features an array of small, brightly colored specks against a deep blue background. These specks vary in size and exhibit different hues, including yellows, pinks, and greens, with some having a slight iridescence. These are somewhat reminiscent of tiny cellular structures or microscopic organisms viewed under high magnification. The varied intensity and distribution of light on these specks suggest a depth within the image, creating a somewhat 3D effect. The overall composition showcases a multitude of these particles spread randomly across the field of view, with a couple of larger, more detailed specks that draw the eye. The larger specks have defined borders and a more complex internal structure that gives them a glowing appearance. The background's uniform color enhances the visibility and contrast of these colorful specks.","title":"Small algae photographed by the Atlantic Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Algae is plentiful throughout the Bight Apex near the dump sites and in polluted bays and estuaries. Scientists are beginning to think this could be used as an indicator organism for polluted areas.
