{"path":"543627.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a man in an outdoor setting engaged in a fishing activity. The man appears to be in his mid-adult years and is smiling towards the camera, creating a cheerful and lively atmosphere. He is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, light colored pants, and a headband, and he has a visible tattoo on his arm. The man is standing in front of a tackle box which is open and filled with various fishing gear like reels, lines, and possibly bait.\n\nThe setting is a serene lakeside area with calm water reflecting the clear sky. The background shows scattered snow patches on the ground and a lightly forested area, suggesting that this might be in a colder region or during a transitional season like early spring.\n\nThere are rocks around the man where he seems to have set up his fishing station, with some items placed on the rocks, adding to the impromptu feel of the setting. The fishing rod is propped up beside him, indicating a pause in activity as he possibly rearranges his tackle or prepares another part of his equipment. The lighting is natural, brighter on the lake and softer on the man, giving the image a contrasting balance between the subject and the surrounding nature. The overall composition conveys a sense of leisure and enjoyment of nature.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["550313","550666","554519","554520","548138","549935","550317","551024","551025","543484","550665","554522","542646","544714","544256","552122"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","man","reel","headband","pause","rock","year","balance","rod","t"]}
