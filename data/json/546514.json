{"path":"546514.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a narrow, urban alleyway between two buildings, under a vividly geometric and structured glass roof. On the left, there is a brick wall which gives a textured appearance and a sense of solidity. To the right, a building features a unique façade with numerous windows, each bordered by angular metallic frames that cast intricate shadows and reflections on the ground, contributing to a dynamic interplay of light and shapes.\n\nThe focal point of the composition, however, lies in the sophisticated roof structure composed of numerous glass panels and steel beams, which create a sense of vertical flow and openness in an otherwise enclosed space. This construction not only serves as a functional shelter but also adds a modern architectural aesthetic to the scene.\n\nIn the alley, a few individuals are seen walking, providing a human element and a sense of scale amidst the architectural features. They are dressed in casual attire, suggesting the everyday usage of this passageway. The perspective of the photograph, aligned with the alley, draws the viewer's gaze toward a vanishing point at the rear, further emphasizing depth and the linear qualities of the surroundings. Overall, the image offers a mixture of urban atmosphere, architectural interest, and everyday human activity enclosed within a distinctly contemporary design.","title":"Greenhouses are part of the new addition to the irwin union bank","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546525","546510","546517","550145","551493","545356","555329","543360","546521","546531","549880","557333","557391","555909","545361","553845"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["alley","enclose","alleyway","vanish","glass","usage","openness","shelter","roof","façade"]}
