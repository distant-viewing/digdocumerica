{"path":"554523.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man outdoors, engaging with a bowl of freshly caught fish. He is squatting on a lush green lawn with focused attention on his task. The man is dressed in a work attire that includes a gray long-sleeved shirt, darker gray pants, and a brown fedora-style hat with a sticker on it marked \"342\". His expression is intent and somewhat serious as he examines one of the fish he holds in his hands.\n\nIn his immediate vicinity, there's a light brown sack partially visible, suggesting additional equipment or maybe more catch from his fishing activity. The background shows a modest wooden structure, possibly a shed or the side of a house, surrounded by a rustic, rural environment with visible grass and a hint of wildflowers.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of rural life, likely focused on the personal joy or routine of fishing, with a detailed portrayal of individual activity and serene surroundings.","title":"Fisherman displays catch of native brook trout caught in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543484","554522","554520","550297","543232","553095","554521","544256","550666","554519","543627","545386","551025","552323","551406","552274"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","fishing","sack","fedora","bowl","sticker","catch","portrayal","routine","joy"]}
