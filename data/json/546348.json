{"path":"546348.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts three people enjoying a boat ride on a large expanse of water, which is presumably a lake or river. The boat is captured in motion, moving towards the right side of the frame, with water splashing around its hull, creating dynamic waves and spray.\n\nThe boat is a small, open motorboat with a pointed bow. It carries three passengers: a woman and a man sitting at the front, and another man standing towards the back, steering the boat. The woman, seated at the front, wears a dark shirt and is smiling, appearing to enjoy the ride. Next to her, the man wears a red life jacket and sunglasses, casually holding onto the sides of the boat as he looks forward.\n\nThe backdrop shows a cloudy sky with some blue peeping through, suggesting a day of mixed weather. In the distant background along the horizon, a thin line of trees or land indicates the far shore of the body of water. The overall atmosphere is lively, focusing on leisure and the enjoyment of a day out on the water.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Field trip to nearby waters biologists will fish for contaminated and non-contaminated female shrimp.
