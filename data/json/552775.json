{"path":"552775.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving several individuals and a car with its hood open. The car, predominantly white, features the logo of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on its side. It is a classic sedan, likely from the 1970s based on its design, paired with solid and simple rims.\n\nIn the foreground, a man, balding with dark and grey hair, dressed in a striped suit, is bending slightly over to examine the engine of the car. His expression indicates a focus on the task at hand. \n\nBehind him, there are additional men wearing business attire. One man appears to be in mid-conversation, possibly addressing someone not visible in the frame. These men are dressed in suits and ties - typical professional or government official attire.\n\nThe environment suggests this event could be outside a business or government building. The building visible in the background has a modern design with elements like large windows and partial brickwork, possibly indicating office or institutional use.\n\nOverall, the mood seems semi-formal with a focus on the task with the car, possibly relating to an inspection, demonstration, or similar official event organized by or involving the EPA.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
