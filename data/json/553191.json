{"path":"553191.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a young woman sitting outdoors, prominently lit by natural sunlight against a darker, blurred background that suggests a natural setting. She is dressed in a striking, patterned pantsuit with a combination of geometric and intricate designs in black and white. The outfit includes flared pants and a fitted jacket, typical of fashion from the 1970s era.\n\nThe woman is wearing large, rounded sunglasses that are tinted, partially obscuring her eyes but adding a sophisticated touch to her look. Her hair is styled in soft waves that frame her face. She is seated with one leg crossed over the other, resting her arm on her thigh, which gives her a relaxed yet elegant posture.\n\nIn her hand, she holds a small round object that resembles a stylish black hat, which she is possibly holding after removing it or before putting it on. Her shoes are white, possibly made of canvas or a light fabric, adding a casual component to her otherwise detailed outfit.\n\nThe lighting creates a dramatic effect, focusing attention on her and her fashionable attire, while the shadows help in emphasizing her figure and the texture of the clothes she is wearing.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556765","551821","553165","554270","549888","543864","557039","553157","553156","554923","550048","551439","551448","554378","544747","557901"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Portrait"],"terms":["outfit","thigh","round","canvas","fabric","clothe","woman","combination","shoe","leg"]}
