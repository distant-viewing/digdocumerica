{"path":"548666.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a charming, historic Victorian-style house characterized by its elaborate architectural details and tranquil setting. The main focus is a corner turret with a conical roof, featuring scalloped shingles that add a decorative touch. The turret includes large, white-framed windows that allow plenty of natural light to enter the space.\n\nSurrounding the turret on two sides is a wraparound porch with decorative railings and intricate woodwork, possibly including gingerbread trim, which is typical of this architectural style. The porch provides a spacious outdoor seating area and enhances the classic aesthetic of the home. There is a balustrade along the edge of the porch, adding to its elegant design.\n\nThe house is painted white, which contrasts beautifully with the lush greenery surrounding it. Several mature trees, including one prominently in the foreground, partially obscure the view and cast shadows on the building, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a sunny day. These trees add a sense of privacy and serenity to the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph balances the striking architectural features of the house with the natural elements, creating a peaceful and inviting scene. The house appears well-maintained and proudly reflects the heritage and charm of its Victorian design.","title":"A typical bahamian-style residence of Key West.
