{"path":"543394.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a woman and a black dog are seen at a beach setting. The woman, standing with her back partially towards the camera, is dressed in a long-sleeve purple top and blue jeans. She is pointing towards the ocean with her left hand and holding a stick in her right hand, which she appears to be about to throw for the dog. The dog, attentive and poised to run, is focusing on the stick. Its body language suggests eagerness and readiness.\n\nThe beach itself has fine sand, with scattered driftwood and seaweed. The ocean in the background is active with waves, and there's a rugged coastline visible in the distance under a hazy sky. The scene is infused with natural light, casting soft shadows on the sand. This setting contributes to a tranquil yet playful atmosphere, emphasizing a moment of leisure and interaction between the woman and her dog.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543463","544191","543083","543500","548695","548292","545218","543395","549928","553072","543390","545133","543396","553089","547148","543070"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","stick","sand","ocean","beach","woman","infuse","seaweed","readiness","language"]}
