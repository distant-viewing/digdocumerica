{"path":"545290.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, nature-filled scene, likely in a lush park or forested area. The main focus is on a large, ancient tree cloaked in moss, positioned centrally and to the left in the image. Its branches are widespread and thickly draped with hanging moss, creating a textured and mystical appearance, partly obscuring the sky and other vegetation behind it. \n\nA group of five people stands on a dirt path partially in shadow, located under and slightly to the right of the tree. The individuals appear to be engaged in casual conversation, positioned facing each other, suggesting a social or leisure activity. The people are dressed in casual, light outdoor clothing suitable for a day out in nature.\n\nThe background reveals more trees and lush foliage, bathed in dappled sunlight, which filters through the leaves, creating patterns of light and shadow on the group and the path. The environment exudes a tranquil and slightly secluded atmosphere, enhanced by the natural green tones and the soft, filtered light.","title":"Sightseers in the Hoh Rain Forest, where the annual rainfall averages 142 inches.
