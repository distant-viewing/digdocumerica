{"path":"544681.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a rural or industrial setting with a series of prominent and striking features. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of what appears to be white foam or froth, clustered along the edge of a dirt road. This road leads to a railway crossing with multiple features prominent within the image.\n\nAt the center of the image, a railway crossing sign, accompanied by a red stop sign with white lettering, is visible. It is flanked by two cross-buck signs typical of railway crossings, which have red and white stripes. The signs are mounted on posts that stand alongside the train tracks.\n\nThe tracks themselves are laid on a narrow strip of land, which bifurcates a body of water, visible on both sides of the track. The track leads towards the horizon, emphasizing depth and drawing the viewerâ€™s eye towards a series of electricity pylons standing in the water and stretching into the distance. These pylons contribute to an industrial atmosphere, representing infrastructure and energy distribution.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photograph suggests it has been taken during the day under clear skies, as there are strong contrasts and deep shadows present, enhancing the details and textures in the image. The landscape is devoid of vegetation and appears arid aside from the water bodies, suggesting a possibly reclaimed or industrial land use. The composition leverages elements like linear perspective and leading lines (the railroad and pylons) to guide the viewer's gaze through the scene.\n\nThis photograph might be interpreted as an environmental commentary or merely documenting a specific location showcasing infrastructural elements, land use, and environmental conditions.","title":"\"Water stinks,\" writes the photographer about this scene.","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["544706","547944","547940","544673","545988","556783","543007","544695","543725","555887","556852","556853","544699","552211","552819","546112"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["pylon","crossing","track","railway","land","lead","sign","leverage","froth","series"]}
