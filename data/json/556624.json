{"path":"556624.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man seated on a large bed covered with a multi-colored striped blanket, primarily in shades of blue and green. The man is casually dressed in a dark blue jacket, blue jeans, and is barefoot. He's focused on reading a newspaper and holding a cup, possibly containing a beverage like coffee or tea.\n\nThe room has plain white walls, and above the bed, there is a distinctive wall decoration made of various colorful tin cans arranged in a grid-like pattern. Next to the bed, on a small brown bedside cabinet, are a few small items that appear to be decorative figurines. Overall, the setting gives an impression of a comfortable, lived-in space, with a unique personal touch provided by the wall art made from tin cans. The lighting is soft, suggesting the photo may have been taken in natural daylight.","title":"Lawyer Steve Natelson, who lives near Taos, New Mexico, relaxes on the bed of his experimental home built of empty steel beer and soft drink cans.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["544232","552104","553517","548454","555532","557765","556459","553522","545974","552619","547353","552114","545986","548458","556484","555430"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["bed","tin","can","coffee","cabinet","wall","beverage","cup","newspaper","blanket"]}
