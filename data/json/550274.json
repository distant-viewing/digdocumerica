{"path":"550274.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling construction site with multiple elements indicating large-scale infrastructure work in progress. In the forefront, a large yellow wheel loader is actively engaged, moving a pile of earth and generating a small cloud of dust around its wheels, clearly in motion. This contrasts with the peaceful demeanor of a worker in the left middle ground, standing and observing the scene while holding a red flag, perhaps acting as a spotter or traffic controller for safety.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is another construction vehicle, partially visible and appearing to be stationary, enhancing the sense of ongoing, varied activity at the site. The background is dominated by a substantial brown metal bridge structure in an unfinished state, with various segments connected and supported by temporary structures such as scaffolding and concrete pillars.\n\nThe setting suggests extensive preparatory work on either a highway or railway overpass, given the scale and type of the structures involved. There are additional workers visible on the bridge, interacting or overseeing construction tasks, adding to the dynamism of the scene.\n\nThe landscape around the construction site is relatively barren, with large open patches of dirt and modest vegetation, typical of such projects before landscaping or further development. The clear sky suggests favorable weather conditions for construction activities. Overall, the photograph captures a moment that reflects both coordinated activity and the raw, transformative nature of large-scale construction projects.","title":"Freeway construction on Riverside near brook park road","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551966","547235","548431","553383","553378","546252","544167","553394","553391","547236","553382","557479","556939","553886","547240","549169"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","project","wheel","scale","worker","loader","bridge","dynamism","coordinate"]}
