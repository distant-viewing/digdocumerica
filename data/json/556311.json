{"path":"556311.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This is a photograph of a man playing a saxophone. He is captured in mid-performance, actively engaged in playing the instrument. He is a middle-aged African American male with a mustache and slightly unkempt hair. The man is wearing a patterned, houndstooth jacket that is white and dark-colored, a dark shirt underneath, and dark pants.\n\nHe is standing, with the saxophone tilted up slightly as he plays, and a microphone set up in front of him to capture the sound. His expression is focused and somewhat intense, possibly reflecting the emotional or technical complexity of the piece he is performing.\n\nThe background of the photograph is completely dark, focusing all attention on the performer himself. The lighting highlights his upper body and the saxophone, creating a dramatic contrast between him and the surrounding darkness. This setting enhances the sense of a live stage performance, emphasizing the atmosphere of a concert setting.","title":"Black saxophonist performs at the International Amphitheater in Chicago as part of the annual PUSH 'Black Expo' in the fall of 1973.
