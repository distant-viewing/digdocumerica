{"path":"549185.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape dominated by expansive mounds or formations that appear to be made largely of earth and rock materials. In the foreground, there are several triangular soil heaps or piles lined up in a row. These soil heaps, covered in light-colored dust or dirt, are likely related to mining or excavation activities.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows open fields and undulating terrain with some tire tracks visible, suggesting recent vehicle movement. There are scattered small structures or poles, possibly agricultural or related to utility lines.\n\nIn the background, the main focus is on a group of rolling hills which exhibit a gradient of colors from dark at the top to lighter shades toward the bottom, indicating possible soil or mineral layers. These hills have sparse vegetation, but a group of trees grows clustered on one of the hilltops, providing a contrast to the mostly barren landscape.\n\nThe overall scene is set under a cloudy sky, suggesting an overcast day. The composition and contents of the photograph suggest it might depict a mining or excavation site in a rural or semi-rural area.","title":"Strip-mined land is flattened and graded for reclamation old spoil piles in foreground","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555588","554804","550574","549170","554817","545534","549179","555610","549180","554802","545533","555629","555594","554763","555634","554811"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["heap","soil","excavation","mining","hilltop","dark","relate","group","hill","mineral"]}
