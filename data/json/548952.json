{"path":"548952.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a moment of agricultural activity, specifically within a cattle handling facility. A man appears engaged in a task involving a Hereford cow, which is partly seen through a chute designed for holding cattle during medical treatment or tagging. The man is focused on adjusting a part of the chute mechanism; he is dressed in a practical outdoor outfit, including a denim jacket and a beanie hat, suitable for farm work.\n\nThe environment around them is predominantly a dirt ground, typical of a livestock pen, surrounded by metal fencing. Behind the focal activity, you can observe other cattle in a pen, hinting at this being a part of a larger farming operation. The clear, bright sky suggests the photograph was taken on a sunny day, contributing to the stark shadows visible on the ground, which add a graphic element to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a typical day in cattle farming, highlighting the equipment and environment, as well as the direct interaction between the farmer and livestock.","title":"Cattle raised on an experimental farm operated by epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552569","548959","548957","554949","552669","554950","552677","543690","552567","543686","552565","554881","548962","553106","549033","553104"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cattle","chute","pen","livestock","farming","beanie","farmer","fencing","cow","treatment"]}
