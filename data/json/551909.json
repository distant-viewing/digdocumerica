{"path":"551909.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling tram station, likely from the mid-20th century, showcasing an array of tram cars and personnel. The scene is busy and vivid, emphasizing public transport of the era.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there's a tram prominently numbered \"547\" with a sign showing \"Hohe Warte\" indicating its route or destination. The tram is red with cream-colored accents, and inside, drivers and passengers are visible, suggesting it is in operation. Another similar tram, identified by the number \"1715,\" is parked parallel to tram 547 but at a higher elevation, indicating a multi-level tram station setup.\n\nBehind tram 547, another tram numbered \"62\" is seen carrying what appears to be cargo or supplies instead of passengers, hinting at the multifunctional use of trams at the time. The vicinity is packed with tram lines, signaling a major hub or a key part of the tram network.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a complex network of tram lines, poles, and signage, indicative of a comprehensive and well-utilized public transport system. Various people, possibly commuters and tram staff, are scattered throughout the scene, walking along the platforms or waiting. The environment is urban with visible roadways adjacent to the tram station, and several old-model cars are parked in the distance.\n\nBillboards and industrial structures can be spotted further back, contributing to the urban atmosphere of the photograph. The day is clear and sunny, casting shadows that add depth to the bustling activity at the tram station.","title":"Construction of a subway is a major part of Vienna's plan to reduce, by 95%, surface traffic in the city's cultural and commercial center.  \"temporary\" trolleys run through subway construction area around karlskirche, a cathedral","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551908","549655","551877","551906","549658","551907","549679","551862","554174","551876","549646","549662","549650","556127","556123","556670"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["tram","station","number","passenger","network","transport","personnel","staff","commuter","billboard"]}
