{"path":"554424.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph presents a serene outdoor scene characterized by natural woodland and an open meadow environment. At the center of the image, a person stands in a grassy field adorned with myriad yellow flowers. The person, appearing somewhat indistinct due to the photo's resolution, is dressed informally in jeans and a lighter colored shirt, and seems to be looking either towards the ground or slightly away from the camera.\n\nThe area surrounding the person is a lush mixture of grass and wildflowers, emphasizing a vibrant and peaceful natural setting. The foreground of the photograph shows an uneven, rocky soil path that cuts through the grass, hinting at a less manicured landscape. \n\nRising behind the person and scattered across the image are dense clusters of coniferous trees, predominantly pine, which provide a rich green backdrop and suggest a secluded or forested area. The trees lend a sense of privacy and tranquility, further accentuated by the apparent absence of any man-made structures or other human activity in the visible area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on nature and the contemplative pose of the individual, conjures a mood of solitude and reflection amid a distinctly rustic setting.","title":"A former log-loading area near Tupper Lake, on land owned by the litchfield paper company.
