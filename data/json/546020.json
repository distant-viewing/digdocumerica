{"path":"546020.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene featuring a large, dark-hued freight ship bearing the name \"Axel Maersk\" visible on its stern, sailing along the waterway. The freighter seems to dominate the left portion of the frame, giving a sense of its significant size compared to its surroundings. The ship is equipped with a red and black funnel and several deck structures, suggesting it's a cargo vessel.\n\nOn the right side of the image, significantly smaller in size, is a buoy with a conical red top and a narrow base, floating on the river's surface. It serves as a navigation marker for vessels.\n\nThe river itself has brown, muddy waters, indicative of a possible high silt content, and the surface of the water is rippling, showing movement and flow. Behind the buoy and to the right of the ship, the far bank of the river is lined with a dense growth of bare trees, suggesting it might be late fall or winter.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright blue, contributing to a crisp and peaceful rural river scene. Overall, the composition captures a juxtaposition of industrial activity within a natural environment, highlighting the interaction between human-made vessels and riverine landscapes.","title":"Oil spews from a damaged liberian tanker after the tanker collided with a barge on the Mississippi river.
