{"path":"552440.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a flooded area with numerous trees partially submerged in water. The setting appears to be a park or a natural area typically used for recreational purposes, as evidenced by the presence of a submerged bench and a barbecue grill visible in the water in the foreground.\n\nThe trees, which dominate the scene, have thick trunks and are densely clustered, suggesting they are part of a mature woodland. The water is rippling, indicating either the presence of a light breeze or some movement within the water itself.\n\nThe lighting in the image is relatively dim, suggestive of either an overcast day or a time of day when the sun is not at its peak. There are no visible skies due to the perspective, but the general ambiance is somewhat somber due to the inundation and the lighting.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate cluster of trees, the water extends towards what appears to be an open body of water or a distant shore, barely discernible through the silhouettes of the trees. \n\nNo people or animals are visible in this scene, which conveys a sense of quiet and abandonment, emphasizing the impact of flooding in a typically populated area. The scene captures a moment of natural interruption where human elements like the bench and the grill have been overtaken by the inundation, highlighting nature's overpowering force.","title":"Flood waters of the Illinois river at cooper park, east Peoria","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552438","550832","552853","552843","552834","552847","548692","552817","552431","550788","555570","548587","546066","544462","555637","545008"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["grill","bench","submerge","interruption","water","rippl","cluster","flooding","breeze","flood"]}
