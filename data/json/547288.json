{"path":"547288.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque rural landscape during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, based on the deep colors and lighting. The central focus of the image is a vast field of crops, which looks like mature wheat, golden-brown in color and uniformly textured throughout the foreground. The horizon is broadly flat, suggesting an expansive, open agricultural area.\n\nIn the middle ground, a solitary, small white house with a sharply peaked roof and visible white siding is situated. The house is relatively isolated, with no adjacent buildings, highlighting its solitude in the vast field. A few sparse trees are faintly visible behind the house, and a light fence appears to run near the structure, possibly indicating a boundary or a small road beside the house.\n\nThe backdrop of the sky is a deep, dramatic blue that contrasts starkly with the golden hues of the field, enhancing the vibrancy of the scene. There are no clouds visible, which adds to the stark and open feeling of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph — with its wide-open spaces, the isolation of the house, and the contrast of the earth and sky — evokes a sense of tranquility and the monotonous beauty typical of rural agricultural settings.","title":"Farm house at dusk.
