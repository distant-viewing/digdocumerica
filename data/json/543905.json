The shrimp, prominently featured in the center of the image, is notably clear in color with visible internal organs and whisker-like antennae extending forward. The person's hands cradle the shrimp gently, showing details like skin texture and fingernails with meticulous focus. Behind the subject, the background is blurred and indistinct, emphasizing the sharpness and detail of the shrimp and human hands. The lighting highlights the shrimpâ€™s translucent physique, making its delicate structure and features stand out against the shadowed, nondescript backdrop.
