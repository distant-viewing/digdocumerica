{"path":"549748.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban landfill scene under a cloudy blue sky. In the foreground, a large heap of assorted garbage covers the ground, consisting of various discarded items such as pieces of paper, plastics, and other unidentifiable waste materials. Central to the image, there is a white sanitation truck parked beside a yellow bulldozer, both partially obscured by the mounds of trash and working to manage the waste. Numerous seagulls are seen flying above the landfill or sitting atop the garbage, presumably searching for food.\n\nIn the background, a line of tall apartment buildings is visible, suggesting this landfill is located near a residential area. These high-rises, looking somewhat stark against the open sky, contrast sharply with the chaotic and cluttered nature of the landfill in the foreground. An area with bare trees and a few patches of grass can also be seen between the landfill and the buildings, adding a small touch of natural elements to the otherwise urban and industrial scene. Notably, another distant area similar in appearance to the foreground can be observed further beyond the main focus of the activity, likely indicating the extensive size of the landfill operation.","title":"Municipal dump in the Bronx reaches almost to the doorstep of \"Co-op City\" (housing development in background). Although dump already exceeds capacity, pile-up continues; high winds, typical of the area, scatter bits of refuse for miles around.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548210","549737","549739","549747","546246","550256","549745","544799","549946","549762","549750","549936","546235","549792","543832","554541"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","garbage","waste","sanitation","seagull","bulldozer","heap","apartment","plastic","mound"]}
