{"path":"557833.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at an automotive garage or car testing facility. The central focus is a man lying on the ground, examining something beneath a red car, likely conducting an inspection or maintenance. He is holding a tool or wire, connecting it below the car, suggesting some form of diagnostic or repair work. The man is dressed in casual work attire â€” a blue shirt and dark pants.\n\nIn the background, two individuals stand near another red vehicle. They seem engaged in conversation, possibly discussing the work or waiting for an outcome. There are security or safety cones placed around the area, indicating controlled access or safety protocols in place around the workspace.\n\nThe scene is set outdoors during daylight, indicated by the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground. To the left, an open garage bay reveals a glimpse of the inside of the garage which includes an air and water service station equipped with meters and hoses. The garage has a simple, utilitarian design with what appears to be roll-up doors. The setting suggests a period look, possibly from the mid to late 20th century, given the style of the cars and the design of the equipment. The overall environment and activities suggest a focus on automotive care or testing.","title":"Employee at the Hamilton County auto emission inspection station at Newtown, Ohio, checks the exhaust system for a leaking muffler.
