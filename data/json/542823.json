{"path":"542823.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a forest area showing signs of timber harvesting. The scene captures a mix of standing and fallen trees, scattered in a relatively chaotic manner across the landscape.\n\nIn various parts of the image, vibrant green coniferous trees are visible â€” some are intact and upright, suggesting that areas of the forest remain untouched. In contrast, other sections show substantial deforestation with numerous tree stumps and remnants of felled trees, indicating recent logging activities. These cleared patches reveal a muddy brown soil, enhanced by tracks made from heavy machinery used for logging, crisscrossing through the debris.\n\nScattered across the ground are many pieces of timber and smaller branches, lying randomly, contributing to a sense of disruption in the otherwise natural setting. The landscape is a patchwork of dense greenery interspersed with these disturbed, brown clearing areas where the ground is littered with wood debris and cutting remnants.\n\nOverall, the photograph chronicles the impact of logging on a forest environment, displaying both the retained forestland and the stark transformations where trees have been removed. The image is a stark visual representation of the balance and tension between natural ecosystems and human industrial activity.","title":"Clear cutting and timber damage","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542827","542834","542833","542947","550354","555085","542832","556922","555143","555198","545143","542828","557574","542949","555208","542852"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["timber","remnant","forest","deforestation","transformation","tree","harvesting","tension","patchwork","disruption"]}
