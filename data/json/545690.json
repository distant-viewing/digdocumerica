{"path":"545690.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph portrays a striking, rugged terrain, presumably in a canyon or mountainous region. A narrow dirt road snakes its way along the side of a steep red rock cliff. The texture of the rock is rough and rugged with a variety of hues from deep red to lighter shades of orange and brown. Some sections of the cliff face display vertical stratification, emphasizing the geological forces at play.\n\nIn terms of activity, there are two people visible in the distance, making their way along this precarious path. They appear to be either hiking or biking, given the remote and adventurous setting. Their presence adds a sense of scale to the image, underscoring the towering and overwhelming nature of the cliffs surrounding them. \n\nThe overall composition of the photo highlights the daunting nature of the terrain and the narrow route that cuts through it. There's a strong sense of isolation and wilderness, emphasizing the challenging environment and the adventurous spirit required to traverse such a landscape. The sky is not visible in the frame, which further focuses attention on the geological features and the path, enhancing the feeling of being enveloped by the natural world.","title":"Schafer Trail, a steep motor road, is in the northern section of the park.
