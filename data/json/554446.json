{"path":"554446.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In this photograph, a young girl and an older man, presumably a park ranger, are seated beside each other on a set of stone steps leading up to a rustic log building. The girl, around six or seven years old, is wearing a sleeveless flower-patterned top and shorts, sitting with one leg straightened slightly and the other bent at her side. She has a contemplative or slightly bemused expression. Her long, light brown hair is loosely draped over her shoulders.\n\nThe man next to her wears a classic ranger outfit, including a light-colored shirt with the distinctive \"FOREST SERVICE RANGER\" badge and a patch featuring a pine tree on his left sleeve. He also wears dark trousers, tall lace-up boots, and a wide-brimmed ranger hat. He holds a walking stick or possibly a tool of his duty between his knees and is looking down at the girl with a gentle demeanor, likely engaging in a light conversation or explaining something to her.\n\nBoth individuals are seated against a backdrop of a log cabin-style structure, hinting at a location within a forest or nature reserve. The steps they are on show signs of wear, indicating they are frequently used, and seem to be part of a public building or visitor center, based on their robust and functional nature.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is one of peaceful interaction and gentle guidance in a nature-focused setting, suggesting a moment of learning or companionship shared between different generations, and underscored by the deep connection with the natural environment.","title":"U.S. Forest Service ranger at Stillwater sharpens an axe while his daughter looks on.","placename":"Albany (N.Y.)","location":"Albany, New York","nn1":["558186","554921","554900","543479","551514","543999","554447","543854","546312","554692","545516","551807","546077","547055","552931","542727"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["ranger","girl","step","log","guidance","lace","learning","generation","reserve","companionship"]}
