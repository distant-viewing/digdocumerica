{"path":"555952.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a cityscape featuring a two-story, corner red-brick building standing prominently under an overcast sky. The building has a distinctive architectural style with a symmetric bay window structure on both facing sides. Each bay window set-up includes three vertical windows per floor, accented by dark frames. The entrance of the building features a red door accessible by a dual-staircase leading up from the sidewalk, each arm of the staircase flanked by metal railings. \n\nAdjacent to the building on its right side is a vacant lot partially enclosed by a low, metal fence, showing signs of neglect with overgrown grass and scattered trash. The street is a standard urban roadway without visible traffic, marked by a lone stop sign by the sidewalk. The surface of the road looks worn, adding to the somewhat desolate and ignored ambiance of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a somber, slightly eerie mood, accentuated by the lack of human presence and the disrepair visible in both the building and its surroundings.","title":"Abandoned house on the north side of Chicago, Illinois.
