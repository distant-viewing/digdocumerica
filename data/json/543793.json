{"path":"543793.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a serene river landscape. In the foreground, there is a branch with distinct green leaves framing the left side. The river itself curves gently through the middle of the image, bordered by white rocky edges and surrounded by hilly terrain. The hills, which occupy the background, are arid and covered with sparse vegetation, primarily bushes and small trees, characteristic of a semi-arid or desert environment.\n\nThe riverbanks are rugged and uneven, primarily composed of light-colored rock formations and occasional patches of grass and shrubs. The sunlight illuminates the landscape, casting shadows and highlighting the texture of the rocky terrain, which gives a stark contrast to the tranquil and reflective surface of the water.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, suggesting a bright sunny day without clouds. This element adds a sense of openness and clarity to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph captures the natural and rugged beauty of an arid river landscape, possibly in a region like the southwestern United States. The image is devoid of any human presence or man-made structures, emphasizing a natural and undisturbed environment.","title":"Acid and radium 226 leaks from tailings pond into the san miguel river","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["542537","543789","542653","545632","545301","544929","552905","542558","552548","550656","543716","550433","543977","550542","555575","545633"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","openness","clarity","terrain","riverbank","desert","occupy","bush","compose","shrub"]}
