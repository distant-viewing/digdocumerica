{"path":"552869.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy aboard a boat, looking off into the distance with a curious and lively expression. The boy stands beside the boat's steering wheel, to which he holds onto with his right hand while his left arm rests on the side railing of the boat. He wears a plain white T-shirt that appears slightly weathered, perhaps by the sea air, and his dark, tousled hair is windblown.\n\nThe steering wheel itself is traditional in style, made of metal with four spokes, and it looks aged and rusty, indicating it's well-used and possibly old. Adjacent structures suggest this is a small to mid-sized vessel, as we can see metal bars, possibly part of a canopy frame, and various maritime equipment like ropes and a rusted metal pole.\n\nThe background features an expansive open sea under a slightly cloudy sky, contributing to a sense of adventure or exploration. The calmness of the sea paired with the clear view towards the horizon complements the boyâ€™s adventurous gaze, setting a serene yet vibrant maritime scene. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of youth, adventure, and a connection to the sea.","title":"Oysterman Pete Tesvich's son stands by the ship's wheel on his father's boat on Lake Borgne.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548517","545179","545219","544273","543937","554196","544270","543953","544269","547463","555802","547554","543942","548521","546317","543472"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sea","boy","steering","adventure","wheel","boat","metal","youth","bar","calmness"]}
