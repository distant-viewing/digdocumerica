{"path":"547428.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic aerial view of a rural landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The lighting casts a rich, warm glow across the scene, highlighting various shades of reds, purples, and greens in the fields and tree lines.\n\nIn the foreground, two white buildings, resembling a farmhouse and a barn, are situated adjacent to each other amidst a field. The barn has a distinctive peaked roof and appears to reflect the sunlight, making it a visual focal point. Nearby, a well-defined tractor trail weaves through the crop, indicating recent agricultural activity.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo features undulating fields and patches of dense woodland. The varying heights and types of vegetation create a textured tapestry that hints at the diversity of plant life and its use in this rural setting - possibly for farming and pasture.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape continues to roll gently, with fields divided by lines of trees and hedgerows, typical of a managed agricultural environment. These divisions add to the patchwork effect seen throughout the image. The horizon fades into a soft blend of the earthy tones with the sky, enhancing the tranquil and secluded essence of the rural countryside.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the interplay of light and color across a varied landscape, evokes a peaceful and rustic charm typical of a pastoral setting.","title":"Farmlands near the Seward-Saline County line","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547309","547321","557023","554819","556963","555577","542916","557748","547350","555635","556971","554767","549256","549237","556968","557946"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["field","barn","pasture","farmhouse","division","patchwork","countryside","tapestry","tractor","woodland"]}
