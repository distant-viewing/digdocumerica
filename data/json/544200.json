{"path":"544200.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and candid moment by a body of water, likely a lake or bay. It features two children engaged in leisurely outdoor activities. The child in the foreground, who appears to be a girl, is stepping delicately on rocks or submerged objects in the water. She is holding a net in her right hand, perhaps for catching small fish or other aquatic creatures. She is wearing a colorful striped top paired with dark shorts, which adds a vibrant contrast to the natural blues of the water and the sky.\n\nThe other child, standing on a wooden plank or dock, is watching the first child. She is dressed in a dark blue top and bright orange shorts, adding another splash of color to the scene. The expression on her face suggests she is either instructing or observing with interest.\n\nThe background is relatively subdued, with a wide expanse of water stretching to the horizon under a lightly clouded sky. Just visible in the distance are faint outlines of structures or boats, blending into the muted tones of the horizon. The overall atmosphere of the scene is tranquil, with the focus on the simple joys of a day spent near the water, exploring and playing.","title":"Harvesting crabs","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["543875","544302","546333","543468","547727","543466","547692","552940","544183","554518","550776","549105","552341","553431","551160","544203"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","short","water","creature","net","joy","bay","top","splash","horizon"]}
