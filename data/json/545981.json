{"path":"545981.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features an older couple posing together in a modestly furnished room. The man, on the left, has dark hair and some facial wrinkles, suggesting middle to older age. He is dressed in a long-sleeve, light gray crewneck and dark pants. He sits on the edge of what appears to be a bed or a long cushion, his arms relaxed in his lap, and he gives a slight, friendly smile.\n\nNext to him, a woman with short, curly light-colored hair is seated. She is wearing a light pink, knitted sweater and bright red pants, her hands folded neatly on her lap. She has a serene expression and is gazing towards the camera.\n\nThey appear casual and comfortable around each other, perhaps indicating they share a close relationship. The backdrop includes a light aqua-colored wall, adorned with a few posters or pictures including what look like media or film star posters, providing a personalized touch to the room. The ambiance suggests a lived-in, cozy space, marked by plain yet functional decor.","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Tillman Matherne in their home.
