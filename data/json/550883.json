{"path":"550883.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph features the exterior of a building identified as the \"Howard Paper Company.\" The structure appears to be an industrial or commercial building characterized by its stout architectural design and minimal external decor. The building has a large sign mounted on its side with its name, making its purpose or industry clear. The facade of the building is partly red and partly beige with some features in gray.\n\nIn front of the building, there are two large piles of material, possibly bales of paper or other recyclable materials, which are stacked on top of one another. These pyramids of materials are sizable compared to the building and dominate the lower half of the frame.\n\nThe foreground shows a section of somewhat bare earth or a dirt area leading up to the stacked materials, suggesting a space in use for either storage or processing within an industrial setting. There are several small, round shrubs arranged neatly along the base of the material stacks, providing a minimal touch of landscaping.\n\nThe background of the image has a cloudy sky which fills the upper section of the photograph with various shades of blue and white, suggestive of a typical overcast day. The overall composition and elements within the photograph indicate a functional industrial setting focused on paper products.","title":"Bales by the thousands form paper bulwark outside the fort howard paper company on the shores of green bay","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["554702","550712","553399","550882","550881","550722","552152","553451","550350","546006","550265","550349","546236","546866","550880","546148"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["stack","paper","material","building","bale","section","materials","decor","landscaping","identify"]}
