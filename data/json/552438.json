{"path":"552438.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a flooded woodland setting, featuring slender trees standing partially submerged in water. The trees are evenly spaced, stretching out across the frame, accompanied by varied underbrush that also protrudes from the reflective water surface. The forest is dense, with the foliage primarily consisting of bright green leaves that highlight a vibrant and healthy ecosystem.\n\nThe water surface is calm, mirroring the surrounding timber and greenery which adds depth and a sense of tranquility to the scene. Visibility through the water is obscured by the reflection of the trees and the sky above, suggesting a substantial depth of the flooding.\n\nLight filters through the canopy, casting patterns of light and shadow that enhance the textural quality of the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and somewhat mysterious, evoked by the unusual sight of a forest immersed in water. The photograph lacks any visible human activity or presence, focusing solely on the natural landscape and its quiet, untouched state during a moment of environmental change.","title":"Grove at banner is partly submerged by the flooding Illinois river","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["550832","547011","553465","552440","554525","543700","553410","558009","553075","542844","546947","545488","558012","552847","554603","555076"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["underbrush","immerse","water","protrude","flooding","forest","sight","spac","timber","accompany"]}
