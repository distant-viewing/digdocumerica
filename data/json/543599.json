{"path":"543599.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a natural landscape featuring a clearing surrounded by a dense forest of tall pine trees. The foreground shows deep tire tracks in what appears to be soft, perhaps muddy ground, creating a textured pattern across the grassy field. These tracks lead primarily from the bottom-left of the image towards a central clearing in the background where a group of trailers or RVs is parked amidst the trees.\n\nThe trees, mainly conical in shape, are thick and lush, suggesting a healthy forest environment. In the background, beyond the trailers, the forest continues, and a mountain range can be partially seen through the trees under a clear blue sky. The lighting in the image suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening, casting defined shadows and giving a serene glow to the clearing.\n\nThe overall composition creates a perspective leading from the muddy tire tracks up to the human activity at the campsite, nestled within the surrounding natural beauty of the forest and mountains, highlighting a blend of human impact and natural setting.","title":"Trash dumped in field","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["545160","542732","554480","542609","542604","542746","542747","553133","554515","544860","543600","552898","548795","552584","545605","546983"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["clearing","forest","track","trailer","tire","campsite","mountain","tree","glow","bottom"]}
