{"path":"551406.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a man sitting by a muddy water body, likely engaged in an outdoor activity involving water sampling or fishing. The man is dressed in outdoor gear suitable for wet conditions, wearing a red jacket over a plaid shirt, olive green pants, and knee-high rubber boots. He wears a bucket hat with a patterned band and is equipped with glasses. His posture is relaxed as he sits on a rock, gazing thoughtfully into the distance, with one hand resting on his knee and the other holding onto a green and white piece of equipment, possibly a net or sampling tool.\n\nNext to the man is a bright yellow bucket which suggests that he may be collecting samples or creatures from the water. In the water, a shadowy mesh object, resembling a net, is partially submerged, hinting at his activities related to capturing or examining aquatic life.\n\nThe surrounding environment indicates a rugged, natural setting with muddy banks and scattered vegetation. The waters are calm and there are visible sediments and ripples on the surface, indicating either recent movement or a flowing water source. The overall atmosphere is serene, dedicated to a specific task requiring attention and care in a natural setting.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
