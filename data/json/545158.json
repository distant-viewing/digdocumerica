{"path":"545158.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a small fishing boat near the shore of a sizable body of water. The boat is painted yellow with a white interior and has the registration \"OR 195 EM B\" visible on its side, indicating it is registered in Oregon. It is equipped for fishing, with several rods arranged in holders and netting equipment readily accessible.\n\nOnboard, a single person wearing a dark jacket and lighter pants operates the boat, appearing to be steering or manipulating controls near the rear. The individual's focus is directed towards the front of the boat, possibly navigating or looking out for a suitable fishing spot.\n\nThe sea around the boat is calm with gentle waves lapping against the sandy shore. The coastline in the background is lined with low mountains or hills, partially shrouded by a light mist or haze, suggesting early morning or late afternoon light. The sky is mostly clear with only a few wispy clouds, adding to the tranquil and serene setting of the scene. The lighting in the photograph enhances the vivid colors of the boat and the natural surroundings.","title":"Salmon fishing.
