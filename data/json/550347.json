{"path":"550347.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene, likely in a forested area showing signs of disturbance or environmental change. In the foreground, there are scattered logs and debris, including small branches and wood chips, on a slope that descends toward a water body. The varying sizes of logs, some with raw, freshly cut appearances, suggest recent logging activity or clearing.\n\nThe middle ground features a calm body of water that edges the forest, reflecting a bit of the light and the greenery from the surrounding trees. This part of the image evokes a tranquil yet somewhat somber mood due to the visible dead trees and stumps around it, pointing towards possible damage or consequential effects on the area's ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, dense green foliage from young, thriving trees provides a stark contrast to the immediate devastation in the foreground, suggesting ongoing growth and regeneration in the area. The overall lighting, with overcast skies, creates a soft, natural illumination that enhances the forest's lush, green tones against the more muted and earthy colors of the debris-strewn ground.\n\nThis scene is indicative of a forest either recuperating from logging or other human activity, or experiencing natural events that have altered its landscape. It highlights the ongoing interplay between destruction and regeneration within natural settings.","title":"Leachings from waste bark and chemicals into polluted tributary of the st.  Croix river.
