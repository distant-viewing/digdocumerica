{"path":"546159.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph is a close-up of a majestic fallow deer, prominently featuring its head and the upper part of its body. The deer has a white to light grey coat and a pair of striking antlers that are still in velvet, indicating they are still growing and it is perhaps early in the year for deer. The antlers curve gracefully and branch out into several points.\n\nThe deer's expression appears calm and alert as it looks directly towards the camera, giving a sense of connection to the viewer. This close-up allows us to note details such as its large, dark eyes and the fine texture of its fur.\n\nThe background is a lush field, densely packed with tall yellow flowers and green foliage, which suggests a wild, natural habitat. The lighting in the photograph is soft, with what appears to be the warmth of a setting or rising sun illuminating the scene, highlighting the deer's fur and the surrounding flora.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph beautifully balances the detailed, crisp focus on the deer with the softer, blurred background, creating a serene and intimate portrayal of this beautiful animal in its natural environment.","title":"Wild deer","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["546163","554621","544916","545902","552339","543279","558368","543839","542778","543851","543369","550803","550804","545898","550802","550381"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","antler","fur","up","portrayal","warmth","note","year","strike","grow"]}
