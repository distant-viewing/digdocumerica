{"path":"551353.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a single, finely detailed maple leaf, suspended in the air against a dark, blurry background. The leaf is highlighted and appears luminous due to its light green color, while the background remains unfocused, possibly suggesting a woodland setting in low light conditions.\n\nThe maple leaf, shown in profile, is adorned with numerous water droplets that glisten as if recently subjected to rain or morning dew. These droplets vary in size and are scattered across the entire surface of the leaf, emphasizing its intricate veining and serrated edges. The leaf also carries a small, spiral-shaped object near its center, which could be a small snail or similar creature, adding an extra element of interest and natural beauty to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and the play of light on the leaf's wet surface create a vibrant contrast with the dark background, drawing the viewer's attention mainly to the leaf and its details. The scene evokes a sense of calm and the fleeting beauty of natural phenomena.","title":"On a lake formed by one of Missouri's famous blue springs a maple leaf with raindrops floats in a pattern formed by light slanting through tall trees.
