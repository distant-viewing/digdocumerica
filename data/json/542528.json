{"path":"542528.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a close perspective of a large, metallic pipeline extending into the distance. The pipeline is mounted on concrete supports and stretches along a natural slope. Its surface is silver-gray with some small, square-shaped metal fixtures attached to it. Surrounding this pipeline, the landscape includes shrubby plants and rocky soil typical of a dry, possibly Mediterranean environment.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, with visible blue sections and some fluffy white clouds. In the background, there is an electric power pylon, hinting at industrial activity in the region. No people are visible in the image; the focus is primarily on the infrastructure and its setting in the landscape.","title":"Penstock bringing water to power plant","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["545615","549118","547571","549000","552432","548932","543170","548843","553902","545997","547949","546829","552689","549204","544102","552544"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipeline","pylon","fixture","silver","support","slope","power","soil","region","section"]}
