{"path":"555605.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a view from an indoor perspective, looking out through two adjacent open doorways. The doorways frame a serene rural landscape, presenting a strong juxtaposition between the darkness of the interior space and the sunlit exterior.\n\nThe left doorway reveals a single, tall pine tree set amid overgrown grass and brush. This scene includes glimpses of more distant trees and a somewhat clouded sky. The contrast between the dark interior and the sunlit view emphasizes the greens and browns of the natural surroundings.\n\nThe right doorway offers a broader view that includes a rustic dirt road curving through a grassy field. A wooden fence line follows the road, aiding in leading the viewerâ€™s eye through the scene towards a gentle hill in the distance. The day is bright outside, illuminating the details of the fields and rural terrain.\n\nThe interior from which this view is taken appears to be old and somewhat dilapidated, with cracked and peeling walls that suggest abandonment or disuse. This interior condition starkly contrasts with the vivid beauty and liveliness of the external landscape, creating a poignant dynamic within the photograph. The sparse interior increases the focus on the windows' views, making them the central thematic elements of the image.","title":"View from the interior of an abandoned farmhouse across land strip mined by coal companies off Route #800, near Edgewater Park, Ohio, and Barnesville.","placename":"Edgewater Park (Ohio)","location":"Edgewater Park, Ohio","nn1":["545810","544281","556738","555295","544811","555818","554822","552527","545233","552515","551076","545825","545821","555632","556962","554401"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["doorway","interior","view","liveliness","brush","disuse","dynamic","field","pine","darkness"]}
