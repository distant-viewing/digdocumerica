{"path":"549027.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, rural scene with several elements of pastoral life. A herd of cows, mostly black and white, are gathered by a river, some standing in shallow water. A herder, wearing a white garment and a hat, stands among the cattle on the riverbank, appearing to supervise or guide them.\n\nThe river bank curves gently and is flanked by dense vegetation, including bushes and various trees, hinting at a fertile environment. Beyond the river, the terrain rises slightly and is covered with sparse, semi-arid vegetation. In the distance, flat fields and low hills can be seen under a blue sky lightly dotted with clouds, indicating a spacious, open landscape typical of a rural setting.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of daily life in a pastoral environment, emphasizing the interaction between livestock and nature. The colors are natural and earthy, contributing to the tranquil and timeless quality of the image.","title":"Watering cattle in the Colorado River at San Luis, Mexico","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["544535","542626","550833","552465","545153","554560","546102","553105","542627","554128","551157","554071","555645","542628","553100","557022"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["river","herd","cattle","cow","garment","livestock","curve","riverbank","life","vegetation"]}
