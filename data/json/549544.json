{"path":"549544.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and powerful scene of a waterfall, most likely Niagara Falls, from a high vantage point. The shot shows a large body of water plunging down the waterfall, creating a dense mist that rises above the base of the falls. The vibrant swirls of water at the top cascade into the frothy, white foam below, emphasizing the waterfall's force and scale.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, amidst the swirling mist, a faint rainbow is visible, adding a touch of color to the predominantly blue and white hues of the water and mist. The river upstream appears calm compared to the turbulence at the waterfall's edge.\n\nSeveral boats, possibly tourist vessels, can be seen navigating the waters near the falls, providing a sense of scale and human activity in contrast to the natural majesty of the site. The far side of the river features a tree-lined shore, further framing this natural spectacle.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its expansive view of the water and the inclusion of human elements like the boats, creates a dramatic and engaging scene that showcases both the power of nature and human interaction with it.","title":"At the base of the \"Bridal Veil\" falls on the American side, a group of yellow raincoated tourists observe the plunging waters.
