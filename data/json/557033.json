{"path":"557033.jpg","date":"November 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is a close-up portrait of two people. The main subject, prominently displayed in the foreground, is an older man with pronounced features. His face is partially illuminated, highlighting his greying hair, his skin's texture, and the lenses of his large, round-framed glasses. The lighting casts deep shadows, accentuating the contours of his face and the reflective property of his glasses.\n\nBehind him, slightly out of focus, is another person, also wearing similar round-framed glasses, suggesting a shared context or possibly a mirrored setting, perhaps in a professional or academic environment.\n\nThe background is dark and indistinct, drawing full attention to the expressive, detailed visage of the man in the foreground. The mood conveyed by the lighting and the subjectsâ€™ serious expressions suggests a moment of intensity, possibly captured during a conversation or a thoughtful activity. The overall composition and use of light create a dramatic and somewhat introspective atmosphere.","title":"Chairman of the board of Concerned about Trident, Irving Clark, Jr., Seattle attorney, attends a meeting of the group at his Kitsap country house, at Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, Washington. The group is concerned that the Navy adheres to all applicable laws as the Trident submarine base is built nearby. Some 27,000 new residents are projected for the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Bainbridge (Wash.)","location":"Bainbridge, Washington","nn1":["554097","557035","556452","554340","553055","556443","543701","543849","557034","551337","557907","556563","552103","552872","547282","554857"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Portrait"],"terms":["glass","subject","face","portrait","skin","intensity","property","contour","context","conversation"]}
