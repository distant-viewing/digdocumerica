{"path":"549131.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a rugged, natural landscape with a scene of an industrial railway traveling through it. In the foreground and the sides of the image, you can see rocky terrain with sparse vegetation. The earth here exhibits a variety of colors, predominantly shades of brown, beige, and hints of greenery, which suggests a semi-arid environment.\n\nCentral to the image, a yellow and black diesel locomotive pulls a long line of uniformly dark, hopper cars, possibly filled with coal or another type of mineral material. The train curve gently along the bending tracks provides a sense of motion through this rather harsh and deserted terrain.\n\nThe background of the scene reveals gently sloping hills, which appear extensively eroded, forming ridges and troughs that suggest a history of intensive geological activity. The sky above is partly cloudy with sizable, soft white clouds floating against a bright blue background, suggesting a fair weather day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the contrast between the man-made elements represented by the train and the natural roughness of the landscape. The perspective is slightly elevated, looking down upon the train as it winds its way through the valley, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the industrial activity within a vast natural space.","title":"A trainload of coal from the western energy mine near colstrip passes through a landscape of old strip mining spoil piles","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555887","543826","543725","556382","556003","556111","554834","548129","547999","556009","545541","544035","545378","556106","556851","555883"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","bending","trough","eroded","locomotive","slop","coal","history","pull","ridge"]}
