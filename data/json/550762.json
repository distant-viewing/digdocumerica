{"path":"550762.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic urban scene centered around a cascading water feature in what appears to be a city plaza. The significant element in the foreground is a series of wide, shallow steps over which water flows creating a waterfall effect. These brick-lined steps lead up to a seating area where multiple people, possibly visitors or city dwellers, are seated facing away from the camera. They seem to be enjoying the scene, gathered socially while some eat and chat.\n\nIn the background, modern architectural structures dominate the skyline. Of prominence is a tall office building, its sheer size and austere design typical of mid-20th-century architecture, looming in the background. To the left is a lower, elongated structure featuring uniform rows of windows and a flat roof which, like the skyscraper, showcases a utilitarian architectural style.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting it could be either a late morning or early afternoon. The lighting in the photo indicates a bright day but with sufficient cloud cover to cast a soft light, enhancing the calming effect of the water feature below.\n\nThe scene is a blend of natural and man-made elements, offering a respite and a recreational spot for city residents amidst urban structures. The overall composition encapsulates both the grandeur and the functional aspect of an urban setting designed for public utility and aesthetic appeal.","title":"Cool water falling in tiers into basin at City Hall Plaza helps to alleviate the midsummer heat.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550747","550752","551647","551661","552703","551663","557258","551772","557267","552726","557282","557261","550751","551480","553224","551651"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["step","city","dweller","respite","effect","prominence","resident","plaza","seating","appeal"]}
