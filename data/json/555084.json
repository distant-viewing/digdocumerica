{"path":"555084.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a striking natural landscape dominated by large, rugged rock formations that have a dark, almost black, coloration. The texture of the rocks is distinctly rough and porous, indicative of volcanic origins, with speckles and small irregular cavities across their surfaces. Among these formations, a notable element is a slanted, partially exposed log in the foreground that has a lighter color, contrasting starkly with the dark volcanic rocks. This exposed log is weathered and bears whitish striations, perhaps a result of long-term environmental exposure which has stripped it of its bark.\n\nThe backdrop of the image showcases a bright blue sky sparsely dotted with fluffy, white clouds, creating a vivid contrast against the dark tones of the rocks. The stark lighting suggests it is a sunlit day, highlighting the textures and the uneven topography of the rock surfaces. There are no visible human activities or presences in the image; instead, it captures a sense of rugged and wild natural beauty, emphasizing the enduring and imposing presence of geological formations shaped by natural processes over centuries.","title":"Douglas fir seedlings growing in a burned clear-cut area of Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552444","544363","552685","552890","543421","545805","554410","552445","544453","555592","552546","550428","545804","545792","544376","545791"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","log","expose","origin","striation","speckle","endure","coloration","result"]}
