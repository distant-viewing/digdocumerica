{"path":"551744.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban garden scene, likely captured in a bustling city area, judging by the presence of high density, older-style apartment buildings and several storefronts visible in the background. On the left side of the image, a row of commercial establishments can be seen, including a chemist's shop and a luncheonette, labeled \"St Vincent Chemists\" and \"Luncheonette\" respectively. These shops are situated in a classic brick building that showcases the typical architectural style possibly from the early to mid-20th century.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by a meticulously maintained public garden full of lush and vibrant flowers, with patches of marigolds and roses noticeable. This colorful and well-kept garden contrasts pleasantly with the urban setting.\n\nIn the middle of the garden, there is an elderly woman dressed in a light, probably white, coat and hat, pushing a shopping cart. She appears to be either tending to the plants or simply enjoying a walk through the garden.\n\nBehind the garden and across the street, there are parked cars, hinting at the area's activity and accessibility. The cars appear to be models typical of the late 1960s or early 1970s. There's also a glimpse of a street sign that reads \"Greenwich,\" suggesting that the photo might be set in an area named Greenwich, potentially pointing to a neighborhood in New York City like Greenwich Village.\n\nThe entirety of the scene offers a quaint and tranquil vibe, presenting a stark contrast between the vibrant, natural elements of the garden and the dense, urban environment surrounding it. The inclusion of well-groomed public spaces within a bustling city area emphasizes community and the integration of natural beauty into urban life.","title":"Painter in the garden opposite st.
