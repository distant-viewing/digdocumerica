{"path":"551540.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image captures two small sailboats on a body of water that sparkles under the light. Each boat has a different set of sail markings and they are both tilting slightly under the force of the wind, indicating some speed. The surface of the water appears calm with a gentle ripple, highlighted by the shimmering reflections of sunlight, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe background of the photograph is a striking contrast with a dark, possibly stormy sky in a deep green hue. This dramatic backdrop emphasizes the brightness of the sunlight on the water and highlights the sailboats as the focal points in the scene. The combination of the dark sky and the glowing water creates a serene yet somewhat moody atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image with its contrasting colors and the dynamic angle of the sailboats suggests both tranquility and motion, capturing a beautiful moment of sailing.","title":"No motors disturb the quiet of Lake Calhoun.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552351","544669","549406","544663","544667","552345","548118","544697","547781","551539","548203","549424","544021","552352","548247","548498"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sunlight","sailing","speed","marking","force","sail","water","brightness","set"]}
