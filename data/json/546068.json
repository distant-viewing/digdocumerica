{"path":"546068.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an older man standing in a rustic setting that suggests a farm or ranch. The man, who appears to be in his middle-aged years, wears a saturated blue shirt with buttoned pockets and a tan cowboy hat. His facial expression is serious and direct, looking straight towards the camera with glasses on.\n\nHe is framed by a white wooden gate, which is part of a larger structure that looks like livestock pens or corrals typically found in farming or ranch settings. The gate, showing signs of wear and tear and painted white, features traditional hardware and wooden beams that cross horizontally and vertically. \n\nIn the background, there are further indications of a ranch-like environment, with visible structures that resemble barns or farm storage buildings. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light on the scene, which enriches the color saturation, particularly in the man's attire and the rustic wooden elements surrounding him. The overall mood of the photo is contemplative, with a strong sense of place and character rooted in rural life.","title":"Workman at Dominick's stock yard","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["547679","549120","553091","545087","547311","553516","554926","552561","549051","542548","554915","554948","549198","549042","558333","552581"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["ranch","gate","farm","hardware","indication","tear","root","pocket","pen","cowboy"]}
