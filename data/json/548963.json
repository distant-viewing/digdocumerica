{"path":"548963.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural setting with a group of people engaged in an outdoor activity, presumably hiking or exploring. The scene is taken during the day under clear skies.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a group of four individuals. Three of them are standing and one is sitting, all seemingly taking a break or enjoying the view. The attire of the individuals suggests a casual, recreational outing, with one person wearing a cowboy hat which adds a distinct touch to the setting. The people are situated on a slightly rocky hill that slopes down towards a vast body of water.\n\nThe background features expansive views of a tranquil lake surrounded by rolling hills. The lake meanders into the distance, bordered by land that varies in color from dark browns to lighter sandy tones. The terrain around the lake appears rugged and arid, typical of a desert-like landscape. This suggests the location might be in a region with such geographical features, possibly somewhere in the American Southwest.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its wide scope and natural beauty, conveys a sense of tranquility and the pleasure of exploration within a majestic outdoor environment. The clear blue skies and the gentle ripple of the water help emphasize the peacefulness of the setting.","title":"Baptism ceremony at Lake Mead performed by members of the \"Church of God in Christ\" of North Las Vegas","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["545780","545710","543998","543443","554516","552978","549716","554491","554509","545293","543892","544025","543816","543535","545745","552982"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["lake","help","scope","pleasure","cowboy","peacefulness","group","hill","outing","break"]}
