{"path":"548824.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a suburban neighborhood. The landscape shows a series of detached, single-story houses, most of which boast similar architectural designs with varying shades of brown and beige roofing. Each house appears to have a small, well-maintained front yard, and many have driveways with parked cars.\n\nThe houses are organized along two perpendicular streets. The main road running vertically in the image is wider and seems to be a primary thoroughfare, while the horizontal lane is quieter, flanked by homes on either side. The neighborhood is in an early development stage, evidenced by vast barren land and undeveloped plots visible around the community.\n\nA few of the homes boast backyard swimming pools, one of which is kidney-shaped and another is circular, providing a recreational space for the residents. The area outside the immediate neighborhood is sparse and undeveloped, showing arid terrain and very few signs of vegetation.\n\nOverall, the image presents a quiet, developing suburban area with basic amenities, emphasizing the ordered layout and residential focus of this community.","title":"Housing--lake havasu city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549071","547769","548112","547211","544510","553699","556975","544550","553970","547435","548825","553700","546399","544604","553937","553934"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["boast","neighborhood","house","home","thoroughfare","backyard","amenity","driveway","roofing","community"]}
