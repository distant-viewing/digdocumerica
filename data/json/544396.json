{"path":"544396.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, rustic landscape featuring two primary structures and a picturesque background. The foreground shows a large, circular building with a conical, dark roof and a small chimney at the center. Adjacent to this structure is a traditional wooden cabin with a slanted roof. Between these buildings, there's a handmade drying rack with clothes hanging out to dry, indicating domestic activity.\n\nThe area surrounding the structures is covered with dense, low-lying shrubs typical of arid or semi-arid environments. The middle ground is relatively flat but speckled with similar vegetation and stretches towards a distance that gradually ascends into impressive rock formations.\n\nThe background is dominated by dramatic natural features, including steep cliffs and layered rock formations characteristic of a canyon or mountainous desert region. The color palette includes earth tones that range from deep reds and browns to lighter shades of green, suggesting a landscape that might frequently experience dry or hot weather. The entire scene encapsulates a serene yet rugged rural setting, possibly situated in a desert or semi-desert region like those found in the Southwestern United States.","title":"The Hogan is the traditional dwelling of the Navajo Indians.","placename":"New Mexico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544137","545809","556628","556629","544429","546149","557947","556623","544865","555881","543658","555609","547658","543339","545817","544911"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["desert","formation","region","rack","rock","roof","canyon","clothe","cabin","cliff"]}
