{"path":"554434.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or logging scene characterized by a large pile of cut tree logs occupying a significant portion of the frame. Two tall, slender cranes flank the pile, one on each side, suggesting they are either adding to or removing logs from the pile. The background shows a slightly hazy, overcast sky with a hint of hills or distant terrain, adding a sense of spaciousness to the scene. Along the bottom foreground, there's sparse vegetation and what appears to be the edge of a dirt road or path, leading the viewer's eye towards the logs and cranes. The overall atmosphere is one of active outdoor industrial work, possibly related to logging or construction, set against a rural or semi-wilderness landscape.","title":"Logs piled outside the new International Paper Company mill at Ticonderoga ready for loading by cranes","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["550337","548155","552163","545256","554419","542859","554416","545260","545649","542942","546236","552162","550350","543749","552161","542945"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","pile","crane","spaciousness","bottom","portion","path","dirt","eye","construction"]}
