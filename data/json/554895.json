{"path":"554895.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures two people, a man and a woman, sitting at a wooden table inside what appears to be a small store or shop. The setting has an informal, cluttered ambience stuffed with various items which suggest it may be a local general store.\n\nThe woman, seated on the left, is wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and is resting her arm on the table, leaning slightly backwards. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and a serious expression. Her body language suggests a casual or relaxed moment as she interacts or waits.\n\nThe man, on the right, is seated in a metal folding chair and is dressed in a striped, long-sleeved shirt. He sports dark-framed glasses and has a neat hairstyle, smiling gently towards the camera. His posture is upright, showing attentiveness.\n\nThe table in front of them holds various items that add to the busy nature of the environment. Visible are a red typewriter, several stacks of papers or magazines, small boxes probably containing merchandise like tobacco, a book lying open, and an ashtray which contains several cigarette butts, pointing to a habit or the acceptance of smoking in the setting.\n\nThe background is packed with more items, including numerous cigarette packs (brands like Winston and Salem visible), chewing tobacco tins, and an assortment of household goods and food items on shelves behind them. Thereâ€™s a visible array of product advertisements and promotional posters on the walls, adding to the commercial feel of the space.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a poignant snapshot of daily life within what could be a family-run store, showing personal and commercial elements blended together in a small community setting. The image carries a vintage feel, hinted by the style of clothing and the older model of the typewriter, suggesting it might have been taken several decades ago.","title":"Woman owner in her grocery store in Leakey, Texas, with a friend, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554268","547405","545970","554866","556576","558301","551337","552114","557686","558314","554037","557353","557359","548439","547421","547805"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["store","item","table","cigarette","folding","smoking","pack","tin","magazine","merchandise"]}
