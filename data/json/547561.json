{"path":"547561.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene maritime scene at dusk. In the foreground, there is a body of choppy water, with ripples reflecting the fading light. A small buoy floats near the center bottom of the frame, attached to a line of buoys that disappear into the distance toward the middle of the image. \n\nA motorboat, occupied by at least two individuals, one standing and one seated, is positioned close to these buoys. The standing individual appears to be engaged in some activity, possibly managing equipment or navigating.\n\nIn the midground, there is a larger fishing trawler. It features a high stern, large net booms extended from its sides, and an elevated wheelhouse. It suggests that the boat might currently be in operation or preparing for a fishing activity. A small skiff is also visible, maneuvering near this larger vessel.\n\nThe background features a robust lighthouse, marking the edge of navigable waters. Its traditional structure consists of a cylindrical lower portion topped with a smaller cylindrical watchtower, complete with a lantern room. The silhouette of the coastal landscape, possibly some low islands or a distant shoreline, extends further in the background, under a dusky sky. \n\nOverall, the composition and tone of the photograph create a tranquil maritime atmosphere, emphasizing the activities of maritime work against a beautifully subdued natural backdrop.","title":"Fishermen pull out trap nets at the end of the April May season.
