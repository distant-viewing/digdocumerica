{"path":"558366.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of several Chief Brand corned beef cans on a conveyor belt system in a manufacturing or packing facility. The cans are predominantly red and feature an illustration of what appears to be a Native American chief's head, alongside text that includes the brand name \"Chief.\" The cans are aligned on the conveyor tracks, conveying motion or an ongoing packaging process.\n\nThe conveyor belt curves gently in the captured frame, displaying a robust build possibly made of metal, suggesting a heavy-duty industrial setting. The background is slightly blurred due to the focus on the moving cans, emitting a somewhat dark, industrial ambiance. The lighting in the image highlights the shiny surfaces of the cans and slightly reflects off the metal parts of the conveyor system.\n\nThere is no visible human activity in the immediate area captured in the photo, indicating the automated section of a production line. The overall impression is that of a snapshot of modern industrial food processing, emphasizing efficiency and volume.","title":"Germans like their beer and their descendants, are no exception.
