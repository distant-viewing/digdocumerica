{"path":"548513.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic and colorful sailing scene. The composition primarily features a close view of a dark-hulled sailboat seen from the stern, with several crew members actively engaged in sailing. The boat is leaning slightly to the left under the tension of its billowing white sails.\n\nFour people are visible on the boat, all wearing casual summer attireâ€”shorts and no shirts. The nearest individual stands at the stern, leaning on the railing, looking towards the horizon or possibly another sailboat. This person's stance and position offer a focal point leading the viewer's eye towards the distant waterscape.\n\nIn the background, the ocean expanse is dotted with other sailboats, which vary in size and sail colors, adding layers and depth to the scene. One notable sailboat in the mid-ground features a two-tone sail (blue and white) that stands out against the predominantly white sails of the other boats. This background adds a sense of scale and activity to the scene, showcasing the popularity and competitive nature of sailing in this area.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright, suggesting a perfect day for sailing with ample wind. The lighting is vibrant, accentuating the crisp white of the sails and the reflective surface of the water. This photograph captures the essence of marine leisure sports, emphasizing teamwork, skill, and the beauty of sailing on open water.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549386","547458","549394","548526","549388","549421","549404","549426","544667","549392","548494","549425","549389","547450","548203","544021"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","sailing","boat","popularity","lean","waterscape","skill","tension","teamwork"]}
