{"path":"549102.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting featuring a group of people engaged in various leisure activities, against the backdrop of dramatic, mountainous terrain. The lighting suggests it's either late afternoon or evening, casting a soft hue over the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a grassy field where two separate groups of individuals are enjoying their time outdoors. On the left side of the image, three young males are in motion, one of them appears to be running actively, while the others seem to be walking or possibly beginning to run. Their casual attire and relaxed postures suggest a friendly, non-competitive environment. \n\nOn the right, near a chain-link fence that runs horizontally across the middle part of the image from the right edge, there are additional people. A few individuals, including children and adults, are around and near what looks like a batting cage or a sporting area. One adult in a white hat and red shirt is seen guiding or instructing a child.\n\nThe landscape behind them is striking, showcasing layers of mountains with rich textures and varying shades of blue and purple, giving depth to the scene. The mountains appear rugged and barren, providing a stark contrast to the green, lively activity-filled foreground. The tranquil yet powerful nature backdrop complements the human element, emphasizing a sense of space and freedom. Overall, the composition of the photo balances the human activity with the grandeur of the natural environment, capturing a moment of simple joys and the beauty of the outdoors.","title":"Lake havasu city's young baseball players","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545710","553370","554072","543998","544093","545601","543234","545780","554509","552033","544739","546259","545782","554672","557771","548963"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["run","instruct","adult","cage","child","strik","begin","freedom","mountains","group"]}
