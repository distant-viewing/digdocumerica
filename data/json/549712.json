{"path":"549712.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a glassblowing studio or craft demonstration area. A man, likely a craftsperson or artisan, is seated at a bench engaged in the precise work of manipulating molten glass using a torch. He wears glasses and is dressed in a patterned short-sleeve shirt and khaki pants. His focus and craftsmanship suggest he is skilled and possibly making a delicate piece of glassware, as evidenced by various glass items displayed on shelves behind him.\n\nIn front of the artisan, a group of spectators watches intently. This group includes two young boys and a man. The man and one of the boys are leaning forward, showing keen interest in the glassblowing process. The boys look particularly fascinated or possibly in awe, capturing a moment of educational observation. The onlookers' expressions range from curiosity to intense concentration, highlighting the intriguing and absorbing nature of the glassworking display.\n\nThe background is somewhat dark, directing the viewer's focus more on the brightly lit working space of the artisan and the vivid flames from the torch. The overall ambiance suggests a mix of a workshop and an exhibition space, designed to educate and fascinate visitors about the art of glass making.","title":"A glass blower enthralls visitors to the craftsmen's area on Bob-Lo Island.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["557678","556267","542664","549349","553269","557932","548231","558303","556269","549695","548252","546277","543801","558356","556557","554864"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["boy","glass","making","glassware","demonstration","exhibition","khaki","craftsmanship","flame","onlooker"]}
