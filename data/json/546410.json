{"path":"546410.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene where two individuals are engaged in a fishing activity by a vast body of water. In the foreground, rough, dark rocky surfaces with sharp edges jut out toward a deep blue sea that sparkles with white flecks, suggesting the brightness of the sun reflecting on water. A man, standing and facing the sea, holds a fishing rod cast into the water, dressed in a white shirt and dark shorts. Next to him, on a lower rock, a small child in a white top squatting and perhaps observing the water or waiting.\n\nIn the background, the sea extends towards a city skyline marked with various buildings, cranes, and other structures faintly silhouetted against a mountainous backdrop. The skyline indicates an urban setting lining the coast. The sky above is expansive and mostly clear, with several significant, fluffy white clouds. The entire scene conveys a tranquil afternoon spent fishing against the picturesque landscape of a bustling city shoreline, under a vast, open sky.","title":"Father and son fishing on Isla de Cabras","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547884","543516","554008","552291","543240","553081","543156","543222","542740","543220","550942","551025","549935","543077","552257","548737"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["sea","skyline","fishing","fleck","squat","spend","sparkle","jut","coast","city"]}
