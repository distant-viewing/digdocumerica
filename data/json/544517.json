{"path":"544517.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of a butterfly, likely a hairstreak based on visible characteristics such as small size and tail-like extensions on the hindwings. The butterfly, perched on a flower, is predominantly gray with distinct white, red, and black markings along the edges of its wings, giving it a vivid and intricate appearance. These markings also include some spots near the body that are red encircled with black, enhancing its detailed beauty.\n\nThe butterfly is interacting with the flower, perhaps feeding on nectar. It's positioned with its wings partially open, allowing a good view of both the dorsal wing patterns and its body structure. The antennae, prominent and thread-like, have white bands and black tips, which are forward-pointing, suggestive of an alert position.\n\nThe flower on which the butterfly is perched appears to be yellowish-white, possibly from the family Fabaceae, noting its shape and size, typical of wildflowers found in natural grassy or meadow environments. The background is softly out-of-focus, featuring gentle hues of blue and green, hinting at a natural, outdoor setting possibly under bright, diffuse light conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing the detailed and delicate interaction between the butterfly and its environment, emphasizing the beauty and intricacy of the butterfly's markings and structure against a subtle, natural backdrop.","title":"Butterfly and wild flowers","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544514","544479","544553","544619","543603","544566","544618","544603","551381","547818","544614","554839","548284","548283","557585","554842"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","marking","perch","flower","thread","extension","intricacy","black","size"]}
