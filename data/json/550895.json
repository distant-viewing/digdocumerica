{"path":"550895.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph features a large, industrial maritime scene with two prominent ships. In the foreground, there is a red and white tugboat, actively moving on the water, indicated by the splash and waves surrounding it. The background is dominated by a massive tanker ship, labeled \"EXXON BALTIMORE.\" The tanker is painted in a dark red with a white superstructure, and its features include an array of exhaust stacks, cranes, and other nautical equipment necessary for its operations.\n\nBoth ships are set against a calm body of water, and the backdrop has a faint outline of shoreline, possibly with some industrial infrastructure. There is a prominent clear sky above, and no visible people are depicted in the scene. The focus of the photograph is clearly on maritime industrial activity, primarily shipping operations. Elements like the design and the size of the tanker, as well as the activity of the tugboat, suggest the movement and logistics involved in marine transportation.","title":"Tanker \"exxon Baltimore\" and tugboat in the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550892","550896","550894","550898","546909","557817","557816","546938","546845","550893","546751","551990","550904","546832","546828","545830"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tanker","ship","tugboat","superstructure","exhaust","logistic","operation","splash","crane","stack"]}
