{"path":"543298.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image features a coastal scene with dynamic ocean waves in the foreground. The ocean appears rough, with visible whitecaps and varying shades of dark blue and deep cyan, reflecting the intensity of the sea. The middle ground of the photo includes a construction or industrial area on the water, evident from the presence of a large crane and several industrial tanks positioned on a pier-like structure, suggesting some form of maritime industry.\n\nIn the background, across the sweeping bay, the coast is lined with dense trees and foliage, likely a forested area, and a few visible buildings suggest human habitation or activity. These structures are small and scattered, indicating a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is a clear blue, contributing to the vibrancy of the scene and enhancing the contrast between the natural environment and the industrial elements. The overall composition of the photograph brings forward a narrative of human intervention at the edge of a natural maritime setting.","title":"California--Big Sur coastline","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["554064","551953","543337","544976","552167","548079","545129","545122","543088","543291","545230","552000","544705","552192","553773","554102"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["ocean","whitecap","coast","maritime","intervention","vibrancy","intensity","bay","habitation","pier"]}
