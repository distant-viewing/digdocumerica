{"path":"545845.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a maritime scene featuring two large cargo ships. The foremost ship is facing towards the camera with its starboard (right) side visible, showing multiple cargo holds and a red hull, moving through the water and creating a prominent wake behind it. The second ship, visible in the background, is also large, painted in darker tones, and is captured in the process of making a turn, causing the water to swirl around its bow.\n\nThe setting is a large body of water with a narrow strip of land visible in the background, separating the water body from another which spans into the horizon. The land exhibits sparse vegetation and appears to be a constructed breakwater or embankment, suggesting this area might be part of a port or canal system. Industrial facilities or buildings are faintly seen in the far distance under a light blue sky.\n\nThe dynamic movement of the ships and their positioning suggests active navigation possibly entering or leaving the port area. The calmness of the water and the clarity of the sky contribute to a peaceful yet industrious maritime scene.","title":"Baytown ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545830","546828","551990","557816","548127","555721","548201","555810","557817","555722","552008","552020","555801","552010","555788","546751"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","port","cargo","breakwater","water","embankment","land","positioning","navigation","canal"]}
