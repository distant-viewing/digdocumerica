The group of people in the image, consisting of around 12 to 15 individuals, is gathered around a column covered in graffiti. The setting appears to be an urban area, with buildings, sidewalks, and a street visible in the background. The composition utilizes the column as a central point around which the people are grouped.\n\nIndividuals in the scene display a variety of late 1960s to 1970s fashion trends. They are wearing bell-bottom pants, patterned shirts, and dresses, with several sporting sunglasses. Most of the group are young adults. The hair styles range from long and straight to curly and voluminous. The expressions and posture of the individuals suggest a casual, social gathering possibly waiting or preparing to cross the street or simply congregating to chat.\n\nThe background includes typical city elementsâ€”trees lining the street, other pedestrians in the distance, and older model cars driving past. The scene conveys a day of casual urban activity characteristic of the era, exemplified by the sense of style, the public setting, and the relaxed interaction among the people.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: fascination of shifting reflections in chrome and stone sculpture.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553183","555906","551124","556808","549923","549909","545231","553264","551835","550082","553210","553319","553184","551820","558395","554178"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["street","column","fashion","trend","sporting","style","bell","individual","past","people"]}
