{"path":"550755.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph portrays an urban public space, likely a square or plaza. In the foreground, there is a vibrant bed of red flowers arranged in a square pattern, bordered by gray paving stones. This colorful addition adds a natural element to the otherwise urban environment.\n\nBeyond the flowers, the square opens up into a larger space where several people are seen engaging in various activities. Some people are sitting and chatting on the steps, while others appear to be walking through the plaza or enjoying the day. The square is equipped with multiple lamp posts and seating areas, facilitating both social interaction and relaxation.\n\nThe architecture surrounding the square features tall buildings, mostly modern in design. On the left, a building with green vertical elements rises next to a large, dark-toned building that dominates the background. Another significant building is a long, multi-story structure that curves around the plaza, enhancing the sense of enclosure and urban scale.\n\nThe sky is partially cloudy, suggesting a bright yet overcast day, which casts a soft light over the entire scene, enhancing the colors and shadows mildly. This setting provides a glimpse into city life, blending nature with urban design.","title":"City hall plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551800","550759","557257","551792","549988","551795","551794","551823","550003","557266","550751","551802","553324","553162","551797","553320"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["square","plaza","flower","chat","enclosure","addition","pave","seating","building","facilitate"]}
