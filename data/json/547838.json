{"path":"547838.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a large, multilevel boat adorned with the text \"Circle Line\" and \"Miss Liberty\" visible on its side. The boat, which is painted white with a yellow trim, appears to be docked or close to shore. It is filled with numerous passengers, who are crowded on all available decks. People are seen standing by the railings, looking out towards the viewer, suggesting a lively scene possibly of a tour or a cruise.\n\nThe top deck is open, exposing the passengers to the open air, while the lower decks have covered areas. Each deck is surrounded by protective railings. Many of the passengers are dressed casually, suitable for a day trip, and the atmosphere looks busy yet festive.\n\nIn the background, the view beyond the boat shows an open body of water, indicating that the photograph was taken at a large river or near the coast. The sky is blue with scattered clouds, hinting at pleasant weather conditions, conducive for such an outing.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of leisure and exploration, characteristic of scenic or touristic boat trips in urban areas.","title":"Circle Line ferry carries tourists to Statue of Liberty in Upper New York Bay.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549910","554176","549561","546840","554189","549412","543954","550029","551147","545736","554657","545728","549373","549541","543972","549707"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["deck","passenger","boat","trip","railing","cruise","tour","coast","trim","outing"]}
