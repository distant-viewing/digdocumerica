{"path":"553177.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively art fair or outdoor exhibition. The scene is framed by several wall panels densely packed with diverse art pieces, including framed photographs, prints, and abstract artworks. Some of these pieces are monochromatic, while others are vividly colored. The exhibit also features at least one sculpture, prominently displayed in the foreground, which appears abstract and is possibly made of metal.\n\nSeveral people are shown engaged in viewing the art and conversing. They are dressed in what could be considered relatively formal attire typical of perhaps the late 20th century, indicated by the style and cut of their jackets and trousers. The individuals vary in age but predominantly seem to be adults. The crowd's attention is directed towards the artworks, as they either discuss pieces amongst themselves or observe them quietly. In the background, the structure of the exhibition space is straightforward and functional, supporting the display panels and contributing to a focused, clutter-free environment that highlights the artwork.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests an engaging cultural event where attendees are deeply interested in the visual arts, providing a snapshot of social interaction within an artistic community.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: art show.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551666","553254","556261","546482","557723","553262","551808","553266","550076","551694","549314","551691","551693","551852","553250","549585"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["art","artwork","exhibition","piece","panel","clutter","sculpture","consider","discuss","attendee"]}
