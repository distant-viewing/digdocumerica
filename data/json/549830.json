{"path":"549830.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photo depicts a white sanitation truck parked on an urban street. The truck is labeled with the word \"sanitation\" prominently visible on its side. The truck appears to be a small, compact model, suited for city work, with a no-nonsense, utilitarian design. The vehicle number \"20E 030 D 9\" and a circular logo are visible on the cabin's door.\n\nOn the street beside the truck, there is a metal trash can, slightly dented and partially filled with trash. Adjacent to the trash can is a street post with attached signs indicating \"ONE WAY\" pointing to the right and another displaying the street number \"172.\" Above the street signs, there is a traffic control light facing the foreground.\n\nThe street appears somewhat dirty, with visible debris scattered near the curb and gutter. The overall scene captures a typical urban municipality environment, focusing on the daily operations and infrastructure of city sanitation management. The photograph's vantage point suggests it was taken from an elevated position, looking down onto the truck and street, under overcast or subdued lighting conditions.","title":"Sanitation truck on 172nd Street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549765","549759","549837","549775","549832","547975","549844","550147","550150","544091","549751","550159","553040","550162","551865","549771"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["sanitation","street","truck","trash","number","no","city","curb","can","cabin"]}
