{"path":"552733.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph capturing a vivid rural or semi-rural landscape. The central focus is an impressively long and straight canal or waterway, which cuts through the scene from the top middle to the bottom of the photograph. This water channel is flanked by parallel strips of green grass or maintained areas that run along each side.\n\nTo the left and right of the canal are diverse patches of dense forest and trees, showcasing a variety of hues primarily of green with hints of autumn colors like oranges and yellows, suggesting the photograph might have been taken in the fall season.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of the canal and trees, the broader landscape includes a mix of open fields and patches of residential or perhaps small farm buildings, distinguishable by small roofed structures. Several roads meander through the trees and houses, subtly integrating into the natural landscape.\n\nTo the far right, towards the horizon, the area opens up to a more developed landscape where clusters of buildings and perhaps a small town can be seen amidst strips of vegetation and open land.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a serene yet structured natural environment, juxtaposing human-built elements with natural forestry and water bodies, giving a comprehensive view of this mixed-use landscape. The lighting in the image is soft, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the gentle and tranquil feel of the scene.","title":"Pennsylvania--north west Philadelphia, Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["558002","553083","542713","549032","558043","558016","558047","553668","548896","556964","542510","553080","556971","544678","544536","549260"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canal","strip","landscape","forestry","integrate","channel","vicinity","meander","open","patch"]}
