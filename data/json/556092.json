{"path":"556092.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an emotional moment between two people engaging in a warm embrace in an outdoor setting, likely a train station or similar transportation hub. The central subjects are a man and a woman hugging each other closely. The woman, dressed in a patterned over-shirt with red sleeves and blue denim pants, has her back partially turned to the camera, obscuring her face. Her curly blonde hair cascades over her shoulders. The man, visible from the front, wears a plaid shirt and jeans, with his face partially visible as he leans in for the hug.\n\nIn the background, a silver, streamlined train car with a blue stripe and a logo is visible. The door of the train is open, suggesting either arrival or departure. A woman is visible in the immediate background, peering into the train from the platform, and there are more individuals in the vicinity, suggesting a bustling environment typical of a transport hub. The scene is set under bright daylight that casts sharp shadows on the ground, indicating the time of day to be around midday.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo is one of poignant farewell or reunion, underscored by the trainâ€™s presence, which both connects and parts individuals. The setting and the interaction displayed denote themes of travel, parting, and significant life transitions. The casual attire of all individuals suggests an informal event or a personal journey rather than a formal occasion.","title":"One last goodbye before passengers board the Empire Builder at Fargo, North Dakota, enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington. The Amtrak train was seven hours late because of a bridge washout. Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity rail passenger service, but leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556042","551934","557909","556091","556114","556700","556089","552931","556827","557898","556830","556041","551334","553543","547834","547072"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","hub","arrival","woman","departure","cascade","face","occasion","individual","silver"]}
