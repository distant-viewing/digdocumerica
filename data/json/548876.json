{"path":"548876.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elder male standing in a dry, harvested field with a large agricultural combine harvester in the background. The man is dressed in a traditional Western outfit that includes a white cowboy hat, a red neckerchief, a plaid long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and brown cowboy boots. His posture and facial expression convey a tough, weathered character, perhaps from years of working under the sun in the fields. A red and white “CASE 1660” combine harvester is visible directly behind him, which suggests that he is likely involved in farming or agricultural activities. The background shows a clear sky and flat, expansive landscape typical of rural or agricultural regions. The overall composition of the photograph, including the vibrant colors and clear focus on the subject and harvester, portrays a strong sense of rural life and labor.","title":"Harvesting wheat in the Palo Verde Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547734","548874","549051","549046","549042","554203","549259","544250","549036","547416","555619","547679","545087","548981","552677","552678"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvester","cowboy","combine","case","field","farming","year","male","boot","character"]}
