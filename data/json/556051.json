{"path":"556051.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a busy nighttime scene at a railway platform. The image shows a platform that extends horizontally across the image, illuminated by multiple overhead lights that cast a warm glow. Various groups of people are scattered along the platform, some standing and talking, others possibly waiting for a train. Their activities are varied, some appear engaged in conversation, and one person seems to be handling a bicycle.\n\nThe railway tracks are prominently visible in the foreground, shiny and reflecting light, suggesting they are perhaps wet or polished. The platform itself runs parallel to the track and features a series of supporting columns and a roof that shelters the area where the people are gathered.\n\nThe background is mostly dark, emphasizing the brightness of the lights above the platform and the lighter colored gravel of the track bed. The ambiance suggests a warm, community-like atmosphere with people casually interacting during their wait. The overall scene hints at a typical evening at a train station with passengers biding their time until their ride arrives.","title":"Passengers wait on the loading platform at night at the Fort Worth, Texas, station for the Inter-American train to St. Louis, Missouri. Few travelers boarded because officials reported the air conditioning was not working on most of the train. Old equipment and needed repairs to track and roadbed caused problems for Amtrak in the first few years since its 1971 takeover of most U.S. intercity passenger service.","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["556673","555959","555967","556667","556768","556855","556670","556649","556827","556778","556074","556686","556823","551895","556821","556041"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","track","railway","train","people","ride","standing","bicycle","bed","gravel"]}
