{"path":"552109.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a man in a dynamic pose, swinging an axe high above his head in a wooded area. The man, whose face isn't fully visible due to the angle and his own arm partially obstructing it, is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. He wears sturdy shoes and appears to be engaging in some form of physical labor, likely chopping wood or clearing ground.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor area rich with greenery; several trees can be seen around him, adding a sense of seclusion and natural environment to the scene. Behind him, in the background, there's an indication of a residential zone with what looks like the side of a house visible through the trees. This house is painted white and has at least one visible window.\n\nThe ground he stands on appears to be uneven and lightly covered with leaves, indicating that this might be a rarely disturbed part of the yard or wood. The lighting in the photograph suggests it could be taken during daylight, with natural light filtering through the trees, creating a play of light and shadow across the scene. This enhances the rustic and vigorous theme of the photo.","title":"On this island in the Kansas river between the 18th street and east Kansas avenue bridges, warren freeman, a loner, has built the home in which he lives.
