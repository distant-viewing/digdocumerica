{"path":"546346.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in outdoor activities next to a vehicle that bears the label \"EPA\" and an American flag. The setting features natural elements such as trees and tall grass.\n\nThe woman, on the left side of the image, has long, straight, blonde hair styled in braids. She is wearing a casual, light blue, sleeveless top and denim shorts. Her attention is focused on a clipboard she is holding, which she appears to be reading or writing on.\n\nThe man, on the right, wears a striped, black and white, short-sleeved T-shirt and blue jeans. He is using binoculars, looking through them with his right hand, the action suggesting he might be observing or monitoring the environment. His expression and posture indicate concentration and involvement in his task.\n\nBehind them, the vehicle is noticeable and substantial, only partially in view. It sports an \"EPA\" sign in yellow letters and an American flag, suggesting that these individuals might be conducting environmental monitoring or related work. The backdrop shows lush trees, contributing to a serene yet active setting, typical of fieldwork or environmental assessment activities.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: field trip to Mulatto Bay.
