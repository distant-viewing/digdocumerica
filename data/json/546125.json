{"path":"546125.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and striking scene of a narrow, multicolored water channel. The body of water displays a unique and intense color gradient that transitions from a bright, rust-like orange to a cloudy white. The orange part of the water appears along the left edge and is bordered by a rough, pebbly shore. This orange staining suggests the possible presence of iron or other mineral deposits which can discolor water bodies.\n\nTowards the center and moving to the right, the water's color fades into a milky white hue, creating a gentle and ethereal effect. The right bank of the channel is lined with dense green vegetation which partially obscures the water in places, adding a natural and untouched feel to the scenery.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a perspective right above the water, providing an almost aerial view that focuses on the contrast and the flow of colors in the water. The natural light enhances the intense colors and adds a reflective quality to the surface of the water, suggesting the photo was possibly taken during a bright day.\n\nOverall, the image likely depicts a natural or pollution-induced phenomenon in a waterway, characterized by striking color contrasts and a quiet, nearly still water surface, surrounded by natural foliage.","title":"Contaminated water in drainage ditch behind Pittsburg Glass Co","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["555626","545014","552430","544858","544692","543976","553427","551608","553388","551077","549244","549641","544790","548192","555705","544804"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","channel","discolor","phenomenon","iron","deposit","mineral","strike","color","gradient"]}
