{"path":"546588.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling, multi-layered road infrastructure scene. At first glance, prominent features include a large arched bridge spanning a body of water that looks like a river. The bridge is constructed with multiple arches, supporting a thoroughfare packed with vehicles.\n\nThe scene is viewed from a high vantage point which gives a clear view of roads that curve gently around the natural landscape. Directly below the bridge, there is another road segment which wraps around and under the bridge, indicating a complex interconnection that accommodates heavy traffic. The scene includes numerous cars and trucks using the roads; the traffic is dense but appears to be moving smoothly without apparent congestion.\n\nSurrounding the roads and the river are lush green areas, likely city parks or natural reserves, which provide a sharp contrast to the man-made structures. The colors in the image indicate that the weather might be overcast, lending a slightly muted tone to the landscape and vehicles.\n\nThere's a clear separation of inbound and outbound lanes with visible road barriers and lane markings, enhancing traffic organization and safety. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a focus on the interplay between urban development and natural landscapes, emphasizing a blend of functionality and environmental integration within a city setting.","title":"George Washington Memorial Parkway on Virginia, looking north to Key Bridge","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546569","546704","558049","546722","548401","546581","546689","546573","549861","549469","546718","546616","548418","546724","548413","553846"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","road","traffic","lane","glance","separation","thoroughfare","accommodate","congestion","reserve"]}
