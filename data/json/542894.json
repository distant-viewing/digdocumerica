{"path":"542894.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a nighttime scene centering on a cafe. The most dominant feature in the image is the vertical neon sign on the left that spells out \"CAFE\" in bold, red letters. The neon sign is brightly illuminated and stands in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.\n\nOn the right, there is a large window that allows a view into the interior of the cafe. Inside, the decor appears cozy and warmly lit, with a light bulb glowing brightly near the window. At least three people can be seen inside the cafe, engaging in what seems to be a casual interaction, potentially dining or conversing. The interior walls are adorned with simple decorations, including what looks like a framed picture.\n\nThe outside of the cafe is enveloped in darkness, suggesting that the photograph was taken late in the evening. The overall mood evoked by the lighting and activities is one of warmth and conviviality, offering a glimpse of a quiet, social moment at a local gathering spot.","title":"Ranchers having coffee","placename":"Laytonville (Calif.)","location":"Laytonville, California","nn1":["551320","551322","547779","547789","551321","551239","555446","553518","550037","551485","549677","551234","545462","551846","551634","544144"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["cafe","neon","darkness","outside","bulb","nighttime","decor","warmth","decoration","window"]}
