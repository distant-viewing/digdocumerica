{"path":"544447.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two clusters of rich orange lantana flowers glowing vibrantly in sunlight. Each cluster consists of numerous small, rounded blooms crowded together. The petals of the flowers are dappled with drops of water, possibly morning dew, which catch the light and add a sparkling effect to the image. The leaves surrounding the flowers are deep green, with visible veins and a slightly serrated edge, indicating a healthy, lush plant.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus, with shadows and patches of sunlight creating a contrasting backdrop that enhances the vividness of the orange flowers. The overall composition focuses on the beauty and delicate details of the lantana blooms, with the lighting and shallow depth of field drawing all attention to the moisture-laden petals, emphasizing their freshness and natural splendor.","title":"'Flowers'","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["548027","554587","543596","544875","543623","554115","542970","550464","543205","551369","553366","543597","547613","554574","543565","544890"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","bloom","cluster","drop","freshness","dew","vein","sunlight","moisture"]}
