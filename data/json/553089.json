{"path":"553089.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene with a man and a dog, possibly near a lake or sea. The man is seated on a cushy armchair placed outdoors on a pebbled ground, suggesting a makeshift, casual outdoor seating area. He appears to be an older adult wearing a dark gray shirt with pocket flaps and dark pants, complemented by black boots and a cap with a shiny peak, possibly indicating some form of uniform or official role.\n\nThe man is looking to the side with a relaxed posture, one leg crossed over the other, and his hands resting on the armchair. Next to him, on another similar couch, sits a small dog, attentively looking towards the camera. The dog has a pointed ear and a sharp gaze, and seems to be a small to medium-sized breed with a light-colored fur pattern.\n\nBehind them, a large body of water stretches across the horizon, bordered by a rocky and pebbly beach. The landscape includes distant hills or low mountains, contributing to a tranquil and somewhat remote setting. The overcast sky suggests a cool or temperate climate.\n\nStructural elements like a wooden post and part of a white building with a rustic appearance are also visible to the left of the frame, adding to the informal, rugged outdoor setting. This setting, combined with the personal and relaxed demeanor of the man and his dog, offers a glimpse into a moment of quiet companionship in a natural environment.","title":"Avery winnemucca is one of several paiute indians who run the dock at Sutcliffe's landing, Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["549928","554537","542874","556549","554126","543031","551516","549716","547148","547100","557637","556421","543500","543327","546077","557676"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dog","armchair","couch","breed","ear","man","companionship","medium","fur","pocket"]}
