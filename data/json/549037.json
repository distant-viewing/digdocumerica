{"path":"549037.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals situated in a vast desert landscape dominated by sand dunes. The dunes are large and rolling, characterized by their smooth, curving shapes and fine-textured sand. The color of the sand appears as a pale beige, forming a stark contrast against the clear blue sky in the backdrop.\n\nIn the composition, one individual is dressed in a red shirt and green pants, creating a bold color contrast against the muted sands. This individual is located to the left lower quadrant of the frame and is shown in motion, perhaps walking or climbing up the dune. The other individual, positioned at a lower point on the right half of the frame, is wearing a teal shirt and dark pants, also making their way across the sand.\n\nThe image portrays a sense of isolation within a serene and expansive natural environment. There are no visible structures or signs of civilization, suggesting a remote setting. The curves and slopes of the dunes create a pattern that highlights the wind's influence over the landscape. The overall mood is peaceful yet desolate, highlighting the magnitude and beauty of this desert scenery.","title":"Sand dunes in the imperial valley--near brawley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545199","547717","544869","545575","548906","550490","545196","545203","545767","555399","544089","543097","553058","543842","545755","545200"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["dune","sand","individual","desert","civilization","magnitude","quadrant","teal","curve","pants"]}
