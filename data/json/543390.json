{"path":"543390.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and lively scene at a beach during what appears to be late afternoon, given the warm golden lighting and long shadows. On the left side of the image, a young child in a red outfit is bending over, interacting with a large, fluffy dog, possibly playing or petting it. Standing next to them is another child wearing a black coat looking at what is happening. On the right side of the frame, further away towards the shoreline, there is a young girl dressed in a yellow dress, joyfully skipping or dancing along the sand. Her body position and the flutter of her dress suggest movement and playfulness.\n\nThe beach is moderately crowded with other visitors seen in the background, engaged in various activities such as walking along the shore or playing. The ocean waves can be seen gently crashing onto the shore.\n\nThe background is detailed with the coastline stretching across the frame and hints of scattered beach paraphernalia like towels or small beach tents. The overall mood is cheerful and relaxed, typical of a pleasant day out at the beach.","title":"California -- southern Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543395","545218","543396","543463","553072","544191","548695","548697","553951","543225","555923","544206","552341","555892","550924","547009"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","dress","playfulness","shore","child","tent","towel","dog","coastline","visitor"]}
