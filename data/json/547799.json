{"path":"547799.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph shows an aged two-story brick building on a street corner during daylight, under a clear blue sky. The building has a faded sign painted on the side with the words \"ALS MOTEL\" visible. The structure has a flat roof, and there appears to be some corrosion or wear on the facade. On the left side of the building, there is a large overhang which was likely used as a covered porch or entryway. The overhang is supported by dark, possibly metallic posts and is covered with a deteriorated long fringed awning, giving the building a somewhat neglected appearance.\n\nThe building has several windows; some of them are boarded up and others are covered with what appears to be dark reflective material. The visible doors are closed, and one door at the side of the building is boarded up. The street is mostly empty except for a parked car visible in the deep background and a street lamp directly in front of the building. The surrounding area lacks significant pedestrian or automotive activity, suggesting this photo was taken in a relatively quiet or less frequented area.\n\nThe general vicinity seems to be a small urban or town setting, with another low-rise building adjacent and trees visible in the background which hint at residential or mixed-use surroundings. The atmosphere, intensified by the deep shadows and the stark lighting, evokes a sense of abandonment or decline.","title":"On a corner in northside (the stockyards area) of ft.
