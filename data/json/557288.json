{"path":"557288.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a view down a narrow street lined with closely packed two-story houses in various colors, including white, blue, and brown. The architecture is reminiscent of early to mid-20th century American row houses, characterized by their steep roofs and narrow facades. Each house has small front stoops and multiple windows, some of which are accentuated with striped awnings.\n\nThe street itself is paved and includes a single lane for vehicles, flanked by sidewalks. A series of utility poles runs along the left side of the street, supporting multiple wires. The scene is set under a clear sky, suggesting a sunny day, casting shadows and brightening the colors of the buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, a vintage blue sedan is parked on the right side of the street. Two individuals are near the car, one appears to be getting into or out of the driverâ€™s seat, while the other stands beside the car, potentially engaged in conversation or waiting. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, providing a sense of scale and everyday life.\n\nIn the distance, the street slopes upwards, leading the eye towards hills visible in the background, which hint at a coastal or hilly urban environment. This setting evokes a sense of a quaint, tightly-knit urban community, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s based on the style of the car and the general ambiance. The environment is quiet and devoid of modern traffic, adding a nostalgic or historical feel to the image.","title":"Man washing his car while a youngster looks on in an older well-maintained ethnic community on the south side.
