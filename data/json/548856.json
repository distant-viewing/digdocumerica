{"path":"548856.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a woman in a lab environment. She is wearing a long white lab coat, and appears engaged in handling or preparing to handle large plastic containers filled with a liquid substance. These containers, which are a bit opaque and have their contents and numbers written on them in black marker, are arranged on a metal trolley. The woman has a focused expression, looking at the containers while reaching out to possibly move or organize them.\n\nIn the background, there are various pieces of laboratory equipment, including a large analog device with reels that resembles an old computer or data recording equipment, indicating a scientific or research setting. A telephone and some other smaller lab gadgets are visible on the countertops, further suggesting an active work environment accustomed to experiment and analysis.\n\nThe overall mood appears professional and the setting looks organized yet busy, typical of a research lab scene from a past era given the style of equipment and labware. The lighting is soft with no harsh shadows, emphasizing a calm but dedicated workplace atmosphere.","title":"Water samples, mailed from all over the country, are analyzed at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548862","548860","546278","546288","547710","548858","549354","546323","549342","542737","555253","549608","549607","549339","555249","546327"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lab","container","research","equipment","organize","recording","reel","handle","workplace","analysis"]}
