{"path":"553035.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a clinical setting where an older man is being attended to by another man, possibly a medical professional. The elderly man is partially reclined on a hospital bed, wearing a light-colored jacket and trousers. He appears frail and is using an oxygen mask connected to tubing, which suggests he is receiving respiratory support.\n\nThe person attending to him is dressed in a dark suit and wears glasses. He appears focused and concerned, examining the oxygen mask equipment or possibly adjusting it to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\nThe room has a clinical and somewhat dated appearance, highlighted by a plain, light gray-blue wall and a simple curtain that partitions the space, likely for privacy. Above the bed, a fluorescent light fixture provides illumination. The bed's metal railings and the breathing apparatus are also visible, contributing to the medical context of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of medical care, emphasizing themes of aging, health management, and the role of caregivers in medical settings.","title":"Doctor attends patient suffering from red lung, acquired in the iron mines.
