{"path":"548861.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image showcases a somewhat intriguing and clinical scene. In the foreground, there is a large, mechanical apparatus with several tubes or cables attached to its base; this appears to be some type of equipment, possibly for a scientific or medical purpose, though its specific use is not clear from the image alone.\n\nIn the middle ground, a woman in a white lab coat stands holding a sign with the number \"35\" on it. She is looking towards the camera with a curious or analytical expression. Her attire and the context suggest she might be a scientist or technician. In her environment, there are hints of a lab or research setting, marked by sparse, utilitarian furniture, and the clinical, almost sterile lighting and atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, through what appears to be a semi-transparent mirror or window, the reflection or silhouette of a man can be seen, adding a layer of complexity and depth to the composition. He seems to be in a different room but participating in or observing the same activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its mix of direct and reflective imagery, the scientific or analytic equipment, and the clinical setting suggest a scenario set in a research or medical facility. The inclusion of person-numbered signage indicates some form of experimentation or testing is likely taking place. The image has a somewhat vintage or dated feel, potentially placing it a few decades back.","title":"Laboratory at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548860","549358","549364","542765","546344","556567","555374","546327","556566","547319","555249","548856","555248","546285","542667","549610"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lab","research","number","experimentation","technician","scientist","imagery","testing","inclusion","tube"]}
