{"path":"548079.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic coastal scene dominated by powerful ocean waves and boating activity. The setting is a rough, surging sea adjacent to a rocky coastline. The image is anchored by a building perched on the edge of a cliff on the left side; its stark, industrial appearance contrasts with the natural ruggedness of the area. The ocean is showing strong wave action with white frothy water indicating turbulence, possibly near a waterfall, as immense waves crash against the rocks, sending spray high into the air.\n\nThere are multiple boats in the water, scattered across the frame. These boats vary in size and type, most appearing as small to medium recreational or fishing boats. The boats are navigating through the choppy waters, some moving towards the coastline while others are heading in the opposite direction. The boats and their activity provide a sense of scale and human interaction with the nature.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is dynamic and somewhat dramatic, emphasizing the power of the natural environment and human engagement with it. The photograph has a slightly grainy texture, suggesting it might be taken on film, adding to the dramatic and timeless quality of the scene.","title":"Crown-zellerbach corporation and publisher's paper company on the willamette river at Oregon city led the campaign to clean up the river.
