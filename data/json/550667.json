{"path":"550667.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape under an overcast sky. In the foreground, there is a large expanse of grassland highlighted with patches of yellow flowers, adding a bright contrast to the scene. Towards the middle of the image, a narrow strip of darker land, possibly a road or pathway lined with wooden fences, separates the meadow from a dense forest stretching behind it. The trees are lush and dark green, forming a dense wall of foliage that stretches horizontally across the image.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains rise against the horizon. They are cloaked in soft blue and grey hues, suggesting either distance or mist. Above the entire scene, heavy, textured clouds dominate the sky, casting the landscape in shadow and enhancing the moody, tranquil atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition is layered horizontally, with each band of color—the yellow and green of the meadow, the dark line of the forest, and the misty blue of the mountains—contributing to a peaceful and natural pastoral scene. The photograph has a calm and quiet quality, evoking a sense of isolation and untouched wilderness.","title":"Meadow bordering the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["549249","554722","556990","550604","549142","549139","543763","557099","548025","549227","549236","551370","545209","554982","552914","549238"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","cloak","forest","grassland","mountain","stretch","flowers","band","strip","dense"]}
