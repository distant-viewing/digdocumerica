{"path":"547502.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene where the foreground is filled with a white, frothy substance, which appears to be foam, covering the water's surface. The foam is thick and clustered, suggesting turbulent water conditions or possible pollution. The river flows between rocky banks, which are visible on either side forming a narrow channel that leads into the background. These rocky hills are barren and steep, adding a rugged character to the scene.\n\nThe water pathway created by the river leads the viewer's eye towards the horizon, which is positioned in the upper third of the image. The lighting seems to be of late afternoon or sunset, as indicated by the warm hues reflected on the frothy surface and the subdued light.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, the vast frothy coverage on the water and the enclosing rocky shores lend a slightly enclosed and perhaps neglected feel to the location, raising environmental concerns. There appears to be no human activity or any living organisms visible, which emphasizes the solitude and untouched nature of the landscape, apart from the possible environmental impact suggested by the foam. The overall composition uses natural lines formed by the riverbanks and the direction of the river flow, guiding the observation from the frothy foreground into the calmer waters in the distant center.","title":"Suds and foam on incoming tide","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547650","557240","553388","557252","550370","550742","550369","552137","544856","550686","550815","545168","550367","549482","550698","545164"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["foam","river","organism","calmer","flow","liive","water","banks","coverage","third"]}
