{"path":"547918.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a prominent red sign mounted on a grey pole, displaying the message \"NO FISHING ALLOWED VIOLATORS PROSECUTED\" in white uppercase letters. Below the sign, there's a number \"47\" in green on a white background, possibly indicating a location marker or distance. Beneath this, on a misty, seemingly cold day, we can see a bridge structure. A group of individuals, appearing relatively small due to the perspective, are gathered at the foot of the large bridge support. They are near a parked car, interacting or observing the surroundings. In the background, the hint of another structural element of the bridge can be seen, and the environment suggests a spacious, possibly riverine or coastal location. The sky is overcast, contributing to the grey and subdued color tones dominating the scene.","title":"At fort tilden army reserve facility on breezy point south of Jamaica bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544228","551430","557971","547836","544210","548141","550664","550850","551236","548846","558000","554567","542648","557762","544542","544216"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["bridge","grey","riverine","parke","marker","location","foot","misty","message","letter"]}
