{"path":"544655.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a striking nautical scene at sunset or sunrise. The main subject is a silhouette of a large cargo ship with multiple cranes and masts, positioned in the left section of the frame. The ship's outline is dark against the vibrant sky and reflective water.\n\nThe sun is prominently positioned in the sky, slightly off-center towards the right side of the photograph. It appears as a bright starburst, casting radiant light that bounces off the water surface, creating a shimmering path of light that leads to the viewer. This path is speckled with tiny, glittering reflections that suggest the water is relatively calm.\n\nThe sky itself transitions from a deep blue at the top to lighter tones near the horizon, indicating either early morning or late evening light conditions. There are minimal clouds, adding to the serene and open feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is mostly undefined due to the dark silhouette of the ship, but hints of structures or further ships can be seen at the distant horizon, contributing to an industrial or harbor-like environment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph skillfully contrasts the immensity and industrial nature of the ship against the natural beauty of the sun and water, creating a powerful interplay between mankind and nature. Overall, the image evokes a sense of tranquility and might in a maritime setting.","title":"Sunset","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544659","544247","550304","544251","550910","544657","550918","544701","547110","545277","550915","553991","553857","555721","545170","544238"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","glitter","path","silhouette","sun","mast","speckle","position","sunrise","shimmering"]}
