{"path":"549606.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene inside a laboratory. A person, likely male, is working intently at a lab bench, focused on adjusting or reading equipment. He is dressed in casual attire, wearing dark bell-bottom jeans, a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, and a red sleeveless vest. His hair is styled long and he wears a watch on his left wrist.\n\nThe lab itself is equipped with various pieces of scientific apparatus. The bench on which the person is working holds an array of instruments and devices that appear to be analytical or measuring equipment, possibly for chemistry or biology experiments. These include boxes with numerous buttons and digital readouts. There are also large white plastic jugs, likely containing chemicals or reagents, and various other smaller containers. The bench and walls are fitted with wooden cabinets and drawers, suggesting an organized environment for storing lab utensils and supplies.\n\nThe setting suggests an era that could be around the 1970s or 1980s, inferred from the style of the equipment and the person's fashion. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and scientific investigation.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
