{"path":"542650.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling, densely packed marina environment. The marina is filled with an array of houseboats and recreational boats moored in blue water. These structures vary widely in style, color, and condition, ranging from more traditional and modest designs to colorful and multi-storied houseboats. Some boats are equipped with upper decks and large external staircases, suggesting they are used for both living and leisure purposes.\n\nIn addition to the houseboats and boats, there are various floating platforms and docks, some of which are cluttered with items like chairs, and small personal items indicating daily use and habitation. The boats closest to the foreground appear older and more utilitarian, while those in the background seem to be better maintained or newer, with cleaner lines and less visible wear.\n\nThe water around the boats is calm, suggesting a protected area, possibly a bay or river inlet. There is no visible movement of the water, and no people are discernible in this image, giving the scene a static, yet lived-in feel. The background beyond the marina is a deeper blue, indicating a larger body of water or open sea, setting a natural contrast to the colorful, human-made elements at the foreground.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a vibrant and eclectic waterfront community, characterized by a mix of leisure and residential use, offering a glimpse into a lifestyle centered around water and boating.","title":"Launch dock in pine flat lake","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["552028","552027","542912","548078","542871","548075","546935","557450","546877","546853","548763","548969","548547","546388","545155","548543"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","leisure","item","water","addition","boating","staircase","lifestyle","use"]}
