{"path":"551618.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a communal gardening scene set against a backdrop of urban decay. The image shows several individuals—both adults and children—engaged in gardening activities within what appears to be a makeshift urban garden or community plot.\n\nThe center of the image is dominated by a large mound of dark brown soil, where most individuals are focused on their tasks. On the left, three women are either shoveling or raking the soil. Directly in the center and slightly to the right, children are participating as well; one appears to be around preschool age, and is playing next to the soil, while older children, possibly pre-teens, are actively using rakes on the ground.\n\nThe background provides a stark contrast to the foreground's flurry of activity. It features dilapidated buildings with exposed interiors, missing windows, and walls covered in graffiti. Some buildings are partially demolished, revealing the urban blight and neglect often found in inner-city environments.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with active, hopeful gardening in the foreground against the backdrop of urban decay, offers a poignant dichotomy that highlights themes of community effort, resilience, and rejuvenation amidst challenging and deteriorating urban conditions.","title":"City \"farmers\" plant flowers and vegetables in plots assigned by community association.
