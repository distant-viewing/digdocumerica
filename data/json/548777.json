{"path":"548777.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a coastal area. The central and dominating element is a long, narrow white structure that stretches diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, surrounded by water. The structure appears to be a man-made causeway or jetty, comprised of white material, possibly sand or crushed coral, lined by darker material, perhaps sandbags, that outline its edges and define the pathway.\n\nAt the far end of this structure, there's a smaller, distinct platform extending further into the water, where a white boat is docked. This platform suggests some sort of operational or recreational usage, such as a loading or unloading area.\n\nThe surrounding water is relatively clear, showing variations in color from dark blue to turquoise, indicative of different water depths and seabed compositions. The area directly around the structure shows lighter water colors, suggesting shallower waters. \n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a dense forest or mangrove area is visible, rich green in color, suggesting a thriving natural environment. A winding road runs through this greenery along the bottom left corner, hinting at some accessibility to this otherwise isolated area.\n\nThe top and right sides of the image blend into a lighter horizon where sky meets water, emphasizing the isolation and remote nature of the structure within its surrounding environment. Overall, the scene is one of human intervention juxtaposed against natural elements, possibly for conservation, transportation, or tourism purposes.","title":"Waterfront development at North Key Largo with \"plugged\" canal.
