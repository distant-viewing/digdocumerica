{"path":"556138.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a young child. The child appears to be leaning on or partially inside a large, possibly metallic object. Part of this object is visible in the upper left corner of the image and appears worn and rounded.\n\nThe focus is on the child's face, viewed slightly from above. The child has dark eyes, and their gaze is directed upwards towards the camera, conveying a thoughtful or intense expression. They have short black hair and their skin is dark. Dribble can be seen on the child's lower lip, adding a candid quality to the snapshot.\n\nThe child is wearing a dark-colored sweater with a lighter, possibly white or grey, collar that has two stripes. The background is blurred and indistinct, which isolates the child further in the frame, drawing focus primarily to their expression and upper body.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural light and shadow which highlights the child's facial features and the texture of the object they are leaning on, creating a moody and evocative scene. The photograph seems to capture a moment of quiet introspection or a brief pause in activity.","title":"A black child on the rear porch of a house in a very low income area on Chicago's west side. It is one of the many black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. The photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope, struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship and faith. In short, portraits of people who feel they are individuals and are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556140","556144","558394","553554","556139","543744","553170","551473","549299","552961","556146","556606","543476","557632","543870","553495"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","object","lip","introspection","pause","collar","expression","skin","gaze","sweater"]}
