{"path":"549025.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures the vibrant and colorful facade of the Golden Nugget Gambling Hall and Casino at night. The photograph highlights the dazzling lights and ornate signage characteristic of classic casino architecture. \n\nAt the top of the frame, rows of glowing, spherical white light bulbs are visible, part of an overhanging structure or marquee. The main focus of the image, the casino’s sign, is elaborately detailed and illuminated by numerous lights. The sign is topped with a large red circle featuring the words \"Golden Nugget\" in bold, stylized script surrounded by lights. Below, a larger frame encloses text that reads “Gambling Hall” in a vintage font, and below that \"CASINO\" in large, capitalized yellow letters, all set against a deep red background.\n\nThe building’s façade is decorated with rows of bulbs, and repeated text \"Golden Nugget\" alongside graphic elements that suggest an upscale, glamorous venue. The lower part of the image shows the street level few people visible walking in front of the casino.\n\nThe overall composition is rich in detail, evoking a sense of the bustling, lively atmosphere typical of a casino environment, particularly in a historical context. The lights, colors, and grandeur of the design are quintessentially associated with traditional gambling and entertainment venues.","title":"\"Night lights\"","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549026","549009","549015","553119","553139","549022","549017","545462","549014","551321","555446","545448","553196","553123","553121","545456"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["bulb","venue","text","script","entertainment","font","row","circle","light","characteristic"]}
