{"path":"554468.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day on a calm river with a group of people enjoying a recreational boating activity. Several canoes and kayaks are spread across the frame, each containing one or more individuals. The participants seem to be engaging in a leisure activity, some are paddling, while others appear to be resting their oars, suggesting a moment of relaxation or conversation. \n\nThe canoes and kayaks vary in color, showing a mix of blues, yellows, and whites, which add a colorful vibrancy to the image. The people, both males and females, are dressed in casual, lightweight outdoor clothing suitable for a warm day; some wear hats to shield themselves from the sun.\n\nThe background is densely filled with lush green trees, indicating a secluded river setting. The reflection of the trees in the water enhances the sense of a tranquil, natural environment. The overall composition of the photograph, with its spread of boats and backdrop of foliage, conveys a scene of communal outdoor enjoyment and the peacefulness of nature.","title":"Start of canoe races at Old Forge, New York, on the north branch of the Moose River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554469","552982","554465","553806","550768","553691","553343","543943","551350","553403","545734","558069","550659","557972","543881","551209"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["kayak","canoe","oar","female","spread","boating","peacefulness","participant","vibrancy","male"]}
