{"path":"552520.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph showcases a tranquil landscape under a vast sky. Most of the frame is occupied by a wide sky, featuring soft pinks and gentle blues, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. A few wispy clouds are scattered across the sky, adding texture and depth.\n\nBelow the expansive sky, a flat horizon of dark green vegetation extends across the image. This band is relatively narrow compared to the sky, emphasizing the openness of the scene. Against this backdrop, silhouettes of sparse trees are visible, with one prominent tree on the right side of the frame standing alone, its outline clear against the light sky.\n\nThe overall composition is simple but evocative, focusing on the serenity of the landscape under a vast sky, conveying a sense of calm and solitude. The photograph is captured in such a way that invites the viewer to feel the quietude of the rural scene. The bottom of the image, framed by a more solid black line, could possibly be a boundary of some sort, perhaps the edge of a window or a physical frame within the photograph.","title":"Sunset after rain--north of Donnellson","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["557182","552903","550390","552484","552899","547292","550391","550604","547649","548673","550537","550667","552914","552906","549249","556990"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sky","quietude","serenity","frame","pink","band","openness","sort","calm","boundary"]}
