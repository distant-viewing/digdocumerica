{"path":"542995.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and moody scene at twilight. It features a calm river in the foreground that reflects the subdued light of sunset, giving the water a smooth, mirror-like appearance. In the river, there are several posts sticking out of the water, and birds, possibly herons, are perched on some of these posts and others are seen flying above the water in the distance.\n\nIn the background, there is a silhouette of an industrial structure, likely a factory or processing plant, on the far side of the river. This plant includes large constructions, possibly silos, and elevated conveyor belts or walkways. These structures are outlined against the dimming sky, creating a stark contrast with the natural elements in the foreground.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is calm and somewhat somber, juxtaposing the natural beauty of the river and its wildlife with the imposing, man-made industrial backdrop. The dim lighting and the silhouettes add to the dramatic and tranquil ambiance of the scene.","title":"Heron in outlet.
