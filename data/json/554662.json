{"path":"554662.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of individuals on a nature hike through a densely wooded area during what appears to be the fall season, judging by the colorful autumn leaves. They are walking on a narrow leaf-covered trail amidst a thick forest. The trees surrounding them have turned shades of yellow and orange, hinting at a vibrant forest canopy. \n\nIn the foreground, a man in a casual outfit (white shirt and beige trousers) is walking with a young girl in a light blue dress. The man seems to be speaking to the girl while gesturing with one hand. Behind them, a second man, bald and wearing a dark top, is talking to a male hiker. This hiker is equipped with a backpack and dressed in a light jacket and jeans; he's listening to the bald man while walking. Further back on the path, other hikers, including both males and females, continue along the trail.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and leisurely, with the focus on the interaction among the hikers as they enjoy their walk in the natural setting. The forest floor is thick with fallen leaves, adding to the sense of a crisp, autumn day outdoors.","title":"Backpackers and hikers on a trail in the mount marcy area of Lake Placid, note the width, hard-packed surface and heavy use of the trail, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554705","554663","551764","543233","557005","545512","554502","553357","557206","554672","553364","543331","557007","544739","554665","554558"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["hiker","walk","trail","male","forest","autumn","girl","fall","female","man"]}
