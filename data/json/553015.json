{"path":"553015.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of an urban area featuring prominent highway infrastructure and a distant city skyline. The main focus of the image is a large, curving highway interchange that features several layers of ramps and roads connecting broadly in a sweeping pattern. These highways are moderately filled with traffic, though no individual vehicles are distinctly visible.\n\nIn the foreground and midground, there are multiple areas of commercial and possibly light industrial developments, which include several low-rise buildings, parking lots, and patches of green spaces like small lawns or trees scattered among the buildings. The area is geometric in its layout with blocks of buildings separated by roads.\n\nIn the background, the city skyline consists of several tall buildings indicating a metropolitan center. The horizon stretches into a slightly hazy sky, suggesting either distance-induced fog or air pollution, common in large urban environments.\n\nThe color palette consists of varying urban shades like gray, brown, and green, blending the natural and man-made elements. This aerial perspective likely aims to showcase the complexity of the cityâ€™s transportation network and its sprawling nature.","title":"Central expressway leading south into Dallas.
