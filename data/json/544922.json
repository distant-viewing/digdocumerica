{"path":"544922.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts the ancient ruins of a cliff dwelling, likely from a Native American settlement. The structure is multi-storied and made from tan-colored bricks or stones, skillfully stacked and mortared to form walls and various rectangular rooms.\n\nThe dwelling is nestled within a large rock alcove, which provides a natural ceiling and partial walls. Several rounded and squared towers rise from the base, with noticeable windows and openings that may have served as lookouts or ventilation. The stonework includes several ladders that lean against the walls, suggesting multiple levels were utilized and perhaps indicating these structures were inhabited over different floors.\n\nThe area surrounding the ruin features rugged, uneven terrain with large boulders and lush green trees, indicating a wilderness setting. Thereâ€™s a clear path that leads away from the dwelling, winding around the rock formations, suggesting this was part of a larger community or network of pathways used by the inhabitants.\n\nThe composition and lighting of the photograph highlight the architectural and historical significance of the site, capturing the intricate detail and formidable placement of these ancient structures within their natural environment. This image encapsulates a blend of historical architecture and the natural landscape that provided both shelter and strategic advantages to its inhabitants.","title":"Photograph of Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544952","544953","544927","544941","544919","544951","544948","544949","545554","545817","544421","544923","551344","545550","545565","545825"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dwelling","inhabitant","ruin","wall","stonework","ventilation","ladder","rock","shelter","placement"]}
