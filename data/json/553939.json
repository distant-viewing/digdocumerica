{"path":"553939.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a panoramic aerial view of a densely populated suburban area. The area is covered with hundreds of closely packed single-story homes, predominantly featuring flat roofs. The houses are mostly rectangles, and their rooftops display various shades of brown, gray, and white.\n\nThese residential units are neatly arranged in rows, and the streets that weave through the neighborhood are visible as thin gray lines, some curved and others straight, indicating an organized city planning. In between some of the homes, there are small patches of green, suggesting backyard gardens or small parks.\n\nThe backdrop of the image features a mountainous terrain, hinting that this suburb lies near hills or at the base of a mountain range. These elevations are covered with darker vegetation, contrasting with the more urban and built-up foreground.\n\nOverall, the scene paints a picture of a crowded but orderly suburb, likely part of a larger city, tucked away near natural elevations that might offer scenic views and possibly a cooler climate compared to the city center.","title":"Pearl City, on the west side of Honolulu, is the fastest growing area in all of Hawaii.
