{"path":"543608.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a large body of water, likely a lake. The foreground shows the tranquil waters, reflecting muted light. Beyond the waters, a treeline suggests a distant shoreline populated with dense forest of coniferous trees. Above the trees, imposing mountains, partially obscured by cloud cover, form the background.\n\nThe sky is a dramatic and prominent aspect of this photo, painted with dense clouds that appear heavy and full of moisture. The colors of the clouds range from deep purple and blue tones at the upper parts, transitioning to warmer orange and pink hues likely caused by the setting sun. This coloration provides a striking contrast against the darker, more subdued colors of the lake and land. The overall mood is peaceful yet somber, with the magnificent and slightly foreboding cloud formation dominating the scene. The photo captures the vastness and the quiet beauty of this natural landscape at dusk.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["554759","550646","552142","552319","554404","552277","552335","554405","554760","554399","554397","557497","547352","543604","543577","554752"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lake","treeline","coloration","cloud","moisture","cover","sunset","photo","aspect","vastness"]}
