{"path":"554584.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene scene of water lilies floating on a dark water surface. The lily pads are large and rounded, and they have a rich burgundy hue that appears to almost glisten with moisture. Some of the water droplets are visibly beaded on the surface of the leaves. There are several lily pads, some overlapping slightly, scattered across the frame. Amongst these, the bright yellow flowers of the water lilies provide a striking contrast to the deep, dark color of the water and the burgundy of the leaves. Two blossoms are visible, one in full bloom and the other partially open, suggesting an early stage of blooming. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is tranquil and natural, capturing a close-up view that invites contemplation of nature's quiet beauty. The dark background emphasizes the vivid colors and delicate details of the lily pads and flowers.","title":"Spatterdock or cow lily (nymphaea advena), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["554583","550809","544474","543598","555080","544592","544588","550808","545387","558095","547639","555044","550775","557587","554591","543561"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pads","burgundy","flower","blooming","blossom","water","droplet","glisten","moisture"]}
