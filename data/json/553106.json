{"path":"553106.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of outdoor activities in a rural, arid environment. In the foreground, two men are involved in what appears to be the branding of a calf, which is lying on the ground. One man, wearing a yellow cap, brown sweatshirt, and jeans, is bent over the calf, adjusting something near its hind legs. The other man, sitting next to the calf, wears a wide-brimmed straw hat, a red-striped shirt, and jeans; he seems occupied with work on the calf's front side.\n\nBehind these men, a group of people and horses are arranged more distantly. A few individuals are on horseback, while others stand or walk about the area. The attire and general ambiance suggest a ranching or rural setting, likely related to farm or livestock operations.\n\nThe landscape is wide and open under a clear blue sky, with distant hills framing the scene. The terrain is dry and sparsely vegetated. Off to the right, the background features a line-up of cars and camper vehicles, indicating that this location may also be an area of gathering for an event or communal activity. The overall impression is that of a dynamic rural working environment, likely revolving around traditional ranching or farming activities.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
