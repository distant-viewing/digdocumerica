{"path":"554095.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a fish market, where a variety of fish are displayed for sale on a dark, reflective surface, possibly wet from ice or water to keep the fish fresh. The fish are aligned in neat, long rows that recede into the background, each fish with a small, white label attached, likely indicating the type or price of the fish.\n\nIn the background, there are numerous people, mostly adults, who appear to be shoppers or observers. The individuals are dressed in casual attire, typical of a public market setting, with some wearing shirts, pants, and jackets. The environment suggests an indoor setting, possibly a large hall or covered market area, with diffused lighting that casts soft reflections on the wet surface where the fish are displayed.\n\nThe overall mood is one of casual commerce and public interaction, characteristic of a bustling market where local residents come to shop for fresh seafood.","title":"Fish auction is a daily event.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554098","554093","547848","550320","544987","545284","547856","544995","545063","542892","545274","546792","545198","552810","546216","543219"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","market","shopper","seafood","observer","hall","price","resident","commerce","ice"]}
