{"path":"554350.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of industrial elements with an iconic historical landmark. In the foreground, we see an uneven, dirt road flanked by wild, overgrown grass and small flowers, suggesting a somewhat neglected, rural or industrial area. Dominating the middle ground is a series of electrical poles, extending in a double row from the foreground into the far distance. The poles are uniformly spaced and carry multiple electrical lines, which suggest a significant, albeit unrefined, infrastructure.\n\nIn stark contrast to this industrial setting, the Statue of Liberty stands prominently in the background, centered in the frame and partially shrouded in a haze, which contributes to a sense of distance and isolation from the viewer. The statueâ€™s presence in the scene offers a profound visual commentary, perhaps on the American Dream or the interplay between progress and ideals.\n\nThe overall composition uses a deep depth of field, with the lines of poles leading the eye towards the statue, creating a strong perspective effect. The lighting appears to be natural, with a somewhat muted color palette, intensifying the industrial feel of the photograph while simultaneously highlighting the enduring symbolism of the statue.","title":"New Jersey flats near Hoboken, with the Statue of Liberty in background (left)","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554296","549803","549763","549781","549760","549761","549790","554351","555740","554359","555723","545989","548349","545050","548351","543006"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["statue","pole","commentary","progress","ideal","landmark","line","distance","haze","interplay"]}
