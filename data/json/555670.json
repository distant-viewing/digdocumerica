{"path":"555670.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene mountain landscape featuring a winding road that leads through a rugged terrain. The road, partly surrounded by small guardrails, carves its way through rocky and grassy hills, emphasizing the remote and untouched nature of the area. A single white car is visible, traveling on the road, giving a sense of scale and motion to the otherwise still landscape.\n\nThe background is dominated by dramatic mountain peaks with sharp, jagged outlines, suggesting they are part of a high mountain range. These mountains show patches of snow and glaciers, indicating a cold, alpine climate. The sky is clear and bright blue, contributing to the vividness of the mountain colors and enhancing the overall stark and majestic appearance of the scene.\n\nThis setting likely invokes a sense of isolation and tranquility, highlighted by the minimal human presence and the expansive natural beauty. The composition of the image, with the road leading towards the mountains, draws the viewer's eye into the distance, creating a sense of depth and exploration.","title":"The crest of Thompson Pass (elevation 2,771 feet). Here the Richardson Highway winds through rocky benches that seem to steer the road toward the deserted glacier, eight miles and an entire valley away to the south. Mile 760, near the Alaska Pipeline route.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553785","557558","556579","553630","555665","555653","542735","550634","550600","543772","550599","542838","544178","557537","555659","557528"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["mountain","road","glacier","guardrail","vividness","outline","exploration","way","climate","peak"]}
