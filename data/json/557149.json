The woman, on the right, is slightly smiling, wearing large round glasses and a dark quilted jacket over a lighter sweater. Her hair is styled in a curly, voluminous manner and has a reddish-brown color.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a serene outdoor setting, likely in a park or a large backyard with expanses of grass.
