{"path":"542722.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image depicts the base of a massive, ancient tree located in a dense, lush forest setting. The tree appears to be a redwood, given its enormous girth and the typical fibrous, deeply furrowed bark. The trunk of the tree is dramatically split, forming a natural arch or gateway at the base. This split offers a glimpse into the hollow interior, which seems dark and partially obscured by the complex textures of the interior wood.\n\nCovered with moss and other small vegetation, the surface of the tree displays a variety of greens and grays, depicting a long history exposed to the elements. These plants highlight the moist, fertile environment typical of redwood forests. Surrounding trees rise steeply in the background, their trunks and dense canopy creating a verdant, almost shadowy atmosphere due to the limited light penetrating through the foliage.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph is from the ground level, looking up towards the sky, emphasizing the towering height and grandeur of the trees. This angle showcases the immense scale of the redwood compared to the viewer, invoking a sense of awe and the ancient character of these magnificent forests.","title":"Burnt monarch tree in Big Stump Meadow.","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["554969","554977","543449","554995","543447","542845","543442","542928","542748","557621","545278","554968","554966","550792","554999","542745"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["redwood","forest","base","trunk","tree","awe","history","arch","bark","moss"]}
