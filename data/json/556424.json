{"path":"556424.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image captures a scenic, yet industrial landscape, possibly in a valley surrounded by dense forests. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, offering a panoramic view of a coal mining operation nestled among heavily wooded hills. The trees display a variety of green shades, indicating this photograph was taken in spring or summer.\n\nAt the valley's center, there is a sizable industrial complex with several large, grey buildings that appear to be facilities for processing or storing coal. There are multiple railroad tracks that curve through the scene, reflecting the transportation needs of the mining operation. One of the tracks leads directly to a coal carriage, which is visibly loaded with coal.\n\nThe area around the industrial buildings and railroad tracks has been cleared, showing muddy grounds and some puddles, suggesting recent rain. There are also several winding roads that connect the facilities and possibly lead out of the valley.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a juxtaposition of natural beauty with industrial activity, highlighting how such operations are often situated in remote and scenic locations.","title":"Typical scene of a medium-sized coal mine at the base of a forested valley near Logan, West Virginia.","placename":"Logan (W.
