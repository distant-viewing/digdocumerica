{"path":"543115.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a wooden sign, prominently displayed in the foreground, that reads \"SOLD\" along with the number \"962 931\" painted in black on its white face, showing signs of weathering and chipping. Behind the sign, looking out into a distance, there is a natural landscape of hilly terrain. The area is characterized mostly by cleared patches of land interspersed with regions densely populated with coniferous trees. Winding through the terrain, a dirt road meanders down the hill and into the forested area. The overall ambiance appears to be of a rural or slightly wild location, possibly earmarked for development given the presence of the \"SOLD\" sign. The lighting suggests that the photo might have been taken on an overcast day, as the atmosphere is lacking in strong shadows and has a gentle, diffuse light.","title":"Vacation home sites for Los Angeles residents.
