{"path":"552721.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph shows a serene, tree-lined walkway, presumably in an urban park. The viewpoint looks through a frame of overhanging green tree branches, focusing on a straight, paved path. The path is flanked on both sides by lush, green deciduous trees in full leaf, suggesting that this image was taken in spring or summer. \n\nAt the center of the image, at the end of the pathway, an American flag is prominently displayed, hanging vertically from the side of a large building or structure that appears to be under construction, indicated by the visible scaffolding. The color of the flag stands out against the surrounding greenery and the gray structure.\n\nThere are three people visible on the walkway. They are walking away from the viewpoint and towards the building. The figures are likely wearing casual, possibly warm, attire and seem to be engaged in a leisurely walk or perhaps a conversation. The dappled sunlight filtering through the trees casts patches of light and shadow on the path, adding to the tranquil and picturesque settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"A stroll in a city park","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557940","553755","546559","551713","553373","550046","553043","546609","546535","552407","544808","551776","545512","558033","549518","553464"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["path","walkway","viewpoint","flag","dappled","scaffolding","walk","casts","flanke","leaf"]}
