{"path":"548184.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with a number of distinct elements adding texture and depth to the landscape. In the foreground, the sandy beach shows traces of waterflow patterns etched into its surface, with a mixture of wet and dry sand creating a rich texture. Notably, there is a decayed, partially buried wooden post, suggesting remnants of an old structure or fence. Around this post, several stones and smaller debris are scattered, adding a natural, rugged character to the scene.\n\nThe center of the image features the gentle curve of the shoreline meeting calm, dark blue water, with small waves lapping at the sand. This central section of the photograph leads the viewer's eye towards a distant shoreline filled with sparse vegetation and industrial-like structures in the background, including poles or masts extending above the landscape. The distant background is dominated by the striking and serene presence of a snow-capped mountain, adding a sense of grandeur and tranquility to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the curving shoreline drawing the eye towards the mountain and the natural elements in the foreground, creates a juxtaposition of the transient beauty of nature against the quiet persistence of human-made decay. The overall atmosphere is peaceful yet somewhat melancholic, reflecting the passage of time and nature's reclaiming of human-altered landscapes.","title":"Columbia River bank with drainage pipe","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543287","548757","546970","543078","543069","550458","547607","547139","551554","544989","543081","542890","551553","543244","542884","543091"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["shoreline","post","sand","human","beach","trace","meeting","eye","mast","mountain"]}
