{"path":"549983.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of a woman outdoors in what appears to be a rainy environment. She is positioned side profile to the camera, looking towards the left. The woman's face expresses a contemplative or serene demeanor.\n\nShe is wearing a light-colored short-sleeve blouse adorned with a geometric pattern. Raindrops are visible across her skin and clothing, suggesting that she might be in the midst of a shower or spray of water. Her hair is pulled back and wet, adding to the overall soaked appearance.\n\nThe background of the photo is dark and blurred, which emphasizes the subject by using a shallow depth of field. This blurring makes it difficult to distinguish detailed features of the background, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the woman and the water droplets on her.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights her right side, possibly due to sunlight filtering through overcast skies, which gives a lustrous quality to the water droplets on her skin and blouse. The image conveys a sense of resilience or peaceful acceptance, enhanced by the natural lighting and composition.","title":"Philadelphian cools off at fountain of Philadelphia Museum of Art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553499","544742","557114","556414","553156","554923","556412","557846","545373","550940","543864","551468","548842","548291","558319","546223"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["droplet","skin","blouse","woman","portrait","spray","midst","resilience","profile","demeanor"]}
