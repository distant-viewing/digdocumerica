{"path":"553615.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals walking into a thick, reddish-pink haze. Both individuals wear safety helmets and carry what appears to be equipment, suggesting they might be workers or field researchers. The haze is so dense that the background beyond them is almost completely obscured, creating a dramatic and somewhat eerie scene. The ground is barely visible and seems rough, possibly a natural or disturbed landscape. The total effect is somewhat surreal and intense, focusing on the subjects as they move forward into the enveloping mist. The color saturation and composition add a peculiar, almost otherworldly quality to the image.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.  In post-fire salvage operations, \"cat skinners\" work in dust of caterpillar tractors.  The \"cats\" haul logs of fire-damaged trees to \"landing\" where they are loaded onto trucks for transporting out of the area.  Soot and ashes from fire are so thick that drivers must wear face masks","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553616","544330","544315","553562","553600","551089","545415","549565","545396","544085","546146","547542","544903","553599","544089","545772"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["haze","saturation","helmet","mist","safety","individual","worker","carry","subject","effect"]}
