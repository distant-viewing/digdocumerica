{"path":"551988.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of an expansive industrial area adjacent to a large body of water. The image captures a variety of industrial structures, warehouses, and factory buildings distributed across a sizeable zone characterized by dense construction and multiple rooftops. Notably, these buildings are predominantly rectangular and exhibit different sizes and levels of wear.\n\nSeveral open areas spotted with heavy machinery, stacks of materials, and parked vehicles such as cars and cargo trucks intermingle amidst the buildings, suggesting ongoing industrial or shipping activities. A notable feature within these open spaces includes several large piles of what appears to be scrap materials or possibly construction supplies waiting either movement or processing.\n\nTo the right of the image, there’s a highway or elevated roadway crowded with moving vehicles, indicating an urban environment or a well-connected industrial region. This roadway helps connect the industrial area with other parts of the city or region, hinting at the importance of this area in the economic activities of its location.\n\nOn the waterfront, multiple docks can be seen. These docks are populated with a few barges and cranes, highlighting the role of the waterway in transportation and logistics for the facility. The water itself and the skies are clear, suggesting favorable weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe overall layout and design of the area indicate a highly organized space designed for efficiency in industrial operations, likely supporting manufacturing, processing, or heavy-duty storage. The location’s scale and complexity imply it plays a significant role in the region’s industrial capacity.","title":"The Phelps Dodge copper refining center.
