{"path":"550583.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a small settlement or town nestled in a vast, green landscape. The image features a main road that runs vertically through the photograph, splitting the landscape into two distinct parts. This road is lined with scattered buildings on either side, including what appear to be residential homes, industrial structures, and possibly some commercial businesses.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a river runs parallel to the road. This river has wide, sandy banks that are distinctly lighter in color than the surrounding greenery. The immediate area next to the river shows signs of less vegetation, possibly due to human activity or natural erosion. \n\nThe dense forest surrounding the settlement consists primarily of coniferous trees, indicating a northern or mountainous environment. The town itself has scattered vegetation, including trees and smaller plants, which visibly separate and define the properties.\n\nAdditionally, the top left part of the photograph shows an intersection where another road branches off and extends horizontally across the frame, leading to another part of the town or adjoining areas.\n\nOverall, the image captures the layout and environment of a remote, possibly rural area, highlighting the interplay between human settlement and the natural landscape.","title":"Delta junction with jarvis creek appearing in the upper distance.
