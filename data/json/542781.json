{"path":"542781.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing in a forested area with large, recently cut logs around him. The man appears cheerful, smiling broadly as he looks off to his right. He is dressed in work attire suitable for forestry, including a gray shirt, dark suspenders, and a light gray hard hat. He also wears a fur vest over his shoulders, adding a rugged or traditional touch to his outfit. There's a knife in a sheath hanging from his belt.\n\nThe surrounding setting is densely wooded with tall pine trees, hinting at a cool, possibly damp environment, given the overcast sky and moisture evident on the cut wood and the forest floor. The large log next to him looks freshly cut, as indicated by the bright inner wood and the rough, splintered edges around it.\n\nThe scene suggests active forestry or logging operations, with the presence of the large cut logs being a central focus. The man's attire and equipment suggest he may be involved in these operations, possibly as a logger or a supervisor in the logging industry. The overall ambiance is one of rugged outdoor labor in a forest setting.","title":"\"Faller\" D.
