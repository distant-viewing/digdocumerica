{"path":"546131.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, two elderly men are seated on large wooden logs used as chairs outside a store. The store, indicated by the window signage, specializes in camping and fishing gear. One man is dressed in a Western-style red shirt with a black cowboy hat, suggesting a rustic or rural lifestyle; the other man wears a light-colored shirt, beige trousers, a brown belt, brown shoes, and a light-colored fedora. Both men appear contemplative or reserved in demeanor.\n\nThe backdrop of the image includes the storefront, featuring large windows with multiple displayed items and posters, one of which prominently features a red and blue hot air balloon. The exterior of the store is of a basic brown brick construction, and it has a modest, utilitarian design. Sunlight indicates a bright day, casting shadows on the building and adding a vividness to the overall scene. The overall ambiance is quiet and somewhat reflective, capturing a slice of everyday life in a small town.\n","title":"W.g.  Leistikon, 70; and john ricks, 87, in front of the local drugstore.
