{"path":"547655.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, centered around a furniture store named \"TURILLI FURNITURE.\" The setting appears to be in a suburban commercial area. The photo is dominated by a series of large, colorful signage that advertises the furniture store. The words \"TURILLI FURNITURE\" are displayed prominently in big, vertical, block letters, illuminated from behind. Below this main sign, other smaller signs advertise \"The SOFA KING\" and terms like \"BIDDING\" and \"FURNITURE.\"\n\nIn the foreground, there's a yellow-orange compact car, which contributes to the vintage feel of the scene, parked at the curb. A sidewalk and street lamps are visible, as well as other small business signs, including those for a bank offering Master Charge and BankAmericard services, hinting at the era's prevalent business practices.\n\nThe architecture of the building housing Turilli Furniture features reflective windows and a simple, flat fa√ßade with some geometric, angled decorations running along underneath the main signage, giving it a mid-20th century commercial style. The overall atmosphere exudes a busy, commercial vibe typical of American suburbs in that period. In terms of activities, the scene is relatively quiet with no visible pedestrian, focusing mainly on the presence of the car and the strong visual impact of commercial advertising.","title":"Modern view of one of the state's oldest towns","placename":"Warwick (R.I.)","location":"Warwick, Rhode Island","nn1":["546034","546078","545333","547025","542586","546428","551494","542900","550093","545216","554551","549113","549871","556224","549017","556225"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["furniture","term","store","signage","business","sofa","suburb","sign","advertising","curb"]}
