{"path":"543461.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a candid and emotive scene featuring two young individuals seated on a gritty surface near a waterfront, possibly a pier or dock. The man on the left has long, blonde, tousled hair and is clad in a light blue denim jacket and jeans, paired with dark, worn sneakers. He holds a fishing rod, intently focused on it, his posture relaxed yet attentive. Beside him is a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a large, olive green jacket over white pants and light brown hiking boots. She is leaning against him, her face obscured and resting on his shoulder, suggesting a moment of comfort or shared solitude.\n\nA few steps away, leaning against a rugged wooden ledge that seems to provide a seat and a basic safety barrier, is an acoustic guitar with a sunburst design, hinting at a personal or leisurely activity in their day. The backdrop shows a partial view of the calm water through a mesh fence, with no boats or visible activity on the water, enhancing the sense of a private, serene setting. The image evokes a mood of youthful introspection and a sense of momentary escape, possibly from the bustling dynamics of everyday life.","title":"Boardwalk and pier","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544306","547884","552291","549471","543465","543222","552116","554900","543027","547595","549933","550851","546077","554901","548833","547834"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lean","guitar","bry","sneaker","introspection","escape","jacket","dynamics","mesh","comfort"]}
