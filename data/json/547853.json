{"path":"547853.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a group of five people engaged in birdwatching or observing wildlife in a natural setting. They are stationed along a gravel pathway, with three telescopes on tripods set up facing an open landscape, presumably for better views of birds or other fauna.\n\nOn the left, two older individuals, a man and a woman, stand closely, the man using binoculars. He is dressed in a dark cap, brown jacket, blue trousers, and wears a binoculars case slung over his shoulder. The woman next to him is in a blue cap and dark clothing.\n\nIn the center and towards the right are three more individuals. Two are using telescopes: the first is a man in a yellow jacket and darker trousers, and the second is another man in a beige coat and tan pants. The third person, standing to the far right and slightly behind, seems to be either adjusting another telescope or possibly recording notes, wearing a dark trench coat and holding a small item, likely a notepad.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph features a tranquil, flat landscape with patches of grass, water bodies, and a slightly overcast sky, suggesting a cool or breezy day. The environment suggests a coastal or marshy area, typically suitable for birdwatching. The overall attire of the group and their equipment hint at a professional or serious approach to their hobby.","title":"Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547864","547849","557179","543236","543238","557005","557178","549314","547124","544529","544821","548873","554672","554491","547504","547089"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["binocular","trouser","coat","tripod","fauna","hobby","cap","case","trench","man"]}
