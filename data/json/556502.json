{"path":"556502.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The image depicts two tall industrial chimneys against a clear sky. Each chimney is painted with red and white stripes, creating a noticeable pattern that may serve as a visual cue for aircraft. The stripe pattern is segmented intermittently with broader white bands and narrower red bands. On both chimneys, there are external structures attached, possibly for maintenance or operational purposes. These features include several narrow metallic protrusions, akin to ladder or stair segments, facilitating access to different levels of the chimney.\n\nFrom one of the chimneys, thereâ€™s a visible emission of smoke or steam, suggesting that the facility is active. The plume disperses into the sky, subtly blending with the color of the air but still distinct enough to indicate its presence. The overall background is plain and does not provide additional context on the surrounding environment, focusing attention solely on these industrial structures. The composition of the photograph centers the chimneys, symmetrically placing them to dominate the frame, enhancing their formidable and towering nature.\n","title":"Closeup of the smokestacks of the Tennessee valley authority steam plant at Cumberland city, near clarksville Tennessee, coal for its furnaces arrives by barge and is unloaded by automated equipment.
