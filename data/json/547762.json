{"path":"547762.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large highway interchange, showing a complex network of roads and multiple lanes. The highways are filled with cars, indicating a busy traffic flow. The interchange includes various entry and exit ramps that curve and connect to the main roads. The overall scene is set against a background that subtly transitions from an urban environment, noticeable from buildings in the far background, to a more suburban setting characterized by smaller structures and green spaces.\n\nThis image highlights the engineering and design complexity typical of significant highway interchanges, essential for managing large volumes of traffic in urban areas. The landscape around the highways includes patches of greenery and open spaces that contrast with the dense network of concrete roads. The sky is clear, suggesting good weather conditions, which adds clarity to the aerial perspective. There are no visible people or identifiable landmarks, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the infrastructure and flow of the interchange.","title":"Expressways of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["544642","546709","548332","553015","547770","546714","550282","552719","548333","544634","558055","547780","546721","548363","551205","553838"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["interchange","highway","network","traffic","road","flow","ramp","entry","volume","exit"]}
