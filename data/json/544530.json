{"path":"544530.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a large wetland or marshy area under an overcast sky. The foreground is dominated by patches of water interspersed with dense grassy vegetation, typical of wetland environments. The standing water reflects the cloudy sky above, creating a mirror effect in places.\n\nThe middle ground stretches out with similar scenery, consisting of grass and open water areas, suggesting an expansive wetland habitat. The horizon is low, giving prominence to the sky. The vegetation appears lush and predominantly consists of tall grasses that thrive in wet conditions.\n\nThe sky, occupying the top half of the image, features dramatic cloud formations in various shades of gray and white, which suggest an impending or recent storm. The overall mood is somewhat somber due to the overcast conditions and the dark tones of the wetland waters and vegetation.\n\nThe image is void of any visible human activity or man-made structures, placing the entire focus on the natural environment and its expansive, untouched landscape. The scene effectively conveys the quiet and raw beauty typical of such ecosystems, possibly highlighting ecological themes or the natural state of a protected or remote area.","title":"TaMiami Canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553856","544515","552834","547500","547532","545033","547488","554717","550788","542525","550345","547589","550785","544773","546205","547924"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","prominence","consist","vegetation","thrive","storm","place","half","grass","water"]}
