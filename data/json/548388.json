{"path":"548388.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, likely from the mid-20th century based on the style of the vehicles and fashion of the people. The perspective is from a sidewalk looking down a densely packed street lined with tall buildings, giving a sense of a narrow, canyon-like urban environment.\n\nVarious mid-century cars fill the street, some are parked while others appear to be in traffic, indicating a busy time of day. The colors and designs of these vehicles range from light to dark hues, featuring sedans and a few larger vans or trucks.\n\nOn the right side of the image, on the sidewalk, can be seen a group of pedestrians. Men and women are dressed in typical mid-20th-century fashion, which includes suits for men and both skirts and pants for women, reflecting the business attire of the era. There's a notable focus on one individual near the foreground - a man with facial hair wearing a dark suit and tie, which portrays a moment in his stride.\n\nCloser to the foreground, parked beside the curb, there is a bicycle with a basket, which contrasts with the larger motor vehicles and adds a personal, human scale element to the scene.\n\nStreet signs and lampposts, along with wires stretching across above the street, characterize the urban infrastructure typical for the period and location. The lighting suggests it might be midday due to the brightness and the way shadows are cast underneath vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a vivid portrayal of city life with a dynamic range of activities and bustling energy, showing an intersection of transportation, pedestrian traffic, and urban architecture from a bygone era.","title":"Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548369","546626","549872","551135","556724","545216","549882","556709","551913","550139","551125","554297","548399","556225","542586","549906"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","pedestrian","century","vehicle","fashion","suit","sidewalk","traffic","lamppost","era"]}
