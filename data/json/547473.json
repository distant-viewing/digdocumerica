{"path":"547473.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a desolate urban scene, likely on the outskirts of a city or in an abandoned area. The foreground of the photo is dominated by various disassembled and discarded bicycles scattered across a barren field. The field itself is gritty and sparse, interspersed with dirt, patches of grass, and small yellow flowers, possibly dandelions.\n\nSeveral individual bicycle parts, including frames, wheels, and seats, are strewn haphazardly around the area. Near the center, an upright brown and red bicycle stands out due to its somewhat intact condition compared to the others.\n\nIn the background, there's a large, plain concrete building with graffiti on its side. To the right of this building, a small stadium or public seating area with a metal railing is visible, hinting at some form of communal or recreational past use of this place. The area around these structures appears unkempt and abandoned, adding to the overall sense of neglect.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a day with mixed weather, and in the distance, beyond the immediate desolation, the outlines of houses or other buildings are visible, indicating proximity to a residential area. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a sense of abandonment and decay.","title":"Along the seekonk river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["553870","547477","552043","542585","547786","556640","542590","550264","553869","549786","549785","547587","556313","547921","553009","544060"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["bicycle","abandon","disassemble","stadium","dandelion","graffiti","seating","field","outskirt","desolation"]}
