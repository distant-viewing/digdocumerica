{"path":"547576.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene likely taken in the 1970s, capturing a part of the Port of Providence. The dominant features include an administration building, labeled \"Port of Providence Administration Bldg.,\" which is a low, flat-roofed structure painted white with a darker trim around the windows. In front of this building, there are multiple railroad tracks, hinting at the transportation methods used in this area.\n\nTo the left and in the background, there are larger industrial buildings, one of which is emitting a thick, dark smoke from a tall chimney, contributing to a somewhat grim and polluted atmosphere. This smoke rises prominently against a dull sky, suggesting heavy industrial activity. The other buildings in the vicinity appear functional and utilitarian, with visible external pipework and support structures.\n\nA single figure can be seen in the foreground, moving amongst what appears to be stacks of materials or perhaps additional railroad infrastructure. This adds a human element to the scene, emphasizing the industrial environment's scale in comparison to the individual. The overall mood of the photograph is somewhat bleak, characterized by the industrial setting and the pollution, giving a visual insight into the environmental impacts of such areas during this period.","title":"Smoke from chimney of sewage treatment plant","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["550868","545445","548379","545236","546006","545507","546884","557246","555776","555770","545987","545265","545503","548423","555564","547058"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["railroad","comparison","smoke","insight","method","building","trim","support","vicinity","stack"]}
