{"path":"544978.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a selection of fish fillets that are being dried. The fish fillets have a silvery, scaly surface and pinkish-red flesh exposed, indicating they might have been freshly sliced. The fillets are laid out neatly in rows on a mesh surface, likely a drying rack, which allows air to circulate around them to aid in the drying process.\n\nThe background shows a blurred dirt-like surface, suggesting that the drying process is taking place outdoors. The focus of the image is clear on the fish, highlighting the texture and the drying technique used. No people or other objects are visible in this focused shot, keeping the emphasis solely on the fish and the process. The lighting appears natural, likely sunlight, which helps in the drying process and also illuminally highlights the moisture and textures on the fish's surface.","title":"Salmon bake, fund-raising affair for community of browns point","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544987","547848","545063","544995","554095","542892","546366","546792","546319","554093","545075","543189","544982","553095","545206","545065"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["drying","fish","process","surface","selection","pinkish","silvery","rack","mesh","aid"]}
