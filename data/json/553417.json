{"path":"553417.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features a unique birdhouse mounted on a weathered wooden utility pole that stands amidst green foliage. The birdhouse is whimsically designed with bright colors and a playful motif. Labeled as the \"Playskool Postal Station,\" the birdhouse mimics the appearance of a miniature post office, complete with blue, red, and white colors on the body and a rusty-looking metal roof. The front of the birdhouse has a star design and a slot that suggests a maildrop, adding to its charming, postal-themed aesthetic.\n\nThe environment around the pole is lush with leaves and hints of sky peeking through, indicative of a verdant, possibly suburban setting. The focus on the birdhouse against the soft, blurred greenery in the background highlights its quaint and creative design, making it the central subject of the image. There are no human figures or animals visible; the scene is tranquil and purely focuses on this little architectural curiosity in its natural setting.","title":"Mine falls park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua river.  The Nashua conservation commission envisions it as a nature preserve, with facilities for hiking, picnicking, bicycling and eventually swimming once the heavily polluted river is cleaned up.
