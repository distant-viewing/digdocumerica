{"path":"547481.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph displays a striking and somewhat melancholic scene by a body of water, possibly a lake or river. In the foreground, a severely damaged and deteriorated car, which appears to be an old model from between the 1950s to 1970s, is abandoned on a rocky and debris-strewn shore. The car is largely stripped with significant rust and damage; it lacks windows, and its body is crumpled and bent out of shape, indicating severe decay and possibly vandalism.\n\nThe car’s color, once probably a bright shade, has faded to a dull white with areas of rust and dirt all over. Parts of the frame are bent, and the interior is filled with debris. There are remnants of the car’s features such as a wing-shaped emblem on the rear that reflects a time when automotive design included elaborate styling.\n\nBehind the car, the water is shimmering under what seems to be fairly bright lighting, perhaps indicating it is midday. The background across the water features a relatively low, flat landscape with some industrial or commercial buildings. One large white building stands out due to its size and distinct color against the more subdued tones of the surroundings. The overall scene evokes a sense of abandonment and neglect, contrasting the natural beauty of the water with the man-made decay in the foreground.","title":"Abandoned car at Fields Point on Narragansett Bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547601","547484","547835","547605","547839","546318","547911","547597","546315","549107","548752","553007","545540","547132","546173","547587"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["car","rust","decay","1950","styling","emblem","debris","wing","rear","midday"]}
