{"path":"542934.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an extensive outdoor storage area, significantly filled with neatly arranged rows of cargo containers. These containers display a variety of colors, primarily shades of red, blue, and beige, with some having visible text or logos. The scene captures the area during twilight, evidenced by the dim ambient lighting and long shadows cast across the storage field, suggesting early morning or late evening.\n\nThe composition of the photograph enhances the vastness and organized nature of the storage area, directing the view diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of the image, which emphasizes a sense of order and repetition. In the top right corner, there's a narrow waterway running along the edge of the facility, following a slight curve and guarded by a thin strip of land lush with greenery, contrasting the industrial scene.\n\nThe storage area is partly illuminated by some lights, possibly street lamps or security lights, which create highlights and add a glow to parts of the containers and the environment. These lights also reflect off the surfaces of the containers, adding brightness and visual interest to the composition.\n\nOverall, the image powerfully combines elements of human organization and natural landscape, encapsulated from a birdâ€™s-eye perspective, showcasing a slice of industrial activity nestled within a natural setting.","title":"Lumber stacked by river","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555759","542866","555270","555271","555760","550886","555272","550910","552242","552207","548790","549978","547667","551976","551609","552244"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["container","storage","repetition","security","order","organization","highlight","strip","brightness","cargo"]}
