{"path":"548818.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and visually striking scene centered around a powerful burst of water. You can see water shooting upward in a forceful and dispersed spray against a clear blue sky speckled with a few wispy clouds. The sun is directly above, shining brightly and creating a glare that adds to the brilliance of the scene.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows some dark, blurred shapes that might be objects or parts of objects, obscured by the splashes of water. These shapes do not provide clear context but add an abstract quality to the composition.\n\nThe image is captured from a low angle, looking up towards the source of the water and the sunlight. This viewpoint emphasizes the power and height of the water's ascent. There's a blur and motion caused by the water droplets scattered throughout the frame, reflecting sunlight and creating a lively, energetic atmosphere.\n\nThis photograph likely describes a moment of interaction with a water feature such as a fountain or a splashing wave, capturing the spontaneous beauty of water in movement, highlighted by natural sunlight.","title":"Close up of waterfall on Lake Havasu City golf course","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545882","557268","543830","553387","548871","546907","554076","547114","553180","544867","544862","542742","552539","552703","543251","550697"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["water","splash","sunlight","ascent","glare","describe","burst","shine","shape","shoot"]}
