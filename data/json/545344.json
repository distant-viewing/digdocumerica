{"path":"545344.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful moment of a young man leaning on a car, smiling broadly. He has dark hair and is wearing a plain white T-shirt. His arms are resting on the roof of a white car, with his hands clasped together. The setting appears to be a sunlit urban street during the daytime.\n\nIn the background, there are hints of a residential or possibly a commercial neighborhood. There's another vehicle parked on the side of the street—a light-colored vintage car—and in the far background, there's a figure seated on what looks like a bench or low wall near buildings with neutral-colored facades.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of a casual, relaxed moment perhaps during a warm, sunny day. The composition focuses on the young man's expression of happiness and ease, making it a central element of the photograph, which contrastingly contains muted and soft-focused urban elements in the background.","title":"Young man in El Paso's Second Ward, a Chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["557866","545391","556622","543856","543947","546092","557370","553171","545331","553607","551123","547758","557863","552744","557917","549058"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["ease","car","happiness","street","daytime","bench","neighborhood","arm","facade","moment"]}
