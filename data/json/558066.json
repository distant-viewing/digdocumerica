{"path":"558066.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In this photograph, a group of six individuals is gathered along a narrow riverbank surrounded by lush greenery. The river itself reflects light, suggesting a calm, still surface. This scenic spot is encased in a thick forest, with trees showing early autumnal changes in leaf color.\n\nThe group appears engaged in either conversation or observing something in or near the water, as they are all looking towards the same direction. The members of the group are dressed in casual, outdoor attire typical for a hike or a field trip, including jackets and backpacks, which suggests they might be engaged in an educational or recreational activity.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and somewhat secluded, indicated by the dense trees and the absence of any built structures or other human-made elements in the visible surroundings. The photograph captures a moment of exploration or learning in a natural environment.","title":"Members of the Keel Haulers Club at their departure point on the Cuyahoga River south of Bath Road and near the Akron, Ohio water treatment plant. Overflow from the plant enters the river at this point. Sewage is sometimes vented into the river without treatment after severe rains when overflow overtaxes the plant. The Cuyahoga is within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land located between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557005","546803","553415","557985","542563","545531","554475","551538","554662","554672","554667","553413","543736","557740","554665","552033"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["group","hike","backpack","trip","leaf","member","absence","change","riverbank","exploration"]}
