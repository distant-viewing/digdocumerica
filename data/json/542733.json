{"path":"542733.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene dominated by nature and featuring large, distinct animal footprints in the foreground. The footprints appear deeply imprinted into a sandy, ochre-colored soil, suggesting recent activity by a large animal, possibly a bear given the size and shape of the prints.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a clearing in what appears to be a forested area. The terrain around is mixed; there are areas covered in grass and pathways that are likely used for hiking or walking. A fallen tree and stumps are visible, indicating either natural decay or logging activity.\n\nIn the background, dense green trees frame the scene, emphasizing the wilderness aspect of this location. The lighting is bright, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, which also casts shadows and highlights over the natural landscape, enhancing the texture of the ground and surrounding vegetation.\n\nOverall, the image suggests a tranquil natural environment possibly frequented by wildlife, as indicated by the prominent animal footprints. It seems to be a space where natural processes and occasional human visitation overlap.","title":"Sawdust pile in Big Stump Meadow","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["553464","550345","542604","558088","545604","542732","554774","545588","553581","558083","545294","554720","551023","543615","542791","547607"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["footprint","animal","print","stump","hiking","highlight","clearing","wildlife","pathway","wilderness"]}
