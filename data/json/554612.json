{"path":"554612.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a black bear scavenging through a heap of garbage. The scene is filled with various kinds of trash including papers, plastic bags, cardboard boxes, and scattered food waste. The setting appears to be an outdoor waste disposal area surrounded by a natural forest environment, as suggested by the presence of green trees and shrubbery in the background.\n\nThe bear, which is the focal point of the image, is shown partially in profile as it rummages through the garbage pile, likely in search of food. The image effectively captures a moment that highlights issues of wildlife interaction with human waste and the impact of human encroachment on natural habitats. The bearâ€™s fur appears thick and dark, and it looks deeply engaged in sorting through the debris that surrounds it. The surrounding debris includes visible elements like cardboard and plastic, which implies a mix of residential and possibly commercial waste.","title":"Black bear foraging in a garbage dump at big moose, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
