{"path":"546423.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a lone individual walking along a sidewalk that runs beside a brick building with distinctive architectural details. The building features a series of tall, narrow windows set in a beige and red brick facade, each topped with a white stone lintel. These windows are regularly spaced along the length of the building. Above each window, the wall is adorned with rows of diamond-shaped brick patterns, adding a decorative element to the otherwise straightforward structure.\n\nThe individual in the image is a male, appearing to be in his twenties. He's wearing casual attire: a light-colored, patterned shirt that is unbuttoned over a darker t-shirt, flared jeans, and sandals. He’s carrying a large, light-colored shoulder bag and is gazing slightly downwards as he walks, suggesting a moment of introspection or focus.\n\nLight and shadow play a significant role in the composition of this image, with sunlight illuminating parts of the building and the pavement, creating an interplay of light and dark areas. In the foreground, the out-of-focus branches of a tree introduce a natural element and a sense of depth, partially obscuring the view and giving the scene a candid, almost voyeuristic feel. The perspective used in the photograph draws the viewer’s eye along the pavement, following the man's walk down the sidewalk next to the architectural backdrop.","title":"Irwin Management Offices","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546419","547816","553537","546504","547820","547280","546506","553539","546495","546452","546493","546443","552724","546539","550677","551957"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["brick","pavement","sidewalk","twenty","window","diamond","sandal","introspection","walk","building"]}
