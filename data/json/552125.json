{"path":"552125.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seated on what appears to be a small boat at night. He is a middle-aged Caucasian wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, and lace-up boots. A cowboy hat covers his head, obscuring his face partially as he focuses on the task at hand. He's engaged in cleaning a fish, holding it firmly as he works under the light emitted from a lantern. Nearby, there is a metal container, perhaps holding bait or tools, and a white cup.\n\nThe setting has a somber, serene ambiance primarily due to the nighttime setting and the gentle glow of the lantern. The reflective water surface hints at calm surroundings, and the lights from a distant bridge create a faint silhouette and twinkle across the water, enhancing the tranquil, solitary mood of the scene. The backdrop is dark with only distant lights providing depth and context to the location which seems to be rather isolated. The overall composition of the image emphasizes a solitary human experience in nature at night, engaged in a traditional activity, perhaps fishing or preparing a catch.","title":"Warren freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas river.
