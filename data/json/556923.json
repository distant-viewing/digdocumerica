{"path":"556923.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view over a coastal landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, based on the warm hues and soft lighting conditions. A large body of dark blue water dominates the upper left portion of the image. Floating on the water are three large boats, spaced apart and oriented towards the shore. These white boats contrast sharply with the dark blue of the water.\n\nThe shore is lined with large, dense patches of forest, primarily composed of evergreen trees that appear dark green and are detailed with areas of brownish-orange, suggesting either a seasonal change or a variation in vegetation. In the middle portion of the image, a cleared, slightly lighter brown area suggests human activity or a natural clearing.\n\nWinding through the forested area, a road can be seen curving around the landscape, beautifully illuminated as it sporadically catches light, creating an eye-catching visual pathway. There are small white specks visible on this road, potentially vehicles or some structures, reflecting light and adding scale to the scene. \n\nThe composition beautifully mixes elements of nature with hints of human presence, creating a serene yet intriguing aerial portrait of this coastal region. The color palette is moody and natural, with deep blues, lush greens, and accents of warmer earth tones complementing each other.","title":"Aerial view looking west of the navy's Bangor annex hunter's marsh, below, is formed by diking an estuary and has been designated as a game preserve.
