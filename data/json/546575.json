{"path":"546575.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial nighttime view of an urban landscape. The composition prominently features a large road cutting diagonally through the image from the bottom left to the top right; this road is densely filled with vehicles, their headlights creating a flow of white and red lights indicating motion and direction.\n\nIn the center and slightly to the left, a significant architectural complex stands out. This includes a tall tower and several sprawling, large white buildings, possibly government or institutional in nature. The tower and buildings are well-lit, contrasting with the surrounding darkness, and making them the focal point of the composition. \n\nThe background, beyond the complex and road, fades into darkness, which suggests the surrounding area might be less densely populated or composed of parklands or open spaces. The sky overhead is dark, indicating it is nighttime, and there is no visible cloud cover or weather elements impacting visibility. \n\nOverall, the image portrays a mix of vibrant city activity along the road and the prominence of the architectural complex, set against the quiet dark of the surrounding environment.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555418","546744","546586","555425","547051","555406","548392","546684","549476","553001","546624","547429","555743","546574","546591","545913"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["complex","darkness","road","tower","government","prominence","nighttime","dark","overhead","headlight"]}
