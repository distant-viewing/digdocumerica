{"path":"554301.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, chaotic pile of crushed and compressed scrap metal, most likely taken at a scrapyard or recycling plant. The image is dominated by dark, matte colors, predominantly shades of black, gray, and muddy brown, with slight accents of color from rust and residual paint on the metals.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent piece of metal stands vertically, resembling an abstract, misshapen figure. This piece is streaked with grime and rust, giving it an almost sculptural quality among the debris. The twisted and torn forms of metal around it include recognizable parts of automobiles, pipes, and unidentifiable mechanical components, all densely compacted into bales.\n\nThe background has similarly compressed cubes of scrap metal piled high. These cubes show signs of severe deformation, indicative of the powerful machinery used to process this waste. The entire scene portrays a grim industrial vista, focusing on the themes of recycling, waste management, and possibly the environmental impact of such processes.\n\nThere is no visible sky or natural light source; the photograph is illuminated in a way that highlights the textures and contours of the metal, enhancing the dramatic and slightly dystopian feel of the scene. The overall composition is both cluttered and meticulously arranged, showing chaos yet a sense of order in how these materials are stacked and stored.","title":"Flattened cars are ready for recycling.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["557308","554357","554318","554300","547611","554317","554358","548753","548109","554346","554304","547610","548147","547625","542585","551517"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["metal","recycling","scrap","rust","waste","grime","bale","scrapyard","piece","order"]}
