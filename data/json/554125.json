{"path":"554125.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a moment at what appears to be a rural grocery store named \"Miloli Grocery Store.\" A wooden sign above the store promotes \"Drink Hilo Soda.\" The building is rustic, featuring a wooden facade and a porch.\n\nA man stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame, shirtless, wearing faded blue jeans and flip-flops. He is interacting with a dog. His body is turned towards the left where he is looking in the direction of the dog, which appears to be on the porch, behind a wooden railing. The man seems to be playing or communicating with the dog, with his right hand extended towards it.\n\nThe background is predominantly shadowed by the porch's roof, and further details of the store's interior are obscured in darkness. Trees are visible in the far background, suggesting a semi-secluded setting, possibly in a rural or small-town area. The overall ambiance of the photograph is informal and captures a candid, everyday-life scene.","title":"Eugene Kaupiko, 66, was born and still lives in the remote fishing village of Milolaii. A planned subdivision one mile away now threatens the simple life of the village. In 1971 its only approach road was paved for easier access to the development.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554126","554036","543031","555377","544373","549112","551342","554439","554951","552518","550756","557763","556368","547413","547805","547796"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dog","store","porch","grocery","darkness","railing","direction","interior","town","jean"]}
