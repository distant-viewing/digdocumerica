{"path":"550680.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a serene landscape featuring a river and a mountainous backdrop. The river appears in the foreground, dominating the lower part of the image. It is wide and shows some textural details suggesting a gentle flow, with its surface reflecting hues of deep blue and subtle purple. Flanking the riverbanks, there are densely populated areas of greenery which add a rich contrast of colors against the water.\n\nBeyond the river is a series of mountains that extend across the photograph, creating a layered visual effect as they recede into the distance. The mountains closest to the viewer possess deep purple and blue tones, which fade into lighter shades in the more distant mountains, possibly due to atmospheric perspective. There is no obvious human activity or man-made structures visible in the image, lending it a pristine, untouched quality.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft, with the overall color palette dominated by blues, purples, and greens, contributing to a calm and almost mystical ambiance. The image is framed to capture the expanse of this natural setting, indicating it is possibly taken during twilight or under a cloudy sky, which diffuses the light evenly.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the tranquil and majestic beauty of a natural riverscape, nestled between lush woodland and undulating mountains.","title":"Androscoggin River, looking north from the dam above Gorham.
