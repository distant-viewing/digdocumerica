{"path":"554128.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene with a rural and natural feel. It depicts a herding activity involving cattle and several individuals on horseback. The scene is set against a backdrop of a wide ocean visible under a bright, partly cloudy sky. \n\nThe foreground features tall, dense grasses and weeds, leading to a capture gate where many cows are gathered. Most of the cows are black and white, and they appear to be calmly milling about or waiting to move through the gate. \n\nThere are at least three people visible, all riding horses. The horses and their riders are managing the movement of the cattle. The individuals shown are actively participating in the rural task of herding. Their attire is not distinctly visible, suggesting functional, probably rugged wear suitable for farm work.\n\nThe overall composition gives an expansive view that emphasizes the open environment. The ocean and sky occupy the upper third of the photograph, offering a sense of vastness and openness that contrasts with the concentrated activity of herding in the lower parts of the image. The use of natural light and the older quality of the photo give it a timeless, classic feel, typical of agricultural life.","title":"Moving cattle in the rich grazing lands of the agricultural district","placename":"Pahala (Hawaii)","location":"Pahala, Hawaii","nn1":["554129","552565","553100","553105","548828","548830","553104","554885","549033","543776","552698","553101","543634","548878","548829","543779"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["cattle","cow","gate","horse","ocean","horseback","weed","rider","capture","third"]}
