{"path":"554439.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic scene featuring a man standing at the entrance to a dark, wooden shed or cabin. The structure appears relatively simple and weathered, with a sloped roof and a front that includes a doorway and a window fitted with a set of grills or a frame, possibly for security or protection from the elements.\n\nThe man is wearing a plaid, long-sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up several inches, revealing his forearms. He also wears dark pants and seems to be barefoot. He holds a can or jar, poised to either place it or take it from a small shelf above the door, which already houses another similar object.\n\nThe scene is set in a lush, verdant environment with abundant trees and bushes showing a mix of shades suggesting a well-lit day with sunlight filtering through the leaves. The ground near the shed has visible plants and grasses, enhancing the feel of a remote, natural setting.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of solitary living or a moment caught in everyday rural life, emphasizing practicality and simplicity against a backdrop of natural beauty.","title":"Typical backwoods hunting--fishing camp, used only during the sporting season.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554440","555295","551081","555231","554413","551076","547792","558102","552106","554694","558333","553516","554084","552522","546958","551104"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["shed","sleeve","practicality","security","grill","protection","shelf","doorway","can","living"]}
