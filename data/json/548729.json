{"path":"548729.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene nature scene focusing on a body of water and lush greenery. In the foreground, calm waters stretch across the image, with a single white egret or heron standing elegantly in the shallow water near the center-left of the frame. The bird is poised, possibly looking for fish or resting.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dense line of mangrove trees lining the water's edge. These mangroves are thick and lush, with deep green leaves, and they appear to be thriving, indicating a healthy wetland ecosystem. The mangroves are reflected subtly in the water, creating a mirroring effect that enhances the tranquility of the scene.\n\nThe horizon is barely visible, but it suggests an expansive body of water beyond the mangroves. The sky is clear with a hint of light, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon. The overall lighting in the photograph is soft, adding to the peacefulness and natural beauty of the setting.","title":"White heron at Spanish Harbor Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["545967","544624","544620","544506","547630","545991","544482","548731","544838","550388","553085","544842","543063","547589","546059","545008"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["mangrove","egret","water","heron","peacefulness","fish","wetland","bird","ecosystem","body"]}
