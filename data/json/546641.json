{"path":"546641.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents a moody, overcast street scene focusing on a police car marked with the number \"15\" on its roof. The car is seen from the back with a focus on its top, featuring two red rotating lights and a centered forelight. Through the rear windshield, two figures can be barely made out, one apparently wearing a hat, suggesting they might be police officers.\n\nIn the blurred background, urban architecture is visible which includes a distinguished building with towers further down the road, and even further in the distance, a faint, iconic dome-shaped building, recognizable as the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Other vehicles with their headlights on suggest a busy, possibly dusky time of day, contributing to the subdued lighting and the overall somber tone of the image. The setting evokes a sense of routine vigilance or surveillance, typical of a capital city's atmosphere.","title":"In follow-up of two-car accident officers take both drivers into police car for questioning and writing up of accident report.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546638","546746","546661","546645","555447","546634","555461","546654","542755","546635","546630","549932","546649","546631","554293","546647"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["police","surveillance","capital","officer","windshield","dome","headlight","car","number","back"]}
