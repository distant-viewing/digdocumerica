{"path":"554135.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a striking and somewhat desolate landscape. At the forefront is a wooden boardwalk, curving smoothly from the bottom right of the frame towards the center-left. The boardwalk has a weathered appearance, with its light colored planks contrasting sharply against the dark ground.\n\nThe ground itself is covered in what appears to be a vast expanse of dark, volcanic pebbles or small rocks, extending as far as the eye can see. This forms a texture-rich, but somber ground cover, suggesting a recent volcanic activity or a naturally rocky terrain.\n\nIn the background, standing stark against a cloudy sky, are numerous leafless trees. These trees are thin and appear quite brittle, almost ghost-like, enhancing the sense of desolation and abandonment in the scene. They are uniformly dark and seem to have been stripped of life, possibly due to environmental factors like a volcanic eruption or fire.\n\nThe sky above is overcast with heavy clouds, casting an overall gloomy and dramatic mood over the landscape. The lighting is subtle, with no direct sunlight visible, emphasizing the moody and melancholy essence of the environment.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a scene that is hauntingly beautiful, marked by contrasts between the natural wooden pathway and the stark, lifeless surroundings, under a brooding sky. It evokes a sense of solitude and resilience amid harsh conditions.","title":"\"devastation trail\" is the name given to this boardwalk through skeletons of trees desTroyed by the 1969 volcanic eruption in Hawaii volcanoes national park","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554134","543718","543843","543722","555087","545747","548673","550482","555158","555103","554780","548672","555199","544116","555207","554137"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boardwalk","factor","forefro","stripp","gloomy","pebble","ground","stark","desolation","resilience"]}
