{"path":"542994.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, tranquil landscape at either dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by a softly-lit body of water that reflects a subtle palette of pink and purple hues, likely influenced by the sky above. A curving shoreline creates an elegant winding path through the composition.\n\nThe foreground features a narrow, smooth stretch of water that gracefully curves towards the left, flanked by a darker, textured strip of land or sandbar. The calm water mirrors the gentle colors of the sky, enhancing the peaceful ambiance.\n\nIn the background, multiple layers of mountains gently recede into the distance. The colors soften and fade with each successive range, creating a sense of depth and vastness. These mountains are veiled in a haze that blends their outlines with the sky, contributing to the overall dreamlike quality of the image.\n\nThe upper portion of the image is suffused with a gradient of warm light, graduating from a rich pink near the horizon to a darker purplish hue as it approaches the zenith. This coloration suggests that the sun is low in the sky, casting a diffuse light.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a quiet, reflective mood, utilizing soft natural lighting and a harmonious color scheme to portray a strikingly calm landscape. The absence of any human activity or animals intensifies the solitude and stillness of the scene.","title":"Seacoast","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549446","557000","552336","544679","557572","545145","550646","554397","554752","543577","552142","550389","554404","557561","549445","547731"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["suffuse","veil","curve","intensify","mountain","pink","coloration","scheme","soften","approach"]}
