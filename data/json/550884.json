{"path":"550884.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph provides a high aerial view of a flooded urban area. There is a large river that is overflowing, engulging the surrounding landscape and causing apparent flooding of the region. The river forms several curves and branches, partially submerging areas of dense woodland as well as parts of the city.\n\nIn the image, one can notice multiple small islands and peninsulas, most of which are covered in dense trees and are partially submerged in water due to the flooding. Residential areas and a variety of buildings are visible near the edges of the river and are seemingly affected by the rising water levels. The areas closest to the riverbank look severely affected, with numerous structures appearing surrounded by water.\n\nThere appears to be an industrial zone toward the right side of the photo, with structures that include large buildings and a chimneys, indicating possible factories. The area has rows of organized streets, now seemingly bordered by water.\n\nThe left side extends into a broader view of the river, slightly less affected by the urban sprawl but still showing signs of flooding.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is somber due to the unnatural river boundaries caused by the flooding, impacting the surrounding natural and urban environment.","title":"Fox river channel at menasha, a paper manufacturing center on lake winnebago","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["547221","552840","552849","552843","552853","552841","550861","550366","547990","552845","552848","547258","552852","550548","550865","546690"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["flooding","river","affect","cause","submerge","overflow","peninsula","impacte","notice","sprawl"]}
