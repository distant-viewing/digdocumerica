{"path":"558047.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a serene, natural setting, characterized by a rich green landscape with multiple elements:\n\n1. **Water Canal and Road**: A narrow water canal runs roughly diagonally from the middle left to the top right of the image, fringed by a road that mirrors its path. The canal appears calm and is lined with lush green trees on both sides. Along the road, there are a few cars, suggesting a mild level of activity, typically seen in less urban or suburban areas.\n\n2. **Trees and Vegetation**: The surrounding area is heavily wooded, with patches of varying shades of green, indicating different types of trees and vegetation. The density of the trees suggests that this area is possibly a maintained park or a natural reserve.\n\n3. **Bridge and Building**: In the lower middle part of the image, there is a bridge crossing the canal. Near this bridge, to the left, there is a small building, possibly a house or a utility structure, surrounded by more greenery. \n\n4. **Industrial-looking Buildings**: On the bottom right, there are some larger, more industrial-looking buildings with flat roofs. One of the buildings is larger than the others, and there are several cars parked outside, indicating some form of commercial or industrial activity.\n\n5. **Miscellaneous Details**: There are several small clearings and paths within the trees, hinting at areas that might be used for strolls or other recreational activities. Thereâ€™s also a small, possibly man-made, body of water near the bridge and buildings.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a blend of natural and man-made elements, suggesting this might be a place where people engage in both recreational and professional activities in a predominantly natural setting.","title":"Canal Road follows the old Ohio-Erie Canal at Hillside Road south of Cleveland, Ohio, in this aerial view. It was heavily used for commerce between 1833 and 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems. The waterway was put out of business by a flood and the railroads. This area is part of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in a 20-mile stretch of land between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550757","558043","552733","556965","544560","550557","556966","556937","549116","544536","549484","556915","550556","558046","557024","548629"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["canal","bridge","fringe","path","building","stroll","reserve","tree","clearing","density"]}
