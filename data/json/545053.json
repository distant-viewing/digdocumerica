{"path":"545053.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This color photograph captures an industrial scene framed by a natural landscape. In the foreground, there are clusters of lush, green foliage, and what appears to be a variety of trees, possibly in the middle of a dense forest. Some leaves are closer to the viewer, with more detailed visibility, while others form part of the trailing edge of the woodland canopy that fades into the middle ground.\n\nThe middle ground opens up to reveal a large industrial complex, where numerous buildings and smokestacks dominate the view. The smokestacks are actively emitting white and gray smoke, contributing to a somewhat hazy sky. This industrial activity stands in stark contrast to the untouched forest in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate bounds of the industrial plant, one can catch a glimpse of what looks like a river or wetland area, alongside possibly cultivated fields, before the land merges into a range of mountains or highland. The haziness attributed to the factory emissions or atmospheric conditions obscures detailed views of these farther distances.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes industrial development against natural elements, possibly hinting at environmental or economic themes, and reflects a moment captured from a high vantage point, giving a sense of the extent and impact of human activities on the landscape.","title":"Pulp mill pollution","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543813","545013","557225","554630","544039","545112","543009","545989","550995","546073","557377","544736","550997","551026","545239","551053"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","attribute","bound","extent","forest","cultivate","merge","emission","wetland","open"]}
