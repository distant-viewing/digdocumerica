{"path":"544902.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scenic view featuring a rocky, rugged terrain. In the foreground, there is a large expanse of smooth, worn rock surface exhibiting shades of beige and light brown, sloping gently downwards. Several shallow, narrow channels can be seen eroded into this rock surface.\n\nThere is a lone figure, presumably a hiker, standing on the rock. The individual is dressed in dark clothing, including a dark shirt, shorts, and a backpack, with one arm extended for balance as they navigate the uneven surface.\n\nIn the background, massive, steep cliffs dominate the landscape. These cliffs display layered rock formations, suggesting sedimentary origins, and are covered with patches of dark green vegetation clinging to their ledges. The vegetation includes both trees and smaller shrubs. The top of the cliffs is lined with a densely wooded area, extending into the distance where the cliff edges fade into a bluish haze, likely due to atmospheric perspective.\n\nAbove this dramatic rock formation, the sky appears clear and bright, indicating a sunny day. The natural lighting enhances the textures and colors of the rocky landscape and vegetation. The setting seems remote and serene, possibly in a national park or a protected wilderness area, emphasizing a sense of adventure and exploration in a natural environment.","title":"White Canyon near the Sipapu Bridge, Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545759","544341","544906","544898","545762","544903","544305","543846","555592","545700","545697","545589","543838","552685","545571","558083"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["cliff","rock","formation","origin","hiker","surface","vegetation","ledge","beige","backpack"]}
