{"path":"550176.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape overwhelmed by pollution. Several large smokestacks dominate the view, emitting thick, dark smoke that heavily clouds the atmosphere. The background reveals a haze that obscures the details of the setting, suggesting a significant level of airborne pollutants.\n\nThe foreground features industrial buildings and structures, with piles of materials that could be either coal or waste products. Visible throughout the scene are numerous electric poles and power lines, indicating a heavy industrial setup equipped with substantial energy needs.\n\nIn the distance, the silhouettes of more factory structures can be seen, reinforcing the industrial theme of the area. The overall color tone is muted, with shades of grey and brown dominating, suggesting a grim and polluted environment.\n\nThere are no people visible in the scene, which focuses purely on the environmental impact of industrial activities. The image serves as a strong visual commentary on the effects of industrial pollution and may evoke thoughts about environmental preservation and regulation.","title":"Industrial Clark Avenue is obscured by smoke.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550981","557218","545491","550172","545435","547531","550875","545447","557302","546884","550181","545439","550983","550998","551054","551052"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pollution","dominating","regulation","preservation","pollutant","commentary","need","coal","product","thought"]}
