{"path":"546161.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a water surface in a natural setting, possibly a pond or marsh. The focal point of the image is a cluster of frog eggs that appear as slightly transparent, jelly-like clumps with visible dark dots (embryos) inside. These eggs are scattered across the image, surrounded by water and some vegetation.\n\nThe water's surface shows a mix of various textures and colors including shades of blue, green, and brown, indicating the presence of water plants, algae, and possibly some sediment. There are also small patches of floating debris and organic matter such as pine needles and tiny leaves, emphasizing the natural and somewhat untended character of the setting.\n\nThe overall impression is of a quiet, still water body that serves as a breeding ground for frogs, showcasing an aspect of wildlife and ecosystem dynamics in such environments. The image is rich in natural detail, providing a glimpse into the reproductive life of amphibians in their habitat.","title":"Polluted water near large manufacturing plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["550727","557587","551362","551363","549145","557606","555197","555066","555067","547509","542582","544588","542554","544280","554602","555080"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["clumps","matter","water","dynamics","marsh","alga","needle","pond","sediment","wildlife"]}
