{"path":"556812.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This vintage photograph depicts a bustling subway station scene, conveying the atmosphere of urban life. The image captures passengers moving along the platform as a subway train with the number \"6\" indicated as its route, is stopped at the station. The train itself features the classic metal exterior typical of subway trains of the era.\n\nThe platform is well-lit with fluorescent lights running along the ceiling. Several passengers are visible walking or standing on the platform, engaged in typical commuting activities. Most are dressed in styles suggestive of mid-20th century fashion, including suits, ties, and daytime dresses.\n\nSignage plays a significant role in the background setting: above the platform, there is a prominent sign pointing towards \"Worth St\" and \"Brooklyn Bridge\" indicating directions for exits or other transportation connections. Additional peripheral elements include tiled walls and various indications of a bustling, somewhat crowded transit environment.\n\nThis image captures a moment in time, reflecting the daily routine and the aesthetic of an older New York City subway station, filled with the motion and life of city commuters.","title":"Passengers and subway trains on the Lexington Avenue line of the New York City Transit Authority system. In 1970 the 232-mile subway (longest in the world) carried 2.1 million people to and from work daily, an estimated 47 percent of the city's work force. Despite its crucial importance, New York voters have refused to authorize any more funds for new improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be raised to cover costs of operation.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556810","556651","556818","551894","556774","556650","551883","556815","556821","556660","556819","556663","556823","556682","556779","551886"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["subway","platform","train","station","passenger","commuting","exit","pointing","commuter","indication"]}
