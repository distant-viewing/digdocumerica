{"path":"545567.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene of archaeological exploration within a striking natural setting. The image is centered on a large, smooth, semi-circular rock formation creating a cave-like structure. Through the sweeping arch of the cave, the distant landscape reveals layered rock formations typical of eroded desert regions, likely indicating a location in a canyon or a similar geological setting.\n\nInside the cave, the main focus is on a person, who appears to be conducting an archaeological dig. This person, wearing a red jacket and dark pants, is knelt on the rocky ground, engaging closely with the environment â€“ perhaps examining or collecting samples. Around the individual, there are several stone structures or ruins, which include walls or enclosures made from stacked, unmortared stones. The area is littered with rocks and debris, indicating either a site under excavation or a naturally deteriorated site being studied.\n\nThe mood conveyed by the low light within the cave contrasts with the brighter, illuminated scene visible through the arch, creating a sense of isolation and focused activity. The photo documents how the natural landscape houses historical or prehistorical human activity, preserving it in a state that requires careful study to unearth its stories. This interaction of human history and natural environment forms a rich narrative suggested by the photograph.","title":"Keyhole ruin, on Horse Creek in Canyonlands National Park early cliff dwellers once lived here.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545565","544920","545608","545554","551359","545550","544366","544937","544158","544931","545688","552495","545305","544895","544162","556512"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["cave","arch","study","rock","stone","formation","ruin","site","deteriorate","enclosure"]}
