{"path":"543278.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features numerous seagulls resting on multiple parallel rows of floating wood logs. These logs are thick and covered with a thick layer of white guano, indicating frequent use by the birds. The logs are arranged in a grid-like manner on a body of water which is likely a lake or a sea.\n\nOn closer inspection, the logs are connected and stabilized by thinner horizontal beams running perpendicularly. Some of the beams and parts of the logs are dangling into the water, creating a somewhat jagged and untidy appearance.\n\nThe guano marks the logs with splatters and long drips, many of which dangle over the sides, reaching towards the water below. This accumulation suggests that these logs serve as a popular perch for these birds over a considerable period.\n\nNo other animals or human figures are present in the photo, and the background is composed primarily of open water, without visible land or distinct features. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly late afternoon based on the softness and angle of light, enhancing the tranquil yet somewhat messy natural avian habitat.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["554600","553347","549738","549896","552238","548728","550338","552146","549744","543281","543282","542919","549758","550325","545036","557126"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["log","bird","seagull","softness","stabilize","beams","inspection","perch","accumulation","featur"]}
