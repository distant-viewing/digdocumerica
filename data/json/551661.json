{"path":"551661.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a busy, urban scene presumably in a city's downtown area. The central feature of the image is a long, rectangular water fountain that runs perpendicular to the line of sight. The fountain sprays water upwards from several points, creating an engaging visual effect and adding a dynamic element to the urban landscape.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the tall buildings flanking the street. The buildings lining either side of the street are typical of a commercial district, with reflective glass surfaces and metal frames, characteristic of modern skyscrapers.\n\nThe street is bustling with activity. There are several people seated along the edge of the fountain, and a few others are standing or walking along the broad sidewalks. The individuals are dressed casually, suggesting perhaps a warm day and a relaxed urban setting. Vehicles, including cars and buses, are visible in the background, indicating an active, populated environment.\n\nIn the background, the street extends into the distance, flanked on both sides by similar tall buildings, creating a kind of urban canyon effect. The sky is visible at the top of the image and appears to be slightly overcast, casting a soft light over the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of architectural and social interest, depicting a vibrant, living cityscape that is both functional and aesthetically engaging.","title":"Rockefeller Center--6th Avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550747","551647","552705","551663","552726","553289","551772","551660","557282","550762","553224","551480","557261","557258","553214","553317"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","street","effect","sight","spray","downtown","canyon","district","kind","skyscraper"]}
