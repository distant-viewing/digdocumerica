{"path":"546213.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rural American scene that appears to be from the mid-20th century. In the foreground, there are three traffic signs: one displaying a speed limit of 45, another indicating the city limit for Leakey with a population of 393, and a smaller sign below about historical markers in the city. The backdrop presents a street view with older model cars and a scene indicative of small-town America.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a gas station with vintage gasoline pumps, advertising Regular, Ethel, and Diesel fuel. Prices for the fuels are displayed on signs. The gas station has signage that reads \"Leakey Courts\" and \"Barber Shop,\" suggesting it serves multiple purposes, including lodging and personal services. There are also other commercial signs visible advertising a café named \"Buckhorn Bar-B-Q.\"\n\nIn the background, trees and a clear sky set a serene, rural mood. There are a few people visible, engaged in what seems to be casual, everyday activities typical of a small community. The overall composition gives a nostalgic look at rural life, reflecting the character and simplicity of a small American town during this period.","title":"Leakey, a small town near garner state park, derives much of its income from summer tourists and fall deer hunters","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["544882","546184","555584","558037","551070","549003","558028","554709","545618","548889","555506","555484","552602","552526","548174","546183"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["limit","fuel","advertising","gas","sign","town","station","population","café","gasoline"]}
