{"path":"544410.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a woman peeking out from a vertical slit window of a wooden building. The structure, painted in a peach tone, features rustic wood siding and a white-framed window without any glass or screen, suggesting an informal or improvised construction typical in rural or semi-rural settings.\n\nThe woman is partially visible; her face and one arm are seen as she leans on the window frame. She appears to be smiling or in a moment of casual observation, contributing a sense of warmth and human presence to the image. Her attire is not fully visible, but what can be seen suggests everyday, comfortable clothing.\n\nThe background behind the structure shows lush greenery, indicating the building is likely situated in a verdant area. The lighting and shadows suggest the photo was taken on a sunny day, casting deep shadows and enhancing the texture of the wooden siding. The overall composition focuses on the contrast between the structure's man-made lines and the natural environment surrounding it.","title":"Arizona--Supai","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["548232","555295","543028","548246","552745","554194","551091","556541","551104","551076","553503","554798","556738","556487","548656","551100"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["siding","window","screen","warmth","observation","woman","shadow","arm","structure","wood"]}
