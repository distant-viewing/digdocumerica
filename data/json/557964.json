{"path":"557964.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a vintage steam locomotive as its primary backdrop, emitting steam around its large, prominent front which includes a lit headlamp and the number \"4070\" displayed on a plate. In the foreground, three individuals are standing on the locomotive's step platform beside the tracks.\n\nOn the left, there is a young girl wearing a colorful knit poncho over a cream shirt, paired with jeans. She is sporting a quirky train conductor's hat. Beside her stands a young boy in a green jacket over a dark shirt and vibrant red plaid pants, holding a small blue suitcase.\n\nTo the right, an adult woman is partially stepping off the platform onto the train tracks. She wears glasses, a green jacket over a dark shirt with light-colored pants, and carries a striped bag with a patriotic motif.\n\nThe setting seems to be an outdoor railway environment, indicated by the visible railroad tracks and gravel. The mood conveys a sense of nostalgic or educational adventure, possibly at a train museum or a heritage railway event. The steam and vintage elements of the locomotive add to the historical ambiance of the scene.","title":"Exciting moment for these youngsters is a picture taking session on the steam powered engine of the Cuyahoga Valley Line near the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio. The weekend excursion train is a novelty for many adults and children who never have seen such a locomotive before. The train leaves the Cleveland Zoo station and travels south. It follows the Cuyahoga Valley and river which is a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557956","556857","556022","556041","556091","556114","557963","556782","557966","556763","557961","556074","557967","548536","557965","556118"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["locomotive","steam","train","track","railway","step","platform","museum","suitcase","conductor"]}
