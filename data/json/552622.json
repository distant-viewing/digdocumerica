{"path":"552622.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a view through a large window of a diner or restaurant, focusing on an older man who is slightly leaning forward with one hand on his hip and the other resting on a window sill. He is dressed in a white shirt and a cap, which suggests he might be a staff member, possibly a cook or a server, taking a brief pause from work. The window features neon signs that glow in bright pink and blue, spelling out \"DINING ROOM\" horizontally across the middle. Just below the neon sign, inside the diner, there's a small sign facing outward that reads “Come in, we’re OPEN.”\n\nThe window is framed by an exterior wall covered in fake brown stone tiles, giving the building a somewhat dated look. The inside of the restaurant, visible through the window, appears slightly dim and blurrier compared to the bright and sharp neon signs, making it difficult to discern specific details about the interior décor or other occupants. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting, the solitary figure, and the façade suggests a quiet, perhaps early evening scene at a local eatery.","title":"The cook at Texan Cafe watches the snow removal crew at work","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543039","552647","547184","547789","552932","556676","550323","558123","554945","547779","542894","542802","545974","545986","556843","554866"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["neon","diner","restaurant","window","sign","décor","sill","spell","cook","inside"]}
