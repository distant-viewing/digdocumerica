{"path":"546465.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny day in an open landscape featuring modern architecture and recreational activity. In the foreground, a young person is seen pushing a bicycle along a paved path. This individual, appearing to be a young teen, is dressed in a utility-style jacket with a badge on the left sleeve and dark trousers. The bicycle has a purple frame with white handlebars.\n\nIn the background, a long and low modern building stretches across the photo, characterized by large glass windows and a dark brick facade, reflecting a mid-20th-century architectural style. In front of this building, a row of lounge chairs can be seen lined up against the windows, pointing towards a possibly communal or recreational use of the building.\n\nFurther along the path, other persons are observed engaging in various activities including walking and biking, indicating a communal, perhaps educational environment.\n\nThe landscape is lush with green grass and the sky is clear and blue, adding a calm and peaceful quality to the scene. This setting might be part of a campus or a public park, aimed at fostering communal interactions and leisure activities.","title":"Parkside Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546443","546522","546545","546452","546541","558131","546532","546464","547209","544808","546453","546537","546559","551545","546461","546539"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["bicycle","campus","lounge","teen","handlebar","path","badge","person","window","style"]}
