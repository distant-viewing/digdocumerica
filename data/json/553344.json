{"path":"553344.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic scene featuring a wooden pole rising from a body of water, with a birdhouse mounted on its side. The birdhouse appears weathered, with a natural wood finish and a simple rectangular design, featuring a large open compartment and what appears to be a smaller compartment or ledge. Adjacent to the birdhouse on the same pole, there's a white sign that conspicuously displays the word \"POSTED\" in bold black letters, followed by additional text \"NO TRESPASSING\" below, which is common signage used to indicate private property or restricted access.\n\nThe background showcases a dense thicket of bare branches and evergreen trees, suggesting a colder season. The water has a murky green-brown color, and the surface appears slightly rippled, possibly due to wind or the proximity of the photographer to the water. The overall atmosphere of the scene is quiet and somewhat secluded, evoking a sense of solitude and tranquility, typical of a natural freshwater environment. There's no visible human activity, enhancing the stillness of the scene. The lighting and colors are subdued, with an overcast sky suggesting an early spring or late autumn timeframe.","title":"Wooden duck box on the Nashua River","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553417","554103","548248","557441","544288","544567","547318","554788","552455","557205","553458","554438","547910","552076","548845","545137"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["compartment","trespassing","timeframe","thicket","pole","photographer","finish","ledge","property","stillness"]}
