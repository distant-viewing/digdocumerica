{"path":"551316.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a family standing alongside a vibrant red dune buggy in an outdoor setting that appears to be a campsite. The dune buggy, placed prominently in the foreground on the left, features a noticeable glossy red finish, large rear wheels, exposed engine components, and a striking design that includes a black-and-white checkered flag pattern evidenced on part of the vehicle's interior.\n\nThe family consisting of three individuals, presumably a father, mother, and a baby, are positioned to the right of the buggy, slightly blended into the background. The father is wearing a light-colored jacket, a dark shirt, trousers, and a hat, exuding a serious expression. The mother is in a dark top holding the baby comfortably in her arms. All are standing on a gravelly surface with trees and a traditional blue camping tent visible in the far background, which helps set a relaxed, recreational outdoor atmosphere. The overall composition conveys a sense of family leisure time combined with an interest in distinctive, hobbyist vehicles.","title":"Fluorescent-orange dune buggy built for $2,000 by willard hicks of granite city, Illinois.
