{"path":"543674.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large mining or quarry site. The photo captures a vast area with significant geological and human-made transformations. In the foreground, you can see deep trench-like excavations characterized by dark, exposed earth. These trenches are organized in a pattern that suggests systematic mining activities.\n\nIn the midsection of the photograph, there are large mounds of earth neatly arranged in rows, resembling a zigzag pattern. This part of the mine site appears to be more methodically planned, likely signifying different phases or types of excavation activities.\n\nFurther back, near the horizon, the landscape is less rugged and shows elements of a rural setting, including patches of green fields and small clusters of buildings, which could potentially be associated with the mining operation or local communities.\n\nA road runs horizontally across the middle of the image, and a few vehicles can be seen, likely used for transportation related to the mining activities. The overall scene is devoid of visible natural vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the mining area, indicating the heavy industrial use of the land.\n\nThe image gives a stark representation of industrial impact on the natural landscape, highlighting the extensive alteration of the earth for resource extraction. It also reflects the scale at which these operations occur, affecting vast tracts of land.","title":"Peabody coal company strip mine","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543861","549174","543857","544064","549177","543758","544785","544498","544111","544789","549171","554768","555622","555614","543754","549172"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","trench","earth","excavation","zigzag","quarry","transformation","phase","site","alteration"]}
