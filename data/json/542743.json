{"path":"542743.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic river as it courses through a rugged landscape. The river is filled with white, frothy rapids indicating strong currents and turbulent water flow. Large, irregularly shaped rocks and boulders protrude from the water, some partially submerged, adding to the chaotic movement of the river. These rocks appear weathered and mossy, suggesting they have long been part of this watery environment.\n\nThe background of the image reveals more rocky formations that line the riverbank, supporting sparse green vegetation that adds a touch of color to the predominantly gray and blue scene. The lighting is natural, possibly taken during the day given the clarity and vibrancy of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the natural power and untamed beauty of the river, presenting a scene that feels both timeless and isolated. The absence of human presence and man-made structures amplifies the wildness of the landscape.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["549442","553416","550658","550742","548156","544856","553420","553855","549550","542537","553653","550698","544871","544862","550605","552061"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["river","watery","wildness","protrude","course","rock","current","boulder","vibrancy","clarity"]}
