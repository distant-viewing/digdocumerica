{"path":"557494.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary flamingo standing in a shallow body of water during what appears to be sunset or sunrise. The lighting is soft and casts a warm glow over the scene, highlighting the pink and red hues of the flamingo's feathers. The flamingo stands on one leg, a common resting position for the bird, with its curved neck and head forming an elegant \"S\" shape.\n\nThe body of water reflects the pink and orange colors of the sky, interspersed with darker patches that suggest either shadows or deeper areas. Floating vegetation can be discerned on the water's surface near the bird, adding texture to the water. In the background, the horizon is obscured by a low-lying mist or fog, softening the landscape and creating a tranquil, isolated atmosphere.\n\nAbove, the sky is filled with large, soft clouds that catch the light of the sun. These clouds, highlighted against a darker sky, add depth and drama to the upper portion of the image. The overall composition relies on the contrast between the vivid color of the flamingo and the subdued hues of the surroundings, focusing attention on the bird as the central figure in this serene environment.","title":"A bird waits for its meal to float by at buena vista lagoon the wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons in southern California.
