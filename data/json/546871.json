{"path":"546871.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a dilapidated waterfront building located on a pier extending into calm water, which appears to be a river or bay. The building shows signs of significant wear and decay, with its wooden structure partially exposed, peeling paint, and portions of the siding and roofing materials missing or damaged. \n\nThe building is predominantly rectangular, featuring a flat roof with slight overhangs. A smaller rectangular extension on one end has a higher roofline, possibly functioning as a separate room or storage space. Windows and doors are visible but show signs of neglect, with broken panels and frames.\n\nThe pier on which the building rests is constructed of wooden planks and pilings, also in a state of disrepair. Surrounding the building and across the water, elements of an industrial or semi-urban environment are visible. This includes another large building on the right side, hints of urban infrastructure, and a crane in the distance, suggesting proximity to a working area, likely a shipyard or industrial sector.\n\nThe water is relatively still, reflecting the overcast sky and parts of the decrepit building. No people, animals, or moving objects interrupt the scene, enhancing the sense of abandonment and decay in this industrial waterfront setting. The overall ambiance is quiet and somewhat somber.","title":"A rotting pier in the Baltimore Harbor near downtown Baltimore","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548105","547575","547038","547622","545005","547040","547594","547582","547577","549300","551984","543320","547581","551985","550293","552135"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["building","pier","waterfront","decay","piling","sector","shipyard","extension","roofline","overhang"]}
