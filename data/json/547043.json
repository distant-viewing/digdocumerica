{"path":"547043.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a ruffed grouse standing in a natural habitat. The bird is positioned in the center of the frame, flanked by tall green grass and leaf litter on the ground, which suggests a wooded or forested setting. The grouse has a richly patterned plumage that blends shades of brown, black, and white, ideal for camouflage in its earthy environment. It appears alert and is looking off to the side, perhaps cautious of potential predators or disturbances. The lighting is natural, casting shadows and highlights that add depth and texture to the scene. The background is out of focus, emphasizing the bird and creating a strong contrast between the subject and its surroundings. Overall, the photograph showcases the grouseâ€™s distinctive appearance and the subtle interplay of light and shadow in its natural setting.","title":"Grouse on the side of road","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["549115","552696","555010","550471","544477","544489","550387","544547","553408","543265","554599","544480","554947","554601","554927","544478"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","camouflage","plumage","leaf","litter","disturbance","highlight","habitat","shadow","interplay"]}
