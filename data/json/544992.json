{"path":"544992.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a textured, rugged surface that appears to be mud or clay, deeply ridged and cracked, suggesting that it might be a dried-up riverbed, lakebed, or coastal mudflat. The texture is intricate, displaying a network of crevices, bumps, and patterns that give it a chaotic yet natural structure. The lighting is dramatic, emphasizing the depth and contour of the surface, with reflections suggesting that there are still moist areas or possibly a light covering of water present. This creates a glistening effect on many parts of the mud, especially in the crevices, adding a visual contrast between the wet and dry areas.\n\nThe colors in the image are monochromatic, dominated by dark browns and hints of black in the deeper sections of the mud. There's a natural abstract quality to the photograph, rendering it almost like a textured painting. There are no visible human activities, animals, or plants within the scene; it's solely focused on the natural earthy texture and the interplay of light and shadow.\n\nOverall, the composition isolates and magnifies a segment of the natural world, encouraging a focus on the detail and beauty found in the often overlooked nooks of environmental landscapes.","title":"The Puyallup River has been contaminated by industry.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550837","554347","555545","553582","545597","545850","552983","544682","542869","555793","543523","553867","545656","546110","544176","552066"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mud","crevice","present","mudflat","clay","covering","painting","riverbed","black","segment"]}
