{"path":"551465.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph features a creative and unique perspective focusing primarily on a yellow bicycle, viewed from below and oriented vertically in the frame. The main focal point is the bicycle's wheel, perfectly framing a city scene through its spokes. The rim and spokes of the wheel are sharply detailed against the urban backdrop, adding a distinctive structural element to the composition.\n\nIn the background, captured through the arc of the bicycle's wheel, is a vibrant city street scene. A vintage red streetcar is prominently visible, indicating a setting likely in a city with a historical or currently operating streetcar system. Around the streetcar, there are people engaged in various activities. One person appears to be boarding the streetcar, momentarily stepping up, while another individual stands by the streetcar, potentially waiting.\n\nBuilding facades with decorative architectural details line the street, suggesting a possibly older, historic district. The sky above is clear and blue, adding a bright and airy feel to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition relies heavily on the interplay of urban elements and everyday street life, captured uniquely through the perspective of bicycle parts, highlighting a blend of transportation modes and city life.","title":"Transportation modes on nicollet mall--bus, bicycle and feet","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551464","557535","551456","547032","551645","551445","551443","546169","554312","556708","545328","547389","544967","551864","547400","549854"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bicycle","wheel","city","street","rely","mode","arc","bright","rim","perspective"]}
