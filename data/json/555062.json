{"path":"555062.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is a close-up view of a dark-colored beetle perched on a leaf. The beetle has elongated, smooth, and somewhat shiny body with long legs and prominent antennae. The focus on the beetle highlights its detailed texture and the fine lines running through its body and limbs.\n\nThe beetle is situated on a leaf that is clearly in a state of decay, evidenced by its dry, cracked appearance and the holes scattered across its surface. This leaf is part of a larger pile of similarly decayed leaves and debris that covers the ground in a natural, scattered fashion.\n\nThe background consists of more dried leaves and bits of earth and possibly small rocks, creating a textured and organic setting typical of a forest floor or a similarly natural environment. The colors in the image lean towards shades of brown and gray, emphasizing the autumnal or decaying theme. Light and shadow play subtly across the scene, casting soft shadows and creating depth, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the beetle and the intricacy of the natural debris around it.","title":"A beetle on dead alder leaves in a private forest preserve on Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557544","557585","544520","553872","555196","555178","551372","544896","557168","544731","555064","555030","542686","554842","546096","557102"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leaf","antennae","limb","intricacy","leave","hole","debris","leg","fashion","bit"]}
