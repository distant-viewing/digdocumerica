{"path":"554437.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction in a natural wooded area. The foreground shows a jumbled mess of what appears to be the wreckage of a small building or structure. Various pieces of debris, such as wooden planks, roofing material, and other unidentifiable components, are scattered in a chaotic fashion across the ground.\n\nAmid the debris, a person is actively engaged in what looks like the process of cleaning up or salvaging materials from the wreckage. The person is bending over a particularly large piece of debris that is tilted at an angle. They seem to be either examining something or physically manipulating the debris.\n\nThe background is filled with a dense array of trees, highlighting that this scene is set in a forested area. The trees have no leaves, suggesting it could be either autumn or winter. There is a noticeable absence of any other structures or people in the visible area, which might indicate this location is relatively isolated.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, along with the natural lighting and the unspoiled background, contrasts sharply with the destruction and activity in the foreground, creating a visually and emotionally impactful scene.","title":"Remains of a summer cottage which collapsed under the weight of the winter's snows","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["544468","545254","555086","557993","557008","545258","545264","551088","555142","555089","557573","547527","543165","555230","556445","555162"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["wreckage","destruction","debris","salvage","piece","clean","manipulate","roofing","material","tilt"]}
