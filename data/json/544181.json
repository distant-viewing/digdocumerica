{"path":"544181.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures an old wooden boat beached on a grassy shore beside a body of water reminiscent of a river or a large lake. The wooden boat appears aged and worn, with its paint peeled and wood weathered indicating long exposure to the elements. The boat has a flat base with a raised and enclosed pilot house towards the bow. The pilot house has small windows, and there is visible damage and decay to elements of the structure, such as missing panels and exposed frames.\n\nAround the boat, various items and debris can be seen that contribute to a sense of abandonment or disrepair. There is a rusty barrel positioned near the front left of the boat, and nearby, a disused tire and some wooden planks are scattered across the ground. The back part of the boat, which is partially obscured from view, leans towards the shore supported by what seems to be wooden beams or temporary fixtures intended to keep the boat balanced on land.\n\nThe backdrop of the image features a calm water body lined with dense vegetation, mainly lush green trees under a partly cloudy sky, which casts a soft light over the scene, enhancing the tranquil yet somber mood of the photograph. The setting is peaceful, reflecting a juxtaposition of natural beauty against the forgotten decay of the man-made object.","title":"Derelict boat","placename":"Lafitte (La.)","location":"Lafitte, Louisiana","nn1":["547510","552128","547965","551981","543057","546787","547017","547961","544567","555512","545005","548688","549306","548248","550780","548689"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["boat","pilot","raised","enclosed","decay","shore","panels","house","intend","fixture"]}
