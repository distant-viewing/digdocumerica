{"path":"549717.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a joyous moment at an amusement park water ride. The scene shows a log flume ride, where riders in a log-shaped boat are just coming out of a water slide, splashing water around as they hit the water at the bottom of the slide. The log boat holds three people: a young woman at the front, and an older woman and a young man behind her, both appearing exhilarated with wide smiles, likely from the thrill of the descent.\n\nThe background of the photograph offers a glimpse of the amusement park setting. On the left, there is another log flume in motion with riders aboard, and behind it, various other park attractions and activities can be seen. There are numerous people walking and watching the rides, scattered across the paths lined with lampposts and trees. The sky is overcast, giving a slightly muted tone to the vibrant activity of the park.\n\nThis scene captures a classic amusement park experience, emphasizing fun, family-friendly adventure, and outdoor enjoyment. The water splashing and the expressions of delight on the riders' faces convey a sense of motion and excitement, encapsulating the essence of a leisurely day at the park.","title":"Log flume ride at amusement park on Bob-lo Island","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["551299","546348","554611","545458","543212","550029","553449","543218","543944","552540","545267","543952","551546","551308","553835","557737"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["amusement","rider","log","park","ride","slide","splash","delight","thrill","descent"]}
