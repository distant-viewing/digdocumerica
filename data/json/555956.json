{"path":"555956.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man inside an old, disused bus that is being restored or repurposed. The interior of the bus is spacious and notable for its large, distinctive curved windows spanning the length of the bus on both sides, providing panoramic views. These windows are somewhat grimy, suggesting that the bus has been out of use for a while.\n\nThe bus's internal structure is mostly gutted, devoid of seats and other accessories typical of a bus, giving it an empty, eerie appearance. The floor of the bus looks worn and still retains a central aisle, typical of public transport vehicles, with bare metal tracks where seats might once have been attached. On the left side, a rolled-up piece of carpet or fabric and a loose, round object that might be a speaker lie on the floor.\n\nThe man in the bus is crouched on the right side, working intently on the floor near the base of the bus windows. He wears casual clothing - a dark blue T-shirt and jeans - and his long hair falls forward as he focuses on his task. His presence and work tools scattered around suggest he is involved in renovating or maintaining the bus.\n\nIn the background outside the windows, a foggy, indistinct setting is visible, consistent with a workspace or industrial area, enhancing the overall feel of a work-in-progress or restoration project. The lighting inside the bus is natural and soft, likely coming from an overcast day, contributing to the muted tones of the bus's brown and grey interior.","title":"Interior of an amtrak dome passenger car has been stripped at a plant in mira loma, California, near Riverside.
