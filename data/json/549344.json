{"path":"549344.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a maritime scene viewed through a framing device that appears to be a large dark silhouette of a curved object with a hook-like shape. This creates a unique, circular framing of the main subjects.\n\nInside this bold frame, we see four people on the bow of a boat that appears to be cresting over a calm blue sea. The sky above is bright and clear. On the left side of the boat, a man and a woman, both wearing swimwear, are standing and appear to be engaged in a conversation. The woman is seated, facing the man, who is standing with his back partially toward the camera. To the right, another woman in swimwear is standing, holding onto the boatâ€™s railing and looking toward the nearby man, while a fourth person, wearing a light-colored hat and dark top, appears to be adjusting or holding something cylindrical, possibly a camera or a pair of binoculars, near their face.\n\nThe composition is lively and captures a carefree, leisurely moment at sea. The framing choice adds a creative and artistic touch to a simple scene of friends enjoying a sunny day on a boat.","title":"Zoology students from the University of Vienna participate in a scientific cruise on the hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II, a research laboratory of the Ruder Boskovic Institute.
