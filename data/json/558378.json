{"path":"558378.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The image captures a woman engrossed in her work at a table, which appears to be in an industrial or workshop setting. She is dressed in a sleeveless, checkered-pattern blouse and wears glasses. Her hair is styled in a short, curly manner typical of past decades. The focus of her attention is on assembling or sorting through a collection of white, flat ribbon-like materials, which she is organizing or inspecting with great care.\n\nOn the table, these ribbons are stacked in a somewhat helical formation, suggesting they may be strips of film or some sort of flexible material possibly used in manufacturing or processing. The environment around her is softly blurred, but hints of additional industrial materials and the edge of another workstation can be seen in the background.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights her and her immediate task, emphasizing her hands and the materials on the table. The image evokes a sense of diligent work, attention to detail, and could be indicative of a setting where manual processing or inspection of goods plays a crucial role.","title":"Employee of the b.f.
