{"path":"546805.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted landscape, primarily featuring a large pile of garbage and debris near a body of water. In the foreground, there is a prominent sign stating \"NO DUMPING,\" mounted on a wooden post. Despite the warning, the area around the sign is cluttered with various cast-offs, including broken furniture, discarded building materials, and miscellaneous waste. The background offers a view of a calm river or lake, with a clear sky above and some foliage to the sides. The contrast between the serene natural background and the chaotic, dirty foreground underscores a neglect of environmental care.","title":"Shore of middle branch of Baltimore Harbor at Port Covington","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548308","544813","550258","552100","550352","550801","550800","547512","551245","547907","550687","551440","552098","547992","550798","552082"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["off","dumping","warning","furniture","care","garbage","post","sign","waste","neglect"]}
