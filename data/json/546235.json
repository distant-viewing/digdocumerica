{"path":"546235.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a landfill or waste disposal site featuring a broad expanse of disturbed soil and scattered debris. In the forefront, massive amounts of waste including large pieces of wood, cardboard, plastic containers, and miscellaneous garbage cover the ground. Toward the center, heavy machinery including a bulldozer and another unidentifiable yellow vehicle are working amidst the trash, likely moving or compressing the waste.\n\nOn the right side of the image, close to a large mound of earth, there is a white truck parked with its back facing the viewer, potentially in the process of dumping more waste. Additionally, there are several barrels, possibly containing chemicals or industrial waste, prominently visible near the center-right of the photo.\n\nThe background is bordered by a line of dense trees, suggesting that the landfill is located near a forested area. The sky above appears slightly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, contributing to a somewhat gloomy atmosphere typical of such environments. The general appearance and operation hint at environmental challenges concerning waste management and landscape alteration due to human industrial activity.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
