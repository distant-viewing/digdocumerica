{"path":"544412.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This image captures a group of five men spending time together by the marina at dusk. The setting is a floating dock aligned with several small motorboats moored on both sides of the wooden pier. The scene is relaxed and casual.\n\nIn the foreground, three men are seated on the edge of the dock directly in front of the camera, facing towards the left side of the frame. The first man, wearing sunglasses, a red long-sleeve shirt, and blue jeans, is sitting with his legs crossed, holding a fishing rod. The man next to him is dressed in a white t-shirt and blue jeans, and also holds a fishing rod, his posture more relaxed and leaned forward slightly. The third man at the edge of the boat wears sunglasses, a maroon sweater, and blue jeans, and he's also engaging in fishing, looking towards the water.\n\nFurther back, two additional men are seated in a boat anchored next to the dock, engaged in a conversation. One of them, visible near the front of the boat, is holding what seems to be a drink.\n\nThe background shows a tranquil marina environment. Other boats are docked around the area, and there are small buildings and terrain that suggest a hilly landscape around the marina. The water is calm, reflecting the dusky sky, with ripples spreading out from one point on the surface. The overall mood is serene and content, typical of a leisurely evening spent among friends by the water.","title":"Marina on Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["543231","548164","544269","552870","544306","548132","543042","551571","546800","544130","552868","546079","543465","549935","543944","554659"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["dock","spend","boat","fishing","marina","jean","rod","man","sunglass","maroon"]}
