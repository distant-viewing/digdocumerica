{"path":"554416.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a logging scene deep within a forested area. In the foreground, a muddy, well-trodden dirt road leads into the scene, flanked by lush greenery typical of a dense woodland. The main focus of the picture is a heavy machinery setup involving a yellow bulldozer or loader that is equipped with a grapple, standing adjacent to a large, open-back truck that appears to be carrying soil or debris.\n\nPiled high beside and partially behind the vehicle are numerous cut logs, showcasing varying diameters and the freshly exposed, bright wood at the ends where they have been sawn. These logs are heaped in a somewhat disorderly fashion, although the formation suggests an effort to stack them. Surrounding trees, still standing, encircle the clearing, emphasizing the contrast between the ongoing forestry operation and the natural woodland.\n\nThe environment suggests active logging operations, with the machinery indicating work in moving or arranging the harvested timber, possibly clearing the area or preparing the logs for transport. The natural lighting and composition of the image lend a raw, gritty feel to the scene, highlighting the intersection of industrial activity and natural forest landscapes.","title":"Hardwood logs, ready for trucking, stacked beside logging road on land owned by the Litchfield Paper Company at Tupper Lake.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554419","542790","554418","542624","542623","542855","553468","555154","542824","552201","542851","550354","555472","542616","542852","542856"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","woodland","saw","loader","tread","machinery","encircle","harvest","operation","forestry"]}
