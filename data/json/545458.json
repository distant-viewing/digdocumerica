{"path":"545458.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an amusement ride from a unique perspective, focusing on two riders sitting in a suspended cart. The scene is illuminated by ambient lighting, creating a lively and slightly surreal atmosphere.\n\nThe ride appears to be some kind of swing or pendulum ride, as indicated by the structure of the cart and visible metal framework surrounding it. The cart itself is structured with metal bars and a safety grill, and it's equipped with seats where the riders are securely strapped in. The riders, a man and a woman, are seated next to each other. Both are laughing and appear to be enjoying the ride tremendously, suggesting a moment of thrill and excitement.\n\nIn the background, other riders can be partially seen, providing a sense of depth and context to the setting. The focus on the main subjects, though, is intimate and captures a moment of joyful abandon.\n\nThis setting is typically found in an amusement park or a fair, indicated by the nature of the ride and the informal attire of the participants. The image likely captures a moment of nighttime entertainment, emphasized by the artificial lighting that highlights the faces and expressions of the riders, adding to the dynamic and vibrant mood of the scene.","title":"Riding the ferris wheel at the state fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["551299","551298","551297","547278","551295","549711","554455","543218","543213","545460","543212","545464","549717","546781","545444","549708"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["rider","ride","cart","amusement","thrill","entertainment","grill","laugh","swing","strap"]}
