{"path":"555097.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily logged forest area showing a hillside with extensive tree stumps and remnants scattered across it. Many of these stumps are tall and whitened, likely due to sun exposure, and they stand out starkly against the greener, regrowing vegetation. The setting shows evidence of clear-cut logging, with minimal remaining live trees, indicating a significant alteration to the landscape. The environment around the stumps is starting to recover, showing young, green plants, which suggest the early stages of ecological succession after logging. The sky in the background is clear and blue, adding a stark contrast to the devastation depicted in the foreground. The photograph appears to capture not only the environmental impact of human activities like logging but also the resilient nature of ecosystems beginning to regrow and heal after such interventions.","title":"Seven to ten-year-old Douglas fir trees in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555107","542820","542865","555098","555198","555094","542827","555085","555136","550354","542834","555150","542938","555221","553468","555139"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["stump","evidence","devastation","alteration","cut","intervention","logging","hillside","remnant","stage"]}
