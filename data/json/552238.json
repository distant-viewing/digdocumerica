{"path":"552238.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning and dynamic scene over a body of water, possibly an ocean or a large lake. The composition predominantly features a massive, scattered cluster of pale, whitish birds in flight. These birds, potentially seagulls or similar waterfowl, are caught in various positions as they soar over the dark, rippling surface of the water. The contrast between the bright white of the birds and the deep blue of the water emphasizes the flurry of movement and the density of the bird flock.\n\nThe sunlight seems to be illuminating the birds from one side, highlighting their bodies and making them stand out vividly against the darker water background. The lower part of the image, where the water is visible, shows gentle waves and ripples that suggest a calm day with light wind conditions. The overall effect is a dynamic yet harmonious depiction of natural wildlife in motion, captured in a moment of collective activity. The distribution and density of the birds create a sense of texture and depth, enhanced by the vast, open backdrop of the water surface.","title":"Close-ranked snow geese in flight over Stillaguamish Estuary on Puget Sound","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553347","557125","552146","557121","544609","549772","549738","544605","557124","557126","557123","553875","543273","544834","544500","543283"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","density","water","flock","seagull","distribution","flight","depiction","white","wildlife"]}
