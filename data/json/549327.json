{"path":"549327.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a group of fourteen people standing in front of a large, multi-level, dark-colored shelving unit, located in a grassy field. The shelving unit has an industrial appearance and several open compartments. It's daytime, and the overall lighting suggests an overcast or cloudy day.\n\nThe group is diverse in terms of gender, with both men and women present. Most individuals are wearing white lab coats, suggesting they might be scientists, researchers, or medical professionals. A couple of people are dressed in business attire, including suits and ties, which could indicate they are administrators or executives.\n\nThe individuals are arranged loosely in a line, with some standing slightly in front of others, suggesting an informal group photo. Their expressions vary, with some looking directly at the camera and others slightly away. They appear to be professionally engaged, perhaps taking a break from a meeting or a visit to the facility.\n\nThe grassy field and relaxed positioning of the group provide a casual contrast to what appears to be a more serious or industrial backdrop. This juxtaposition adds to the visual interest of the scene.","title":"Laboratory chiefs of the ruder boskovic institute are involved in research projects for a number of u.s.
