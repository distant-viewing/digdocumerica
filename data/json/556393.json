{"path":"556393.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a group of coal miners at the end of a shift, emerging from the entrance of a mine. This entrance is a small, dark tunnel opening into a larger, covered area with a rugged, industrial feel.\n\nThe miners, all men, are dressed in typical mining attire which includes helmets with headlamps, heavy boots, and dirty, worn clothing that suggests heavy physical work. Some of them carry metal lunch boxes. Their faces and clothes show marks of grime and coal dust, indicative of their hard work underground.\n\nThe setting around the miners is somewhat grimy and utilitarian, with visible structural elements made from concrete and steel. The background includes an upper walkway and some equipment hanging from the structures, suggesting more industrial activity is present outside the frame. The overall atmosphere is gritty, with an overcast sky that contributes to a somber tone in the image.\n\nThe expressions on the minersâ€™ faces range from weary to alert, possibly relieved to be concluding their shift. The group is quite diverse in terms of age and physical appearance, offering a snapshot of the varied individuals who work in such demanding conditions.\n\nOverall, this photograph is a vivid portrayal of the blue-collar workforce in the mining industry, encapsulating the exhaustion, resilience, and solidarity that characterizes the life of a miner.","title":"First shift of miners at the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia, leaving the elevator.  They will be replaced by the second work shift that will work from 4 p.m to midnight.  A midnight to morning or \"hoot-owl\" shift will conduct clean-up operations.  Many of the men carry their own water jugs from home, preferring to do that to drinking the company provided water.
