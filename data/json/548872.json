{"path":"548872.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking silhouette scene against a vibrant red backdrop, reminiscent of a sunset or dramatic lighting. The image predominantly features several herons positioned on the gnarled branches of leafless trees. There are five herons visible; three are perched steadily on branches while two appear in flight, with one of the birds just about to land. The silhouette of the birds and branches contrast starkly against the red background, creating a vivid and somewhat ethereal atmosphere. The simplicity of the color scheme and the elegance of the birdsâ€™ poses produce a serene yet dynamic composition.","title":"American egrets roosting and nesting on the Colorado River Indian Reservation near Parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["544612","554069","555013","549101","544601","544597","551379","547726","549095","544605","544609","547593","543063","557448","551378","548832"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["heron","bird","branch","silhouette","elegance","scheme","flight","pose","simplicity","sunset"]}
