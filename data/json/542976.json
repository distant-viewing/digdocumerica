{"path":"542976.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph shows a scenic coastal scene. In the foreground, there is an accumulation of natural debris scattered across the rocky ground, consisting of driftwood, leaves, and twigs. This area leads towards a rugged shoreline where multiple large, jagged rocks emerge from the sparkling sea water. Near the center of the image and further out on the rocks is a lone person, standing and possibly looking out over the water. The person, potentially a man, is dressed in casual attire which includes jeans and a long-sleeve shirt.\n\nThe background beyond the figure features the glittering ocean under a bright, clear sky. Sunlight reflects vibrantly off the water's surface, creating patterns of light and shadow. The ocean horizon meets the clear blue sky seamlessly at a distance, emphasizing the vastness of the seascape.\n\nThe composition of the photograph cleverly uses the positioning of the rocky foreground and the human figure to draw the viewer's eye towards the expansive ocean, conveying a sense of tranquility and isolation within the natural environment.","title":"Flotsam on beach","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553772","543237","545173","547602","553773","550826","543153","543250","545095","543291","543080","543139","546953","543289","543492","543204"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","glitter","figure","driftwood","twig","seascape","positioning","rock","accumulation","person"]}
