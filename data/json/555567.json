{"path":"555567.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene rural landscape. In the foreground, there is a vast field covered with tall, brownish grass, showing signs of drying, indicating perhaps late summer or early fall. The middle ground features a more cultivated area with green undulating hills, dotted with numerous trees, which appear well-spaced and systematic, suggesting maintained grounds, possibly a park or golf course. Several paths or roads slightly curve through these hills, enhancing the orderliness of the landscape.\n\nIn the background, there are dense clusters of trees and a few visible structures, including white buildings that could be residential or part of a larger estate. The backdrop is a range of low hills or a forested area, offering a sense of depth and seclusion. The sky above is clear and tinged with a faint blue, hinting at a bright, peaceful day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes tranquility and the expansive beauty of a natural environment subtly shaped by human hands.","title":"Countryside of the type that surrounds the hanna coal company preparation plant","placename":"Steubenville (Ohio)","location":"Steubenville, Ohio","nn1":["545040","549236","549249","557087","555603","549142","554722","549146","551304","549261","549256","549218","556990","549157","555537","549141"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["hill","estate","golf","tinge","course","seclusion","cultivate","undulate","dry","summer"]}
