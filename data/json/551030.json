{"path":"551030.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at dusk with atmospheric and dramatic lighting. The sun, positioned relatively low in the sky, casts a warm glow across the scene and is partially obscured by clouds, resulting in a halo effect. Smoke or steam billows from multiple stacks in the background, contributing to a sense of industrial activity.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by electrical utility poles, which are silhouetted against the sky and create vertical lines that contrast with the horizontal lines of the cables. These poles and cables stretch across the image, emphasizing depth and perspective.\n\nIn the midground, the outline of an industrial plant with several structures, including tall chimneys and various buildings, is visible. The plant appears operational as evidenced by the emissions from the chimneys.\n\nThe scene is further detailed by the appearance of vehicles on a road, situated at the bottom of the composition. These vehicles, captured in motion, add a dynamic element to the image and suggest a busy industrial area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the intersection of human activity, technology, and nature, presenting a moment of industrial life in a specific environmental and temporal context. The use of light and shadow, combined with the smoke and the infrastructure, gives the image a moody and evocative quality.","title":"The Belle Du Pont chemical works at sunset.
