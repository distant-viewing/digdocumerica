{"path":"550905.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph presents a dramatic and vivid scene focusing on environmental impact, featuring a large industrial smokestack. This smokestack, likely part of a factory or power plant, is positioned on the left side of the frame and emits a substantial volume of thick, white smoke that billows into the sky. The smoke forms a dense cloud that mirrors the appearance of natural cumulus clouds, floating prominently against a sky with lighter, more diffuse clouds.\n\nThe image captures the contrast between the man-made emissions and the natural environment. The smokestack itself is dark and vertical, with visible structures like ladders or maintenance platforms that outline its utilitarian purpose. The surrounding sky is a clear blue, suggesting a day with good weather, further emphasizing the stark intrusion of the industrial smoke into the natural scene.\n\nThe photograph may serve as a commentary on pollution, environmental degradation, or the impact of industrial activities on the atmosphere. It captures a powerful moment that highlights human influence on nature's backdrop, depicted through the lens of vivid, conventional photography which uses color and composition to draw attention to environmental issues.","title":"Smokestack of the Du Pont Chemical Company on the Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545468","550938","553841","550871","545392","546237","545439","545472","557301","550939","550333","545491","544704","550821","545990","557373"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","smoke","cloud","cumulus","intrusion","ladder","volume","lens","commentary","impact"]}
