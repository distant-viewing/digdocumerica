{"path":"544110.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive, open-pit mining operation. The terrain is rugged and consists of numerous terraced levels. The earth tones are dark with shades of brown and gray, which characterize the stripped and blasted rock surfaces.\n\nIn the image, several large industrial vehicles are present, indicative of ongoing mining activities. These include heavy trucks, which appear to be transporting materials, and at least one large excavation machine with a crane-like arm, likely used for digging and moving earth or ore. The roads winding through the mining site are broad and dusty, suitable for the heavy machinery moving along them.\n\nElectrical or utility poles are visible, suggesting some infrastructure development on the site to support mining operations. There is no vegetation in view, reinforcing the industrial nature of the environment. The background is dominated by the stepped layers of the mine, highlighting the extensive excavation work that has taken place.","title":"The Phelps Dodge Corp.'s Lavender Pit mine","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["544112","544096","549172","552177","553049","554631","549242","544054","544100","549241","544789","543758","544111","549177","555621","544785"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","excavation","ore","earth","site","mine","pit","operation","machine","crane"]}
