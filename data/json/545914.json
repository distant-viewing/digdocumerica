{"path":"545914.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a densely packed urban area, characterized by a highly organized and repetitive layout. Divergent straight roads divide hundreds of closely aligned houses into neat blocks extending from the foreground to the distant background, creating a grid pattern. The houses appear similar, predominantly single-story, with light-colored rooftops, perhaps suggesting a residential suburb. Amidst these residential blocks, the main thoroughfare cuts through the image from bottom to center, lined with larger commercial or industrial buildings distinguishable by their bigger footprints and flat roofs.\n\nSeveral smaller streets crisscross the main road, enhancing the structured urban planning visible in the area. Vegetation is sparse, seen mainly as small patches in backyards or as isolated trees along streets, which contrasts with the dense urban development. The background of the image reveals a more varied topography with patches of undeveloped land and hints of hills, providing a natural border and adding depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a typical suburban landscape marked by uniform residential units and an intersecting network of roads, showcasing the common architectural and urban design strategies used to accommodate population density and facilitate accessibility in such environments.","title":"California--Crescent City","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["546399","558112","549071","552730","553699","553939","544510","553934","547435","553700","552729","544550","553937","556975","548825","544629"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["block","population","road","suburb","thoroughfare","backyard","accommodate","footprint","accessibility","house"]}
