{"path":"545500.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, slightly misty camping scene amidst a dense forest. A young man stands in the foreground, focusing on hanging up or examining a blue jean jacket. He is dressed in simple, casual clothing—a light-colored T-shirt and pants—with a calm expression, suggesting routine or contemplation.\n\nTo his left, a well-used, olive-green canvas tent is pitched. It appears slightly worn, blending naturally with the surrounding greens and browns of the forest floor scattered with small plants, leaves, and some litter like an orange and a beverage can. Smoke gently rises from a small campfire near the center, adding to the tranquil, outdoor atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, a classic yellow Volkswagen Beetle, adorned with luggage and equipment strapped to the roof, is parked. This element adds a splash of bright color and implies a sense of travel and adventure tied to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and natural lighting of the photo evoke a sense of peaceful solitude and the simple joys of camping, highlighting an intimate connection with nature. The trees envelop the scene, providing a lush, green canopy and a sense of seclusion and quietness away from urban life.","title":"Gasp (greater Alliance to stop pollution) organized a weekend trip to bankhead national forest as part of the campaign to prevent clear-cutting here.
