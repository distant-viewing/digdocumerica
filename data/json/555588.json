{"path":"555588.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape scene characterized by rolling hills and earthworks which suggest some kind of mining or industrial activity. The foreground features a field of tall, golden grass, giving the scene an overall rustic hue enhanced by the soft, diffuse lighting which indicates either early morning or late afternoon. Scattered throughout the grass are small bushes or shrubs.\n\nThe middle ground consists of several hillocks, likely man-made given their symmetrical shapes and the cuts visible in their sides. These hillocks are darker in color, appearing to be composed of earth or possibly coal. This composition hints at a possible mining operation in the area.\n\nThe background of the image reveals more of these mounds, and includes machinery typically associated with mining or industrial works. There is a crane visible, as well as what appears to be some type of conveyor or similar machinery. A few small buildings or structures can also be seen, possibly used for storing equipment or as employee facilities.\n\nThe overall composition and the presence of machinery suggest that this photograph is of a mining area or a site involved in some form of industrial processing. The landscape is devoid of trees or larger vegetation, focusing the viewer's attention on the industrial activities and the impact they have on the surrounding environment. The lighting and coloration provide a serene, yet stark impression of this industrious setting.","title":"Land that was previously stripped by the coal companies off route #519.
