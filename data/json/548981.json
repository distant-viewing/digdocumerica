{"path":"548981.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an agricultural scene, likely taken during a harvesting operation. In the image, a large red combine harvester is depicted in a field, actively engaged in processing crops. The harvester is equipped with machinery and conveyor elements that collect and sort the crop. A prominent feature is the outflow pipe on the side of the harvester, from which a stream of harvested grain or seeds is being ejected, forming a pile on the ground.\n\nInside the harvester's cabin, a man can be seen. He appears to be operating the machine, wearing a white shirt and looking focused on his task. The cabin has a white door which is open, adding a sense of action to the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph reveals a broad, flat landscape typical of many agricultural zones. The farmland stretches far into the horizon, under a clear sky with minimal cloud coverage, suggesting it might be either morning or late afternoon, considering the lighting.\n\nThe scenery is quite calm, with no other individuals or machines visible in the immediate vicinity, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention predominantly on the harvesting activity and the operator within the machinery. The muted earthy tones of the field contrast with the bright red color of the harvester and the darker soil being turned over and processed, providing a visual narrative of agricultural productivity and mechanical intervention in nature.","title":"Harvesting barley grown in the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548982","548976","548985","548964","549046","554044","547432","548874","554045","547734","555619","548979","547730","549036","549258","548876"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvester","harvesting","cabin","crop","machine","productivity","seed","process","machinery","operator"]}
