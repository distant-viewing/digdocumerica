The man, who is the focus of the image, appears to be in his late 60s or early 70s and wears glasses. He is dressed in a dark jacket and a lighter shirt beneath it. His expression is concentrated as he looks down at what seems to be a booklet or paper he is holding in his hands.\n\nThe background features a lush setting with a variety of trees and bright sunlight filtering through the foliage, suggesting a warm, sunny day. Surrounding the older man are several individuals, likely participants or students, who are partially visible and seem to be observing or listening to him. The foreground includes blurred branches, emphasizing the outdoor, natural environment of the activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines elements of nature, learning, and group interaction, centered around the elderly man, who appears to be leading or instructing the group.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["554797","543238","553357","554028","554665","542777","552113","542563","543236","557005","544829","544295","545493","542613","557115","544236"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["instruct","60","student","70","man","learning","concentrate","group","participant","listen"]}
