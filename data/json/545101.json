{"path":"545101.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a striking view overlooking a beach from a high vantage point. The composition is split between a natural scene featuring flora in the foreground, and the expansive view of the ocean in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on a group of wildflowers, predominantly yellow, bathed in soft sunlight that enhances their vibrancy against the darker tones of the surrounding foliage. Prominently positioned are two tall flower heads on slender stalks, rising above the dense undergrowth. These flowers add a distinct point of interest against the more muted colors of the rest of the vegetation.\n\nThe background unveils a dramatic and detailed view of a beach whose shore is lined with gentle, foamy waves. The ocean appears dynamic and textured with multiple lines of surf parallel to the shore, indicating the rhythmic motion of the sea. The sand is visible in patches, suggesting a beach that is both wide and seemingly deserted.\n\nThe ocean's vastness contrasts with the detailed and intimate portrayal of the plants, creating a depth that feels both expansive and introspective. The light and shadow play across this scene highlights the natural beauty and tranquility of this coastal environment.","title":"\"Beach\"","placename":"Seal Rock (Or.)","location":"Seal Rock, Oregon","nn1":["547592","553997","542968","543399","543074","543199","543066","547596","543401","554082","545279","543255","542917","545215","545280","553805"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","beach","flower","shore","surf","stalk","undergrowth","portrayal","point","vibrancy"]}
