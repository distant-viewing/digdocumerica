{"path":"548359.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a densely packed urban area dominated by an intricate network of roads and highways. There are multiple cloverleaf interchanges and curved roadways that intersect and overlap, likely facilitating the flow of traffic in various directions. Throughout the image, numerous vehicles are visible on the roads, indicating active transport and commuting.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a mix of commercial and industrial buildings. Several taller buildings are present, suggesting a mix of offices or residential blocks. Numerous smaller structures, possibly warehouses or workshops, are scattered throughout the region. Parking lots filled with cars can be seen adjacent to many of these buildings.\n\nThe scene also includes open spaces that appear to be utilized for storage or as loading docks, evidenced by the presence of stationary trucks and containers. The overall landscape is highly developed with no visible green spaces or recreational areas, highlighting the urban and utilitarian character of the neighborhood.\n\nThis area's dense layout and the predominance of transportation infrastructure suggest it could be part of a major city focused significantly on industrial and commercial activity. The photograph provides a detailed glimpse into the complex and busy nature of urban transportation and business operations in a densely populated area.","title":"Midtown Manhattan, showing entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548363","547764","548332","546726","548411","547770","546616","546617","553001","546573","555745","553015","548358","548092","548434","548333"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["transportation","commuting","interchange","mix","workshop","space","roadway","warehouse","block","road"]}
