{"path":"543909.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a person's hand holding a blue crab with its claws raised in a defensive or striking posture. The focus is primarily on the crab positioned in the foreground, making its detailed features like the spiky shell, pointed claws, and legs clearly visible.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a water body that appears to be a river or canal with calm, shimmering water. On either side of the water, there are grassy banks leading to a more built-up area in the far background, hinting at rural or semi-urban surroundings. Near the middle of the photo across the water, there is a structure that looks like a small bridge or a barricade, which could potentially be used for water regulation or as a crossing point.\n\nThe whole scene is illuminated with natural light, suggesting the photo was taken during the day under clear skies. The outdoor setting and naturalistic elements suggest a context of ecological study, recreational fishing, or wildlife observation.","title":"Marine life taken from water near the p.h.
