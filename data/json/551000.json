{"path":"551000.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene that includes several structures, likely residential, lining a dirt road. The houses have a rustic, weathered appearance, characteristic of older, perhaps mid-20th-century build. Several of the homes have front porches, some of which are outfitted with casual patio furniture suggesting areas for relaxation or social interaction.\n\nThe environment has full, lush trees providing a thick canopy in the background, indicating the photograph might be taken during spring or summer. Underneath this canopy, there are patches of vibrant greenery and lawns interspersed with utility poles and other small outbuildings, possibly for storage or farm-related uses.\n\nIn the foreground lies a white and black dog, sprawled out on the dirt road, capturing a relaxed or sleepy posture. Near the dog, the ground is sprinkled with random small objects and debris, which may include elements of rural life such as tools or parts of machinery. A conspicuous red barrel stands out against the predominantly green and earthen tones of the surroundings, possibly used for trash or storage.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a peaceful, albeit somewhat neglected, rural setting. It possesses an air of quiet day-to-day life devoid of urgent activity, emphasizing a laid-back lifestyle possibly common in such rural communities.","title":"Substandard housing in Coalburg on the Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
