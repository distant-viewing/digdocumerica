{"path":"549686.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban street scene featuring a woman and a van. The woman, who is smiling, is dressed in a bright green dress with a dark blazer over it and is walking quickly across the street while looking back, possibly at the van. She carries papers in one hand and a bag in the other.\n\nThe van, parked on the street, is painted in purple with accents and decorative text in yellow and white. It appears to be a service or delivery van, broadly labeled with \"dial-a-ride\" and other text, along with a phone number. The van's design suggests a vibrant, 1970s or 1980s style.\n\nIn the background, there are residential homes typical of suburban neighborhoods, featuring well-maintained lawns and driveways. The homes are two-story with brick and siding exteriors. The overall ambiance is peaceful and routine, possibly in a mid-size American town. The overcast sky and indirect lighting suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Smiling passenger is dropped at her home by Dial-a-Ride bus.
