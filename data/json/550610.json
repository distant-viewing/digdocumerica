{"path":"550610.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody landscape dominated by an expansive view of mountain ranges and glaciers under an overcast sky. The foreground is a vast, flat terrain, likely a valley, which features sparse vegetation and appears dark and moody, suggestive of either early dawn or dusk lighting. The middle ground reveals a series of rugged mountains, their jagged peaks partly obscured by low-lying clouds or mists mingling with the landscape.\n\nThe focal point of the image is the stunning snow-covered mountains in the background, with glaciers visible in the crevices between peaks. These mountains are enveloped by large, billowing clouds, mostly gray and some white, reflecting the sunlight in areas, which highlights their majestic and cold nature. The clouds add a dynamic and almost brooding character to the scene, suggesting an imminent change in weather, possibly a storm.\n\nThe overall composition, with its layers of land and sky, varying textures from smooth ice to rugged rocks, and the interplay of light and shadow, creates a compelling and powerful image of natural grandeur and the untamed wildness of a remote wilderness. The color palette is cool, primarily consisting of blues, grays, and whites which reinforce the cold, harsh climate. The image evokes a sense of isolation and the formidable power of nature.","title":"View north to the Alaska Range","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550592","550408","550415","550419","550594","550645","550628","550504","544905","550635","550409","543831","555662","543023","542520","550505"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["glacier","mountain","peak","cloud","wildness","crevice","storm","ice","grandeur","change"]}
