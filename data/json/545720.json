{"path":"545720.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a vibrant blooming bush or small tree with numerous delicate white flowers. The flowers are densely packed along the thin, branching stems, surrounded by small, green leaves that have a slightly jagged appearance. The branches criss-cross intricately, creating a dense floral network. The petals of the flowers are open, with visible yellow centers, suggesting they are fully in bloom and perhaps attracting pollinators.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, with dark and light patches that suggest this bush is bathed in natural light, possibly sunlight filtering through other vegetation or trees. This effect creates a spotlight on the clusters of white flowers, enhancing their brightness against the darker backdrop. The overall mood is one of a fresh, lush springtime scene, filled with natural beauty and tranquility. The focus and clarity of the photograph emphasize the details of the flowers and their arrangement on the branches.","title":"Cliff roses","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545726","554576","554590","554587","545695","554574","547642","553368","555106","544875","553366","544876","554575","554745","554595","549230"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","spotlight","branch","cross","stem","petal","bloom","brightness","clarity","network"]}
