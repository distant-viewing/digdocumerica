{"path":"543871.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a young boy seated outdoors in what appears to be a field of crops under bright sunlight. The boy is dressed in light-colored casual attire consisting of a loosely fitted, unbuttoned, long-sleeve yellow shirt and striped pants. His hair is neatly cut, and he has a focused expression, looking off to the side.\n\nHe is seated on the dry, clumpy soil amid small, leafy green plants, indicating a cultivated field. His knees are slightly raised, and his hands rest upon the ground, one among the plants, suggesting a moment of pause in an agricultural setting. Around him, the environment is solely made up of similar vegetation, underlined by a clear sky barely visible on the upper edges of the image. The scene conveys a sense of calm outdoor activity, possibly in a rural or agricultural setting.","title":"Young child of migrant family works in sugarbeet field.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["549254","557937","556558","552035","553494","543688","545307","555915","557796","548837","551763","543476","549083","542548","553553","553221"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","pause","field","plant","knee","crop","sleeve","soil","pant","hair"]}
