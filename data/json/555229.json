{"path":"555229.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape featuring an aquamarine pond surrounded by rich forest terrain. The foreground prominently displays a fallen tree trunk lying diagonally across the pond, partly submerged in the clear water and pointing toward the camera, adding depth to the composition.\n\nThe water of the pond is relatively still and reflects the sky and surrounding foliage with slight ripples distorting parts of the reflection, giving a sense of tranquility and slight movement. The color of the water varies from deep blue to vibrant turquoise, possibly due to the clarity of the water and the play of light.\n\nSeveral dead tree stumps protrude from the water, adding to the wild, natural ambiance. Thick conifer trees, primarily evergreens, form the middle and background layers, dwarfing the pond and providing a dense green backdrop that contrasts strikingly with the water.\n\nThe sky is barely visible but suggests a clear day as it contributes to the overall brightness of the scene. No human activity is evident, emphasizing the untouched and secluded character of the setting. The natural light appears to be that of midday or early afternoon, as it casts short shadows and highlights details in the landscape, enhancing the colors and textures within the environment.","title":"Entrophication in satsop lake in olympic national timberland, Washington.
