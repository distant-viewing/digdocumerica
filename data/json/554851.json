{"path":"554851.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged woman sitting at a wooden desk in what appears to be an office setting. She is dressed in a vibrant red, white, and blue patterned shirt, possibly a blouse, which echoes a patriotic theme. Her expression is serious as she looks to the side, away from the camera, possibly at someone in the room. The woman is engaged in a task, writing or reviewing documents that are spread out in front of her on the desk.\n\nIn the background, there is a muted olive green door slightly ajar, and another door closed, painted in a similar color. To the right side of the image, an American flag is partially visible, mounted on a pole and hanging vertically against a creamy beige wall. There also appears to be a black filing cabinet between the desk where the woman sits and the closed door, suggesting an office environment.\n\nThe overall setting is simple and utilitarian with a governmental or institutional feel, emphasized by the presence of the American flag. The lighting is soft, illuminating the scene without creating harsh shadows, which conveys a calm, focused atmosphere. \n\nThe composition of the photograph directs attention to the woman and her activities, framed by the elements of her workspace. The use of deep wooden tones and the subdued colors of the room complement the colorful attire of the woman, making her the focal point of the scene.","title":"Schoolteacher at Leakey, Texas, facing her class, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546479","556413","555516","556264","548237","551897","544318","554344","547284","558225","546486","556471","558339","553088","558378","545083"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","woman","door","office","flag","room","review","echo","cabinet","sit"]}
