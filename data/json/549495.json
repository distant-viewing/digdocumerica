{"path":"549495.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an industrial area adjacent to a body of water, presumably a river or a coastal bay. The image features multiple industrial buildings, some emitting smoke or steam from their tall stacks, suggesting active production or processing. There is a visible dock area where several bright orange and brown railroad cars are parked on tracks, hinting at the transportation of goods or raw materials. A wharf extends into the water with what appears to be tanks or silos, possibly for storing liquids or gases.\n\nThe surroundings include various structured areas with additional buildings, parking lots filled with cars, and neatly arranged roads, indicating a well-organized industrial complex. The landscape across the river shows a more residential or lightly industrial environment with smaller buildings and green spaces.\n\nThe water body itself has a shimmer due to sunlight, and at various points near the shoreline, small waves can be seen breaking, suggesting a gentle flow of water. The overall composition of the photograph, with its clear separation of industrial activities and surrounding nature, provides a stark visual contrast between human industrial endeavors and the natural environment.","title":"International Paper Company plant at Tonowanda, between the city of Niagara Falls and Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["550890","555769","552191","549968","548423","555776","551566","549526","552187","552209","552151","551177","555765","552181","550886","551551"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["shimmer","separation","liquid","endeavor","railroad","silo","production","river","water","gas"]}
