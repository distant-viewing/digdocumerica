{"path":"546655.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a group of individuals at a bus stop, positioned alongside a vibrant red and silver bus, marked with the number \"18 X.\" The scene is set against a murky, overcast sky, which lends a grey tint to the atmosphere. Additionally, the ground is covered in lush green grass, contrasting with the bus's vivid colors.\n\nThe individuals, possibly passengers, are depicted in a line parallel to the bus, engaging in the activity of boarding. The people are clad in attire typical of colder weather; men are wearing suits, hats, and overcoats, while women are dressed in coats, with some wearing hats. The fashion and styling suggest a timeframe from the mid-20th century.\n\nThe bus itself exhibits a clean, well-maintained appearance with striped detailing and large windows. A notable feature on the bus is the sign near the front indicating a destination or route, identifiable by “Northern Indiana.” This point could imply a regional bus service location. Several of the bus’s windows are open, indicating either the bus’s readiness to depart or ventilation for the comfort of those inside.\n\nThe mood evoked by the image is one of regular, everyday travel, hinting at the routines and movements of ordinary people during a seemingly cold day. The presence of uniformed personnel (potentially bus drivers or conductors) interacting with the passengers underscores a sense of orderly transit service.","title":"Park and ride station in Springfield, va.
