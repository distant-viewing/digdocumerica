{"path":"544115.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on the water near dusk. A person wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and sunglasses is sitting at the helm of a dark-hued speedboat. The individual appears relaxed, navigating the boat through calm waters. The boat is detailed with a visible windscreen and some gadgets that might be used for navigation or control.\n\nIn the background, various elements contribute to the tranquil marine setting: there are ripples in the water reflecting the gentle light of the evening sun, contributing to a soft, serene ambiance. Further in the distance, a buoy and another boat are visible, adding to the sense of a populated but peaceful waterway.\n\nThe lighting is particularly notable, with the sunlight highlighting the contours of the boat and creating a silhouette effect around the individual and parts of the boat. The warm tone of the light suggests it is either early morning or late in the day, times typically associated with calmer waters and lower wind, ideal for boating. The overall mood is one of tranquility and leisure, likely a moment of solitude or contemplation amidst the gentle sway of the water.","title":"Arizona--Lake Powell","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["546976","549417","552310","543411","548118","551313","549411","552345","545170","553411","551307","551215","547549","543942","547230","549374"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","speedboat","sway","water","buoy","navigation","straw","ideal","relax","brim"]}
