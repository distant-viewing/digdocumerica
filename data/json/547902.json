{"path":"547902.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a large, worn-out outdoor amusement slide, possibly from a fairground or a carnival. The slide has multiple parallel lanes that allow multiple users to slide down simultaneously. These lanes appear weathered and faded, primarily in shades of off-white and red with visible patches of wear and dark marks, suggesting that they are well-used and possibly quite old. At the top of the slide, a few individuals can be seen either preparing to slide down or casually standing near the starting point. The structure of the slide is supported by metallic frames, visible at the sides.\n\nIn the background, wire fences and various urban features, such as tall buildings, hint at the slide's location in an urban or semi-urban setting. The sky is fairly clear with just a few clouds, indicating good weather, which is typical for outdoor amusement activities. The overall scene depicts a day of leisure and recreation, though the condition of the slide suggests it might be a relic from a past era of the amusement park or fairground.","title":"Abandoned \"giant slide\" at Coney Island marks decline of area's recreational use","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555928","553134","543212","555946","547192","555931","552470","549718","547875","551720","556290","547898","545977","555901","549653","549666"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["slide","amusement","fairground","lane","carnival","mark","recreation","wire","wear","fence"]}
