{"path":"545972.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring two young boys and a black dog in playful high spirits. The background is a pictorial waterscape, with a canal bordered by docks and moored boats, hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe foreground shows one boy riding a unique, homemade bicycle that is large and elaborately constructed. It features an extended front, outfitted with a disproportionately large front wheel, and traditional rear wheels. This bike, akin to a modified tricycle, has a striking frame that includes a steering handle attached directly to the front wheel. The second boy is running alongside the bicycle, with an expressive and joyous face, shouting or laughing as he races.\n\nBoth boys display a casual, carefree style typical of childhood adventures. They are dressed in simple, everyday clothing suitable for outdoor play, reflecting the freedom and spontaneity of their activity.\n\nThe canine companion adds to the scene's energy, running along with the boys with its ears perked up, contributing to the dynamic and joyful nature of the moment.\n\nIn the waterway, a serene and naturalistic setting is evident, with calm water reflecting a clear sky, lined by reeds and trees, some draped with Spanish moss. This provides a tranquil backdrop to the ebullient activity on the path, contrasting the motion and excitement of the children and dog with the placidity of the natural environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its vibrant activity in the foreground and peaceful natural scenery in the background, creates a harmonious yet lively scene.","title":"Children of fishermen on homemade tricycle","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["553526","553510","545957","545218","544358","554497","549275","543715","543780","543485","552674","543395","553072","547197","557409","546873"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","wheel","bicycle","dog","spontaneity","tricycle","waterscape","race","companion","spirit"]}
