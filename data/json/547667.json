{"path":"547667.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene during what appears to be dusk, given the low-light conditions which bathe the scene in deep, warm tones. The setting is a waterfront area, likely a harbor or riverbank, featuring large industrial elements.\n\nIn the foreground, you can see several large, round storage tanks. These tanks are simple in shape, seemingly metallic, and dominate the lower part of the image. Their surfaces reflect the faint ambient light, suggesting a polished finish.\n\nBeyond the tanks and slightly to their left, there is a body of water. On the water, a large, dark ship is moored adjacent to what appears to be a cargo-loading framework or an industrial structure, possibly a gantry of some sort. This structure is significant in size compared to the ship and creates a silhouette against the sky. Smoke or steam is visible emanating from the ship, drifting upwards, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe background features a horizon line of low buildings or industrial structures further extending the feel of an industrial area. There is no visible vegetation or natural landscape, emphasizing the industrial and utilitarian nature of the environment.\n\nThe overall mood is subdued and somewhat solemn due to the lighting and the industrial setting. The use of silhouette and the limited but warm color palette impart an almost serene yet melancholic quality to the photograph.","title":"Storage tanks along the heavily industrialized Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["546864","546118","547702","550910","546876","551954","546058","544293","543004","546108","550963","551140","555724","547102","547056","547572"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["ship","tank","drift","silhouette","impart","loading","finish","emanate","harbor","cargo"]}
