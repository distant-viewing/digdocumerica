{"path":"549873.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene that appears to be from the 1970s or 1980s given the style of vehicles and fashion. At the forefront is a bright yellow taxi, possibly a Dodge model from the era, featuring classic circular headlights and chrome bumpers. The taxi has its door open and a man is seen talking to the driver. \n\nBehind the taxi, the street is bustling with various other vehicles and people. Thereâ€™s a large red truck directly behind, which has a rugged design indicating it might be used for deliveries or industrial purposes. Across the street, you can see other cars and trucks suggesting traffic and typical city congestion.\n\nOn the sidewalks, numerous pedestrians of different ages and wearing typical mid-20th-century attire are visible. They seem to be going about their daily routines, with some carrying bags, suggesting shopping or errands. \n\nThe setting indicates a commercial area with signs and store fronts, although the specifics are not entirely clear due to the focus on the street and vehicles. The overall atmosphere depicted is lively and encapsulates a typical day in a bustling city environment.","title":"Taking on a fare, cab blocks traffic in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549876","549859","554330","554331","549869","554310","549848","548410","554314","554315","554294","548331","554293","554329","549868","556716"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","street","fronts","forefro","specifics","vehicle","delivery","bumper","congestion","shopping"]}
