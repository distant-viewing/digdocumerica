{"path":"555818.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene. In the foreground, a dirt road stretches forward, muddy in places, flanked on both sides by vibrant green grass. It is a cloudy day, which casts an overcast, diffused light over the scene, enhancing the lushness of the vegetation.\n\nOn both sides of the dirt road, tall trees with dense green foliage form a natural archway, creating a tunnel-like effect that guides the viewer's gaze towards the vanishing point on the horizon. Some patches of the sky peek through the leaves, hinting at the overcast conditions.\n\nTo the right of the road, there is a wooden fence that runs parallel, partially obscured by the tall grass and undergrowth. Beyond the fence, a pasture or field appears, suggesting the area is used for agriculture or grazing.\n\nFurther back, on the edge of the road, two rural structures are visible: one appears to be a house while the second resembles a barn or shed. Both buildings have a faded, weather-worn look, typical of rural farm buildings. The house is predominantly white with a dark roof, blending into the natural surroundings, while the barn or shed is darker, possibly wooden, adding to the rustic charm of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its leading lines (the road and fence) and natural framing (the trees), directs attention towards the rural buildings, evoking a sense of peaceful countryside living. The mood is quiet and tranquil, typical of less urbanized areas.","title":"Entrance to Finderne Farms, Somerville, New Jersey, in the metropolitan New York area. It is the last farm remaining in this industrialized area and has been in the farmer's wife's family for four generations. During the Depression the land was sold to neighboring industries which rent it back to the farmer. Taxes are too high here for the farmer to own the land himself.","placename":"Somerville (N.J.)","location":"Somerville, New Jersey","nn1":["549257","549235","547354","547300","555635","547316","554800","555624","554819","549261","556462","557946","557154","557748","554767","547658"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","fence","barn","shed","grazing","vanish","pasture","lushness","archway","dirt"]}
