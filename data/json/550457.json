{"path":"550457.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a braided river system, characterized by multiple channels that split and rejoin around sediment deposits, creating an intricate network of waterways. The river flows through a landscape that appears relatively flat and vast, suggesting a remote natural area possibly in a tundra or wetland region.\n\nThe riverbed includes large patches of light-colored sandy or silty material, which stand out against darker areas likely consisting of water or denser vegetation. The surrounding terrain is dotted with various small lakes or ponds, enhancing the complexity of the hydrographic network. The overall color palette is subdued, dominated by earth tones that indicate a lack of dense vegetation, possibly due to the cold or arid climate of the area.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of untouched wilderness, with no visible human activity or infrastructure, emphasizing the natural geological and hydrological processes occurring in the region. The photo captures the dynamic and ever-changing nature of river systems in such environments.","title":"Braided channels of the sagavanirktok river opposite the southwest corner of the franklin Bluffs.
