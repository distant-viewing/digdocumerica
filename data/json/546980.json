{"path":"546980.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"In the photograph, two men are engaging in an early morning fishing activity on a calm, vast body of water. The scene portrays a serene, almost pastel-toned dawn with the sky blending subtly into the waters which reflect a gentle pinkish hue. The focus is on a wooden fishing boat, seen from the side, where the two men stand. The boat is equipped with various fishing gears, including nets and cages, suggesting that they might be professional fishermen gearing up for the day's work.\n\nThe older man, who wears a red sweater and dark pants, is standing more towards the stern of the boat, looking out across the water, possibly checking on another nearby boat or surveying the area. The younger man, wearing a striped shirt and jeans, is positioned slightly towards the bow, engaging in some tasks within the boat, which could include organizing equipment or preparing fishing lines. \n\nFloating nearby is a smaller, unoccupied boat which appears weathered, adding a sense of depth and context to the fishing activities in the area. The horizon is visible but mostly obscured by a light fog or mist, with distant trees faintly marking the boundary between water and sky. The overall atmosphere of the photo captures a peaceful but active morning, with these individuals beginning their day amidst a beautiful natural setting.","title":"Crabbing in the waters around Bluffton.
