{"path":"543198.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a lush, natural setting dominated by an old, majestic tree whose thick and gnarled branches extend in various directions, creating an intricate wooden tapestry. The tree’s textured bark and enormous trunk suggest it is very aged. A small, weathered wooden shed with a slanted roof is partially enveloped by one of the tree’s large, twisted limbs, indicating the tree's expansive growth over time. The shed appears rustic and abandoned, with its grey wooden panels and slightly ajar door contributing to a feeling of neglect and the passage of time.\n\nThe foreground is covered in a dense layer of green vegetation, including small, leafy plants and scattered white flowers, adding a touch of color and life to the scene. The background is somewhat obscured by the tree’s branches, but it hints at a similarly wooded area, suggesting this setting is in a forested or rural environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene yet somewhat eerie, evoking a sense of solitude and the enduring presence of nature over human-made structures. The interplay between the tree and the shed illustrates a picturesque yet poignant scene of natural dominance and architectural decay.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551328","557622","545278","542958","554999","554976","542570","552551","554099","544997","554973","544942","554977","550792","555632","552101"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["shed","tree","dominance","limb","branch","tapestry","time","bark","passage","panel"]}
