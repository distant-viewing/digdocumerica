{"path":"546408.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque beach scene with a mix of natural beauty and urban architecture. In the foreground, a person is sitting on the sandy shore, seemingly relaxed and enjoying the view. They are sitting under the shade of a tree, dressed in shorts and a casual shirt, with a towel or fabric laid next to them.\n\nThe beach itself appears relatively tranquil with only a few other visitors visible in the distance. The edge of the water is gentle, with light waves lapping at the shore. A striking feature of this scene is the presence of vehicles driving along the wet sand near the ocean's edge, which adds a dynamic aspect to the tranquil beach setting. There are at least three vehicles; one is particularly noticeable due to its classic design and red color.\n\nThe background is dominated by two tall, modern buildings, likely condominiums or hotels, which stand prominently against the landscape. They are multi-storied and appear to have balconies offering views of the ocean. Beyond these structures, lush green hills or mountains can be seen, contributing to the scenic quality of the environment. \n\nOverall, the composition beautifully contrasts the serene beachfront with the imposing urban structures, showcasing a blend of natural and man-made environments. The photograph is vivid in color, enhancing the visual appeal and capturing the essence of a vibrant coastal locale.","title":"Luquillo Beach","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553766","545162","553765","546412","543089","548698","543254","553982","553764","543303","557475","543425","553967","551587","550922","557480"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","beachfront","ocean","shore","hotel","sit","towel","locale","appeal","lap"]}
