{"path":"547071.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an intense and dramatic moment where a large wave is crashing against a house. The house, visible on the left, features a dark roof with a red edge and a body of light-gray siding. A window with an air conditioning unit is partially visible. The wave, exploding in a dynamic display of power, engulfs the scene with its spray and foam lit by either the sun or another light source, giving parts of the water a glowing effect against the darker tones of the scene. The force of the water is exhibited by the sheer height - it towers above the house’s roofline, emphasizing the power and potentially destructive nature of the wave. The photograph has a moody and slightly surreal quality due to the lighting and color saturation, enhancing the dramatic impact of nature’s force juxtaposed with human habitation.","title":"Looking over two-story rooftops to Lake Michigan, as waves explode against a sea wall.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547155","547119","543251","547609","547114","547030","551953","551963","548079","547118","547085","552436","547036","543253","543138","543337"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["wave","force","house","power","conditioning","roofline","spray","saturation","foam","habitation"]}
