{"path":"549151.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph provides a scenic and natural view from a high vantage point. The foreground is dominated by a rocky outcrop, featuring a textured surface with cracks and patches of lichen or moss. The rock slopes steeply down and away from the viewer, suggesting a precipitous overlook.\n\nTo the left side, a pine tree grows from the edge of the rocky outcrop, bending into the frame. Its branches, filled with needle-like leaves, stretch across the top left corner of the image, partially framing the view with a natural border. The darkness of the tree contrasts with the lighter rock and the distant landscape.\n\nBeyond the immediate rocky foreground and tree, the background expands into a wide, open landscape. This consists of rolling hills covered in patches of greenery and trees, stretching out under a vast sky. The sky is slightly overcast, casting an even, soft light over the scene, which enhances the tranquility and depth of the view.\n\nThere is no human activity visible in the image; the focus is entirely on the natural environment and its serene, rugged beauty. The perspective and composition of the photograph encourage a feeling of overlooking a vast and undisturbed natural space, inviting contemplation and admiration of the scenery.","title":"Roy fly ranch near sarpy basin.
