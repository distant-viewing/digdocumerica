{"path":"551343.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph is taken from the perspective of someone looking out of a medieval-style arched stone window. The arched opening frames a picturesque landscape consisting of lush greenery, a walking path, a river, and rolling hills in the distance.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, there's a dirt path that winds slightly as it moves away from the viewer. On this path, two people are seen walking. They are small in the frame and their details are indistinct due to the distance, but they appear to be engaged in a leisurely stroll.\n\nBeyond the path, the landscape features dense green trees and foliage that stretch out around the area. In the distance, slightly to the left of the middle, there's a calm river that meanders through the scene. The river reflects the light and is bordered by trees on either side.\n\nOn the left side of the view through the window, and also in the distant background, there are portions of a small settlement or possibly old buildings that blend into the surrounding greenery.\n\nOverhead, the sky is visible through the top of the arch, adding a contrasting brightness to the lush, darker tones of the green landscape.\n\nThe composition and framing through the stone window offer a sense of peaceful seclusion and a connection to history, while also highlighting the beauty of the natural landscape that dominates the view.","title":"The area known as the ha ha tonka, on the niangua arm of the lake of the ozarks, is one of unusual interest.  A land mark is the r.m.  Snyder mansion, built sometime after 1904 of stone quarried on the estate by masons brought in from scotland.  The mansion has stood in ruins since it burned in 1942.
