{"path":"555266.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features an analog device displaying a chart on a continuous paper roll, with various graphs and lines imprinted upon it. The background is slightly out of focus but visibly includes parts of the machine that feeds the paper, which is dotted with circular holes on its sides used for mechanical transit through the device. The top and some parts at the bottom of the paper show a grid pattern, while the center and majority of the visible paper is covered with red lines that seem to represent data readings (likely an output from a form of measurement tool). Thereâ€™s a jagged pattern to some lines, indicating fluctuations in whatever is being measured, and smoother curves in others suggesting more stable readings. The overall setup is technical, and it appears to be a piece of scientific or medical equipment possibly used for monitoring or recording specific data points over time.","title":"Closeup of gas liquid chromatograph used by Environmental Protection Agency laboratory technicians to separate components of pesticide samples brought in by inspectors for analysis in New York City.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549610","546285","546281","542765","547740","548893","555249","557829","552377","542659","555252","557331","547671","555248","551595","555374"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["paper","reading","device","output","chart","roll","line","datum","measurement","hole"]}
