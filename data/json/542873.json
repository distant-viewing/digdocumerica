{"path":"542873.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a maritime scene featuring a close-up view of two boats docked in a harbor. The boat in the foreground is mainly white with a wooden casing and a life ring attached to its side that is white with a black rim. The cabin of this boat has small windows and a variety of nautical equipment visible on its roof and sides. The water reflects subtle ripples, suggesting a calm day.\n\nThe second boat, partially visible behind the first, is named \"GLENDORA.\" It possesses a robust, sturdy build typical of fishing or commercial vessels, with a darker hull and a structure that supports navigation and fishing activities. The name \"GLENDORA\" is clearly inscribed in dark letters on its lighter superstructure, and details such as antennas, masts, and other functional maritime gear are prominent on top of the boat.\n\nThe background of the image is slightly obscured but seems to feature a hilly landscape, suggesting that the harbor is located in a valley or a geography with elevated terrain. The sky is overcast, imparting a soft light and a somber mood to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is rich in nautical details, conveying a sense of everyday operations in a coastal or harbor environment. The focus on the boats and their equipment highlights their readiness for sea, reflecting a blend of workmanship and functionality inherent to seafaring vessels.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542905","546939","548235","543035","542872","542911","552296","543247","548535","548078","548539","548037","542904","547565","542902","548546"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","harbor","vessel","fishing","geography","superstructure","rim","readiness","build","ring"]}
