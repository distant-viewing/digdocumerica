{"path":"547121.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a natural outdoor scene, featuring a large corrugated drainage pipe positioned partially submerged in a stream. The scene is likely taken in a wooded area, evident from the presence of fallen leaves and natural debris surrounding the water. Sunlight is reflecting off the rippling water surface, creating a sparkling effect on the stream, which suggests the picture is taken on a sunny day. The background is dark and shadowed, possibly due to the dense foliage overhead, which partially obscures direct sunlight. The pipe appears aged and weather-worn, implying it has been in place for some time. This image can evoke themes of human intervention in natural environments and the interaction between man-made structures and ecosystems. Overall, the composition underlines contrasts between the manufactured object and the natural setting.","title":"Sparkling brook passes from culverts on its way to Bass Lake.","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["552134","543170","553467","543759","555550","552022","552254","552062","551424","544674","552023","543670","546922","552069","550715","549064"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["stream","pipe","drainage","overhead","intervention","sunlight","ecosystem","picture","place","leave"]}
