{"path":"549143.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a young boy, dressed in a cowboy hat and a yellow long-sleeve shirt, seated in a vibrant red toy car made to resemble a classic automobile. The toy car, which reads \"Ban Strip Mining\" along the side, features details like a \"SHERIFF\" sign and the phrase \"Ball Bearing Drive.\" The boy is engrossed in playing with a small white object in his hand, potentially a toy or gadget, as he sits comfortably in the spacious interior of the car. \n\nThe backdrop features an outdoors setting with greenish-brown grass and taller weeds or crops visible in hints at the edges, suggesting that this scene takes place in a grassy field. There's a clear and bright sky visible behind, which indicates it’s a sunny day, enhancing the vividness of the colors captured in the image.\n\nThe use of natural lighting brings out the depth of colors from the boy’s yellow shirt to the red of the toy car, and the texture of the grass and weeds in the background. The overall effect is one of a peaceful, leisurely day outdoors, highlighting a moment of playful innocence.","title":"Young Rial Redding, third generation of Reddings who have ranched in Sarpy Basin, joins the resistance movement.
