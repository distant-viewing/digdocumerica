{"path":"543776.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph vividly captures a scene of rural life, specifically centered around cattle herding. In the image, a rider, dressed in traditional cowboy attire which includes a wide-brimmed hat and a dark shirt, is mounted on a brown horse. The cowboy sits relaxed, observing the herd, with the horse's stance equally calm and collected. \n\nThe scene takes place in a setting that hints at a rugged, natural landscape, likely at dusk given the subdued, purple-hued light that enshrouds the area. The background is somewhat dusky and shadowed, adding a layer of mystery and a timeless quality to the image.\n\nIn the foreground and midground, numerous cattle are scattered across the terrain. The cattle are predominantly white or light-colored, and they appear to be moving leisurely or grazing on sparse vegetation. The terrain is rocky and uneven, with small bushes and scrubs dotting the landscape, characteristic of a semi-arid or desert locale.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of serene coexistence between the cowboy and the natural environment, highlighting the bond and understanding between the herder and the herd. The photograph evokes themes of solitude, tradition, and a close connection to the land.","title":"Cattle drive on ranch","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553814","552565","548830","543634","549033","548828","553104","548838","553118","548829","543787","554128","548878","553105","552677","543779"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["cattle","cowboy","herd","horse","bond","dott","scrub","tradition","rider","graze"]}
