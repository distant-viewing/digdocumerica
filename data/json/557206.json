{"path":"557206.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph shows a group of people walking through a natural, rural setting, likely involved in an outdoor activity such as hunting or hiking. The scene takes place in a thick, brush-filled area, with leafless trees and tall, dry grass dominating the landscape. The setting has an autumn or winter feel given the apparent lack of leaves on trees and the bundled-up clothing of the individuals.\n\nThe group consists of several people, with some of them visible only partially. They are dressed in various outdoor, cold-weather garments suggesting they are prepared for activities in a colder environment. Notable attire includes a jacket with a camouflage pattern, warm hats, and some are carrying items that may be used for hunting such as rifles or other equipment.\n\nIn terms of composition, the photo is focused towards the center where we can see more details of the individuals and their attire. The background and foreground both feature blurred vegetation, giving a sense of depth and highlighting the central figures. It's a candid shot capturing a moment of activity and interaction between the people and the natural setting around them. The light is diffused, providing a soft visibility that complements the tranquility of the outdoor setting.","title":"Members of the National Audubon Society walk through the brush at the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary at GRand Island, Nebraska. They are planning to view some of the 250,000 lesser sandhill cranes that stop here on their migratory route from the Gulf of Mexico on their way to the Yukon Territory and Siberia. The birds are attracted by the Platte River, which has a shallow and marshy habitat. The area is threatened by a possible project to dredge and dam the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["557207","557005","554662","554663","545512","543234","554672","554667","551764","554665","557007","552407","557985","543233","544739","556992"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["rifle","hunting","bundle","camouflage","garment","brush","people","hiking","group","term"]}
