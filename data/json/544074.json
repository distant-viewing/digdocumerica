{"path":"544074.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and atmospheric scene featuring a vast dust storm (haboob) approaching an urban area. The stormâ€™s immense wall of dust is colored a rich orange-brown, indicating it is likely late in the day, possibly amplified by the lighting at sunset.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a suburban landscape with multiple residential houses, characterized by low-rise structures and some with flat roofs typical of arid climate areas. There are several trees scattered throughout the residential area, and utility poles and power lines prominently crisscross the view, adding to the urban infrastructure feel of the scene.\n\nThe middle ground shows more dense urban development with larger buildings, including what appear to be mid-rise office structures or apartments. Their windows and facades are lit by the ambient light, suggesting activity and life despite the impending natural phenomenon.\n\nThe background is dominated by the massive dust cloud that dwarfs the urban area beneath it. The cloud is dense and tall, casting a shadow over portions of the city it approaches. Beyond the dust storm, faint mountain outlines can be glimpsed, adding a sense of scale and geography to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and contrast between the serene cityscape and the menacing natural event elicit a striking visual narrative, emphasizing the power and unpredictability of natural events against human settlement.","title":"Dust storm rises above Phoenix on labor day, 1972.
