{"path":"554852.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This is a retro-style photograph depicting a relaxed and cheerful scene on a sunny day. Three young adults are seated in front of a store, showcasing fashion and style reminiscent of the 1970s.\n\nOn the left, a young man leans against a wooden post, wearing a light pink sweater over a collared shirt, with dark blue jeans. He has light brown hair and a joyful smile, looking directly at the camera. Next to him, sitting on a rustic wooden bench, is a young woman dressed in a white blouse with embroidered floral patterns and a red and white gingham skirt. She has brunette hair and a playful yet slightly perturbed expression.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another young man with blonde hair and a wide, genuine smile is also seated on the bench. He's wearing a denim jacket and jeans, embodying a classic double denim look. \n\nIn the background, part of another individual can be seen seated further to the left, somewhat obscured and looking away from the camera. The setting is a small shop lined with brick walls; a large store window displays various posters and stickers, including a noticeable peace symbol.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of camaraderie and youthful exuberance, set against a backdrop that gives hints to the culture of the time, such as a focus on peace and music. The ambient lighting and composition give the image a warm, inviting feel.","title":"Miss junior Texas shown with friends in Leakey, Texas, her home town, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["553151","549909","554178","555906","553183","554872","551433","551820","551124","553122","553166","553171","551028","551460","553169","553185"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["peace","denim","bench","store","hair","seat","smile","jean","embody","sticker"]}
