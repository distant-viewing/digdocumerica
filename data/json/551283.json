{"path":"551283.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene at what appears to be a waterside location, possibly a dock or a similar waterfront structure. The image is focused on three individuals, likely engaged in observing or feeding fish, as suggested by the “FEED FISH 5¢” sign on a coin-operated dispenser.\n\nThe person on the left, a young woman with short dark hair, is leaning forward, peering into the water, and possibly interacting with something in it, holding an object that could be a feeding stick or small net. She wears a plain, dark-colored T-shirt and colorful patterned shorts, offering a casual, summertime appearance.\n\nNext to her stands another young woman, also casually dressed and wearing sunglasses. She is looking down towards the water, covering her mouth with her hand, possibly expressing surprise or excitement at the activity below. Her denim shorts and multicolored, horizontally striped tank top complement her relaxed, outdoor attire.\n\nTo the right, slightly set back, stands a third individual who is only partially visible in the image. This person also seems to be observing the water or the actions of the others.\n\nAround these individuals are features typical of a dockside setting: a black railing provides safety and a boundary between the observers and the water. The surface they stand on is wooden, typical of piers or docks, weathered yet functional for waterside activities. \n\nThere’s also a dynamic element visible in the water, possibly caused by fish coming to the surface to feed, indicated by disturbances and ripples in the water's otherwise dark, reflective surface.\n\nHence, this image offers a glimpse into a simple, leisurely activity, where individuals engage with nature at a waterside setting, enhanced by spontaneous expressions and casual attire indicative of a warm, enjoyable day outdoors.","title":"Children feeding the carp at \"The Clown\", a floating restaurant at Osage Beach","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["548523","543164","549935","544274","544209","548190","550850","551393","550838","546800","548737","554517","542564","547089","546811","554008"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["feed","fish","individual","dispenser","short","water","dock","express","summertime","observer"]}
