{"path":"542507.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene characterized by a sharp contrast between technology and environmental disarray. In the foreground, an accumulation of discarded items, primarily industrial barrels and cardboard boxes, creates a chaotic and cluttered image. The barrels and boxes, showing signs of wear and exposure, vary in colorâ€”from standard metallic finishes to red, green, and white. The inscriptions on some barrels are industrial in nature, hinting at the contents they once held or their origins.\n\nBeyond this immediate mess, the middle ground hosts an old biplane runway. A vintage biplane with yellow wings and fuselage, marked by an identifiable circular engine and exposed framework typical of early aviation design, taxis on a dirt path. This juxtaposition of old aviation machinery against the backdrop of waste underscores a theme of neglect or obsolescence.\n\nThe background of the image, subtly blurred, features a rural setting with fences, sparse trees, and a few low buildings, possibly farm structures. The environment suggests a vast and open space, typical of a rural or semi-rural airstrip area. The clear sky above hints at a dry, sunny day, enhancing the visibility of the scene's details. The overall composition of the photograph, from cluttered degradation in the front to historical aviation in the middle and tranquil rural life in the back, presents a layered narrative about progress, neglect, and the passage of time in a technological age.","title":"Discarded pesticide cans","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["547966","556324","549307","552102","542494","543806","543165","556640","542585","543762","557283","552043","555521","554211","547470","553433"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["aviation","barrels","biplane","box","clutter","obsolescence","neglect","runway","taxis","chaotic"]}
