{"path":"557743.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This image captures a serene outdoor scene at a shallow river. The riverbed is visible and comprises mostly rocks and pebbles, with a relatively narrow stream of water flowing through it. Several people can be seen engaging in various activities around the water. Some appear to be wading or sitting in the river, possibly enjoying the cool water during what looks like a warm day. \n\nOn the banks, the dense foliage consists of a mix of trees and bushes, suggesting a natural, possibly secluded setting. To the right side of the image, a camper vehicle is parked on the far side of the bank under the trees, hinting at recreational or camping activity in the area. \n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of leisure and outdoor recreation, with people immersing themselves in the natural environment, possibly during a camping trip or a day out in nature. The image evokes a tranquil and picturesque setting, ideal for relaxation and escape from more urban settings.","title":"Campers are seen along the Chattahoochee River from Georgia Highway 17/75 on the southern edge of Robertstown.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553439","549030","557740","543692","551348","546171","551538","555376","542558","551499","549450","542523","548868","557736","545293","550839"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["camping","bank","camper","riverbed","pebble","trip","recreation","river","relaxation","stream"]}
