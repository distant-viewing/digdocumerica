{"path":"545246.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid suburban scene featuring children and a single adult under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a dark-haired woman is communicating with a young girl, both wearing tops and pants, in front of a small house. The house, likely made of wood, is painted dark blue and adorned white-trimmed windows with a small porch topped with a white railing.\n\nTo the right of the house, occupying the center of the photo, three boys are engaged in various activities. One stands watching something intently to the left, wearing a green shirt and darker colored pants. Another boy, in a striped shirt and jeans, rides a bicycle, and another is on a toy vehicle, enjoying outdoor play.\n\nOminously dominating the background is a tall industrial smokestack emitting a dense plume of blue smoke, contrasting sharply against the sky. This element adds a layer of complexity to the scene, juxtaposing youthful play and residential calm against industrial activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph draws a stark juxtaposition between the warmth of a sunny day filled with childhood play and the looming industrial element, suggesting themes of environment, community, and perhaps concerns about pollution and its proximity to residential areas.","title":"Children play in yard of Ruston home, while Tacoma smelter stack showers area with arsenic and lead residue.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545242","546039","551075","546043","556584","545404","551074","545398","557300","551152","551072","557213","551145","545388","551151","551146"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["play","house","boy","toy","pant","childhood","bicycle","warmth","concern","calm"]}
