{"path":"551248.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a man at a landfill, actively throwing a wooden board. The man is dressed in light-colored trousers and a short-sleeved shirt, capturing a moment of physical exertion as he hurls the board using both hands. His posture and facial expression suggest a combination of concentration and effort. \n\nThe background is densely filled with various types of discarded items, creating a chaotic and cluttered scene typical of a dump site. Visible trash includes crushed cans, plastic bottles, cardboard pieces, and other unidentifiable waste. Additionally, there are larger disposed items like furniture evident in the composition.\n\nThe environment has a dark, muted color palette, contrasting sharply with the brighter sky visible above the horizon in the background, which suggests it might be either dawn or dusk. This lends the image a somber or gritty feel, emphasizing the unglamorous but essential nature of waste management and disposal.","title":"Tourist adds to litter in dump beside Lake Road (5-27) near Purvis.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["542550","542549","547983","546761","543824","549936","554541","548210","549949","546238","549945","549750","545299","543828","545600","546257"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["board","waste","exertion","item","dump","landfill","cardboard","disposal","furniture","can"]}
