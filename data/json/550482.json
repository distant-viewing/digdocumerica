{"path":"550482.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a rugged landscape under overcast skies. The foreground prominently features an extensive rocky terrain, leading up the slope of a mountain. The rocks vary in size and are interspersed with patches of moss or small plants adding a subtle touch of greenery to the otherwise gray and black stones.\n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a gently sloping valley that stretches towards a distant mountain range visible along the horizon. The mountains appear sharp and jagged, suggesting their geological youth and erosion resistance. Between the viewer and the mountains, there appear to be some flat areas that might be small lakes or ponds, reflecting a dull light which provides a contrast to the overall dark terrain.\n\nThe sky occupies the upper third of the photo, filled with dense, layered clouds that contribute to the somber ambiance of the scene. The lighting is subdued and moody, with no shadows, indicating an overcast day where the cloud cover diffuses sunlight evenly across the landscape.\n\nThis setting might be typical of cold, barren highland regions or volcanic areas, characterized by minimal vegetation and a stark, natural beauty.","title":"Rubble debris (talus) at the foot of peak 5308 looking west toward galbraith lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["546385","544874","550628","550409","550588","550477","550491","550408","550610","544116","543635","550645","555087","543831","550502","545647"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","lakes","youth","ponds","third","cloud","rocky","jag","moss","terrain"]}
