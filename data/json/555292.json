{"path":"555292.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph showcases a close-up view of a solar water heating panel, characterized by multiple parallel tubes through which water presumably flows to be heated by solar energy. The panel is inclined at an angle, optimized for capturing sunlight. The tubes are encased within a flat, rectangular frame which is partially visible around the edges; the frame is painted white, highlighting the contrast with the dark glossy tubes.\n\nThe tubes themselves have a noticeable reflective surface where sunlight gleams intensely, indicating the photo was taken on a sunny day. There is a slight hint of moisture or condensation on the tubes, reflecting the interaction of the water inside with the outer environment, which is used to transfer heat effectively.\n\nIn the background, beyond the upper edge of the panel, a clear blue sky is dominant, suggesting a bright, cloudless day which is ideal for solar heating systems. There are no other objects or people visible in this frame, drawing all focus to the technology depicted. The composition emphasizes the functionality and environmental setting of the solar heating panel, possibly situated on a rooftop or an open space designed for maximum sunlight exposure.","title":"Experimental solar heating panel of the \"thomason\" type at New Mexico state university, Las Cruces.
