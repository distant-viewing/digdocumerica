{"path":"554193.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a casual, homely scene inside a rustic wooden room. A woman is seated comfortably in a wicker armchair, with her legs crossed and one bare foot tucked beneath the other. She wears blue jeans and a plaid flannel shirt, conveying a relaxed, casual appearance. Her expression is pleasant and she appears to be engaging with someone off-camera or simply enjoying a moment of quiet.\n\nA yellow Labrador dog lies on the worn wooden floor in front of her, appearing relaxed and possibly asleep. The room itself has a cozy, lived-in feel with wood-paneled walls that show signs of age and wear. To the left of the woman, a small wooden bookshelf is crammed with books, suggesting a love for reading or the comfort of intellectual pursuits.\n\nOn the wall behind the woman hangs a large poster with a colorful, floral design, and another small piece of paper or photograph is tacked beside it. Additional touches that add character to the scene include a decorative patterned throw draped over a nearby piece of furniture, and a pair of boots with ornate stitching, sitting to the left of her chair.\n\nA cardboard box on the right edge of the image hints at ongoing activities, possibly moving or storage, contributing to the feel of a space that is lived-in and dynamically used. There's a rustic charm in the setting, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.","title":"Ann schindler of grygla at home with her dog manhasset","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["552114","546990","552611","556413","548459","546479","553535","556576","545525","556482","543041","553098","558337","548440","553546","555393"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["live","room","armchair","bookshelf","flannel","woman","love","pursuit","piece","throw"]}
