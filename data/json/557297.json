{"path":"557297.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph depicts a large industrial facility, likely a power plant, under a clear blue sky. Dominating the scene are several tall structures, including multiple smokestacks, from one of which thick white smoke is billowing into the air. The building appears to be relatively large and is constructed with sections that include both flat and angled roofs.\n\nIn the foreground, a chain-link fence encloses the facility, suggesting restricted access. There's a sign on the fence that reads \"$32 MILLION ENVIRONMENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM,\" indicating some form of environmental investment or initiative associated with the plant.\n\nSeveral power lines, both in the foreground and background, crisscross the image, emphasizing the industrial theme. Additionally, electrical substations and towers are visible, underscoring the plant's function in power generation or distribution.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its industrial elements and environmental context, speaks to themes of energy production, environmental impact, and industrial infrastructure.","title":"Smoke from stacks at the phillips power station owned by the Duquesne light company and located on the Ohio river northwest of Pittsburgh.  The sign in the foreground notes a $42 million environment improvement project to install wet scrubbers to minimize emissions.
