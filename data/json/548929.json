{"path":"548929.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image captures a vibrant and busy beach scene viewed from an aerial perspective. The photograph shows a broad stretch of sandy beach along the shore of a large body of blue water. The beach is densely packed with a variety of elements. Most prominently, numerous vehicles are parked on the beach itself, arranged in several rows that extend back from the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nArranged between and around the vehicles, small groups of people can be seen. The individuals are scattered across the beach, with some near the water and others closer to their vehicles, appearing to engage in typical beach activities such as sunbathing, swimming, and socializing.\n\nAdditionally, there are several boats, both in the water and pulled up onto the sandy shore. The sea adjacent to the beach has a tranquil appearance with a deeper blue color, contrasting with the lighter blue of the shallower water near the shore, hinting at a gentle gradient into deeper water.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the edge of the water curving slightly and the orderly array of colorful beach elements, creates a dynamic and lively summer scene, showcasing a popular leisure destination bustling with activity.","title":"Enjoying lake mead.
