{"path":"549222.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures a rural scene with a wide-open landscape dominated by sprawling green fields and rolling hills in the background. The sky is partly cloudy with patches of blue visible, suggesting a calm, temperate day.\n\nIn the middle ground of the photograph, there's a small farming community or a cluster of farm buildings. These buildings include a barn, some smaller structures, and possibly residences. Near the center, there is a road or dirt path leading toward the farm buildings. This indicates a slight hub of activity or connectivity within the otherwise open landscape.\n\nOn the left side, there is an area with utility poles, hinting at the presence of electricity and adding a minor industrial touch to the rural setting. The fields around the farm buildings show variations in vegetation, with areas of darker and lighter green, suggesting different types of crops or land use.\n\nThere are no visible people or moving vehicles, which contributes to the sense of tranquility and isolation often found in rural landscapes. The entire scene conveys a peaceful, pastoral vibe, typical of agricultural regions.","title":"Ranch in the Powder River Basin","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554819","549256","557087","547291","555635","549257","544481","557748","545040","557946","549235","551304","549261","555603","554767","549236"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","residence","electricity","connectivity","field","building","sprawl","hub","barn","variation"]}
