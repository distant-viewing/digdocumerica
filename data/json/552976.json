{"path":"552976.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment of outdoor activity alongside a river, set within a densely forested area. Two individuals are engaging in distinct pursuits along the rocky riverbank. To the left, a man is shown in mid-motion, actively engaged in fly fishing. He is wearing a white t-shirt and shorts, and his fishing line is elegantly cast over the water, creating a smooth, curved line against the backdrop. His posture and concentration suggest a tactical approach to his fishing.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another person, who appears to be a child, is bending over near the waterâ€™s edge. The child, dressed in a light-colored shirt, is seemingly exploring the river, possibly collecting stones or examining the water.\n\nThe river itself is shimmering with sunlight, and its surface sparkles amidst patches of shadow and light. The atmosphere is tranquil and appears quite secluded, surrounded by tall, dense pine trees that fill the background, enhancing the sense of isolation and immersion in nature.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes a connection with nature and a peaceful coexistence within it, suggesting themes of exploration and activity in the wilderness.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
