{"path":"544692.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph displays a striking and somewhat unusual scene centered around a vividly red body of water. Dominating the foreground is a patch of rugged, white-crusted terrain that appears to be salt deposits, which are crackling and forming intricate patterns on the water's surface. Partially submerged in this red water is what looks like a large, rusted piece of metal debris, possibly part of a ship or industrial equipment, hinting at pollution or abandonment.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is lined with industrial structures, including cranes and other machinery, which suggest this area might be near a port or industrial complex. The sky is clear and the weather appears calm, casting a soft light on the scene which enhances the surreal contrast between the natural and industrial elements.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of environmental impact, highlighting the interaction between human activities and natural landscapes. The vivid red color of the water could be due to the presence of chemicals or microorganisms, commonly seen in areas affected by industrial waste or natural saline conditions.","title":"\"Water stinks,\" writes the photographer about this scene.","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["544686","544685","544804","555846","544042","544675","552219","543815","555382","545014","546125","544803","544702","551077","546110","544527"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["salt","deposit","affect","port","water","chemical","ship","submerge","abandonment","complex"]}
