{"path":"550462.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a delicate, purple-pink flower blooming on a slender, upright stem. The flower is composed of multiple small buds clustered tightly together, each bud gently swelling at its base with softer, rounded tips. The stem appears to be sturdy, bearing narrow, elongated leaves that protrude mostly out of focus from the lower portion of the frame.\n\nThe backdrop is a blurred tapestry of natural hues, predominantly shades of soft browns and muted greens, contributing to a serene, almost painterly effect that isolates and highlights the flower as the focal point of the composition. Thin grass-like strands, possibly from surrounding vegetation, intersect the frame, adding texture and a sense of depth to the scene. The lighting is subtle, suggesting either an overcast sky or a shaded environment, enhancing the soft and tranquil atmosphere of the image.","title":"Bloodwort, a common wildflower along the pipeline route","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547613","555034","553366","555035","553588","545707","551368","554595","545695","557500","554576","553368","554843","543597","555036","553361"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["bud","stem","flower","strand","tip","tapestry","base","frame","portion","brown"]}
