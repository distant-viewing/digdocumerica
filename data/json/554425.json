{"path":"554425.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dense forest scene. The image is filled with numerous trees that vary somewhat in size but generally seem to be mid-sized to large, with straight trunks and moderate leaf-bearing branches that are primarily located toward the upper third of the frame. The forest floor is thickly covered with lush green vegetation, including low-lying shrubs, ferns, and a carpet of smaller plants. Throughout, the greenery is bright and vibrant, indicating that the photo was likely taken in late spring or summer.\n\nLight filters through the leaves, creating dappled patterns of light and shadow across the scene, enhancing the texture and depth of the forest. The trees appear healthy and largely straight, suggesting a relatively undisturbed forest environment. There are no visible paths or clearings that suggest human interaction; the forest looks wild and untamed.\n\nIn composition, the photograph is rich in shades of green enhanced by natural lighting, with the vertical lines of the trees adding a sense of height and the dense undergrowth giving an impression of fullness. The overall feel is peaceful and secluded, typical of a woodland area that has been left to grow and thrive naturally. There are no people, animals, or man-made structures visible in the shot, emphasizing the untouched beauty of nature in this particular location.","title":"Recently logged hardwood forest on litchfield paper company land near Tupper Lake.
