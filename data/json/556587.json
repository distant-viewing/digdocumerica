{"path":"556587.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric landscape at dusk or dawn. It features multiple layers of hills, each progressively fading into a more muted tone due to the mist or fog. The hills create a rhythmic pattern of undulating silhouettes, adding depth to the scene. The overall color palette consists of deep purples and blues with a hint of warm pink towards the top, suggesting early morning or late evening light.\n\nThere is a distinct layer of fog settled in the valleys between the hills, contributing to a tranquil and somewhat mystical ambiance. The sky, while mostly subtle, plays a significant role in setting the mood with its gentle gradient of colors. The upper part of the image is slightly lighter, possibly a glimpse of the sky clearing as the sun rises or sets.\n\nOn the right edge of the photo, some plant silhouettes are visible, indicating that the vantage point might be from another hill or a high viewpoint, adding a natural frame to the composition. This landscape is devoid of any human elements, reinforcing a sense of pristine nature and quietude. The focus and simplicity of elements contribute to a peaceful visual experience, underlining the beauty and vastness of natural terrains.","title":"Sunrise over Black Mountain which separates Virginia and Kentucky, near Kingsport, Tennessee.
