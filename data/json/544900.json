{"path":"544900.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a snake navigating through a shallow body of water, likely a stream or pond, characterized by clear, rippling water and muddy banks. The snake, which appears to be of a moderate size, has distinct, smooth scales and a pattern that could be indicative of a non-venomous species. Its body meanders over and around small rocks protruding from the sandy, wet soil.\n\nThe foreground features clear water wherein the ripples reflect light, indicating the presence of subtle water movement. Surrounding the snake are patches of wet, golden-brown sand, giving a textural contrast against the glistening water and the rocks, which are earthy in color and irregular in shape. The overall tones of the scene are natural and earthy, with sunlight enhancing the textures and creating a serene naturalistic setting. This detailed interplay of water, sand, and rock, along with the presence of the snake, conveys a moment of quiet wildlife activity, typical of a freshwater ecosystem.","title":"Garter snake in Harris Wash","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["551374","551375","544908","543286","549459","544904","555065","544528","546171","555077","557251","545561","546875","550341","550219","544765"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snake","rock","sand","ripple","water","glisten","protrude","specie","meander","pond"]}
