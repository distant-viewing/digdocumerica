{"path":"549509.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This aerial photograph features a scene centered around a marina and a large, ornate riverboat moored at a dock. The riverboat has a distinctive, vintage design with multiple decks and a classic paddle wheel visible at the stern, similar to those used on Mississippi riverboats. It's painted in white and appears to be a focal point of this waterfront area.\n\nSurrounding the riverboat are neatly arranged rows of smaller boats, each docked within individual berths in the marina. The water glistens, likely due to sunlight reflecting off its surface, enhancing the visual appeal of the scene.\n\nAdjacent to the riverboat on the left side of the image is a spacious paved area dotted with several cars parked in an informal arrangement. This parking area includes some vacant patches of ground and light poles, suggesting it might be a public or semi-public space.\n\nThe background beyond the immediate vicinity of the riverboat and marina fades into a blur, focusing attention on the waterfront and the boats. The overall scene conveys a leisurely, recreational setting, likely dedicated to boating activities and possibly serving as a tourist attraction given the prominence and style of the riverboat.","title":"Niagara River marina on the Buffalo waterfront","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["543972","557450","543962","548078","552028","548969","543954","548179","545917","546853","542912","548075","543963","551147","548639","543971"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["riverboat","marina","waterfront","paddle","attraction","prominence","boat","blur","appeal","tourist"]}
